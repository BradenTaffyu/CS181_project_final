2023 best rts game ever made there are many reasons why this game still holds up very well 24 years after its first release i don t have many hours on record here as i mainly used to play with the disks back then this definitive edition is all i could dream about age of empires ii looks great all the while keeping the og style that made me fall in love with the franchise in the first place content wise i m glad the developers keep adding more content to this wonderful game highly recommended
