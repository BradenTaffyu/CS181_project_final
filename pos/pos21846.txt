2021 short version pros world building and lore are amazing areas are interconnected exploration is rewarded very challenging but never cheap stellar art direction plenty of secrets great boss battles epic soundtrack outstanding amount of content dlc replayabilitycons still unwelcoming to a lot of people story lore gameplay ranged weapons are still not viable interconnectivity is not as complex as before long version dark souls iii is an rpg developed by fromsoftware inc and published by bandai namco entertainment it is the final title in the dark souls trilogy you play as the ashen one and your objective is to defeat all five lords of cinder and bring them back to firelink shrine to ignite the flame again the story may seem superficial at first but just like in the first game there is a lot of lore behind characters items and locations the game does not really ease the player into its world you will have to rely on reading item descriptions and watching a few videos to get a general idea of what is going on even though it may not be for everyone the story is engaging enough to keep you interested while i thought the final areas in dark souls 1 were rather uninspired i feel like all areas in this third installment are good you do not get anything as frustrating as blighttown or as cheap as the archers in anor londo s rooftops you certainly get nods to said areas but they are not as unfair areas are also interconnected just like in the first game but this time i think this interconnectivity is less special in dark souls 1 you would explore for a rather long time and finally getting to kick down a ladder to access a bonfire after 30 40 minutes was a huge victory i remember being completely lost and suddenly opening a gate only to figure out my starting point was just on the other side i found shortcuts to be too plentiful and easy to get in this one it is not necessarily bad per se but managing to find shortcuts on my first try after 10 minutes or less felt a tad strange dark souls iii a screenshot of dark souls iii by good guy nick with that out of the way let us talk gameplay it is very satisfying the controls are responsive and you feel in control during exploration and combat exploration is simple as it does not require tricky jumps or timed actions you can still jump just like in the first game but it was clunky back then and it is clunky now you get rewards for looking for hidden entrances with better gear and consumables combat is great there is a lot of variety to it you can use a plethora of weapons armor to dispatch enemies and depending on your build you will be able to adopt different playstyles you can be slow but powerful nimble but squishy a bit of both the choices are endless you can also be a spellcaster but i still find it rather janky i feel like the game does a poor job explaining how it works i decided to go for a high stamina katana build with a bow on the side just like in the first game the bow is completely useless i get it you want your players to engage in melee combat i understand why some players find ranged weapons lame but come on i want to feel like a king and fill a boss full of arrows while i dodge like a madman but i cannot do that in dark souls 3 your bows are absurdly slow and rather weak you can cheese some enemies bosses with it but it is not rewarding at all i feel like it would take a whole lot of work to integrate ranged weapons into the game and the devs would rather keep the options really underwhelming to avoid making the game too easy dark souls 3 also seems to be a lot more forgiving when it comes to damage and healing items i managed to trade hits fairly often even while wearing light armor that is something that would be impossible in the first game trading hits was a fast way to die estus flasks healing items also seemed a bit too good i never really struggled while exploring because of how plentiful they were it might have been because i used them all for hp if you play as a magic user you will have to divide them between hp and mana so i guess that would counterbalance its effectiveness but still combat is a lot of fun if you pick anything besides bows i will be attempting to use magic for my next playthrough where i plan to get the rest of the achievements i reckon it will be a lot of fun and completely different from my ninja build dark souls iii a screenshot of dark souls iii by good guy nick graphically i feel like dark souls 3 s art direction does most of the work the actual graphics are fine but nothing special the characters and world design are amazing the environments feel vibrant and lived in enemy and boss designs are really interesting with one or two exceptions that feel too safe the soundtrack is stellar each track feels meticulously crafted boss fights are elevated to such a level of epicness that i could recommend the game on the soundtrack alone sound effects are satisfying hits feel heavy and crunchy because of how good the sound is there is still a bit of janky associated to the game if you plan on playing it with mouse and keyboard as i did but it is nothing too inconvenient the game also has some multiplayer elements to it which i avoided for the most part but ended up trying after beating the game the first time it is fun i ended up trying some dlc bosses with other players and it felt great the limited communication actually improved the experience invaders can be a bit annoying but i feel like you get invaded just the right amount to keep you on your toes you can actively invade other players too which i tried once but i just sat around and drank booze with the enemy no need to kill someone and ruin their day p dark souls iii a screenshot of dark souls iii by good guy nick i had quite a bit of fun with the dlcs i review ashes of ariandel here i review the ringed city here all in all i have thoroughly enjoyed my experience with dark souls 3 while its exploration feels bland in comparison to the first game of the series and some annoyances persist every other aspect has been updated the combat feels fair and satisfying the world is captivating the bosses are epic and you will be getting a lot of bang for your buck i still feel like dark souls 1 is a better game with a terrible port but i had more fun with this one overall an easy recommendation final score 9 out of 10 if you enjoyed this review please consider joining my group and following my curator page on steam controversial opinion my favorite boss of the base game is deacons of the deep loved walking into a group of creepy looking religious figures and the music is great
