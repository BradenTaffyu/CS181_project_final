2021 this game is a masterpiece which left me emotionally broken even though i am a 28 year old man i have to admit this one managed to make me cry a lot i thought games like final fantasy xv messed me up but this it s pure emotion infused with the darkest depression you could possibly think of it s guaranteed to make you question the meaning of life or if anything means anything at all you have to play this i m sorry i can t be more descriptive but just thinking of the scene with 2b and 9s in the roller coaster makes my eyes water those onion cutting ninjas my only regret is that i did not play through this game sooner but perhaps i wasn t quite ready for it truth be told i don t think i will ever be o7 glory to mankind
