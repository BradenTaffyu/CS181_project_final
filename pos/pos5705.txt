2020 early access review this game is amazing the first time i played warband i couldn t believe my eyes that i found a game that met every desire i had while playing a game campaign map is like heroes of might and magic battlefield like total war while i command my troops while fighting beside them economy family etc the problem is that it is still an early acces and it has alot of bugs i use mods to make the game better otherwise i would have quit a long time ago it has alot of bugs and alot of things that don t make sense and these are the following the campaign main quest running arround in the begining to find 10 heroes that know of the battle of pendraic is the most annoing thing ever family it is not finished and i hate that i can t marry off the members of my family and when i get married i get an offer for marriage for me and my brother seriosuly marry me and my brother leadership as a lord or as a king why do i need to make small errand or search for other characters why can t i have messengers to set a meeting or something like that searching for characters that are always moving is really boring fighting system yes it is smoother than warband but it lacks the impact the satisfaction when you hit an enemy it looks like a bunch of girls are fighting with sticks titles there are no titles no kings no sheikh no khan etc everyone is on a first name basis parties there are literally no party options like follow me or patrol etc and when one of my clan parties is defeated i need to manually recreate the party every time really annoing diplomacy diplomacy is one of the most boring things in the game no allianes no pacts no nothing recruiting lords in warband it was great that lords would come to you to serve you as long as you would have good relations with them and a good reputation in bannerlord you have to run arround the map searching for the leader of the clan just for him to refuse you or worse accept and demand an outrageos sum of money in order to join mods every time they make an update all the mods crash you need to wait for the mod authors to update their mods and post them can t we do something about this these are my main complaints about the game but i solved this by using mods and i hope that taleworlds will implement things like these in the future and make some real improvements because most of the time i see bug fixes and not really a gameplay improvement
