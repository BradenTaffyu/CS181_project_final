2020 sourcerers divinity original sin ii takes place in a world in chaos world called rivellon is a place forgotten by gods a place where every nation and every race seems to fight one another and even within for power for land for their own truths but none of it is so serious as the recent events where monsters from another realm are invading rivellon the voidwoken unlike in the first installment of divinity original sin where you directly embank on the side of member of so called source hunter smth like inquision in the second one you play as the other side of this eternal battle as sourcerers persons able to control the source the source is a powerful magic which is by common folk attributed to bringing all evil to the world this change is amazing from the decision making perspective because now you have much wider options in how to play the game you can be hero you can be villain and even the outcome of your actions considers your approach this and the fact that your choices have real consequences not only for you but also for the world around you and people living in it this makes you consider what happens if you do what you intend to do and also makes you revise your actions and that all in my opinion really contributes to the role playing aspect of the gameplay which is remarkable as i pointed out above as rpg divinity original sin ii is one of the best out there story is interesting your role in it is vital characters are well written and also quests are not dull but have depth and your actions matter on the other hand the game is not for everyone and in any case it is not for anyone hot headed divinity original sin ii relies on your tactic skills turn based combat ability to cope with lots of information quests and even on low setting the game still is pretty overwhelming and requires a lot of attention from your side nevertheless if you like to think overcome obstacles and solve puzzles these are other reasons why to play so go for it summary pros unique characters with unique stories and conversation options abilities and talents improved system traits given based on your decisions backstory and talents overall well arranged ui easy to understand intriguing storyline and overall amazing storytelling aspect of the game many side quests and secrets every inch of the game is well utilized engaging combat system co op multiplayer for 4 players with very distinguished storylines deep character customization great voice acting pleasant soundtrack choices mostly have effectcons overwhelming at first the games seems very difficult at first many things to keep an eye for especially when you play for the first time and solo experience hunt you experience very slowly and to move forward in the game you need a lot of xp so basically everything xp related is mandatory in order to be able to continue quest log is very detailed and therefore not so easy to orient in also some notes are just confusing very weird romance out of the blue companions were deeply in love with my main character and started acting very weird when talking to me so i rather stopped talking to them combat speed option is missing some fights are just way too slow 9 5 10 notwithstanding the minor negatives i mentioned above divinity original sin 2 is still astonishing and i personally think one of the best games ever published even better than its predecessor that set the bar already high enough i absolutely recommend divinity original sin 2 especially if you have someone to play with in order to overcome overwhelming beginning of the game
