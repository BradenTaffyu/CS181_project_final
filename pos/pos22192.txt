2018 dark souls 3 is a magnificent game just as all the other projects miyazaki has been a part of no dark souls game has disappointed me in the past much the opposite actually so of course my hopes were high when i first played this game long story short no matter how high my hopes were this game was able to surpass most of them dark souls 3 decides to go back to it s root story telling like in demon souls and dark souls 1 the game starts you off with a short premise a short explanation targets you need to defeat and then throws you off in the world also going back to it s roots is the magnificent level design like always the areas in dark souls are all inertwined rewarding the player for exploring around shortcuts that take you hours back making everything more accessible and forcing you to memorize the areas so seamlessly this way of universe building really enriches the gameplay experience and dark souls 3 without a doubt delivers in that regard a couple new classes have been added and some removed even bringing back the pyromancer class which i very much approve of the humanity system is a little different this time around no humanity or human effigy s but now you must use embers embers will just as the humanities grant you the ability to summon be invaded your max hp does not suffer small penalties from each death as it does in dark souls 2 but when an ember is used your max hp bar grows massively as well as healing you as it did in dark souls 1 but unlike dark souls 1 you may not consume an ember after already using one the humanity counter is long gone good in other words the embers are the junction of all the good parts about the previous instalment s humanities which i very much approve of another notable difference are a couple new stats to upgrade the most notorious luck luck does what you d expect it boosts your luck as a rusted coin would but permanently it s good for item drops the covenants this time around also work much differently than the other games and in my opinion for the better in dark souls 3 you ll find around the world insignias for covenants and you may at any given time equipt which insignia you d like each one of them of course having their own benefit or draw back regarding the type of playthrough you d like to do some insignias are very easy to find others almost impossible on your own without a walkthrough or someone telling you about their existence talking about walkthroughs dark souls 3 continues the magical tradition of completely destroying you over and over and over and over the combat system in dark souls 3 is by far my favorite out of the others it s much faster and the varietly is so much it can actually get a little overwhelming this game introduces the weapon arts each weapon in this game has a special attack which will take a little from you mana bar also this game now uses a mana bar which can be restored using a different type of estus you ll have to balance your estus usage depending on the type of build you re making the estus for you mana are taken from your max quantity of estus you have this max number goes up just like in dark souls 2 when finding estus shards and returning to firelink they did not go back to the kindle system of dark souls 1 so god bless the main hub in dark souls 3 is very cool it s not even close to be as good as majula but it for sure has it s charm the music is super relaxing and most of the time you just can t wait to get back and explore around the area it would always feel great going back and finding a new npc there or even some items that i didn t see before even transfer boss souls etc but in all honestly it gets a little morbid later on making it lose its relaxation feel depending on how you play the game of course oh and speaking of boss souls unlike the other instalments you may now transfer boss souls into weapons shields spells miracles and rings from one of the lords of cinder that stays in the main hub which is a major conveniencebut that s actually the thing i don t like about this game it stooeasyalthough very excited when i finally was able to beat the game i was also very surprised by how fast i was able to beat it i remember that the first time around playing dark souls 1 and 2 they took me around a week or two to complete just one playthrough ending up to be around 60 70 hours of gameplay i beat dark souls 3 in a couple days ending up with roughly 30 hours of gameplay all the bosses in this game on the most part looking at you wyvern are extremely well made and very relentless easily one of the best parts about it but i never felt the same feeling i would always get while playing dark souls 1 and 2 the feeling of ooooh no no not right now what the is this this is impossible usually when playing dark souls 3 you just can t wait for the next boss fight cause you just want to up and yeah that s a great feeling but the whole feeling of dread and knowing that you re not nearly as strong as you think you are and that anything can just come and you up at any moment the other games gave me really gave true meaning to those playthroughs the feeling of overcoming such difficulties in the previous games where much more orgasmic to compensate a little the enemies is this game are usually a lot more relentless then the other instalments even sometimes being a little frustrating as if their stamina was infinite all these enemies are dealed with easily if you thrive to attack them with the same aggresiveness that they have other than staying on the defensive another major issue i had with this game was bonfire placement there are literally bonfires that are less than 10 seconds apart from each other i remember finding that very stupid also a lot of fan service is made in this game the players that are more fond of the first dark souls game will most certainely be very much pleased with how the game plays areas from the first game come back familiar faces and armour many easter eggs and even weapons to add in on the weapons dark souls 3 decided to continue the dual wielding from dark souls 2 but makes it a little easier with putting both weapons for one slot there are tons of weapons like this so you can go crazy they also brought back the torch but actually made it as a weapon so instead of using the flaming butterflies and relying on that stupid time limit just equip it as a weapon and you re more than ready to go a great improvement poison also goes back to it s roots not drying your whole hp bar in miliseconds like in dark souls 2 no more life gems and they also decided to do the dark souls 2 bonfire mechanic of just lighting them up serve as a checkpoint instead of having to rest at one like in dark souls 1 which i appreciate to end it up dark souls 3 is an amazing game lovers of the previous games will adore the adventure 100 guaranteed newcomers to the series this game will for sure be a great starting point for its the easiest most beautiful less cryptic of the 3 and i love it 9 10lol jk theres no poise0 10
