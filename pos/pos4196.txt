2022 so i wasn t really into card games but then i played ring of pain and then inscryption and so i had to play slay the spire i think it s the original rogue like card game anyways it s a nice card game but i am not having as much fun as i was playing either inscryption best card game or ring of pain i think it s worthy of recommending though just because it s not bad and plus it s the original it s just i think the newer card games have improved the formula rate 7 5 10
