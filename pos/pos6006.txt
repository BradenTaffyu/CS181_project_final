2022 while it is cool they made this game free to play do not be fooled in order to play this game you will need origin in order to play it when i tried to click play through steam it did not let me into the game and i had to open origin to play it i mean come on ea what are you thinking are you even thinking if you put a game on steam then people should be able to play it on steam and not need to have origin just to play it this in my opinion is just bad marketing which will probably lead to alot of complaints and people just not bothering with ea games in general if they do not have origin for that reason i guess this is kind of a mixed review while i can recommend this game because of how much fun the sims games can be i would also say to stay away if you don t have origin as well
