2018 fallout new vegas is an incredible experience hidden behind a outer layer it s terrible to look at terrible to play and crashes so consistently i find myself filled with dread whenever i go more than 30 seconds without saving that being said in total i ve probably put somewhere around 1000 hours into this game over the years all that stuff i just said has never bothered me because this game is a masterpiece of storytelling i m in love with this world and it s characters obsidian was given 18 months to complete new vegas 18 months and they still managed to craft an ambitious and engaging rpg that manages to be those things in direct spite of it s many many flaws i could sing my praise of nv from the rooftops for days and still have more to say if you want a brilliant story and can tolerate a bad game please play new vegas it s my all time favourite
