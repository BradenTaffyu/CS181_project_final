2023 been wanting to get into these colony simulator type of games but the issue is that they re always so deep and intricate that they end up being very unwelcomming to newer players like me fortunately oxygen not included is not like that it is a vast game that has a lot of depth to its systems and world whilst also being welcomming to newer players very lovely game i look forwards to waste many hours in it
