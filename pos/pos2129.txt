2023 although this is a positive review i am reviewing the game itself rather than the absolute disaster that is the current server system everything that you have read in every other review about the servers is completely correct payday 3 is a solid game but it doesn t feel as inspired as payday 2 the first time i played pd3 the word that came to mind was charm as in its absence was noted when compared to pd2 to wit shade your handler is a far inferior version of bane locke maybe that shouldn t count for much in a game like pd3 i enjoyed the accompaniment of bane and locke in pd2 but i find everything that shade says to be trite and obnoxious for example the surphaze heist seems to be a protracted exercise in the tired critique of pretentious art snobs and everything that shade says would be the first thing that a person with a gun to their head would sputter if they were asked to list pretentious art snob tropes the heists themselves seem to be solid as a tasting menu but i long for heists with the nuance of firestarter framing frame golden grin or big oil the thing that drew me in to pd2 was that you could see and feel the inspiration of the developers with every new heist while we were playing rats 10 years ago many of us were also watching breaking bad as it was airing and it felt like pd2 was growing in concert with it and shows films similar to it right now pd3 feels like a game that has been refined from the experience of the last ten years rather than being one that has something new to say new characters to introduce or new depth to be explored without a doubt the game has areas that have been carefully crafted stealth is a new experience relative to pd2 but the attention to detail feels mechanical rather than the labour of love that pd2 seemed to have been all of this might make one wonder why this is a positive review i just enjoy the game the challenge of figuring out how to approach a heist is still there even though it is a massive shame that preplanning is no longer a part of the game combat is serviceable but i am mostly interest in solo stealthing as i imagine are most players and on overkill difficulty some of the stealth heists can be a bit of a handful at first again i assume that the heists that we currently have will be iterated upon and will lead to greater diversity and difficulty in the future so i choose to be optimistic starbreeze has been transparent about the server matchmaking issues though this is no excuse for how poor the release has been and they have earned a lot of goodwill for what they did with pd2 i only hope that they will once again dare to take risks with their designs because at the moment it feels like most are somewhat upgraded versions of heists that existed in pd2
