2018 early access review the good stuff this game is much more than a crash simulator this is without a doubt the best vehicle simulator of all time each individual component of the vehicle is simulated at 2000 times per second in real time creating a driving experience like no other this is unlike vehicles in any other game as they are essentially boxes on wheels whereas beamng simulates almost every single component of the car this game also recieves many updates with a new vehicle a small classic italian car a map based on italy and a new and optimised ui expected to arrive in the coming months edit car and map have been releasedalso the beamng community is great with many high quality mods made for the game and a friendly environment in the game forums on the beamng website the developers are also always in contact with the community helping us resolve issues and answer questions as this game is early access we are essentially helping improve the game for it s official release recently beamng drive has partnered up with the car creation game automation in my opinion this is the best game collaboration of all time as it allows you to make whatever you wish in automation and port it over to beamng and drive it around this allows the previously almost impossible task of modding available to almost anyone you can also upload your creations to the beamng repository for anyone to enjoy the not so good stuff the only major issue with the complexity of the game is it requires a reletively decent computer to run it properly make sure your pc at least meets the minimum requirements before purchasing the game although you want to at least meet the recomended requirements to have a more enjoyable experience you will need a decent cpu gpu and at least 8gb of ram to run this properly despite this the game is constantly being optimised to run on lower end computers there is also no multiplayer the developers are well aware of the demand however they are focussing on getting the game prepared for official release and finishing the career mode don t expect multiplayer in the near future the neutral want to make a mod good luck mod creation for beamng due to it s complexity is no easy task you will find many of the high quality mods you will use are actually created by adults who have a background with computers there is a steep learning curve although all the necessary information to make a mod is on the beamng wiki on the website and the community will help you resolve issues you may face creating a mod despite this as i outlined above you can easily make you re own vehicle in automation and port it to beamng currently automation cars to not deform as well as real mods and they don t have interiors as of when this review was published but it is a much easier and quicker way to make your dream car in beamng other things i have read the negative reviews of the game and most of the issues they adress are not actually an issue with the game many complaints are a result of their computer not meeting the minimum requirements a broken outdated mod and or having no idea how to work a computer just ignore the negative reviews and if you have an issue visit the forums and the community devs will help you find a solution to your problem summary in summary the positives definately outweigh the negatives beamng will provide you with a driving experience like no other espicially if you use a racing wheel beamng supports almost all racing wheels you will have countless hours of fun from smashing up your car until it is almost unrecognisable to driving a bus around maps and making all the stops sure there is no multiplayer but if your computer can handle it it s well worth the price you wont regret buying this game
