2014 early access review i m a little stunned at the replies of negativity 1 said that it was laggy with his top of the line comp really i m running it on an 8 gig laptop pentium 2 7 it runs more than fine without lag another griped of the blocky features and repetitive landscape am i the only one that read in aplha stage the graphics needs some heavy updating to eliminate the blocky old nintendo game look but i can t imagine that not being on the menu another wrote how the zombies always find you regardless of where you hide really me and my friend built a fortress that was completely unbreakable they haven t gotten even close to us yet it isn t a mindless shooter you need to put effort into the game scavenging foraging forging crafting hunting and even cooking honestly the only complaint i see valid is the cost it has the potential to be with massive graphics upgrade a 50 dollar game right now it shouldn t be 20 i d price it at 15 for a one pack and 25 for a 2 pack i just saw it went on sale which annoys me as i bought it like 5 days ago the 2 pack for 49 i d have saved 16 grrr had i known i d have waited and bought 3 copies but i recommend the game mostly based on potential and what i see may be in the works better graphics and driveable cars 2 thumbs up i d like it if one could hide from the zombies to but i don t see that as a huge issue there should be roaming npc groups that either want to join your compound theives and merchants though i saw that was coming the scope and potential of the game is huge and limitless it really just depends on how serious these guys are about it so far i think they are and as such i give this game a thumbs up and look forward to more game updates soon
