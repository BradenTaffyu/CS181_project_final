2022 early access review great casual card game especially for minor breaks contra 0 agency over the collection progress collection management and ui have some issues no unranked mode only way to play is pvp vs other players from rank 0 30 you face nearly no human players the game tries to hide if you are playing vs bots a few clues are bots don t emote and many humans use season locked avatars which the bots don t use neutral deck building is on the simpler sidepro super short match time 2 4 minutes no mulligan conceding is encouraged you lose less elo points if one party is losing very strategic gameplay you often you need to anticipate how the opponent will play their cards moneywise the fairest ccg i have played all non season content can be unlocked for free a full collection is very viable as 100 f2p player for a minor competitive advantage you would need to buy a season path each month for 10 bucks each so 120 bucks per year which is not even 50 of a single hearthstone expansion devs officially stated there won t be additional monetisation in the future it s easy to mix up decks by switching a couple of cards encourages experimentation it s easy to try out new builds because you don t work toward new decks locations often mess things up so you need to spontaneously come up with solutions to make the best with what you are offered
