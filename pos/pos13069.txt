2021 i m not a very intelligent person i jumped into this game expecting a quick jaunt to the moon and maybe some flights in funny airplanes what i got was a complicated space exploration game that requires actual math that is far beyond my extremely limited abilities so with absolutely no understanding of the game i decided to mess around and create the worst space program ever i got to the moon quite by accident and spent the rest of my game time making airplanes of widely varying quality some vehicles i made were perfectly viable spaceplanes while others disintegrated on the runway did i learn from my mistakes probably not but that doesn t mean that you can t and hey if you re not lazy like me and are willing to put in actual effort to get good at a game then that s worthy of respect and this is the game for you
