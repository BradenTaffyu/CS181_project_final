2023 i just realized i had never posted a review for tabletop simulator as much as i have used it and i think part of that is because i view tabletop simulator the same way i view the calculator on my phone it is such an essential part of my steam library that you don t even really need to think about it tabletop simulator is an absolute must have game not because of the graphics they re not bad but not the best out there or the storyline there is none but because of the endless possibilities i have played hours with friends who live in many different places some overseas and we have played games like cards against humanity around a single table if that statement didn t amaze you read it again because it is truly something wonderful primarily i use tabletop simulator to help me create tabletop roleplaying games for my friends and this is possible due to the literally hundreds to thousands of mods people have created in steam workshop that include tokens table scatter and more there is even a vr option for those who want to feel even more in the game if you are thinking about getting tabletop simulator i cannot recommend it enough
