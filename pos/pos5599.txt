2022 early access review game is really fun in early and midgame can recommend to anyone to try it out but endgame is such a horror i loved this game until i hit the mark of that point early and midgame is actually fun i kill a 2k army take 15 prisoners kill another 2k army take another 13 prisoners put them all in my capital s dungeon i have all the perks that give prisoners less chance to flee in less than 3 minutes vlandia shows up with another 2k army i kill them and take another 16 prisoners by this time bunch of prisoners from the first battle already fled the dungeon slowly grinding down my units in less than 5 minutes i kill a 1 6k army again everyone is wounded in 2 minutes another 2k army shows up on top of that all my kingdom s overall strength seems to be 24k while vlandia s strength is 7k but my retarded ai teammates all get wrecked somehow i finally siege and conquer all the settlements of vlandia after fighting battles for 10 hours straight then they have a 2k strength while i am around 20k they want 10k gold per turn to make peace what a bollocks of a game not only that but my 2 other neighbours also declare war on me and i kill 2k armies every 2 minutes to see another 2k army coming in also if you don t have 500 troops in every garrison there will be a smartass enemy that will always backdoor while you chase them there will be 10 more smartasses sieging your other settlements and hit and running your villages till the end of time endgame of this game is cancer just quit after you make your kingdom and settle yourself after the first wars at that point the fun you will get out of the game is over start a new game
