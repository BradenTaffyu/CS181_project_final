2016 the year is 2387 and the galactic community is on the verge of extinction the prethoryn scourge came to the milky way galaxy in 2368 in isolated pockets which were quickly dealt with by the outer rim empires but everything would change the main force arrived only 3 months after at the beginning the galaxy united together to fight off the scourge but setback after setback the scourge pushed deep into the galaxy within the next four years assimilating all forms of biomass they could find and eradicating any resistance that stood in their way at first it was the smaller weaker empires that went first the cannon fodder while the major galactic powers consolidated their forces and entrenched their worlds and secured their borders but then the scourge targeted the two fallen empires in the galaxy the galactic community all sighed in relief the scourge would surely be annihilated in mere moments against the powers of the fallen empires but within the next couple of weeks the fallen empires fell silent with infected ships pouring out from their borders the scourge had assimilated the fallen empires and now nothing could stop them the galaxy was stunned the panic set in all across the galaxy a once unified galaxy now fractured as empires began fending for themselves as the scourge advanced some some species thought they would kill themselves rather than become a twisted horror of the scourge entire empires were wiped from existence as they nuked themselves into oblivion committing mass suicide with casualties reaching into the billions over the course of the next 20 years many empires would stage a brave final stand at their homeworlds fighting until the bitter end before being snuffed out like a flame from existence during the 2380s the united nations of earth were one of the last remaining empires still militarily capable of fighting the scourge but by 2386 the une had lost a majority of their colonies to the scourge billions dead or transformed into nightmarish horrors in 2387 humanity staged their final stand in the sol system having lost contact with most of their allies they accepted the fact they were now alone the first engagments of the battle of sol were small small scout fleets entered the system and were quickly destroyed by the remnants of the united nations earth defence fleet unedf the first major scourge fleets were dealt by layers of defence platforms and fortresses built across the entire system with most of the outer sol system mined it was an absolute death trap and would ve been considered suicide to assault but the scourge had no fear within months the scourge had broken through the the layers of defensive placements and now directly besieged the worlds of earth and mars the unedf was mostly ruin reduced to a few corvettes destroyers and cruisers the fighting on the surface of earth and mars was terrifying entire armies annihilated by hordes of the scourge s abominations the capital city of earth geneva was lost within hours of the planetary invasion now reduced to nuclear ash the date is november 11th 2387 humanity s grand fleet and army continue to fight desperately in their home system heroically defending their homeworld against the endless onslaught of the prethoryn scourge hoping for an impossible miracle or die trying this is the galaxy s last stand
