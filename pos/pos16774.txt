2022 had it on my wishlist for a long time picked it up for 5 bucks and have enjoyed it the whole day ended up buying two more of the dlcs at 50 and will get the rest when they go on sale it is a good time waster when you just want to chill and listen to some music it is pretty addictive and i finally had to stop and go to bed not sure if i would pay full price but on sale it is a for sure yes
