2015 my experience with this game has been simply amazing first of all the music in this game is beyond great i find myself listening to the radio all the time the guy talking in diamond city radio is f king funny as hell it will for sure make you laugh also the combat music is epic i feel so hyped up when i get into battle with some super mutants the story is fantastic it is an epic adventure to find your lost son in the wasteland going through many different types of enemies such as annoying bugs or some a hole raiders speaking to different people in the wasteland trying to uncover the mystery there are many options of dialog to choose from in some cases you could persuade these characters into giving you more info or items it is really cool to see there are many side quests to do many locations to find and explore the world has many things to offer this game is one of the best games i have ever played in 2015 fallout has been one of my favorite series of all time and it is still number one for me i m glad it is this game has many quests over 100 hours of content dlc and more mods coming soon i cannot wait you could put hundreds of hours into this game fallout 4 earns from me a solid 10 10 hopefully this is the game of the year i highly recommend this game for anybody and for rpg fans it is a must own mr takanashi
