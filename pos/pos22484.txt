2017 having finished all three dark souls games including all dlc aoa and trc included i still affirm that this is the weakest in the trilogy and that includes the dlc which is among the worst souls content i ve played period but you disgusting weeaboo you hit recommend by accident you that s right because just on virtue of this game being a dark souls title it s still entirely above average compared to most aaa releases and it s still a joy to play in general i had fun with it the world design and lore is completely nonexistent compared to ds1 and the weapon balance pvp and dlc quality entirely is nowhere near ds2 s level it s an inferior game to each of its contemporaries subjectivity but hey it s still fun to play pick it up blow 80 hours on it play the others if you haven t it s good
