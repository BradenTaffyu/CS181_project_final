2017 best total war personal opinionbefore i start this review i must say that i wrote a review before this about how total war medieval ii was the best total war game but i would say they are pretty equal on my personal scale i mean what is better than swatting a bunch of orcs off a hill with a hypogyph nothing though i am not a fan of the warhammer series and or have a extensive knowledge of the universe that the story dwells in i do believe this game to be really interesting and fun not to mention it is a great relief not to play on the same map with just differing factions and time periods the fantasy take on the game has really brought out how the total war series should be played still i do love going back and playing attila or rome ii mostly because of the mechanics and story telling or possiblities with the different factions reviewwith all that in mind that doesn t take away from the actual game and review this game is different compared to many especially with the uniqueness of the factions and how they are played humans are weaker than most but have great tech to keep them balanced it is best to play them on a defensive play through unless you have a lot of them the orcs are strong but can be frightened easily or swatted off a hill if they don t use good tactics plus they have crappy tech and rely on their brute force it is best to play them aggressively and knock surrounds enemies down before they can build up their empire vampires are the opposite of humans with no stamina and scary af but they are weaker most others if you play this faction make sure to play strategically you may have more units stacks armies but the enemy is always somehow stronger or better the dawrves are best played aggressively they can take on the orcs easily and can rival up the humans but have troubles with the vamps if not handled well the other factions are for you to see not to mentions it gets rid of the old use of the same map with different engines of the last total war games not to mention the replayability of this game is almost off the charts with the possibilities every character feels unique even within their own faction and can help or hender your armies the lore is pretty cool but you won t know it unless you are already a fan or you look it uphere forums totalwar com the units are so cool to look at i really love the dragons or giants even the soldiers of the empire have great textures with the military clothing overall b it s a great game offers a lot of replayability and interesting gameplay that s why i am gald it is coming out with a second game the dlc are worth it and interesting seriously try it out and have fun
