2017 based on 500 hrs of gameplay best game i ve ever played school grades have been sacrificed do you want to get addicted because this is how you get addicted build and design spaceships rovers or even spaceplanes like the shuttles nasa is using build it launch it crash it try again crash again build again and eventually manage to explore the solar system this game is for the players who enjoy challenges and small chances of success at least at first it s a steep learning curve and a lot to dig into but the fact that a lot of your coming failures will be the result of having to adjust to the laws of physics aerodynamics thermology and so on makes the whole experience rewarding in even real life practical ways smart people play ksp be smart seriously
