2014 while some say its really buggy i didn t have that problem since there are several readily available mods posted in a sticky on the steam forums that fix most of this game s problems i played the previous 3 fallout games and enjoyed all of them but this is my favorite so far its an enjoyable open world quest based rpg game that let s you do almost anything and then you find out that the legion are slavers that crucify people for fun and you realize that you only have one choice which is killing every living thing in the wasteland to prevent the legion from having the pleasure of course
