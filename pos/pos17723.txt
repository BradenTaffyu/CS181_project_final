2016 finally congratulations to ca sega you have gained your name back with this title awesome game with awesome graphic these heroes spellcasters and faction s quests make me feel like i am playing a mix between strategy and rpg playstyle besides this game is harder than i think compared to previous titles in vanilla always did well with very hard campaign difficulty in rome 2 and attila and i just abandoned my dwarf campaign at the same difficulty level at turn of 70 since there was no way to stop waves of orcs from invading my land and now my chaos hoards are running across the map normal diffuculty being chased by out of nowhere stupid bird god so recommended campaign should be normal or hard in the first playthrough once again well done sega
