2014 early access review one of the most addictive and exciting games i ve played in recent memory and that although it is not even in beta stage yet so wonder what is more to come from this but if you like space games like building rockets or space planes and send them out to explore the universe this is definitely the game to get even after over 30 hours of playing i still scratched on the surface i wished this is what spore space stage should have been with kerbal space program you could lots and lots of fun in this one but beware this can be a real time sink i also recommend watching some of the tutorial videos online to help a bit with frustration at the beginning when you just don t get your rocket into orbit
