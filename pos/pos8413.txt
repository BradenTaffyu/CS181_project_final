2023 frostpunk casts a long shadow in the gaming world much like minecraft does this is usually an indication that a game is destined to be remembered as a classic of gaming much like how david bowie and the stones are remembered as classics of rock and roll from timberborn s automaton system to captain of industry s exploration system and cult of the lamb s morality system you ll find many games touched directly or indirectly by frostpunk and those were just the games i could think of off the top of my head there are probably many more if you want to be a part of history by saying to younguns many years from now that i played classic games by buying this game not to mention all the fun you ll have it s a bit difficult and you ll probably end up resetting a few times but don t worry you can get it right tldr frostpunk is a high quality innovative gaming classic well worth your money
