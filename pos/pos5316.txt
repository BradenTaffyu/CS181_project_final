early access review the key to enjoying this game is understanding how it s balanced well it s not really balanced you can easily become a god by finding a certain flying bug and spending few real world hours grinding a percentage based outcome over 1000 times but it s boring what s not boring is to swap bodies with a bug and trying to survive in a world where even a character with normal stats can be single turn killed in over a hundred of different ways you can easily become rich by cloning certain merchants and spending even more time bying and stockpiling some precious liquids from them but it s not as fun as going 50 stratas deep and just finding the equipment you would buy for this money lying around charred corpses you can easily gain your first few levels by being extremely cautious and spending a lot of time travelling between the starting village and a newbie zone but it s not fun as just jumping into a space time vortex and making it out with getting all the levels almost at the same time or dying in various fun ways you can invest an insane amount of time and attribute points into unlocking a combat skill tree but you can just pour a certain liquid over any enemy to turn them into a frog and kill them well and soft lock yourself out of the main quest this is your choice grind and be rewarded role play and be rewarded do stupid things and be rewarded
