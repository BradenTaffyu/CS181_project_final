2017 on release everything seems to work perfectly for me i have had no issues with the game at all and even alone the voice acting is keeping me playing feel free to check some valid negative reviews for problems that will most likely be fixed and remember there is always the option to reload to rethink and plan lets hope this stays constant through the game ok the quest log is broken as mentioned alot and i found a couple of bugs the devs are working to fix problems but they just do not have enough people to find all the bugs i am 100 sure the game will be fleshed out within a couple months i also have heard that act 3 is kind of broken in a way which i will experience myself so far everything is beautiful and feels good the graphics audio story telling companions and all the other stuffs as someone who enjoys smething and goes back afterwords to see everything this will be a great experience early access review before you buy please go play atleast some of the first game if you wanted to play this it is finished so a new player can enjoy the full experience i have just been reading people complain about the early access too much to ignore this oh and i very strongly recommend getting a friend to join you there is a 2 player pack i pretty sure if you are feeling generous without a friend that you can enjoy playing with the beginning will be a struggle as it is a bit misleading also the game is difficult in a way that makes a person have to think critically making a restart is inevitable unless you are either a master at these games or just have played it a while having another person to talk to about positioning and cc main points of the game really makes a restart less frusturating and more of a learning experience until you get into the groove if you get this game i seriously hope you enjoyed it as much as the first one although i haven t beaten it completely i have enjoyed every step of the teleporting mess that it is also if you can only buy one get this one both are really great though
