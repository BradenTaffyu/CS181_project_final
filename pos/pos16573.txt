2017 early access review i ve spent over 200 hours in this game since i ve downloaded it not only do i think it s revolutanary in the way it s made and played but to even be an early access game and feel so complete and right amazes me every time i boot it up with or without mods my summer car is a different awesome experience every time i play it and i think that s what makes me love it so much not many games now have the charm this one does and for that i believe it s one of the best games i ve really ever played
