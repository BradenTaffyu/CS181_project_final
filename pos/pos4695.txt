2015 i love the fallout series i was also extremelly hyped for this game it s incredibly fun but has its flaws pros combat is no longer dull and boring wasteland is a good as ever addicting for the first day of playtime or so once you get the hang of settlement building its pretty fun companion quests are fun as well as getting them all to romace best friend status power armour actually feels like power armour not just a bad metal suit power armor modding is also worth the time the mechanic is balanced by having to scavenge for fusion cores to keep your power armour functioning like how its meant to voiced protagonist at first the voiced protagonist was hated the game came out and people thought it was good now people see it and think eh but imo it does express the emotional tones this game wants to portray when the character is meant to be angry hes angry sad sad and etc you can hear the emotion in the voice he or her is trying to portray weapon modding is fun and it does make a difference but after a while it can become tedious locations and map the map is big enough is full of unique and interesting locations one of my favourites is the glowing sea where the atomic bomb was dropepd graphics personally i think the graphics are just great but keep in mind i m running at ultra with 60fps some people might differ from me cons dialouge at first i didn t think it was so bad but now i see its a major flaw you only get 4 choices which are yes good guy no being a sarcastic sometimes sometimes good and question question is redundant because someone could tell you something about a topic or thing you already know a lot about yet you still have the option to story no matter what you do you will end up with the same ending and story regardless of your choices but slightly different depending on the faction you side with will determine your slightly altered final mission battle no matter what you ll either be a good guy helping people or a guy with an attitude no matter what the game will take you to the same place the story also feels rushed and incredibly short withing your first 2 hours of story or so you re already thrown into power armor when the other games took a long time to get you into it but atleast power armor makes a difference now with 81 hours in i also cannot find any more side quests replay value as mentioned above the endings and story do not change significantly depending on choices you make don t expect multiple endings or storylines like new vegas had thats not here since the story never changes just like war it feels like there is no replay value besides changing genders the game still would be boring doing the exact same thing not me personally but bugs a lot of people have reported bugs in their game i haven t expierienced any but always keep that in mind tl dr most mechanics are improved making the game really fun but the story options and ending are just lackluster when its predicesor new vegas showed how a fallout story line should go that was developed by obsidian though not bathesda its still worth a buy and play though hopefully dlc might fix some story issues but at least it ll add more things to do as well as other stories to complete and areas to explore i still very much reccommend playing it because its still a blast to play 7 10follow up after dlc so as you can see my invested hours in the game has rissen since i wrote this review my points have not changed dramatically but i noticed that casual exploring invested me a little further into the game but dlc relies on my new playtime greatly at the moment there are 4 dlc s i hate how most of our dlc s are monthly releases and focused on settlements before you say be greatful etc youre getting dlc i personally don t believe along with many others that settlement building dlc is entirely worth the money into a season pass previously in the older fallouts dlc would take 2 3 months or so to release and would be story location driven making for incredibly fun quests and senarios i would much prefer bethesda to take their time developing more story location based dlc s rather than pumping out monthy dlc with arguably 3 5 6 dlc s being settlement based these are the dlcs so far automation allows you to build companion defense robots i say this counts as settlement building because of the building element this dlc has a quest accompanying it but its incredibly short its closer to a linear side mission than anything robots are fun but it gets old 6 5 10wasteland workshop build arena s concrete structures and have settlers fight animals or each other this dlc is ok i d say its only worth it if you want a gorilla or deathclaw or another creature patrolling your settlement tbh this feels more like a mod than dlc should be free its good for concrete and creatures average 5 10far harbor this this is what dlc should be a brand new location weapons story side missions interesting characters locations and quests this is arguably better than the main story due to all of the possible choices you can make within this dlc this dlc is incredibly worth it and i pray to god nuka world either succeed this or be on par definately a 8 5 10contraptions tbc seems alright i guess idk what ill need a conver belt for also elevators seem to be the only realisticly cool thing vault building tbc initial thoughts the idea is cool however it is basically fallout shelter in fallout 4 i dont really have a problem with it besides the fact it just doesnt make sence to me this kinda seems like a gimmick arguably building things is way to simple but wood and metal you can get away with just building vaults outta some materials just doesnt seem right to me nuka world tbc inital thoughts new map new story with the option of being evil with an effect on the commonwealth sign me up mods yeah they basically improve the game to your liking can t say much else besides it more than likely will add a lot of hours to your playtime
