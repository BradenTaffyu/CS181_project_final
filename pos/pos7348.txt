2022 this is an amazing game for new truckers to get an idea how to handle a tractor trailer i m not sure but if this game included the driver being able to get out and look around the truck would be great also random heavy traffic not for long and more cars on the road would be cool furthermore more people walking around would be nice and penalties given if they are hit but this game is great
