2017 this is the greatest shiniest heaviest most beautiful diamond in the rough ever found in the blood diamond mines of congolese warlords you will spend a lot of hours playing with it before attempting to shine it and cut it into something even more beautiful modifications filters script extenders the things you thought you wanted items weapons armor types character styles they are out there for you to add in it is a game which stands on its own in terms of story character game content all while constrained by the absolutely garbage bethesda creation that is the gamebryo engine but no matter how shiny you make this diamond or no matter how many times you cut it to present it as something more beautiful it will always be a little bit misty in the center the colors will always be brightest in a few key areas and dull in others it is a gem which could fit easily in the royal jewels of any ancient monarchy but it will never be set within a crown sceptre or hilt it will always stand on its own in a little velvet and glass casing the diamond that came out of a strange and frankly horrible place and it captivates you will feel the frustration of the jewelers as they tried so hard to make something great it is a poor craftsman who blames his tools the addage goes unless of course those tools were sold to you by todd howard buy this game play this game i hope you enjoy it but understand that this game requires a certain level of commitment from you the player this game will not entirely hold your hand all the way through you will need to figure things out have some imagination and understand that you won t be able to see everything this has to offer in a single playthrough admittedly if patrolling the mojave makes you wish for a nuclear winter you can always go be someone with absolutely no taste class intellect or redeemable qualities and go play fallout 4
