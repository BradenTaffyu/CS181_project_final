2020 race 4 just graduated from rookie to d license skip barber series racing watkins glen i ve put in 4 hrs of practice on the track getting my lap time from a depressing 1 27 325 to a respectable 1 24 724 i hop into the race qualifying p2 with a 1 24 998 i cant believe it i pop into the grid sporting my custom canada black red livery from tradingpaints i m feeling nervous 4 red lights and green p1 starts slow and i take pole position on turn 1 this is it race 4 and i m going to win just need to hold on for 18 laps coming up through the esses i can feel the car slipping around turn 4 tyres haven t warmed up yet but i manage to hold my position down the long straight into turn 5 i can see p2 and p3 drafting up from behind they have the inside line going into the long turn they brake early giving me the opportunity to take the ideal line around the bend but in my excitement i end up braking a bit too late taking the turn faster than i m used to on cold tyres i spin out my heart sinks this is it i m going to get t boned i somehow control the car enough not to hit the inside wall i sit there for what feels like eternity i don t want to move and cause more incidents so i wait for the other skippys to fly by a player comes in over the coms thanks for not moving chris well done mate you ll get it back thankfully another incident has occured on turn 6 allowing me to easily navigate through the wreckage of 8 cars and start lap 2 in 7th place if i can hold onto 7th for the remaining 17 laps i ll be happy but there are 3 other skippy s on my tail we race neck in neck the entire rest of the race going 4 wide at one point into turn 5 3 wide through the esses everyone is holding their line who cares about p1 this is the most exhilarating experience in gaming i ve ever had lap 18 this is it the final lap i just did a 1 24 567 my fastest lap ever i m in p8 coming up through the esses 3 of us hit the slipstream behind p7 on the long straight into turn 5 p7 s skippy starts blinking then disappears did he disconnect suddenly he reappears on my left side he s in the grass i don t have time to react as he clips the wall and rebound back into me sends me airborne i do a barrel roll up and over one of the cars behind me who is also spinning out of control along with the p9 and p10 skippys my car rolls for what feels like eternity making me absolutely nauseated in my vr headset are you f ing kidding me says one of the players on the coms i am so so so sorry the other player says i say nothing i m unable to as i cant stop laughing another player chimes in i ve been playing for 3 years and that was the most exciting race i have ever done not even mad well done guys started p2 finished p16 was incredible i no longer care about the cost of the cars tracks i no longer care about the subscription fee i no longer care about the dated graphics that one race was worth the price of admission would 100 recommend
