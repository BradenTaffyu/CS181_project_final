fallout 76 is a fomo and inventory management simulator game set in the fallout universe it is a near carbon copy of fallout 4 with regards to gameplay except it has the addition of being multi player the story is fresh and interesting and is expanded upon every season there are however multiple gameplay penalties introduced that strongly encourage you to pay monthly for fallout 1st such as unlimited scrap and ammo storage which used to be just like baked into other fallout games is fallout 76 objectively a good game no no it is not you will encounter bugs that have existed for years quests that don t work odd dialog pauses for no reason and occasionally bethesda just completely breaks stuff like right now the map is broken and has been for several days as mentioned it is a near carbon copy of fallout 4 engine wise so prepare to face things like constantly dealing with the stupid entering your power armor animation 7000 times per play session just because that was how it was in fallout 4 also worth noting there are numerous things you cannot do in power armor like interact with any workbench there are a couple fun new additions like your weapons and armor will break and require repairs and you need to maintain your food and water levels and oh don t forget the aid items like stimpaks are really heavy for some reason in a game that limits your storage space all that being said if you love fallout fallout 76 will scratch that itch there are tons of weapons armors skins paints and base items to collect you will encounter familiar faces like deathclaws and feral ghouls along with new and scarier enemies there are dozens of events to attend that are generally pretty generous with rewards and experience and stingy on rare plans to keep you coming back the game encourages group play and the community is generally pretty nice and helpful with a low quantity of trolls or toxic players most of my complaints are around the infuriating amount of bugs in the game and the general frustrations caused by stringently limiting player storage holding space as a result of needing to push players towards a subscription and even then the frustrations are only mildly abated not completely relieved there exists however a satisfying gameplay loop of earning things scrapping or scripping things unloading your ill gotten goods and heading back out into the wasteland to do it all over again
