2018 nature callsi bought this game knowing nothing about it i tried the previous game though but it sucked because it was pay2win i don t like that this was one of the best blind purchases i ve made the game is very detailed the forests look natural and when you re in the forest you feel like you re really there this game has one of the best if not the best depiction of vegetation and especially grass i ve ever seen sometimes i just stand there and look at the grass it looks even better when the wind blows you see the waves going through the fields just beautiful when you move through bushes and other plants they react to you and move when touch them when you re in a forest it feels like a forest and not just same one tree copy pasted all over the place it looks diverse also if you re on a field you leave tracks like if you re on a corn field the corn will bend down beneath you and stay that way little details like this really makes the experience more enjoyable i wish someone would do an open world rpg on this engine rain effects is another amazing feature the sound of rain is so calming and so real that you may forget what you re doing don t forget the dlc maps they look stunning and provide you with a whole new maps in different locations from deserts to snowy locations the pricing ok too although there are some dlc which should ve been the part of core game but hey at least they re dirty cheap i almost forgot this is a hunting game because i sometimes just run around and admire the scenery you can shoot not only with your in game camera but you can shoot guns too first you must find the animal tracks or the place they rest eat or drink these spots are then marked on your map but they don t stay there forever so you can ambush the animals in these spots or you can follow the tracks but it s much harder because animals hear you from afar then just aim and shoot but it s not as easy as it looks it s very easy to scare an animal if you get close at couple hundred meters from the animals and you make noise or you re not crouching they will run away you need to stay silent and sneak until you re at a good range to aim and take the shot you must take wind direction into account too because animals can smell you from afar if wind is blowing at the right direction and hitting the animal is not enough you must hit the vital organ to get a guaranteed kill and a good rating at the beginning you will probably only injure the animal then it runs away leaving a trail of blood you then follow that trail if your shot was pretty accurate the animal will bleed out and die and you ll find it but if the wound wasn t critical he can run far away and not die to make the hunt easier you have various callers and scents which when used attracts the animals you need to use different callers for different animals gun handling is done pretty well guns feel real they sound real and they shoot realistically your hands are moving a bit you can t hold up your breath forever you practically can t aim if you were running recently because your gun will move too much due to you needing to catch the breath there are quests you get xp unlock skills buy new weapons and progress through the game quests can be really challenging like hunting animals with a bow or pistol down an animal from a very close or very far range exploring is a big part of the game the maps are huge and if you re on foot it will take hours to explore everything you can make exploration faster by buying quad bike dlc but it s a bad idea for hunting because it scares the animals in extremely wide area around it so going on foot is always better i must say the game looks absolutely stunning the graphics are beautiful sometimes you even forget you re hunting you just run or drive around admiring the nature performance is average i run the game on max settings and it runs at 60 65fps i don t have big complaints but i d prefer better performance the game must be pretty demanding considering the graphics i play on 5800x 2070s 32gb 3440x1440 ultrawide support is there but sometimes it s glitching where you start seeing to much of you own body on the screen there are many things to do quests or just doing what you want this game will keep you occupied for a long time a very long time the price tag is great go get it if you want calming and relaxing experience prosstunning graphicshighest quality soundlots of content and things to dovery challenging but extremely rewardingdlc maps are greatcons some dlc should be freeaverage performancemy curator page
