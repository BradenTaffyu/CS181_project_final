2022 i m on the highway to hell so i kept getting tickets for speeding and almost went to jail for ramming people off the street then i started playing this game and the consequences are gone yay me but seriously it s all fun and games until you re asked to deliver ammunition and chlorine from germany to france anyway here s to me following in my father s footsteps take a truck to spain and never come back oh and for those who don t know there are actually 2 games in 1 just remove the speed limiter and you get the hidden speeding ticket simulator as well all jokes aside though like this time for real it is an amazing truck driving simulator hell probably the best one out there right next to the same company s other truck sim american truck simulator and one that has been around for a decade now with a huge fanbase even after 10 years constant updates from developers who actually listen it supports steam workshop mods as well as other mods and the game itself is just so chill and relaxing with some really good graphics all things considering and attention to detail a ton of customization options for multiple things an overall huge map some cool management mechanics here and there for your own company and so on simply put it s a must have 11 10 nearly 3 years after brexit the game still recognizes great britain as being a part of the eu take that uk
