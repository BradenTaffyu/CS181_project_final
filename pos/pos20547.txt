2020 i can hear someone outside my door never mind plants vs zombies is a 2009 game from popcap originally a seattle company whose humble beginnings began in 2000 by john vechey brian fiete and jason kapalka their first game was a soft core porn game called foxy poker their intentions were to accumulate a huge revenue from the adult industry and then use those proceeds to create family casual games their real passion forthwith however they soon realised that the whales that spend the most are not interested in simply suggestive animation they want all or nothing and so their original plan had fizzled the company was then rescued from disillusionment with their next game diamond mine aka bejewelled and used the revenue accumulated from that to eventually buy out a whole list of small gaming companies spintop sprout etc and works of various individual programmers such as george fan and his creation of plants vs zombies knowing what they were getting themselves into popcap who had already bought out the work of george fan then sold their own company to ea in 2011 for a staggering price of 750 million george fan crossed over but was soon fired on the grounds of not wanting micro transactions on his work hence causing a backlash somewhat among many dedicated fans plants vs zombies is a 5 lane tower defence game using an assortment of genetically modified plants constructed by an eccentric inventor known as crazy dave known as dave blazing in the comics who foresaw and prepared for a whole range of end of the world calamites from his own greenhouse he manufactured a range of plants that would be able to maintain an assault against a number of proposed future invasions including that of zombies he also created plants that are simply used for defensive purposes along with some plants that collect sunlight and light energy which can be used to purchase energise other plants a few of crazy dave s trademarks is that he wears a saucepan on his head and mumbles incessantly the prequel lawnmageddon comic series reveals that crazy dave is also involved in fighting a war against telepathic squirrels which is a worrisome indicator as to his state of mind and that he might be a perfect candidate for an asylum in a patch adam s movie this is also the reason why you find a hidden squirrel minigame if you use cheat engine his solitude in a mounted last stand for survival with what could be the last survivor of neighbourville that being you has evidently caused a toll however his mumbling a language by itself as indicated by comics and plants vs zombies 2 can only be translated by his niece patricia blazing and gugle a translating device which might indicate that there are more survivors or even something like penny even though you don t see them george fan in an interview also admitted that originally the gargantuan was going to occasionally appear brandishing a phone booth with a person still trapped inside being used as a club hence in george fan s mind pockets of neighbourville resistance still existed even though their whereabouts is shrouded in mystery since plants vs zombies the franchise and its lore has significantly grown with the help of ea including pvz 2 pvz adventures now cancelled pvz heroes pvz garden warfare 1 2 and 3 pvz the last stand pvz all stars pvz battle for neighbourville and the list goes on this has added a deep foliage of time travel alternate universes and fan theories to the franchise one such theory is that you might not exist at all but that you may just be an hallucination concocted by crazy dave himself since your never actually seen there are a few problems with this theory though 1 you don t meet crazy dave till 1 5 before that you seem to be interacting with free runaway plants from his greenhouse comic and whomever is translating informing you how to use them 2 if you fail and zombies do get in your house your then greeted by a scream that is not crazy dave s 3 crazy dave gets abducted by a bungee zombie on the last level leaving you to defend your house by yourself 4 penny in pvz2 states finally another user who can process my queries evidently you must exist then while the zombies in the comic seem to somewhat co exist with people in neighbourville simply making a nuisance of themselves chanting and parroting the word brainzzz they are never ever actually seen eating anybody on the flipside there is undoubtedly a crusade against your house and more importantly your brain as if the consummation of your brain is the sole implanted mission of every zombie all along why has dr zomboss realised that your demise will benefit the timeline in his favour somehow again one of those interesting theories we can only hope will be addressed as the lore improves dr zomboss zombie boss is also an interesting character and is somewhat different from the other zombies making us question if he is actually a zombie at all pvz gw2 seems to indicate that he might have some characteristics to the naked mole rat he is the only one to demonstrate flawless grammar and a high iq with his large array of zombot inventions unlike other zombies he has a craving taste for pop smarts and as a graduate in thanatology he has demonstrated a morbid curiosity in experimenting on zombies as shown in a nintendo ds trailer and absolutely no remorse like a crazed war general when he kills even some of his own zombies in pvz 2 in a nutshell this game will open a franchise you will want to bury yourself in your first problem though being do you pay for this pc version or play the free mobile version with microtransactions added essentially the pros of the pc are that there is more minigames with a hidden limbo page filled with 11 more minigames that can be also accessed via cheat engine the pc version also has the tree of wisdom which will give you in game codes that will unlock a variety of visual easter eggs though growing it to a 1 000 ft to unlock the pinata code could be extremely grinding also the zen garden can be arrayed with a rainbow of coloured marigolds in comparison to the mobiles only white version the biggest delight for me though was the music video at the end by laura shigihara her childlike blissful voice filling my heart to the brink with joy on the other hand the free mobile version harnesses way better high definition graphics has the ability for you to replay any level in the adventure mode at any time and has a much easier set up in the zen garden shop allowing you to be an avid plant collector in final whatever version you choose every time i played this game the plants with their joyful characteristics was like being hugged with a bouquet of constant goodness crazy dave and his antics was like a friend that never failed to make me smile and the magical accompanying musical score often made my heart dance and flutter like a butterfly finding a ray of sunshine in a dim forest do yourself a favour and start planting a few roots into this franchise hang on i just received a note under my door i ll read it to you now no need tu play this gamme as we hav hirred a nu gardner too take care of plunts go play
