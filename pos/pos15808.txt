2021 this game comes with a really stupid simple premise that s done extraordinarily well you spray water at things until they re clean doesn t sound like fun but it s incredibly soothing and satisfying to see something covered in mud and dirt suddenly pop with live and vibrant colors and sorting out a method of which you tackle these projects is a different sort of fun in itself think of it like a coloring book from your childhood except the giant building is the book and the pressure washer is your crayon the level of organization or chaos is up to you do you want to spray a bunch of wangs in the mud or do you just want to climb on top of the truck and start spraying from there the grime is your oyster also the game has a story for some reason the people you get the projects from text you while you clean their crap and it s hilarious and charming there s actually a few of the reoccurring customers that i came to enjoy and looked forward to seeing if i get to do more for them edit no seriously this game has a story i m not crying i just got soap in my eye
