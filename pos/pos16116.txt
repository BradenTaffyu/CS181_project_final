2015 early access review this simulator has so much potential that a single review on steam could not even scathe the surface of depth that it contains within it s walls of creativity and customization do you enjoy the luxury of having every single board game card game dice game and pen and paper game laid before you in an easy to use ever growing plethora of a database do you ever find yourself in a dire situation in which you can not contain the hatred and fury of the rage inside of you which burns like the flames of one thousand suns and lays waste to all who oppose you in such a mood then this game is right up your ally at any given time you can flip the table and watch your game pieces fall into the void of nothingness with the physics unmatched by any game sold commercially or otherwise you will be left in awe when you come to the sudden realization that the game that lies before you could change the way you look at video games and life in general forever did i mention the deep and vast multiplayer expierence duuuude it s like soooo deep 8 players yeah it s like that the host also has the ability to lock items or the table itself to prevent those less capable of abstract thought to flip the table in the middle of your session i think it should be manditory for this game to be in everyone s collection just like obamacare
