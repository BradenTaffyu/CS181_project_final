2020 i have been a total war fan since the early days even today i still enjoy playing the earlier titles like medieval 2 and it dlc over the years i have watched the series grow and develop into something far more greater than what the early days gave you this is what three kingdoms does like warhammer 2 it brings in a diverse area of character development in the fact that your heroes are singular units they are powerful and have the abilities to take on entire armies this is a fun concept if you have played any of the dynasty warriors games that follow the romance of the three kingdoms novel and not the actual historic accounts of china so like what it is with warhammer 2 this concept brings a whole new level of gameplay still new to the total war world yet if you interested in playing classic then three kingdoms also gives you that option the campaign itself is rather confusing and can take you some time to understand the concept behind it not just from the development points of the cities but the diplomacy council and other aspects of the campaign are difficult to master at first one feature that threw me off for some time was the use of reforms to this day i still have not fully understood the the concept behind these its a new way of doing things however i believe three kingdoms is still easier to understand then some titles like rome 2 i have not played rome 2 much but when i do play i end up with a headache very quickly the battle system has been developed well and incorporates both concepts from rome 2 and warhammer 2 which really brings life to the battle of three kingdoms from duels taking place between generals to never before seen unit tactic and formations three kingdoms brings you hours of fun that make you need to stay one step ahead of the ai or enemy player at all times one fatal error can spell the end of you entire army a mistake i have made a couple of times this brings me into a certain bad point of the game that is the choice and selection of units i understand that it is needing to follow as much of the history of that era as possible but the game can become somewhat dry by the time you reach the level to unlock the more unique legendary units i m not going to go into load of details about the pros and cons of the game what i have said is basics and you find out what this game has to offer on your own through playing it i do highly recommend this instalment of the total war world for you will not be disappointed and like me can have hours of fun playing it thanks for taking the time to read this what you do in life echos in eternity
