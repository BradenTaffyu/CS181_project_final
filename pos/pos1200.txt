2015 early access review project zomboid i drank a bottle of bleach to relieve my thirst genre isometric post apocalyptic zombie survival plays like dayz don t starve positive well realised oppressive zombie apocalypse well balanced survival elements properly reward scavenging negative ui needs work you ll likely want a wiki companion recommendation yes finished or not it s one of the best survival games to date project zomboid is a hardcore survival game with the works you have to manage the usual things like hunger and thirst but also new considerations like sleep overheating freezing fear sickness and infection it s a balancing act that has lasting appeal with an ever growing variety of ways to deal with your situation which brings me to early access i personally don t find the distinction between a finished game and an unfinished one to be all that useful the feeling of fun that i have while playing a game doesn t care if it s finished or not if your game is functional and enjoyable before it is officially released then i ll happily give you money to continue creating a product that i would have probably bought anyway after all this same method is how we have come to enjoy many games that likely wouldn t have been made some games perhaps most famously minecraft will likely never be finished with new content being added on a regular basis project zomboid is possibly in the same situation if being in early access is one of your considerations against buying a game then i hope this review is at the very least informative for you zombie survival often turns into dumb action so it s nice to see a game that is more the walking dead than dawn of the dead the zombies themselves aren t that threatening in small clusters but the real danger comes in numbers i had an experience where i had boarded up a house with a small vegetable garden only to wake up in the middle of the night to a horde migration on its way to the city i escaped but my stash became inaccessible after the initial frustration i looked back and thought that s a really cool feature coming across an event as catastrophic as a migration or even something mildly hazardous like finding a zombie behind a door that you weren t expecting add excitement to the gameplay once your character is dead you have to start a new game so even being scratched by an unnoticed zombie can be devastating and in more than one case lethal i love this you approach scavenging cautiously you pick your targets and pass over ones that you think would end badly it s an elegantly designed difficulty curve that while not unique to project zomboid has been well implemented a large part of the game is character progression you create your character with a basic background and positive and negative traits customise the games difficulty settings to your preference and then are dropped into rural america to fend for yourself there are a selection of skills available to you the way they improve is simple the more you use a skill the better you get at it thats it this encourages variety in the way you play your game as new options open up the better you get at a skill currently there are 20 skills most are related to different physical abilities but there are ones that affect how well you can farm build cook trap fish etc while the system itself works mostly without player interaction it s still nice to see something going on under the hood in a genre where most games are just content with a hunter gatherer style of gameplay so what actually is the scope of the game well when you start you literally just have the clothes on your back among your first concerns are food water and a safe shelter to sleep through your first night you will scavenge for anything of use and try to carry as much as you can without making you a slow easy target for nearby zombies once you ve found a nice place preferable close but not actually in a town you ll probably want to go about barricading it to reduce the risk of zombies breaking your windows or even worse just wandering through the back door you forgot to close once you have found your new home you ll go about nicking as much as you can and dropping it off for later use eventually the utilities will be shut off so you ll have to find alternatives to using refrigerators to keep food fresh and taps for easy access to water long before this you ll need to consider actually growing and catching food yourself a task made difficult by roaming walkers this status quo balancing act can go on for months until you finally run out of bandages or meds to keep you going i found the variety of things to manage to be really immersive thanks in no small part to the attention to detail if zombies are banging on your door your character will become anxious so you need to give him sedatives or risk him being less effective when it comes time to run i really liked project zomboid it has a wealth of content in its current state and still has new things added to it each time i play it is everything that i want from a survival game in a package that clearly has had a lot of care and attention put into it again being an early access title you ll have to decide for yourself whether you ll find value in this purchase i certainly feel like i got my money s worth
