if you loved nfs underground 2 s vibe but enjoy the racing drifting of assetto corsa this game is for you it s not assetto corsa or the latest nfs title but for me it feels like nfs underground 2 reborn with a fantastic driving experience arcade racers it may feel tough at first why isn t the car turning why does it under oversteer but once you tune the car properly it responds perfectly look up setups to get it just right sim racers while i haven t tried it with a wheel the joypad experience is fun and predictable you can extend drifts with the handbrake adjust angles with left foot braking and clutch kick for transitions all very satisfying the downside even after updates it s still very grindy it takes a lot of hours to earn enough credits for the car and upgrades you want if you don t love the car after all that effort it s back to grinding for another still as a sim racer drifter looking for a chill experience without setting up a full rig this is a fun and rewarding game
