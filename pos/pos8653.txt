2019 beautiful game and immersive simulator experience gives you the genuine feeling of going out to explore the wild just you and the untamed nature being a hunter myself mostly reindeer and ptarmigans i can attest that this game very successfully recreates the thrills and experiences of real life hunting the multiplayer options are also a big bonus i play this game a lot with my hunter friends pros in this game as in real life it s about so much more than just pulling the trigger it s really about going out into the wild and experiencing nature up close learning about the behaviour of the wild animals anticipating where to find them searching tracking taking account of the environment wind visibility foliage hills slopes line of sight sneaking to get up close for the perfect shot the question of where to aim to successfully down the animal with your shot the thrill of successfully getting the perfect shot in the heart and then the inevitable chase tracking the bloodtrails of injured animals or simply the critically wounded which still manage to run for hundreds of meters the tracking system in this game is very good and enjoyable for example how you can tell if there is a big blood puddle that your shot was a vital hit or if it s just small one that it was just a non fatal flesh wound in this game just as in real life again it s about patience and thinking responsibly as being too harsh or eager and hastily making the wrong decision will get you nowhere only frustration this is no standard fps with constant machine gun killing action if that s what you are looking for as some people here in the reviews seem to be go and play left 4 dead cons the integrity system and scoring bonuses for shooting the animals could be improved to be more closely reflective of reality for example you would never shoot an animal in the gut or the intestines that would ruin the meat but you can do so in this game and still get a 100 integrity score there is also no specific bonus for shooting in the heart you might as well shoot it in the spine which is a much easier target in the game while this might not be the case in reality there are a few bugs which could probably be easily fixed but in general the game is not very buggy the dlc content for this game is relatively cheap compared to many other big titles which employ excessive and exploitative pricing schemes from the reviews of this game i get the impression that most negative reviewers are complaining about the pricing of the dlc content but this perfectly legimitate criticism can be applied to almost every game nowadays definitely recommended
