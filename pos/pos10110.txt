2019 overall score 9 5 10 masterpiece replayability one of if not the most replayable games i have ever played you ll never find two colonies to be the exact same you might have one of the most successful colonies you ll ever have in one of your first runs and it might fall to pieces in less than an hour with 100s of hours of gameplay under your belt believe me i ve had plenty of both which takes me to difficulty the game handles difficulty perfectly imho it doesn t hold your hand but it isn t entirely cruel with some skill and luck you can recover from pretty much anything losing is fun and part of your story after all rather than a typical difficulty setting like peaceful easy hard extreme etc rimworld rather has storytellers that you choose first and then choose a difficulty setting in conjunction with your storyteller the storyteller runs in the background and chooses what events to throw at you their severity and whether they re good or bad for instance cassandra classic is the normal storyteller in that you receive a relatively easy start that grows in difficulty as you play your colony randy random however as the name suggests is unpredictable you might have a toxic fallout on the first day of your colony or you might have a horde of man eating rabbits sent your way story while the game doesn t have a set linear story you rather feel the story for yourself maybe your best gunman loses an arm in a shootout and you have to send your cannon fodder colonists to retrieve him and hold off the enemy while your medic does what he can do get him back into the fray is it worth sacrificing lesser colonists just to save one of your best maybe one of your colonists goes on a psychopathic rage after a particularly scarring event and lashes out killing another colonist should she be put to death for this should she be locked away or exiled should she even be punished after all one of those raiders she killed in the shootout was her long lost sister mods one of the few games that i can thoroughly enjoy vanilla as much as i do modded although there are a wide range of mods available for the game you can get everything from minor convenience fixes to downright overhauls to put your game in the star wars or fallout universe developer attitude the dev of this game tynan is incredibly helpful and listens to the community you can find him on the rimworld subreddit participating and taking criticism and suggestions very well all in all i can t suggest this game enough the only potential downside i could see is if you have a tendency to rage quit games after setbacks in this case expect to be uninstalling and reinstalling rimworld quite often
