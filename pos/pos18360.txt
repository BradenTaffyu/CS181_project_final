2022 update 11 26 2023 everything still rings true the dedication of this development team is the stuff legends are forged with mostly forged into metallic objects that pop balloons full disclosure i started with bloons td1 that used to run on what is now an archaeological find known as adobe flash before continuing there is a cash shop in this game it is not very intrusive and is only there when accessing the daily challenges or if you go looking for it i have never once needed to purchase anything from this cash shop in my 440 hours of playing bloons td6 it is strictly for convenience and that s it you don t need to spend any additional money everything can be earned simply by playing the game and having fun with that out of the way if you were to dismiss bloons td6 as a game for kids i would not blame you it is the finest in cartoon silliness the game is filled with a multitude of monkeys using high powered dart throwing weaponry to pop deflate or otherwise protect their home from balloons or bloons as these apes call them from lasers to icicle spike throwers to literal catapults this game has it all and more in weaponry once you break through all this silliness in the presentation you will realize that higher level play actually requires strategy efficient methods to properly manage money generation minimal tower placement reselling already placed towers to quickly change builds counters for specific waves or countering bosses just to name a few it quickly goes from an fun distraction to a bit of a nerve wracking display of skill and planning couple this together with an absolute love from the developers to keep adding in more content new maps new heroes new towers new bosses new game modes new aesthetics to unlock etc it will be multiple hundreds of hours before you run out of stuff to work towards i should know i m still at 440 hours and climbing yes some of it can be more of the same but there is just enough variety and difference in maps that it has a lot to offer in terms of new ways to challenge yourself another advantage for those who are looking for an approachable and fairly easy game for their young kids to play this game definitely fits the bill easy enough to simply be fun on the lower difficulty modes and still offers rewards for your kiddos to unlock they ll be finding new ways to throw darts at bloons harder difficulties reward the kids with new monkeys they normally cannot afford to see on the lower difficulties which in turn might make them challenge themselves the game is rather brilliant in design for something that is just monkeys flinging sharp metal objects and air filled rubber balls there is online co op but from my limited experience most interactions are through predefined emotes to cut down on language barriers and introducing your 5 year old to george carlin this will not stop that one player from just sitting there and placing only farms and not sharing their money with you to just be a troll but that is just open internet co op these days you could in theory be that awesome parent that just plays with their kids though be awesome mom or dad there is only one form of competitive play that has recently released and it is fully pve competitions for high scores rather than pvp competitions against other players with all of this the beauty of bloons td6 is the fact that it can both be a fun distraction for when you just need some chill bloon popping fun in your life or an extremely technical display of your gaming knowledge often times on sale for less than 10 usd pick it up if you like tower defense games and need something to fill that void for both fun and challenging
