2022 i don t play this game myself just not my cup of tea so at the time of this review why do i have 240 hours on it well my 7 year old son plays it and has been playing it since he was 5 granted some of that time is just him leaving it running because the kid is just simply incapable of closing a program when he s done with it but he loves this game he s constantly setting up battles often requesting i come in and try to beat an army he made when they added unit creator he lost his mind he s probably created like 200 units of his own they re all ridiculously overpowered compared to normal units but he loves it and i love that he loves it if you re an adult you might get a few hours of fun out of the silliness of the game and then you ll be done with it if you have a kid that likes watching imaginary troops do battle and building their own troops with crazy powers and whatnot this is well worth the price of admission and the bonding time you ll have as a result
