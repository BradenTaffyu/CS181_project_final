2017 in an era when classic 4x and other strategy titles can be picked up for 5 i was stubbornly wary of parting with my cash caught between a mixed bag of reviews but then i had a beer and i made the leap being so cynical yet having enjoyed my time with this game so much i ve taken the time to write my own review which will hopefully help someone somewhere to make up their mind one day maybe who i am where i m coming from a nostalgic and tight fisted smac 1 head who pines after hard sci fi immersive storytelling and believable ai living stubbornly in the illusion that programming these things surely can t be that hard they re just being lazy i think low bandwidth natural selection 2 1 0 three hour epics were the high water mark of western civilisation or at the very least were damn good fun the short the summary buyers guide quick ish answer to the question should i fork out 30ish for this game right now in this economic climate and these end times where moments have never been so precious now there s a tortilla bashing maniac with his finger on the button in a word yes here s why i think what i think this game is an excellent and immersive strategy title that tells a story there is a strong role playing element and while an imagination is essential to making the most of your time playing it you ll still enjoy the game if you want to just switch off and burn every living thing in the galaxy or turn it into a pretty spreadsheet stellaris throws a seemingly endless narrative of events graphics and quirks your way and while it doesn t have the complexities of some of paradox s other titles this is a deep and engaging strategy experience but it isn t just a pretty space challenge it s also a lot of fun so much fun i haven t been tempted to hollow it out through min maxxing my way through it which given my robotic tendencies is possibly a first it also made me question why i continued playing so many other vaguely similar titles beyond the point at which they ceased being fun be a race of xenophobic space mushrooms purging the galaxy on an interstellar religious crusade be the fanatic scientists unlocking the secrets of creation to hasten the evolution of their species only to doom an entire galaxy with their hubris be the shrewd peace loving diplomats slowly manipulating their way into becoming an economic power house this is an immersive fun and complex enough strategy game that is more than worth it right now do get the leviathans expansion however essential reading stellaris feels like a gem to me a slightly polished gem too it has plenty of issues and room for improvement more on this in the long review but far from making me feel short changed i can see it has an exciting future the team are dedicated and work hard consistently producing beautiful things they are involved with the community responding to sensible feedback and requests as well as not so sensible feedback to say this is a perfect game is absurd and i m definitely guilty of looking back on my gaming past with rose tinted to the point of being deluded kaleidoscope goggles but if you like 4x or anything sci fi this is a no brainer if you re new to these concepts then this is a fantastic experience and suitable for anyone who s ever logged into a cod server with chat enabled and wished the sun would implode while there s still time to eradicate us permanently for an in depth long account that covers topics such as performance issues and what the game actually feels looks like see my lengthy diatribe through the link below
