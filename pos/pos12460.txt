2013 ooh what does that do curiosity core portal 2the goodthere are so many gamemodes and way to play the you won t be bored in the gamemode department the problem with this however is that if you have a favourite gamemode that isn t trboule in terrorist town ttt murder mystery darkrp roleplay or sandbox sandbox then the best of luck finding a local server also with the 198 000 items in the workshop to date it makes it the second biggest workshop on steam if you re looking for a particular thing such as charcter models skins then you have to sift through a lot of rubbish to find what you want the greatthe gmod community is huge approaching the likes of l4d2 portal 2 or even getting to the stage of team fortress 2 at least if it weren t ftp this means new servers new addons new workshop creations all new each day it is never the same game twice unless you choose it to be of course it is possible to mount games on gmod so long as they run on the source engine even so this means your content from the half life games source portal and l4d series team fortress 2 and many other games are all able to be mounted from the word go and arguably the best thing about gmod is the fact that you can do anything not like most realistic first person shooters which say hop on your bike you can go anywhere you like so long as it s in this general direction no if you can think of it then it can be made and yes there are some pretty crazy things out there but that makes it all the more fun the uglyif you have a favourite gamemode which is fairly unknown and obscure then there won t be very many people playing it if you can even connect to the servers also the amount of rubbish in the steam workshop is appauling to be clear they do no give a proper description of their item they make it unoriginal and generally trolly this raises another problem some of the greatest mods for it are lost in all of this but those are just nitpicks the worst thing about this in my opinion is the fact that you need assests from other games to play much of this game you will need couter strike source for ttt half life 2 episodes for darkrp and so on it feels like a newly released game has a glitch in it and the devs make you pay for the patch you can feel cheated and your wallet will feel lighter the verdictgmod by itself is about 10 us the pack that includes cs s is about 25 us if you would prefer not to have all the errors play ttt use player models from cs s then i would suggest getting the pack with both of them in it however if you are willing to save x amount of money by going and finding addons which will cover that that will work as well but it will take up more of your time similar games think of a game any game it s most likely been covered in garry s mod that s how expansive this is for more reviews check out
