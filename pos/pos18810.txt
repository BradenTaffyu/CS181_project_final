2016 good game bad dlc policy i mean the dlc policy kinda works if you bought the game on launch and buy every important non music and non unit pack dlc when it comes out then the hit to your wallet is not as severe but this and the game s overall complexity makes introducing it to new players 3 years from launch nigh impossible the game is still good enough for me to recommend it
