2019 ksp is a game that has been tarnished by bad practices from the game s publisher take two interactive over the past year the game has been review bombed following the revelation that ksp was collecting personal details such as purchases ip addresses zip code age gender and date of birth through playing the game now this seems like a very shady business practice right however perhaps it doesn t seem as bad when you realise that this data is collected on a voluntary basis not forced it says so in the privacy policy even then if you really don t trust them just do a simple 5 minute firewall fix for ksp it s not an online game and it won t change anything at all it seems unfair to me to review bomb a game due to the actions of it s publisher not the actual producer of the game itself one could probably argue that squad sold us out or whatever but that s up for debate in terms of gameplay the game itself is very stable and rarely i have had issues with running it performance is great and ksp is all around a well made game you can spend hours designing and launching missions to different planets build space stations in orbit build a space shuttle capable of reaching orbit or just spent time building stupid that explodes on the launchpad i would liken ksp to lego in that it is very open ended in terms of what you can do want to build a rover you can want to build a boat you can want to build an unmodded propeller plane or helicopter using wheels and control systems and take it to another planet you can and if that bores you there s tons of mods to choose from ranging from improved aerodynamics part packs to complete overhaul mods that changes the unmodded kerbol system into our solar system again it doesn t seem fair to review bomb a game based off of business practices of its publisher although i can see where the complaints are coming from without a doubt edit regarding the privacy policy many people have said that this isn t exclusive to ksp alone i did a bit of research and found out that other take two games include the same thing such as gta v and other rockstar games along with 2k games the types of information collected in connection with the activities listed above will vary depending on the activity the information we collect may include personal information such as your first and or last name e mail address phone number photo mailing address geolocation or payment information literally a copy and paste so again it s not squad itself doing this it s the publisher copy and pasting the same privacy policy for each one of their games and if you re really that concerned about them taking away your privacy that a firewall rule won t fix don t buy any of these games
