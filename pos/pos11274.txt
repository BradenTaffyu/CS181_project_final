2023 early access review alrighty so let me start off by saying that my 1 6 hours of playtime is not anywhere near enough to give a full detailed review i will be revisiting this post once i ve played 30 or more and i can give a much more detailed response this is more of a first impressions review first off my specs are mid tier at best hell my processor technically falls below the minimum setting requirements and my ram and graphics card only just meet them those are minimum settings btw honestly it s time to upgrade some parts that being said i am having a very hard time understanding why people are losing their minds over the performance of this game i ran it while recording content for a video for whatever that s worth i don t know that it makes a difference and got decent ish frames while running the game at mostly medium settings with some things like textures on epic it s absolutely playable is it perfect no the performance does have issues there s no doubting that i think a lot of this is massively overblown though or people need to take a long hard look at their settings in game and on their computers often times a second or third look usually reveals something the anger is understandable if you have and you re still getting serious issues that s fair if not remember that you have the almighty lord google to consult if you don t know all your system settings and how to mess with them again it does not run perfectly however it didn t stutter at all when i played it and ran consistently at 35 45 fps especially after i turned off anti aliasing and motion blur well i turned anti aliasing down to low but that s neither here nor there now that i got that out of the way let s talk about the game so far so good i hopped in spawned in and after getting used to the frames and tweaking settings the game is gorgeous it looks beautiful and i felt like i was back in 2016 or whatever year i bought ase and saw my first dinosaur patrolling the beach you know the one where you hear the jurassic park theme in your head watching it move around lol it s tough to recapture that magic but it did i was pleasantly surprised and the sunset is glorious also the hair and feathers actually look like hair and feathers i definitely note that as opposed to the atrocious looking fur from ase that s definitely worth nothing because hair and feathers are notoriously hard to model and animate the new ui needs a little bit of work but i like the look of it it definitely has a more cartoony look but that kinda works with ark anyways still needs some fine tuning character creation is improved though i wish it had a little more customization especially with the facial stuff let me adjust my damn nose lol the animations feel much smoother and both me and the creatures seem to interact with the world around them much more like things have real weight to them and when you move your arms it feels like you re putting your body into it instead of the stiffer animations from ase same with the creatures there s weight when they move and they actually connect with the terrain much better i have yet to see if the ai has been improved but i m excited to see it building system seems improved from what i ve played seems like you get more with less and it looks nice not perfect but nice hopefully there are more options to build crazy structures which i will then not use because i m not patient enough for that i will instead build the most efficient stone box in the universe lol so far so good not fantastic but i m enjoying it it has problems as people have mentioned though like i said i can t be objective because i haven t played the game enough so i will come back and edit this i hope my first impressions help someone out though
