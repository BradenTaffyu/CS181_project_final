2018 having played loads of the past civ games civ 5 included i think civ 6 is really very good to be honest i don t understand some of the hate civ 6 is not perfect but it had me hooked from the onset and has much to offer even seasoned players some of the complaints made against this game are fair expecially about rather poor performance but imo the good outweighs the bad and the new features are brilliant the ai is challenging and for me gameplay was as addictive if not more so than civ 5 i definitely recommend the rise and fall dlc it add a lot of depth to the game and i like the loyalty aspect for new players give this a go for existing civ players take the negative reviews with a pinch of salt and grab a copy if you see it on sale
