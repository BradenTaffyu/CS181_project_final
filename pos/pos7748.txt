2023 early access review beamng drive the physics of destructioni ve always been fascinated by physics so when i first heard about beamng drive i was immediately intrigued the idea of a game that simulated the physics of destruction in such detail was simply too good to pass up i was not disappointed beamng drive is a truly unique experience that allows you to experiment with physics in ways that are simply not possible in real life you can crash cars flip trucks and even build your own vehicles to see how they react to different forces one of the things i love most about beamng drive is the sense of realism the physics engine is incredibly detailed and it really feels like you re driving a real car the cars react to damage in a realistic way and it s always exciting to see how they ll perform in a crash another thing i love about beamng drive is the creativity the game is full of tools that allow you to customize your vehicles and create your own scenarios you can build your own race track create a demolition derby or even make a movie of course no game is perfect beamng drive can be a bit demanding on your computer and the graphics can be a bit dated but overall beamng drive is an amazing game that i highly recommend to anyone who loves physics or destruction
