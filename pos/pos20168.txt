i ve never bothered with wh40k before now i m a fan really enjoyable experience it s awesome being able to role play a benevolent and remarkably stupid ruler in a grimdark setting such as this one combat is very entertaining multitude of build options for your characters although let s be real bonus turns are king and make even the hardest encounters trivial i usually ran 3 officers and 1 main damage dealer oftentimes the fights ended before the second round started love act 3 i ve seen a lot of people complain about it and to my surprise it turned out to be my favorite part of the game but act 4 is my favorite one in pf wotr so take my opinions with a grain of salt played on steam deck and haven t encountered any major bugs the only notable issue i had to endure was with interaction prompts sometimes characters would run around in circles rather than interact with stuff oh and loading screens are a definitely too many of them other than that everything was really smooth they fixed most of the things people complained about 8 5 10 half a point off due to act 5 feeling a bit rushed omnissiah knows all comprehends all
