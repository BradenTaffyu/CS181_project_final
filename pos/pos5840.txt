2020 early access review as a mount blade veteran myself played the series a fair amount back in the day so was eager to see a remaster of the best game warband and bannerlord ticks just about every possible box i had very good update to the series and for me at least it s running about as expected for early access but thus far only had 2 very minor glitches that being once got trapped by a boulder before being bushwacked as the horse wouldnt rotate or back up and the other was a mini mission for a eloping couple that didnt trigger when showed up with the guy aside from that it s been great and bit of a learning curve as forgot how to play it pdid a 4 hour stream of my failings which was patch 1 03 although played more time on patch 1 04 before the review youtube video mount blade 2 bannerlord early access gameplay views 91 steam edition 3440x1440p 60 streamed at 28mb s graphics good texture work that shames some bigger titles models are for the most part good but buildings are some of the best i ve seen on a game the detail on everything is amazingly well done obviously character models fall below that standards set by the buildings but are still at very least on par with titles like kingdom come deliverance still waiting to see if a limb dismemberment mod arrives for better realism though sound about as expected the clearly conan the barbarian not the modern remake inspired theme song is fantastic and the backdrop music is good although could do with more tunes in the selection battle sounds are pretty good lots of atmosphere gameplay played warband then you know what to expect this is quite expanded with lots of new gameplay features combat feel much sharper and more responsive than the old series expect to die a lot if you slip defence until you pad thous skill trees up overall for me this is shaping up as possibly game of the year territory
