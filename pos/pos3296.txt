2020 an incredibly immersive adventure is what you will experience by playing this modern day classic crpg pros detailed beautiful visuals with awesome music creates the perfect atmosphere good dialogues but it should be a standard from this kinda genre deep gameplay mechanics offer flexible experience in and out combat high replayability value even tho you know 5 mins later you have to kill the npc you just met you can t help but admire the effort they have put into that npc overall writing is that good people who like role playing will love the immersiveness of the gamei beat the game on tactician so if i d try to nitpick here s what i could say about the game cons combat is all about crowd controlling if you are new to the genre and like to challenge yourself on harder difficulties it will take a little time for you to adjust to everything not exactly a complaint altho if you are observant throughout the game game sometimes gives you the tips you need and sometimes not so do not shy away from trying out stuff save scum all you want specially if it is your first playthrough i know it is a stretch but why do we get to switch sides so late but not sooner i hope they don t release another divinity game anytime soon so i can find the time to replay this genre frontrunner a few more times
