2017 early access review this game is great but i have my gripes since every review talks bout how fantastic it is and it is i ll tell you what i find lacking there should be more quests there needs to be a better system for tracking down the magical items and locations that you hear about in sultan histories the enchanted items that you find are usually kind of functionally worthless by the time you find them rusting an item happens too frequently and is too hard to remove currently repair doesn t seem to do much and there isn t always fixing spray npc s traders should have a repair function similar to identifying an artifact ego is way too powerful when it comes to merchants my dumb mutie shouldn t have to pay an entire skin of water for a water skin i d like to see more faction interaction i d like to see more base building you can do it currently animate walls then move them into position throw in two chairs a hookah and a chest character generation was fantastic but i would like for the option to build your own class or have more concrete class interactions in the world wardens should crack crimnal s skulls and get rewarded for it hearth children should have to protect homes from raiders overall the game is fantastic and nuanced i don t have any complaints is in early access and the dev is doing a great job the last update was awesome 90 chance that something on this list is already in the game and i didin t know it
