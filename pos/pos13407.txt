2016 i ve never written a review for a game on steam before but i m making an exception kerbal space program is a wonderful game hands down there have been problems underway this game takes a lot of time to get good at to understand how to do stuff from getting above atmosphere or your first orbit or landing on the m n every one of those are achievements and something to be proud of it is a game that is both challenging to get into and very satisfying when what you builds works as intended some explosions are okay i d recommend everyone who is looking for something new in their games to try this
