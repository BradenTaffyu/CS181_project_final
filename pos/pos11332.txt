2019 early access review my husband and i have been playing this game every night for the last three weeks it s like those early days of minecraft all over again this game has everything for the zombie fan the crafting obsessed the first person shooter enthusiast and the open world aficionado crafting and decorating houses crafting and driving vehicles coming up with more and more clever ways to kill zombies all of it is here the graphics are great and only occasionally marred by indie game buffoonery absolutely love this game would recommend to anyone looking to lose hours and hours of their life to zombie killing ruined world bliss
