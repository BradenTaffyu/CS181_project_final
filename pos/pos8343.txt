2019 i am not a big fan of city sims over all and have not played many however i do love steampunk and such things that is why i chose to give frostpunk a try if you do like steampunk and or other similar things as well as sims this is the game for you and i love it the style of the game the various missions with varied objectives and some tweaked restrictions and options makes it a whole lot of fun the game offers large variation in how hard you want to make the game to be from the initial difficulty level to the in game choices you want to make the non square building map layout and area of affects that buildings have give a new and more interesting twist to trying and build as a efficient society as possible the cinematics cutscenes are super good the style suits the game perfectly and the it gives the game a really fitting atmoshphere the voiceover is also amazing there are however a few things that i think are annoying not necessarily bad tho 1 some mechanics are a bit clunky and that makes it hard to effectivly manage a larger city 2 sometimes it feels like there should be more choice in what you are able to do when it comes to policy especially since the secondary choice of policy tree is quite shallow but gives very large effects finally this is not really a complaint but something i wish for more contentthe game is not bad as i have said above and does not lack replay capability but i am a guy who loves grinding missions the 3 optional scenarios are good but after you have beaten them twice or so it makes it less challenging you also want to explore more of the worl and the game what happened what will happen after the great winter are any of the societies you build sustainable etc shortly put i want more of this game they did provided an update with endless mode which is a good start but after you have maxed out the tech tree you can pretty much set it on auto pilot which is not really fun i hope this review helped some of you who read it good luck and wrap up well the cold is here
