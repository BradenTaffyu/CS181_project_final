2023 great game set the difficulty low and it s an excellent city builder with interesting production chains and things to do or play with vicious ai opponents and it s a strategic game of building up your military tech while finagling diplomacy and trying not to bankrupt yourself definitely worth it but it goes on sale often i suggest waiting for a sale and getting the complete edition with all dlc rather than buying just the base game at full price
