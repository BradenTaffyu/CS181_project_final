2021 i might get flak for this but this is for sure my favorite of the main 3 souls games the weapons bosses combat and movement are all miles above the previous generations but it still sticks to the horrid and depressing atmosphere that dark souls is known for it s a hard game for sure but there are very few times i ve felt the game was unfair ringed city pontiff sulyvahn and aldrich are by far the worst parts of this game in terms of difficult for the sake of it from my perspective and even then once you learn the patterns they become manageable i d seriously seriously recommend this especially if you re new to the souls games
