2016 i will compare this game with the other total war games i have played rome rome 2 and medieval 2 total war i will divide this review in 5 sections settlements battles diplomacy campaign and dlcs campaignin this game you aren t in europe africa or asia you are in the world of warhammer that has some northern lands forests and deserts you play as one of the 4 main factions 5 in you get the dlc empire dwarves orks vampires and chaos dlc as you progress through the campaign you can covince other factions of the same race to join you gaining all of their cities and armies you can also conquer them however you cannot occupy settlements of a different race after you grow strong enough an evil force will come from the north and their influence can be felt in the entire world that force is chaos they cannot occupy cities only destroy them spoiler for the warhammer books chaos is the confirmed winner they destroy the world diplomacythe diplomatic options are the same as in rome 2 total war you don t need an agent to travel to someone to start diplomacy you can do this through the diplomacy menu you can tell your allies where to attack when chaos invades all factions have a diplomatic bonus which makes you ally with the whole world to fight chaos settlementsthe public order system has been greatly simplified buildings technologies commandments editcts and agents increase public order while recent raids and enemy agents decrease public order instead of religion or culture we now have corruption vampiric and chaos playing as the vampires means you need vampiric corruption for your people to be happy while playing as any other faction means you need to avoid corruption if you have a lot of chaos corruption in a city a chaos army will appear and rebel against you the same goes for vampire coruption you can lower the corruption with technologies agents characters and buildings battlescombat was greatly changed there is no naval combat anymore only autoresolve and you can use spells if you have the right skills there is no dynamic weather or time of day anymore you can wait before the battle to get better winds of magic spells recharge faster if there is more wind you can equip your characters with weapons and armor and other buffs you can give banners to your troops you also have special quests battles you can start dlcsthere is only one dlc right now the chaos warriors you could have gotten them for free if you purchased the game in a week since it was released the chaos warriors are the major antagonists and are like the mongols in medieval 2 total war other you can rename everything in this game now generals heroes towns and even units customisation is greatly encouraged now since we also have a complex skill tree for each character you can even roleplay i ll give this game a 9 10 because they removed naval battles and you only have 4 factions
