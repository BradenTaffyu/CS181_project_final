2023 a rollercoaster ride of empiresrating 3 5 first things first let me just say that i didn t really intend to write a review for age of empires iv i mean seriously steam doesn t even offer the option for a mixed review but hey here i am defying the binary rating system because this game is like that unpredictable rollercoaster you re both excited and nervous to ride let s start with the positives age of empires iv manages to capture that nostalgic essence that fans of the series have been craving the historical accuracy and attention to detail in the architecture units and landscapes are truly commendable the campaign modes offer a rich journey through history making you feel like you re playing through pivotal moments rather than just engaging in virtual conquests furthermore the improved graphics are undeniably impressive the meticulously designed maps and vibrant environments are a visual treat pulling you deeper into the world building experience the soundtrack too adds a layer of immersion that s hard to ignore the epic compositions perfectly accompany your grand endeavors however as with any complex creation age of empires iv has its fair share of flaws that can t be ignored pathfinding issues persist leading to frustrating unit movements that can disrupt your strategic plans and let s not forget the ai which can oscillate between being a cunning adversary and an inexplicably oblivious foe often creating moments of both challenge and unintended comedy the multiplayer aspect while promising is still plagued by connectivity problems and occasional balancing issues it s a real shame when you re getting ready for an intense battle of wits with friends and find yourself staring at a loading screen for way too long speaking of battles the combat mechanics though enjoyable on the whole sometimes lack the precision that hardcore strategy enthusiasts might demand units occasionally act more like a horde than a disciplined army leading to chaotic and less strategic confrontations in conclusion age of empires iv is a mixed bag of triumphs and letdowns much like a box of assorted chocolates while i didn t intend to write this review the overall enjoyment i ve derived from the game compelled me to share my thoughts if you re a die hard fan of the series you ll likely find yourself forgiving its imperfections for the sheer joy of building empires and leading armies through history for newcomers however the learning curve might be steeper than expected and the occasional frustration could mar the experience so buckle up and brace yourself for an uneven but ultimately captivating journey through the ages
