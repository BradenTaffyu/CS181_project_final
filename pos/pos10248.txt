2016 early access review obviously i have become addicted to this game much like my entire colony s psychite addiction i managed to tame a male and a female panther now i have like 30 panthers trained to maul any raiders i also had about 30 cats which i had to sell to a trade group because they were eating all the raw meat my most profound moment tear to my eye was when the pet elephant was trained to haul items finally researched some serious stuff like making components and drilling for steel thats when it gets interesting the last raid about 10 dudes was completely obliterated by my new mortars it took me many tries and the learning curve was very steep but the last colony i built has been going strong for a long time key make sure you start making stone bricks and replace all your wooden structures because its just gonna burn down and put batteries inside enjoy
