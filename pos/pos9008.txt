2018 tl dr this game is so long but darn it i want to win oncewell let s see finally won my first game in 60 hours i had no expectations for this game going at it blind and 60 hours later it turns out to be rather compelling there s a lot of trial and error at first but once the general mechanics are mastered it was fun spawn with a little luck managed to get a slightly large empire rolling overlord scum vassalizes me great fallen empire awakens and throws everyone into its dominion so i bow to a new overlord who taxes now perfect finds out i have more independence than previous overlord so watch out previous scumlord revenge is coming for you everybody be fighting for independence and hey you do you i ll just sit still look pretty finally free since forever but look who decides to show the unbidden wipes out every fleet but mine fine fine i ll be the hero the remaining galaxy remembers they hate me and unites against me well i guess it s time to rise up and conquer the galaxy as the new supreme overlord would spawn again to conquer a new galaxyproblems sure there is here s a few sectors they hurt me mid game why just why what am i doing wrong several achievements didn t unlock even when i m sure to have done it ie beating the unbidden having 3 vassals end game lag pacifists get bullied and relies on unhelpful aiedit grammar
