2021 early access review is this a good game well yes at least with mods deep and retro style if you like such games like me game is still in ea after i think 8 years so don t expect a bug free game for new players i d recommend the following 1 you can t save the game manually the game saves automatically when you quit to menu or desktop there is a mod ministatpanel manual save which allows you to manually save the game single save file after each saving i suggest you go to the savegame folder userprofile zomboid and make a backup of the current save game folder this way if you die you can prevent starting all over again because the game will also save itself on death 2 the game is good with mods i use almost all beta41 mods and i think almost all of them are compatible no need to manage mod load order however i think when you add a mod midgame you ll have to start over again to make the new mod work game is a 8 10 for me hope the devs will put more work in it in the future because the concept is really worth it
