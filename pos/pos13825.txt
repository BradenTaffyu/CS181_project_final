2017 in my opinion this is one of the best realistic military shooters out there the graphics are alright for the game being relased in 2013 a big con is the price 30 usd for one of the dlc s out of 4 i reccomend this game if u have friends to play with and great communication skills also if you re new never get in the driver seat of a vehicle especially helicoptors and jets pros decent graphics realistic shooter 1 2 shots dead lots of gameplay community servers lots of diversity a blast with friends different gamemodes huge learning curve impossible to fly when new accurate military vehicles f a 181 black wasp ii to 201 shikra cons costs 30 usd for 1 out of 4 dlcs slow paced but thats if your on foot needs good computer specs barly makes it past 60fps pc specs ryzen 1500x amd gtx 1060 6gb zotac amp ga ax370 gaming k5 gigabyte 256 gb ssd samsung 1tb hardrive western digital 600 watt power supply thermaltake
