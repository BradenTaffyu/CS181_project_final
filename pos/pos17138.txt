2022 total war warhammer 2 is in my opinion the best total war game thus far and yes warhammer 3 is currently out but it s buggy and needs balancing from what i ve seen after my 500 hours i ve barely bought any dlc and i like the variety of approaches each faction and lord has i ve played around 5 total war games but there s just something amazingly shiny about fantasy warhammer total war it s well done i should note i do not play anything but mortal empires in this never even tried the other mode mortal empires requires the purchase of warhammer 1 as well as 2 it s a much bigger map that combines the 2 games in a more sandbox theme also when warhammer 3 gets better it s worth noting that dlc purchased carries over to the new immortal empires epic massive entire world if i m not mistaken feel free to comment and let me know 10 10
