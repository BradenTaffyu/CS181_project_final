2017 amazing game i suck at reviews but know that this game is a beautiful world personally to me feels very handcrafted instead of how alot of newer games tend to feel cut and pasted pros game design if you think through all situations and are willing to die a few times trying there are many different ways to complete any situation graphics my pc is not grand base alianware alpha i3 until i pay my house down and build my new pc this winter and i run this game at 1440p high graphics and around 30 fps never dipping below choice i truely feel like i have a say at some parts of this game hence i said someparts this is very clsoe to a pen and paper but does fall short as will all games every played with any type of ai it is just in the nature difficulty i know this has been a hot subject since alot of people are finding the game a little to difficult but it is my own opinion i play on tactition mode have 1 undead poly ranger 2 normal summoner lohse 3 normal rouge sibille 4 normal geo warfare beast and i find the enocunters to be very difficult but i really enjoy a true challenge as well as a challenge to know when i am out matched does not happen often for most games now a days with all the monsters leveling with you eg the elder scrolls online i do enjoy that game too balance while this is not a perfect positive i felt it worth noting no game can be perfectly balenced but i feel as though my build setup see note above is far from perfect and yet i play on the hardest normal difficulty and to me that is saying something i did not feel like i had to play a certain way to enjoy the harder fights now for some of the bad i did notice the number one thing i saw in this game that was missing it is most likely something small to most but enemys and other npcs have things on their body that is not in their inventory now i dont mind not having the armour and weapons i would feel like i would be overwelmed with over powered things that would make me feel to powerfull i dont enjoy that it gets boring i like the fight just to stay in the fight but if i could use my rouge to sneak and replace a healing potion with a poison bottle that would change the game for me allow me to steal things if i was tacticle about manuvering the land not to get caught that might hinder my teammates useless for fights i just feel like that would be the cherry atop the already iced and sprinkled cake difficulty i personally understand why alot of people dont like the way the game was made more difficult with it only being a stat buff to the enemys and a rather drastic one at that so i think there could be more difficulty modes and take the one good thing from ark survival evolved and add a slider for a custom difficulty this is supposed to mimic a pen and paper like dnd give the players the choice there are more pros and cons to this game but these were the ones i felt i would want to know about if i were trying to decide on buying this or not for me this game is a solid 10 10 there is room for improvment in any game but give credit where it is do this game deserves it it is rather a amazing title p s this is one of the maybe 4 7 games i have bought non steamsale i do not regret it at all and would very much recomend it to single player or multiplayer thank you for reading this far and i hope this review helped you make a decision ask any questions you guys may have and i will do my best to answer edit one more thing that i thought of that i personally feel should be fixed as far as combat goes i don t mind the stat buff or the enemy having shorter cool down for skills then you do with that said the game should not allow an enemy to have free range of sight what i mean is i have seen so many times that if i am in range but not within line of sight a enemy can hit you but not vice versa to me this is far from a game breaking bug but it is the only way i feel gimped in any true way cause i cant truly have all power over placing my troops since in some cases enemys could fire through that brush that i hid behind while shooting the other guy with that said it also does not happen that often
