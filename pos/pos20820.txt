2023 this game excels in world representation since wizarding world was an untapped diamond mine and i am happy to say that they managed to capture the atmosphere and everything else that goes with it incredibly well even though a lot of the elements are filler and copy paste content we can probably give a pass to avalanche software and portkey games since this will probably be their base development product from now on let s start breaking down the positives and the negatives positives hogwarts is spectacularly designed like it s supposed to a lot of the people know that it s an immense and maze like school and they captured this feeling pretty well there are a lot going on with little details here and there and representation feels like you ve never seen hogwarts like this before very well done and one of the key selling points of the game the world and particularly hogsmeade and the hamlets are amazingly designed that they make you wish like you were living there from the lighting to the design of the houses are done so well that they capture the coziness of the world easily combat is engaging in a way that you never expect i was pretty afraid of the combat combos and interactivity between the spells but in my opinion using the wand and engaging in combat is pretty well done that they made me go into combat willingly there are enough spells that you will need more skill slots like in mmos which would be spectacular since you feel the lack of slots sometimes they embellish spells with talent point upgrades which you can further develop and increase their effects fashion is something that you may spend pretty significant time because they nailed the looks as well you have different outfits robes gloves hats and face masks eyeglasses to choose from they re pretty expansive in options so you won t run out of any combinations it s good for people who want to rp and apply transmogrification to their appearance also there are slots enchants and upgrades of the items which you can execute through room of requirements and the items you collect from your beasts tougb you can buy the materials through vendors as well main side quests are wonderful there are people who you friend with and their life kind of becomes additional side content in the game and i should say that they are even better than the main plot wish there were more but still a good effort and i hope we can see the most of the game in this format if they ever develop sequels the game will not run out of content for a while i personally don t like this since they used the same stuff over and over but with the help of room of requirements where you can design your own rooms vivariums capture beasts and nurture them in those vivariums which pretty much turns the game into animal crossing so casual audience will definitely cherish other than these the content in the world is pretty much the same with camps treasure vaults crypts etc which are basically copy paste of each other they give the lore of wizarding world through revelio pages and i kind of liked it as it was refreshing for me since i was pretty much 9 years old when i first read the book and now mid 30s so you can imagine the loss of knowledge seeing the items content and then reading about them was pretty good at least for me there are 603 collectibles for people who like to chase so this is both a positive and negative aspect since they re too much and taking unnecessary time through copy paste content still a positive though since you at least spend your time in the beautiful world flying feels very good with a myriad of different options like brooms and beasts i would say that they should have developed the beasts to be faster and made the animation shorter so they become useable again because when you compare them to brooms they feel slow music is otherworldly they captured the tunes of the main harry potter saga and developed from it sometimes the violins kick or a full orchestra takes over it was a pleasure to listen and i already played the whole album couple of times through spotify and youtube graphics look good particularly the lighting when the time is right looks wonderful va is manageable some is very good and some is mediocre negatives main quest line and the antagonists didn t capture me they were shallow in game cinematics not cgis were kind of weird in a way that they either lacked the sound volume in necessary places or was underwhelming instead of the main 2 they could have gone in a different way and focus isidora felt kind of empty side quests are there just for the sake of being there some of them were still good i would say but generally they re forgettable side content is mostly copy paste there are 95 merlin trials which are nearly exact lots of enemy camps which plays the same treasure vaults that contains common items etc it plays like an ubisoft game in that regard and generally wastes your time itemization and the loot is horrible you go deep in a treasure vault or solve a riddle to get to some chest and all they contain is some weird glove which you found in level 5 or 56 gold endgame content doesn t exist at all and after some point you realize that chasing the chests are pointless vendors have no effect they re just there for you to sell your trash items which they can fill your inventory slots in the blink of an eye performance on my end with a hardware like i9 13900k rtx 4090 32gb 7400mhz ddr5 ram and pci e 4 0 ssd was abominable i turned on dlss 3 so that i can get more frames but the main problem is the stuttering fps wise i had no problem but when your games stutter like there s no tomorrow either in hogwarts or hogsmead which are the places you spend the most time it becomes unbearable they never solved it i generally liked what i experienced there could have been so many different ways they could take like respawn s jedi series and make it a linear single player experience since the audience is casual enough to accept it but they chose the open world formula which i think didn t work well because they lack content even though the map is full if you are a harry potter fan though there s no game or content apart from the movies that will make you feel the wizarding world which i think people were craving for a very very long time i do hope that they will learn from this and use the game as a base for their sequels because they passed the hard part and now can come up with extra flavors that will turn the game into another witcher 3 or red dead redemption 2
