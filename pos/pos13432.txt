2016 if you have even a remote interest in space and space travel buy this game seriously it s worth it there s a learning curve but when you learn how to play it s very satisfying and rewarding completing contracts and exploring the solar system there s a huge modding community as well so you can make the experience even better with realism overhaul real solar system to get as close to real life rocket ships as possible hundreds of other mods like spacex rockets and other real life rockets and engines and graphic improvement mods seriously this is one of the best games i ve ever played the development team squad is very active and transparent with the community
