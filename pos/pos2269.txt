2020 not going to lie to you this game had a rocky controversial launch from the refunds to the 3rd party support they hired to the duffel bags the moldy helmets for the console versions and worst of all the bethesda trademark bugs lots and lots of bugs a huge amount that was 2018 we re in 2020 now the wastelanders update is out players are coming back old and new i would say 80 90 of the controversial bugs on launch have been fixed no more t posing ai falling under the map party dsync no more pay to win items in the atomic shop atoms are given to you for free extremely generously i got a 10 dollar skin a few hours without even paying attention to the challenges that give them there s a battle pass now too completely free although you have to the option to pay money to boost yourself up in it like every battle pass that exists there s human npc s with dialogue choices this fallout mmo actually feels like a fallout game now an extremely friendly community there s a 2020 roadmap with even more content coming always something to do in this game i m not going to congratulate them however the game at the very least should have released in b e t a in this state fallout 76 in 2020 is playable now i wouldn t say this game is at a no man s sky level of comeback yet but it s really shaping up to be something now with the base game plus the new wastelanders campaign and soon the brotherhood of steel story steel dawn and fractured steel coming in fall and winter not only that but they are also going to be doing level re balancing that plagues most mmo s this game has a reputation stain due to the b e t a and launch and everything else above but bethesda didn t just take the money and ran they re delivering and i m excited to see what s next to come
