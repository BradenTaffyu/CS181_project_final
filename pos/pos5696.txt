2020 early access review procreation simulator when i got this game i was kind of disappointment with the development however i kept playing in hope that things would get better to my surprise i missed the whole point of the game later after my char got married i learned that mount and blade is actually a metaphor for procreation when i discovered this i had a blast creating babies all over the kingdom me and my bride would move from castle to castle leaving a trail of babies in our wake she would have one about every 5 10min and the funny thing is they never would age i m happy to say that now at 1000 babies i am ready to retire from my campaign hopefully when mb3 comes out i will have a greater supply of names i kind of gave up naming after 50 there are only so many way to use boo in a name quarantine no problem community created artwork for mount blade ii bannerlord by space hamster family this is what happens when boo is locked up in his castle all day
