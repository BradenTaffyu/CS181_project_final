2022 edit still only playing england played one game with ai with hre original review first of all i wanna say that i plan to write the complete review once i manage to put more playing hours into this game but i want to recommend it already because it s just that good through the years i played all of the aoe games aoe 1 was one of the first games i ever played on my first pc and i have such a loving memory sitting with my younger brother and watching my older cousin beating the campaign like it s nothing and then trying to repeat that it was brutally tough especially for a 6 years old kid later i ve put many hours in aoe2 and aoe3 and they were very good in my opinion but somehow aoe1 stayed in my heart the most now it s 2022 and i finally managed to get a good pc and buy the new aoe and let me tell you this all these comments on how aoe2 is better and you don t need to waste your money on iv is in my opinion the people who won t learn something new they just enjoy having the same old game always well everything in life evolves and so has aoe and this game is amazing just amazing is it enough to tell you that after 27 hours i only played with english civ and i barely learn the early and mid game and only against some civilizations or that when you load a civ that you haven t played you will have a feeling you are playing a completly other game also the campaigns are long and packed with unlockable content amazing documentaries on weapons castles and so on the community is also great as far i ve seen on 25th oct 2 more civ are released and i now feel a little bit anxious because i only managed to play with 1 out of 8 and the are releasing 2 more o but very excited for this will do a better review when i ve tried all of the civs and finished the campaigns but belive me if you are a rts fan want to feel like a real winner when you wipe the floor and conquer your opponent and really experience commanding armies on the battlefield i think there isn t better game than this wololo warriors ludilule
