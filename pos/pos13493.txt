2018 tl dr complex and difficult concepts packaged in a manner that are simple to understand difficult to master and endlessly challenging and a game that stops only where your own imagination ends highly recommended i hated maths at school i m not adept at physics either but boy oh boy do i love kerbal space program this is a game that packages the difficult the complex the seemingly impossible and presents it in an accesible and enjoyable fashion for plebs like me from knowing nothing about rocketry orbital mechanics or space exploration in general i can now with the utmost confidence fling my hapless kerbals out into the unknown and sometimes return them safely to kerbin and how did i get to this point hilariously explosive trial error hours of headscratching design after redesign challenge after challenge learning always learning of the 70 hours i ve spent playing this game i haven t felt there was as time where i wasn t learning or there wasn t a time where a new and more exciting challenge presented itself for me to takle the game keeps throwing these challenges at you and indeed you keep inventing them yourself as you become more confident as your mission profiles become more complex as you want to reach further and further out into space it started for me with simply reaching space then orbiting kerbin then to the mun and minmus landing on these planets exploring these planets then mastering orbital rendezvous and building satellites space planes sstos spacestations ground stations rovers asteriod interception the list is endless and what do you gain endless entertainment excitement and a real sense of achievement when something you ve planned for and executed comes off flawlessly or something you built makes it off the pad without exploding that s exciting too this game is what you make it sandbox mode for smashing parts together to see what happens when you hit the go switch this usually involves explosions or career science mode for directing your own space agency and its deidcated brave kerbals in its quest to explore the kerbol system this too usually involves a lot of explosions highly highly recommended
