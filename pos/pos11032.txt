after all the hype and the good will earned by the first cs title this game is a disappointment in is current state the bugs coupled with the lack of optimization at the time of this review has left me feeling a bit nervous for the future of this game however despite all the issues ahead if you have a computer that can run this game i highly recommend it the game is still tons of fun i find it hard to go back to cities 1 even with all its dlcs and mods without missing the quality of life updates made in the new version underneath the issues this game has the bones to be the greatest city builder ever made hopefully come 3 25 2024 with the promised patch more players will be able to experience the game and wash some of the bad taste of the launch out of their mouths
