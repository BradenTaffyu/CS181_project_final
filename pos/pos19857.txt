2020 it s amazing that this game i played 18 years ago is still as good and fun today even better so with the ultra graphics dlc which is free but is a few gbs big and all the new factions and features like auto reseeding farms one of the best rts games ever made still solid to this day blizzard should ve taken notes about aoe2 definitive edition when they made reforged this is how you make a 2 decade old game still feel fresh
