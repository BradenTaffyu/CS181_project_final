2020 stardew valley i can t review this game without mentioning a bit about my experience with it i met stardew valley through my boyfriend bless him 3he showed it to me as a mobile game it came in very sad times the worst year i could have i felt very sad and had problems with my bf a lot i don t want to mention the problems i had they bring me a lot of pain to this day i wish i could forget it i don t want to exaggerate but i felt my soul on the floor the cold and the dark days obviously i m not going to say that stardew valley saved me from that suffering but i admit that it made each one of those days much softer there were nights of those few nights that i could sleep with my boyfriend where each one played on their phones for hours side by side together we share stories achievements moments that i will not forget i enjoyed it a lot this game distracted me from the problems i couldn t handle at the time dedicating myself to having my farm and taking care of my animals made me feel a little less lonely personally i feel it more than just a game so stop giving pity almost 2 years have passed since i started my first stardew game currently we have a new farm with my baby both in our lives and in the game we try to improve day by day together just as stardew valley helped me in difficult times i hope it have also done it with someone else and i have no doubts about that it conveys a particular joy a feeling of calm and beyond the problems that each character can hide it has a remarkable innocence very deep stardew is probably one of the games that has the most value for me one of my favorites
