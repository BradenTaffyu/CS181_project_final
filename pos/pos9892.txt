2017 early access review well ain t such a bad spot for a colony after all i guess been here for a year and a half having enough food electricity even a bunch of nice houses an a little hospital place for me to work and take care of our people as you see three more joined us after we crash landed uhh weirdly enough one of those is the sister of my friend matt what s her face a yeah yoko then we got sullivan ugly poor guy ain t good for much but at least he s having fun sweeping the floors and then there s lynch that lady got by us because she was chased by some tribe folk i don t know what she did but those guys sure were mad at her well whatever she s got the aiming was a scout before she told us but no use getting much out of her anyway seems like she doesn t like man that much always giving us that nasty stink eye when she arrived she had constant terrible pain in her chest turned out she had lung cancer growing not good you gotta learn to deal with that but you also gotta learn to deal with those darn tribe idiots trying to raid our little home sweet home again an again that one time there were five guys with clubs and bows i don t know why they re still trying that but our rifles and pistols sure get the job done maybe my aim was a little off or something three of these savages survived so we pick them up off the ground pack them in our little prison cell and start the medical treatment because we re good folk we ain t killing for fun just because they re hostile and so on however that one poor boy only seventeen i believe matt made a fine swiss cheese out of him no way that boy s gonna make it i said but weirdly enough his chest was still ok i know you re not supposed to talk about stuff like that but whatever i mean one of our girls was in dire need of a new lung y know what i m saying nobody really liked the idea that s a given but nobody stopped me either when i prepared the surgery someone s gonna do the dirty work wilson i say to myself all the time and so i did surely enough a few days later lynch approached me because of that lung even if she doesn t like man everybody know s here that i m the doc and i know what i m doing and getting her a new healthy organ was my intention after all i m telling you it was like some frankensteins movie or something a storm outside thunder clapping as i prepared everything but i ain t some crazy scientist i got the job done clean as it gets seems like i have the hands for it ha when lynch awoke i never saw her smile like that that horrible pain she felt from that nasty cancer well it was gone of course surgery was a full success no problems at all wilson she said seems like you re not such a weirdo after all and we laughed everybody was relieved good hard times i m telling you well but whatever i m not really sure why i m telling you this right now sedation should ve hit you hard enough by now sullivan told me he has this weird itch in his gut sooo where did i put my knife based on true events that s rimworld for you
