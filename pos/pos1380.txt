2020 early access review set in real world cities in kentucky us project zomboid is a game you love to play for it s popular zombie horror genre and brilliant role playing character creation occupations but stay for the great features like crafting skill building weapon building and base fortifications to the 3am with no food water loot runs and all the deep lore you can get your hands on the map itself is essentially scale for scale multiple cities in kentucky muldraugh west point riverside which mean you ll be pretty far fetched to explore everything having put 80 hours into this game i can assure you i m nowhere near exploring anything close to 100 of this map i ve died many times and lost so much progress with new characters only to start up another save learn from my previous mistakes and get further than i ever have before i can say with confidence that this game is worth the few bucks i dare say it should cost way more than it does the game can be described both figuratively and literally as a perfect blend between minecraft s crafting and survival the sims use of character moodles while also surviving in a barren wasteland we know to be knox county kentucky
