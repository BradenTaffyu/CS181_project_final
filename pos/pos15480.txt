not accurate enough to be able to start working on cars but close enough that you ll begin to recognize components of a car in real life this taught me to become fascinated enough to look into repairs myself and they look way less scary after having done them in the game because all the parts aren t just metal plastic black boxes any more might have even inspired me enough to go to school to learn automotive repair i was never really a car guy but this game might have made me into one time will tell what i can tell you i find the game a zen like experience and i personally love the soundtrack
