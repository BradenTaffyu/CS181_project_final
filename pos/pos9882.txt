2017 early access review i had a well established colony i had 9 colonists equipped with sniper rifles assault riflles pump shotguns and kevlar vests and helmets then the unthinkable happened a maddened elephant started attacking my colonists i got the firing squad together elephant charged my colonists and managed to nail 2 of my lads before dying both incapacitated get them to the medical ward only to discover the bad news one had literally lost both feet due to the attack and the other his entire right leg decided that instead of two food draining incapacitated potatos laying in bed all day i would rather human beings that contribute to society decided to start operating and installing peg legs i tried twice on the man with no feet and both times only managed to stab the lad twice in the torso aswell as giving him a scratched ear no dice i tried twice on the man with one leg and both times only managed to stab the lad once in his good leg three times in the torso aswell as a bruised arm no dice decided to give it one more go to the man with no feet and he encounted minor problems during surgery which ultimately ended in his death death by being crushed in a medical ward with no furniture other than the bed on which he laid upon riddle me that gave the other guy a crack and he too died due to unforeseen complications would recommend to friends who want to experience the thrill of wild foot eating elephants
