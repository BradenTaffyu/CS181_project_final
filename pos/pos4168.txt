2021 i guess this is my go to game while i m high for some reason hence the hours it s wonderful i can only describe it as playing slay the spire on hardmode half the time i forget what cards and relics i have which means i m still on ascension 5 but every once in a while you pull off a build you can t understand and dominate the game inevitably you lose to the last boss quite often because you can t remember which order to play your cards in and you end turns with extra energy 11 10 would recommend for your money s worth
