2015 i m an iracing member since 2009 whoever is reading this i know what your biggest concern is you think iracing is too expensive but hear me out i subscribe on cristmas for 49 per year during this year there are 4 seasons in each season you can earn 10 by just participating in championships you also get 5 anniversary credits that leaves you at a price of 4 per year this might seem as squeezing pennies from you but it is done because the iracing system works better the more regular participation there is you might also need to buy a few tracks and cars but how is that different than paying 50 every year for the same f1 game from codemasters for example the only difference is codemasters charge you every year for the same crappy content while in iracing they release new content every 3 months and it is bloody awesome laser scanned tracks and cars it may not have the flashiest graphics effects but the laser scanning ensures that now you can feel every little bump and see every little detail of the track the cars are build with real life data and every single one of them feels different to drive and the content is not even the best part of iracing it is the one of a kind multiplayer system this is the only place where you can have close clean racing with random strangers the racing courtesy is close if not better than in league racing thanks to the safety rating and the protesting systems and while in league racing you can have a race each week in iracing there are races all the time and in all kinds of series oval open wheel gt vintage etc currently there are about 40 different series separated in 6 license levels rookie d c b a and pro everything in rookie license is free and comes with the basic subscription you don t need to worry about buying cars or tracks until you upgrade your license to upgrade it you need to be a safe driver i e not participate in many incidents each type of incident has a different weight going off track is worth 1 incident point losing control 2inc points heavy contact with a track object 2inc points heavy contact with another car 4inc points the light contact with cars and objects are worth 0 inc points every next license level has a steeper requirements for the amount of incidents you can score if this system is not enough to keep the races clean you can also protest any deliberate wrecking blocking or cheating to the racing steward who can give out punishments
