2016 alright there s alot of mixed and negative reviews on here so i figured i d go in and throw my hat for a positive review alot of the negative reviews are recent and are based on the call of the beastmen dlc or if you want to be less fancy beastmen race pack furthermore alot of them are critiquing a combination of things regarding that dlc and are pasting it on the main page well 20 bucks per race pack if that s ca s plan is extreme i ll grant them that and that s a discomfort but here s something i couldn t find anybody mentioning when i was skimming through the negative critiques the beastmen are freely showing up in the campaign as an ai race you only have to kick in if you want to play as them not against i feel if the dlc mentioned that it might help it retain some gravitas or resemblance of sanity in this comment section as i milled through it when it was in preorder and bought a copy of it for myself kicking myself for that a bit now as i didn t actually want to play the buggers i just wanted an extra threat to show up for later in the game but i digress what s good bad about this game good pretty lore accurate as far as i can tell depictions of most of the beasties and monsters in this game from this setting ai can now use cavalry light speedy assault units to actually go after squishies grand campaign is a managable conquer simulator which the modders in the workshop have enhanced to allow you to make it an unmanagable insane inventory filling abomination just like the old grand campaigns the combat s got alot of interesting questions to learn the answers to q can graveguard fight a giant a maybe each race plays differently from each other race in noticable ways beastmen have a pressure to always attack yes i did try out the 20 buck investmen greenskins can t really stop rebellions but don t really want to as it creates sweet free waaagh stacks vampire counts want to slowly invade the rest of the world corroding the morales of others into welcoming their new vampiric overlords imperials and dorfs play more or less like old total war with imperials having a special promotion system as their unique mechanic and dwarfs gaining quests for allies being harassed or themselves losing ground fights in battle it s a fantasy rts out of battle it s a fantasy turn based kinda grand strategy mabob with the grand strategy really devolving into who s your friend vs who s your enemy which direction you re going to war in next if they call stellaris grand strategy this is really more of the same in that respect both of which aren t exactly the most populated genres independently and getting both together is a bit light and ultimately the model designs are beautifully well crafted with the workshop letting you pimp them if you feel they re not quite glorious enough i m sure someone has had the same idea you ve had alright let s go to the bad well everyone s about the price point but honestly alot of games release with less features then this one does and offer the new features as mono dlc this doesn t offer the new features exclusively as dlc again people who kick in 60 get the same experience outside of what forces chaos can field and what races they can play personally as people who ve got all the dlc what it does do that personally kind of offends me is offer the new features without a great deal of bug testing i think the reason for this on the beastmen dlc was that they wanted to keep this game on people s radars and shelves but still i mean if they d waited a few more weeks maybe they could ve stopped their entire bug page on their forum from being repeats of beastmen buggy a few of which i ve experienced personally the game could use a pruning on bugs seriously the game s got quite a few problems still which is surprising because most of these i wouldn t have expected given this is sharing an engine with total war rome 2 i m fine with them because alot of these bugs aren t game breaking but if you were to jump back just a week a week and a half the game would occasionally have enemy armies be invisible until they were 50 meters out which is crippling for any artillery players although not so much for chaos yes yes i preordered the game or vampire counts my two main races the game tends to not have enough diversity in the late game frankly if you kill a race off it s gone and currently there s not really much possibility of anything showing up resulting in imperials needing to erase the ai vampire counts and since ai doesn t know how to play vampire counts that s a pretty easy task and the incoming chaos hordes and then they can kinda just sit there and resettle until they win meanwhile dwarfs once the greenskins are gone there s pretty much nothing for them to do but slowly confederate all the other dwarfs into their massive dwarf empire i was hoping beastmen would shake this up but honestly they have a pretty nasty tendency of dying really early in the campaign currently i don t know why the ai doesn t like using higher tier units i was really patient on a vampire counts hard game i didn t kill the actual human empire for a hundred and fifty turns their one high tier unit in their army was two squads of demigryph knights that was it i had half a dozen terrogheists split across 6 armies and the empire had two squads of demigryph knights if the game was actually simulating the ai s path i d be fine with this but the ai has infinite money to do what it needs to do and it has heroes that level every turn could we get some and i hate to say this just a little bit of cheating to make the ai match its lands maybe nuln has a tendency to have riflemen or a steam tank sitting waiting after the first 20 30 turns for example as is chances are you re only seeing the cool you can do and it s never really highlighting the other races as well as it could outside of quick battle where the ai kinda just grabs one of everything and as many many people have put they don t release full races which is discomforting because beastmen are missing three units chaos warriors can t tap into the power of the dark gods individually outside of the campaign map and even on the campaign map it s kinda lackluster and random whether the gods let you reach for them at all chaos warriors are a great i want to be a dark magic barbarian simulator not really all that good for the chaos part of it though vampire counts don t have everything for them yet they re missing strigoi ghoul kings and two engines imperials don t have all their mages blah blah blah would i reccomend this game absolutely the tl dr of the above is that this game s fun if you don t have the money to buy a race you want then seriously just wait for a sale for the thing to go down to 5 bucks dlc always gets hit the hardest in sales
