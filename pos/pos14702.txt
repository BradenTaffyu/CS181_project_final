2016 product received for free civ 6 is a great installment for the long running 4x series but even with the steps it takes forward to evolve its gameplay it also takes a few steps back this review is after 50 hours of game time full video youtube video sid meier s civilization vi logic review views 939 sid meier s civilization vi is a 4x in the long running civilization series review copy supplied free of charge game about the series logic review is a lets get the bad sorted and this is mostly contained to two areas that do impact the game quite a bit these are ai and the interface the ai is bad it makes illogical choices it uses it s resources badly and even on higher difficulties and with the cheating the ai does it still doesn t make sense on top of the cheating ai it also tries to keep up with tech by just skipping entire trees of research which is very frustrating when they are somehow landing on the moon without having done any of the research which also makes your spies quite a bit less useful secondly the ui is pretty sub par information is often hidden behind several screens and tabs and even explanations on certain features how do cities without amenities rebel game how in their quest to show us the damn pretty graphics and animations they have stripped important information away and in a game where every bit of information matters that is not cool i hope mods will fix this problem asap even if the developers don t as most of this information is available in the game in some form thankfully we do have mod support from day one and that s a good thing as i said there are 2 main drawbacks and those are it if you can deal with those this game is damn good the removal of global happiness for a multi faceted system is great and gives more local controls the addition of district is also a nice change and provides more choices to the player and information they have to weight in i even like the switch with the wonders taking up a physical tile and the builders having limited actions the one aspect i m still divided on is the tech tree as while i love the new civics system and government options i don t like that the tech tree feels quite dressed down due to the splitting into two segments overal i like the game quite a bit and find that the major issues are very annoying and frustrating but for me at least not game breaking
