2018 what i love about early access is that such people are doing it such as factorio will fulfill all your ocds this game will make you embrace them a survival game with a twist of psychology not only will your colonists learn how to cope with loss you too will have to learn that in survival games some will die even many and perhaps all and after tens of hours of playing it only the graves of those that passed will be your reminder of your early days you will truly understand the meaning of being an innocent summer child when that long heavy winter comes oh and it will come all over your face and every darn year what will you do in that winter well i ate one of my human prisoners in the first winter cooked of course because i am no savage and killed one of my pets the exploding ones leaving one of my colonists deeply saddened because she dared have emotions and bonded with that fuel producing crops eating animal do not despair however for you will have company every now and then some will be friendly traders who will sell high and buy low walking in on you in your sleep preventing you from killing yourself only for a little while longer but these are not the only visitors you will get raiders will come too and they will raid you hard all night but again do not despair for out of this disaster that will leave scars like literal scars on your colonists faces you will still harvest something out of it an organ or two if you re a good doctor and some psychological scars if you do that but there is always love and love rules them all well unless one of the colonists dies right after the wedding pushing the husband into years of depression that almost crippled him and rendered him almost useless where i considered ending his misery and to be honest mine once and for all but don t worry he moved on and met another colonist who then crushed his heart and refused his marriage proposal now i have learned my lesson and i am having him smoke weed only because it is cheaper what s that now weed is addictive can t be worse than depression now can it are you still here with me that means you will love this game as i do truly one of the best survival games ever like totally like literally i might be a teenage girl from california okeeeeeh we teenage girls from california enjoy survival games too you know like totally
