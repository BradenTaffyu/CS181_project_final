2020 early access review this is a review complementing the dedication of the dev team for this entire game and also to give insight on the foolish people criticizing taleworlds for bannerlord not being developed first of i want to say that taleworlds has been fantastic on the response by their team on fixing all sorts of issues and balancing the game in just a couple days of launch remember if you are playing start a new game to have the patches be implemented fully second i want to state that i am highly impressed and very thankful that they built an entire gaming engine from scratch just to create bannerlord it is important to note that is more than likely where most of the time went for the 8 years bannerlord was in production they created an entirely new engine just for bannerlord the modding capabilities that they have added to this new engine are terrific and allow for easy use so that we can have even greater mods than before look at kingdom of arda the current lotr mod in production not only all of that but they implemented multiplayer in a very effective way third thing i would like to state is the devs said the game would not be complete in a finished state for at least another year they have many things that are seen in the game but not implemented fully yet things such as voice acting kingdom diplomacy certain quests gang battles and etc much of this will be improved upon and delivered within the year this game is early access and no they did not spend 8 years on just making bannerlord much of the time was spent on making a brand new engine from the ground up however i see the potential in everything they are adding for bannerlord i love the multiplayer and the modding tools they made for the community are some of the best tools i have seen ever i can t wait to fight dwarves ents and cave trolls in the lotr mod currently being made
