early access review the dark souls no the wizardry of car sims what is wizardry and why is it relevant to this game for a sense of difficulty wizardry is one of the oldest rpgs in existence imagine having to play a dungeon crawler without a map you map it by hand with graph paper with obscure riddles to solve to puzzles and enemies do stupidly overpowered stuff it makes the soulsborne and megami tensei series say whoa old man aren t you going overboard and wizardry replies you kids and your so called difficulty back in my day monster mobs could one cycle you out the gate you took the game over and you rolled a new party there is little handholding and there are many ways things can go catastrophically wrong in wizardry the same goes with my summer car death is crushingly painful it s default is permadeath meaning if you die your progress is reset to square one even if permadeath is turned off death will still punish you you resurrect at the church your game is force saved you have to retrieve the vehicle you were driving with another one any damage your vehicle has sustained will be preserved and you ll have to pay for it down the line the suffering is the appeal this is a pro and a con they are one in the same if you don t like this then you will ragequit this game fast it took me over 60 5 hours to build my summer carthis was with a step by step guide keep in mind you still have to manage you bodily needs earn money pay bills pay for fuel manage your stress your sleep schedule and find time to build the car on top of it weekends are your best time to build the car shops are closed then and it s rally days driving cars in midday is dangerous on the weekend the first few days in msc will be hard as you only have 3000mk and most of your jobs are on a by call basis the tractor will be your friend for the majority of the early game heck figuring out the controls of the cars on my first day of playing took me several restarts just to figure it out it s that kind of game what happened when i tried to drive it for the the first two days i got it working i started it but then it stopped battery had drained really fast turns out that i didn t wire the regulator to the alternator something popped off as i was driving down the road it was the drive gear but i had secured the drive gear to the gearbox something popped off again restarting and checking out the engine holy crap i had forgotten to bolt up the halfshafts and the gear linkage drive gear fell off again turns out it was one stupid little bolt attached to the end that i missed it drives it actually drives and works take a leisurely drive down the road hoping to get groceries and have a drink at the bar to celebrate and of course my drunk cousin comes roaring around the worst corner on the road forces me off and causes my car to flip over thanks pena satan i actually made it to the store in time to gas up my car buy groceries celebrate at the bar play video poker for most of the night and then fell asleep inside of the cab bed of the sewage pump truck the next day i went to inspection found out there were brake issues emmissions were out of whack and forgot the warning triangle i lost my toolset between savesgetting late ingame so i decided it going home search the dump to look for the toolset to no avail came home to find out i had an enviromental fine for dumping sewage despite having dumped it at the waste treatment plant thunderstorm took out two fuses in quick succession either ragequit or forgot to save don t remember which looked around for toolset found it underneat the seat of the car went home repaid the fine thunderstorm didn t kill as many fuses this time yeah it s that kind of game everything horrible about this game is exactly why i love itdifficulty gives a sense of accomplishment i mean you could argue that s one of the main facets of life the accomplishment of living it easy games have their niche but it s not really satisfying to beat them my summer car is the hardest car sim game out there and it s why i like it
