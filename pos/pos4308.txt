2022 medieval childhood game this was one of my first games i fell in love with it in three different ways 1 when i was a kiddo medieval design won me over for the aesthetics of the game every day after my history classes i couldn t wait to get home and play and establish my own kingdom it was one of the few games my father played with me too 2 around my teenage years when i played it the strategy of building a balanced army and how to do ambushes and sieges the economy to maintain your army and improve your equipment and other things 3 the last time i played it the way you interact with npcs you can get into fights with nobles marry and run away with your spouse rescue the nobles interact with your unique followers with their own personalities change lords to your side with your persuasion and military prowess this kind of content being present in an old game like a very old game the graphics are really bad but i think it s amazing how they build a game this way when no one has done it something of this scale total war is more city manager in the old days also the add ons especially fire and sword i loved the gunpowder fights and fighting for my northern kingdom there p s don t get me wrong but you can fight with peasants so even being a villain in this game its ok and fun avaible uhsauhauhaushuauasahs with that said this is one of my favorite medieval franchises i can t wait to play bannerlord and enjoy the improvements pros economicsyour looks after the fightsowning a army and empiregood roleplaythe ost its relaxingcool armorssiege battles cons well its really old so i don t think it aged well so i wouldn t recommend it to people who cant enjoy old games mechanics because there s a gap in mechanics for newer generations some lords are snitchs and i wish i could kill them sadly you cant i really don t like using polearms its very bad to handle them in another hand axes are very good note 8 5 10
