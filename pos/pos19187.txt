2019 incredible the choice making and player freedom is unlike most modern rpg s as well as the other entries into the series high replay value and so much so discover explore and do in the mojave and vegas can t recommend this game enough and it s a steal at only 11 the only issues with this game is the slight lack of quests that ask morally gray questions and that once you have chosen a faction to side with the game becomes somewhat linear although still very enjoyable and interesting there are a few minor bugs that will cause the game to crash but that s par for the course when it comes to games published by bethesda despite it s flaws fallout new vegas is an amazing game that is well worth the money
