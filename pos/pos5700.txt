2021 early access review base game is very meh and not really worthwhile but with mods like realistic battle and diplomacy this game is massively better and turns from meh boring into incredible if you don t mind modding and or bought the game and lost interest get some mods and give it another try it might just provide you with hundreds of hours of amazing fun
