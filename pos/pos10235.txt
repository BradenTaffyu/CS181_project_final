2019 product received for free better than dwarf fortress imo i honestly rolled my eyes everytime i saw this game anywhere because i usually saw the typical raids with those cheesy op tower defense style trap setups that end in a killbox but honestly there is so much more to this game than that and it actually surprised me learning the game through trial and error is really fun and addicting and even when you start to get to used to everything the game will still put up enough of a challenge for even seasoned players with it s great random events that range from dropping 100 jugs of milk with cargo pods for you to throwing 20 raiders with molotov cocktails at you while you forgot to upgrade your outer walls from wood to granite honestly one of the best indie titles i have played in a while and it is still updated to this day by a single guy who pours his heart into this game thank you also thank you shade for gifting me this game your money sacrifice was not in vain
