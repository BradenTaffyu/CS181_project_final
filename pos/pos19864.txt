2019 aoe ii remaster no 2 electric wololopros improved qol updates awesome graphics animations new campaign civs improved combat sounds most noticeable in range units and siege weapons nostalgianitpicksremastered soundtrack sounds nice although i think they toned down the tracks too much that it somehow reduced its vibrancy i miss the old campaign narration but hey the new ones are fine also cons for now multiplayer games keeps disconnecting performance issues sound issues frame drops when intense fights are happening or when scrolling in and out of the map all in all i still recommend aoe 2 de hopefully we get performance patches soon now if you ll excuse me i still have to command a great army waiting for me outside cairo
