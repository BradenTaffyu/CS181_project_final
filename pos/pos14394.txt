2021 early access review if any part of you is a perfectionist then this is a game you will enjoy i have destroyed everything three times just to rebuild in a more efficient manner this game was developed by a small team of people who have created something with more originality and polish than some of the other triple a games that come out what makes this even better is it is still in early access and they recently crossed the half way point towards full build i am perfectly happy with the game as it is but excited to see whats next sure a few points of the game could use a little tlc like the monologue from the in game guide some of the things it says just don t sound right the accent is perfectly fine its completely understandable english but as someone who s first language is english my ear catches a few things here and there
