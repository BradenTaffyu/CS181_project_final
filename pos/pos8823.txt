2021 i ve been everything at this point i ve created utopia personified grand architectures of the combined might of thousands i ve wiped out the galaxy ended untold trillions of lives i ve burned cracked erased pacified and converted entire worlds i ve uncovered ancient mysteries and dead civilisations i ve fostered friendships and alliances federations that dominated the galaxy through cooperation i ve been destroyed by the hubris of resisting a steel tide been devoured by eldritch swarms and absorbed by ancient extradimensionals i ve seen stars collapse under the weight of a shared ambition and ideal and watched as the heavens are torn asunder by the gods themselves i ve put my iron boot to the neck of all xenos scum and made them sing praises to a corpse throne i ve sung the tones of the damned and collected all lifeforms to ascend into my image and my image alone i ve done unspeakable things in the name of profit i ve reshaped the galaxy through unseen and deft diplomatic hands enstated myself emperor and made all bow to my will i ve reshaped nations empires and fought blood drenched civil war against myself i have been a learned scholar i have been a fervent zealot of the shroud i have been a champion of the people and of freedom i have been the god emperor the one above all the autocrat and philosopher king i have been the oppressor and the puritan the blood court and the exterminator i have been the diplomat and the seeker of the spurned the creator of alliances i have been the crusader the unending tide of war and the admiral of an eternal fleet i have been the timorous oak the defender and developer of utopia i have been the confluence of thousands of minds and voices a devourer of worlds a parasite or a simple mind i have been the metal horde speaking in a chorus of binary tones and logic an exterminator of flesh a curator of the lesser and a twisted all encompassing matrix i have seen the end and i laughed for it held my image and the reflections of thousands of iterations before this one i ve been everything at this point
