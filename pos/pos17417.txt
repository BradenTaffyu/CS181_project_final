2019 first time playing a total war game this game is perfect for newcomers to this genre great mechanics you could spend endless hours building your empire and dealing with diplomacy hire nobles to work in the court all with their own benefits and when you die of old age or in a battle make sure you have a trustful heir that won t butcher your faction then there are the battle simulators you could spend endless hours fighting one battle with numerous strategic view points outnumbered use the forests to conceal your archers use flanking elements spear head formations and several defensive tactics there isn t one way to do things in this game it s quite incredible the relationship system is amazing to build strong bonds with another captain or general of a retinue of the same unit or become enemies all goes the same for all other factions to just love this game so far edit there currently is an annoying crash during late game in campaign to fix this i turned off ai turn movements and it seemed to have worked and the yellow turban rebellion is no longer crashing my game i m sure there will be a fix but this worked for me
