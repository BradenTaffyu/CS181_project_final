2020 probably the best strategy game i ve played since civ v though diplomacy leaves a lot to be desired i m genuinely surprised that creative assembly made every faction feel so unique and different from each other all of the factions except for maybe beastmen and chaos are really fun to play sadly it costs a lot of money to get every lord in this game but it s not necessary to purchase them unless you want to play as the lords since they ll be in your games regardless load times can be a pain in the butt too but that s computer dependant also ca please fix auto resolve this system sucks
