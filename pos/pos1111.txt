2023 early access review started over in west point found a nice place then made it into my own base went out scavenging for supplies and materials to fortify my base after done with the base i m getting bored went farming and fishing to kill some time got even more bored i have an idea a funny one so i went to some area in the map that has guns and ammunition in it only took the shotgun and tons of ammo for it set up everything then i went to louisville looking for some fun started the gun blasting on every zomboid i saw there everything s still under control until there were too many the amount of zomboid is too much for my deadass potato computer to handle most of the texture in the game became black fought a really hard battle especially in the dark magically survived with some luck for not running into the corner starts the body counts at least 1000 zomboid were killed during the battle 9 boxes of ammunition were used got on my vehicle time to go back to west point game crashed in honor of my potato computer which carried the whole thing before crashing the game i underestimated the game i went to louisville to find entertainment now i will definitely not going back there for the 2nd time1000 100 one of the best hardcore survival game
