2018 a rare case where the sequel is even better than the original put in over 100 hours on this game and loved nearly every minute of it if you love story driven rpgs where the world you roam gives you adventure at every turn this game is for you positives the myraid of ways you can build a character i opted for more of a warden route and enjoyed the freedom of veering outside of the confines of the usually locked in advancement systems found elsewhere the npcs and their contribution to nearly every scene as well as their own storylines i will admit i got a mod to allow me to take all of them along not so that the game would be easier but rather so i could experience all of their storylines in one playthrough i was not disappointed best character development i have seen in an rpg in a long long time how big and developed the world is nearly every corner has you encountering some mystery npc adventure or clue sometimes it can even be a little overwhelming but with time and effort you can start mapping out everything the combat system the built upon the previous one and improved its flaws in the original i would grenade and area effect arrow the hell out of everything sometimes allowed me to breeze through fights that should have required strategy this time out there isn t any overt easy tactics in quite a few fights you have to bring your strategy a game or die repeatedly negativessome of the puzzles got too clever for themselves and go well outside of the established routines of how to solve them while in some cases this worked well there are quite a few that gave you no starting reference point of how to even begin to solve them this can lead to quite a bit of frustration and then gets compounded with the occasional bug that pretty much leads to a roll back save to try a different approach just to avoid the bug endings big fan of anime here so i understand the idea of endings that aren t exactly clean but damn the one that takes care of the most things literally nullifies the entire purpose of the game i need some malady dlc in any event highly recommend this game one of the best i have ever played
