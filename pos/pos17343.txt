2020 wow this is different the economy is very small and funds are tight at the beginning capturing cities does not automatically give a large income boost armies are very expensive still over time cities grow and income with it the game uses reforms instead of technology but it works the same kingdoms get a new reform every 12 months or 5 turns the emphasis is on the characters more than the units i was surprised to see very few character skills that are for the economy and not the military things are slow here as well in the beginning if you get too many characters they will become bored and leave your kingdom unless they have a job thing is it takes many reforms to open more jobs and character upkeep is very expensive play style is slow with few battles early on and a lot of strategic planning and economy building battles play out just as well as most total war games you have your basic infantry cavalry and ranged which can include siege weaponry the overall feel and graphics for this game is unique for total war games i plan on playing more but for now this is a good game edit later in the game it is getting really hard total victory requires almost the entire map under control however all the units have many variances and that is really cool
