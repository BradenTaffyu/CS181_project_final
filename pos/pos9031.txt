2023 it is a really solid game which combines resource management military strategy macrosociology macroeconomics and cough cough politics all topped with science fiction and fantasy sauce along with shredded cheese of philosophical and ethical dilemmas the writing of this game is superb the mechanics of this game make ai governors behave in a believable and human way i literally got insulted by an ai enemy governor after i conquered one of his star systems in retaliation for him declaring war to me it felt very human very natural steaming hot delicious hearty wholesome very spicy though with salty and bitter notes but i wouldn t have it any other way the interface isn t overly complicated and can be easily learned in a couple minutes allowing you to get into actual management really swiftly micromanagement isn t necessary you can delegate your local government officials to do just that as it happens in real life duh but you can totally engage in that if you want to maximize the efficiency or cope with your urge to control everything the devs still continue to update this game years after release it has many dlcs but each one is also supplemented with a free update which gives the base game an extra flavour which is a sort of an aparatiff to the dlc some dlcs are obviously better than others it isn t necessary to buy all of them to enjoy this game my personal recommendation for your first three dlcs is utopia synthetic dawn and ancient relics but you can look at them yourself recently a co op mode started being implemented it is already playable albeit still in beta is this game perfect no is it the best rts out there i don t know i love it though and i highly appreciate the effort paradox puts into nourishing it as well as their players they could easily get away with not doing it and yet they still do they simply love this game as much as i do they are dedicated to educating their players about government management they must be really fun people to be around you are guaranteed to find new content here when you return to this game after a months long hiatus without having to pay a dime which truth be told the devs totally deserve it is a game which can be easily played by multiple generations and which has the potential to outlive me toss a coin to your loper oh valley of plenty
