2021 there are so many curator reviews and they talk about it perfectly but i thought i d add my lil two cents after four years haha life is strange is the only game i ve been able to play over and over again i ve played it maybe 6 times first off the atmosphere is one of my favourite things about this game despite all the craziness and heavy themes in this game it never fails to make me feel so calm and at peace it s a mix between the environment music and hannah telle s voice of the main protagonist max voice i think while i m not a pro gamer i found it marvellous to see a game that isn t a horror game touch on heavy issues such as depression bullying abuse suicide and drugs whilst also being lgbt friendly i used to be pretty oblivious to my surroundings which would make me relatively inconsiderate of others and this game taught me that even the smallest things have consequences and even though you might have the ability to run from your problems in the end you re just going to have to face them and accept them and try your best to move forward and support others it s a really emotional game that still hits really heavy even years later i also love how the game is very photography based just a little personal favourite thing that i love about it a lot of people say that the dialogue sounds really cringey and unnatural i guess that s true but it was personally one of the things i loved about the game too the funky script really stuck with me the greatest downside was the animation the lip syncing is pretty bad but i think the incredible voice acting and atmosphere make up for it the time travelling concept and story was pretty brain challenging for me too so it kept my mind busy haha i may be a little biased because i m very attached to this game but i d definitely recommend anyone to play it as long as you re fine with heavy themes like the ones i mentioned above and after you play the game i d definitely recommend reading the comics by emma vieceli they re beautiful and expand on the lore in such a marvellous way i also love how every game in the lis franchise incorporates lgbt characters if you re queer i d say this game is a must have lis polaphoto
