2017 bought this game expecting a fun fantasy game for my graduation summer wish i knew at the time what i had signed up for because as soon as i played it i grew a mustache and a beard a scar formed over my right eye and my muscle mass increased by about 1000 i was born a female i regularly have flashbacks to the invasions i partook in and the invasions staged against me i have as many confirmed kills as a navy seal irl i live near a bunch of farms so i stole a scythe from a neighbor and tried to dance about the town killing people i was arrested before i could go through with it all out of five i give this three stars the reason for the minus two is because my breasts were really nice before this game changed me
