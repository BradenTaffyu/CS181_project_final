2022 hearts of iron 4 is a difficult game to review presented as the ultimate ww2 grand strategy game the game in many ways falls short of sticking to its theme hoi4 has build its event system around focus trees that tend to devolve the world into a chaotic alternate reality where plausibility is thrown out of the window the designers have added ship plane and tank designers that the game s ai has trouble handling and often tend to favour ahistorical sometimes downright silly designs logistics are not as constraining as they should be as it s relatively easy to quickly build ports and railroads removing many of the historical constraints around theatres that were defined by logistics the game also has many legacy features open issues and ai difficulties that make it a prime candidate for a stellaris style custodian initiative and yet yet this may very well be the most interesting addicting and satisfying strategy game ever created the core flow of the game can be described as building up an army for a war that you are never quite prepared for and spending that war working around every compromise you ever made you often hear strategy games described as consisting of a number of interesting choices and no game pulls that of as well as hearts of iron 4 in the build up phase you work against the constraints of industry policy and politics as you try to build up forces sufficient to carry out the strategy you ve decided upon whilst simultaneously trying to ascertain the strategy of your opponents and attempting to hide yours from the enemy the early game consists of an interesting tug of war where democracies who are the most powerful faction in the long run are constrained by a population that is unwilling to go to war and have to work around various debuffs that are reduced by an increasing world tension mechanic their opponents meanwhile are free to act build and annex to their liking however the more aggressive they are the more they will increase the world tension thus empowering their opponents all of these mechanics lead to a frantic race against time where all players have to a hundred things but only have enough time and resources to do 50 of them well to most people this will probably sound stressful but anyone who likes strategy it will feels like an endless stream of interesting just one more decisions and dilemmas as you attempt to carry out your plan to the best of your abilities when war finally breaks out you are presented with one of the most interesting strategic puzzles that you can get in the entire world of video games you have to manage your own logistics whilst trying to destroy those of the enemy you will have to maintain your industry and production lines whilst trying to bomb those of your enemy into oblivion air land and sea are all present and there is no single winning strategy for any of them as daunting as this all may sound the game does a great job of automating and assisting with many aspects of the actual gameplay most of the time when you click on a button you are doing it to make an interesting decision not fighting the interface looking at you the rest of the wargame genre unlike paradox its other games matches are short and are often decided in a few years this not only means that the game if very replayable as the barrier to restart and try again with a different strategy is very low but it also means that this game is uniquely suited to competitive multiplayer as the large and growing esport community that surrounds this game can attest to so having arrived at the end of this wall of text what is my actual verdict on this game tldr best ww2 game no not even close one of the best strategy games you can play on a computer yes very much so
