2017 well that was unexpected i m not really a car person i have zero interest in trucks and never considered driving a big rig in real life the prospect of maneuvering the things would stress the hell out of me driving games never appealed to me this is the first driving game i ve ever purchased and i ve been a gamer for 30 years so this was the last game i ever expected to like the only thing that gave me a glimmering that i might like something like this was trading in elite dangerous but even then i passed it over as it went on sale again and again i mostly heard about euro truck simulator 2 not ats the only reason i picked it up is because i enjoy driving and i heard it was a pretty chill and relaxing game i figured it might be good for when i just want to zone out or listen to music podcasts or audio books while playing something it turns out to be a lot more fun than i expected it isn t tagged as an rpg but it has rpg elements you gain levels and put points into skills that unlock more types of deliveries you can make such as various hazardous materials and delicate goods increase your income per job and boost your fuel economy beyond that you can buy a truck upgrade it buy garages more trucks and hire drivers to drive those trucks in your business when you have drivers working for you you can direct how they upgrade their skills currently there are 4 trucks you can buy peterbilt 389 and 579 kenworth w900 and t680 more are supposedly on the way when licensing with manufacturers is worked out but in the meanwhile more trucks are available from mods there are a good number of mods available quite a few more than are listed on steam workshop the base game world has 3 states california nevada and arizona free dlc there are also mods that add to this though i haven t tried them yet a long delivery in the base game will be about 1000 miles with a scale of 1 20 the last journey i did of that length from tucson to redding took 1h 5m to complete in real time driving the speed limit kept the timer running when paused and planning where to rest and get gas but didn t include the time to park as that would vary more according to the player i thought that i would want longer trips and would still like more states for the option of going on longer journeys but when making 800 to 1000 mile deliveries i never thought to myself this feels too short downsides i don t mind these but others might only 4 vehicles and 3 states money seems too easy to come by when you take out a loan you can pay it off early without paying interest or penalties and a single job can pay over 80 000 when you have all your skills upgraded this can make money trivial later to avoid this i use a hard economy mod so that jobs pay about 1 10 that the ai of other drivers can be flakey and sometimes while making turns you can get boxed into a bad position with other cars in real life you could communicate with other drivers to go around but in the game they just sit honking at you to get around this without collisions you can save and reload all cars around you vanish on loading a saved game or use a console command to make cars vanish i use a 360 controller and found myself wanting two things a steering indicator when in external view to show the position of your wheels when there is no lighting the option for both the mouse and the controller to steer the controller stick turns your steering wheel at a constant rate and there are times i wish that i could switch to the mouse to turn more quickly overall this game was a big surprise and can see myself sinking many more hours into it
