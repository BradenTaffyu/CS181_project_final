2023 this is my favorite colony sim game the game mechanics start extremely simple and it tells you how to use them in the early stages and then it gradually gets more complex to the point where you ll want to play around in sandbox mode to figure out the more advanced mechanics or just watch youtube videos made by other people who already have if you re lazy there s a vibrant community on reddit steam and klei forums exchanging designs but it s also fun to just figure things out on your own the automation system is turing complete but you don t need to get particularly fancy to get far in the game unless you want everything to run fully automated with no interaction on your part the art and animation range from cute to hilarious and sometimes i find it rather soothing just watching everything go once i ve set everything up i ve gotten my 9 year old into it too and he s enjoying it as well if you want to get it for a kid that age you ll need to help them a bit figurng everything out but it s a fun experience to share with your kid i ve played this game for hundreds of hours and i ll probably play it for hundreds more
