2014 early access review here s my updated review posted april 6th 2015my first review was quite positive and guess what it s still positive perhaps even more so than before i have played every release since the very first one before this game ever hit steam so i ve really had a chance to see this game grow and it sure as hell is growing let s keep this short and sweet pros a very solid voxel game imo great graphics for a voxel game good sound good controls good gameplay crafting looting building mining it s all very nice beautiful randomly generated worlds complete with ruined towns and even cities wonderful smooth voxel terrain as functional as that of minecraft but much prettier pretty damn polished for an alpha like really great development team these guys are serious skilled and well funded cons it s an alpha so there s still some small glitches but honestly i haven t experienced any glitches in a long time not enough different kinds of zombies i m sure they re gonna add more though doesn t work well on computers oh well not a problem for me p building with certain materials has become a bit cumbersome and overdone it s still ok though it s built on unity i just hate unity but these guys have pulled it off so well i didn t even know this game was made with unity until like a month ago lol things i really wanna see added more freakin zombies gettin tired of seeing that same fat bastard with his ugly ass hawaian shirt full controller support i would pay 20 for this feature alone vehicles i know they re coming soon i m just impatient ps i have seen several video s lately bashing early access games and rightly so there is a lot of out there on ea however i keep seeing 7 days to die kinda toted in the background and grouped in with all those never finished ea games which i think is an absolute travesty the fun pimps have proven themselves several times and i think they ve earned a little freakin grace on our parts hell even if they never release another update i d still say this is a great game easily worth the 25ish bucks they ask for it as is it even puts some finished games to shame cough starforge pwell that wasn t short and sweet at all rather long and rambling oh well
