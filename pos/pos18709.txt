2020 as someone who loves maps and mapping this game is an absolute favourite of mine the beauty of this game lies in the fact that you can start of at any place on earth and form any every nation in existence from 1444 to 1900s and not only do you get the freedom of choosing the country you want to play you also have the choice to have your own win conditions and your own play style this game gives you options to customize your nation in every way possible 1 want to play as an european nation competing with others in europe for colonization done2 want to play as the holy roman empire and see how it would feel if you kept it alive till the 1900s done3 want to unite all the japanese clans and form japan and start colonizing california before the europeans arrive done4 or lets get a more aggressive want to unite the aztec and mayan empires and crush the europeans who land on the american soil done5 want to play as the battle pope conquering vast lands in the name of christianity done6 want to play as india and throw out the islamic and european invaders go on and colonize australia done7 want to rekindle the lost empires of vinland malaya manchuria roman empire and every other empire you know of doneyour imagination is your limit this game works smoothly in multiplayer too so get your friends together and rewrite history also be sure to activate all dlcs by any means possible to get the full expeirence i know the dlc policy isnt optimal but true gamers will find a way
