2016 i spent three years building up hype and i was still blown away if you enjoyed harvest moon rune factory or animal crossing then get this it captures all the same things that made those games great and it s the perfect game to play either casually or seriously there are so many different ways to earn money and they re all developed and fun the hardest part is choosing which one to spend your time doing the progression curve in the game is fantastic too every day you ll feel like you re making progress but there s still always something to work towards and you won t beat it after a couple of hours earning as much money as possible as there s always something to spend your money on even after 20 hours of playing i feel like i m nowhere near the endgame and i could easily see myself playing through again and doing things differently i m even doing a playthrough on youtube and the progress feels dramatically different even in its early stages i m easily disappointed by games so you can imagine my surprise when i was so impressed by a game made by one person congratulations concernedape you ve made one of the best games i ve ever played
