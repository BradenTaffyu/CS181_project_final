2023 i think most of the negative reviews of the game are correct the games lacks something that warband has soul bannerlord can feel empty sometimes even when it has so much more stuff than warband there are so many characters lords merchants gang leaders mercenaries that it s hard to make a connection with them hell characters are born as the game progresses and some names are repeated is that realistic yes you probably know more than one john steve or whatever but it can be confusing for the player and it makes it difficult to connect to other characters in warband there is only one lord haringoth for example and you can roleplay being his friend or mortal enemy you see his name on the battlefield or even in the event log and you can feel something about it in bannerlord you will not care about the event log because most of the names that appear there are irrelevant for you even if the names of characters you know appear there it goes so fast with so many names and things happening and to make it worse you can t open a event log menu like in warband if you enter another menu the log in the campaign screen just clears itself losing all the log that s only one thing that one can consider bad about the game there are many more that you will notice if you look closely or if you play the game long enough things that bannerlord just does different than warband and others just bad things plain and simple the game has a workshop and you can download ton of mods but my two cents about it 1 when the game updates it breaks many mods you can roll back to the previous update but it s still a pain in the ass if you don t like to manually do stuff 2 although mods are a good thing the devs should fix the vanilla game problems and keep adding stuff the destiny of the game should not be put on the shoulders of the modding community why the possitive review because it still is a good game it is fun it is engaging it is a game you will spend more than 100 hours and for me that s worth the money the problem is that many of us come from warband and we cannot not compare them and that s when you can find stuff you may not like i m playing the singleplayer campaign full vanilla not one single mod and i m having fun i put aside my previous expectations for the game and take it for what it is i have more than 900 hours in warband in steam and so much more in my jack sparrow days so i know the pain many people feel and i know that the game could be so much more and it just didn t live up to the expectations we all had but the game is still worth it it will keep getting updates and many more mods will appear if you take bannerlord for what it is you will play the game more hours than what you payed for
