2016 if you have played harvest moon games and really loved them you probably already know about stardew valley but if you don t i strictly recommend you to buy it this game is made with passion i was lucky enough to win an early copy and the game is really smooth you may encounter one or two bugs in the first 12 hours of gaming but if you send them to the sole developer he will surely address them he really made this game with all his dedication and love for about 4 years it is a feat acomplished by few guys today the game has a charming story and characters so far lots of activities collectables you can harvest plenty of crops have different animals fish lots of different water creatures and the game has the right dificult to accomplish things making you happy at every time you are able to upgrade your tools build a new barn etc the game has some combat in it giving some flavour of rpg it will sure make you smile and have good sensations that lot of the games lack today it is totally worth the price for the ammount of time of gaming you have i ve played more than 8 hours and i barelly scratched the surface of this game is it is garanteed to have lots of updates cause concernedape loves what he does a strong candidate to best indie game of the year
