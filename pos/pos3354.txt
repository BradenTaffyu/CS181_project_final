2017 paid some pimp in a tavern a 100 gold for a prostitude went up to the prostitude and had a long good talk about how she should actually be paying me for it then said now that we have established who is the most desireable here i will take my leave she got mad and said i couldn t get a refund little did she know that i already had stolen my money back from her pimp 10 10 would steal from pimps and with prostitudes again but in all honesty the game is great the story is much easier to follow now that it is voice acted in my personal opinion upon reaching reaper s coast i have experianced some slight problems with perfomance but other than that the game has been going smoothly the turn based combat gets spiced up by the ground effects you can either make great use of those mechanics or they can be your doom saving before battle is recommended when combat gets challenging there is no shame in reloading a save to come up with new strategies to defeat your foe running from combat might also be the smartest move in some situations the origin characters give a nice dynamic to the singleplayer game having them in your party leads to some memorable events between you and them when you interract with an npc they have interrest in they will let you know you can either allow them to do their buisness or keep them away this will lead to you bonding with that character if they do something you do not like you can often have a talk about it afterwards the music in the game is pretty good but sometimes there is some mishaps where a piece of music that is out place plays nothing gamebreaking but you can lose a bit of your immersion you are able to pick 1 of 4 instruments when you make a character you will hear these instruments being played in the level up music and etc persuasion checks have been a little confusing for me sometimes when i believe i definantly should be able to pass the skill check for an option i fail and other times where i think i should have failed i passed no idea if it is randomized or how it works
