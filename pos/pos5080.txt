2016 a sweet bitter game so i finished fallout 4 main quest here is my feeling without any spoiler read safe my friends well the game was really really good in my opinion yes the skill tree is disturbing at first you can overcome that anyway yes the passive skills are like gone but the books you can find in the wasteland are here to handle that in the end focus on the good things like the new crafting system you really can customize your own weapons find better ones take mods out of it and put it back on yours crazy the legendary items are cool and they do not denature the game experience there are legendary ennemies too yo b tch it s time to show your balls of steel hey hey hey calm down now enjoy the trip on the feel train the universe of fallout 4 is rich you have a lot of different ennemies depending on the area you re discovering interesting stories to read in the computers improvised look alike camps where raiders civilians of gouls are hanging out there are even incredibly awesome radioactive storms beating the sh t out of you everything is making you feel like you re in da real god am f ckin post apocalyptic world you all deserve yes i m talking to you you decrepiting deathclaw put down that rock now but because there s always a but the last part of the story is a bit disappointing there is not really any reason to join one group or another nothing really transcendent maybe because the dialogues are over simplified i mean when you play a rpg with different factions struggling for victory and trying to enforce their ways of life and ways of thinking you must find one where you feel like you perfectly fit a place where you re like hold on i m gonna force my way in this tribe s government and become the boss of all these peasents out here or at least you can fight your way like a lone wolf but not here not really ok i only tried one ending but really the game scr wed me on that point i thought i was doing the things i wanted to but hey in fact i wasn t the goals of the faction i ve chosen were not really clear and even when i was able to make a choice it had litterally zero effect it litterally no wait figuratively ted mosby here thanks mate blew my mind so i have only one question why the h ck i would have been happy anyway if the ending was good but it disappointed me too still no spoiler i promised this is just how i feel about it what am i gonna do now i will try some other endings the good point is that if you ve been farming a little bit you can rush the end of the game without big problems even if you p ss off the tough guys no i m not talking about you stinky gouls well you re pretty agile for a zombi my advice is play fallout 4 if you liked fallout 3 and fallout new vegas but do not have too much expectations concerning the conclusion i enjoyed new vegas more than fallout 4 when i think about the end new vegas had its defaults anyway but i miss the karma system for example that was a cool feature the strength of fallout 4 is the immersion like in every fallout game if you re able to sit comfortably on your chair and set your mind on apocalypse mod you will fre kin enjoy the game i savored my trip in the wasteland until its end but it was a bitter sweet one in this first attempt i hope my second choice because it was hard to choose anyway will be the one i was looking for really fallout 4 is a very good game but why this ending is that hard to handle to me
