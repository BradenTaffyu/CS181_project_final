2019 early access review this game is a bastard it s very difficult to get a situation going in the game that is sustainable where you could just put the game on max speed and walk away it s a constant struggle to try and anticipate what the next issue is going to be eventually you ll decide to take the easy way out of some particular problem and 30 cycles later that is why everything is falling apart you run out of algea for oxygen so start using up your water your water pumps take too much power so you switch to coal your coal makes too much co2 so you use a carbon skim using up more wateryour skimmers use up too much power so you make another coal generator you clean water to get more that uses more power you re running out of coal now so you start to rely on the hydrogen from the oxygen from the water you re low on water so you try and purify more especially because its hard to get clean water the game is a constant balance of that fixes the first problem and makes another one you will likely die as you discover each of these steps or things will get pretty ugly all of this is done in such a way that it still manages to be fun every failure is your own fault your own lack of foresight there are very few mechanics that feel cheap it s all right there from the beginning plants cant live in co2 co2 is heavier than air why did you put your farm at the bottom of your base if you don t mind losing and starting over and getting it right then this game is the type of thing you think about on the way to work if you can t stand starting over 10 15 20 50 100 times then you might find this to just be an annoying experience
