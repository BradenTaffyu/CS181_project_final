2018 warning long review tl dr best games you will ever play do you think games are just silly little things after playing this game i truly think the answer is no nier automata is a special game a hidden gem that mirrors real world humanity and what it means to be a human perfectly into this philosophical art piece of masterful storytelling and audio visual experience this game is nothing short of a masterpiece background i was reading a local game magazine and saw a review about nier automata it scored 90 100 and i had nothing to play at that moment so i spontaneously went to a game store to buy myself a controller and nier automata despite being a little off put by the maid goth samurai protagonist giant swords and other typical features of japanese rpgs can t be too bad of a game with those reviews i said to myself and boy am i glad i bought this game gameplay nier automata needs a controller this game can be played with k m but i would never ever suggest anyone who appreciates their own sanity to play this game with a k m combo game world is big camera angles are used masterfully to make some scenes have more impact to them the 3d game can sometimes turn into a 2d platformer or a top down experience 9s character has his hacking ability which allows player to take control destroy or temporarily indoctrinate enemies this all happens in a bullet hell minigame nier automata s combat system is well polished as you would expect from a hack n slash action rpg combat is easy to pick up but felt like shallow button mashing at times until i realized how different weapon combinations and chips affect your moves and combo sets there is enough weapon variety from small and big swords to spears axes and fist weapons as soon as your realized this the tedious and shallow button mashing is gone replaced by incredibly satisfying perfect dodging followed by perfectly launched combo attacks thanks to this the combat felt fresh and fun even after 30 hours side quests are your typical japanese fetch quest grind however they are flavoured with interesting conversations and revelations to the story and the game world which allows you to understand the whole narrative better nier automata captivates you as a player to it s world going so far as being in menu screen is you actually being part of the game world already adding and removing hud chips remove and add certain hud features this goes so far that you can even remove your os chip which kills your character and provides you with one additional ending one thing that really irritated me at times was lazy level design on some parts for example the invisible walls are we back in ps1 era and very muddy textures in certain places soundtrack composed by keiichi okabe nier automata s ost is genius it s massive it s spectacular it s sad magical and truly one of the best soundtracks ever created to a video game period for me it goes on equal ground with doom 2016 and hotline miami the music adds to the narrative perfectly it evolves and changes from small and subtle mystical tones to a orchestra of ear euphoria perfectly supporting the story s narrative it really is so good it is what got me hooked to the story of the game every song in this game is a master piece from start to finish it s incredible story major spoilers game takes place in a post apocalyptic earth some nine thousand years into the future human race has been driven out of earth to the moon council of humanity has created humanoid androids to fight off the mindless killing machines created by aliens that invaded earth and this task is overseen by yorha at least that s what you re initially driven to belive the game is over after route a and the credits roll you would think this is it but oh no the game prompts you with a screen telling you you should play the game again for the full experience you continue your last save and you start off as a different character in a different place there is in fact three different playthroughs and five major endings a b c d and e route e being the final and most satisfying closure to the game s canon lore as you start your first playthrough the character 2b quotes somewhat random we are perpetually trapped in a never ending spiral of life and death is this a curse or some kind of punishment but it s not random it is referring to samsara a belief of never ending cycle between life death and rebirth nier automata shows it s love for never ending cycles many times during the playthroughs of different routes during your first playthrough you will notice that some of the machines are capable of speaking some are developing feelings like loyalty some of them are trying to imitate and understand love some have developed religions androids are getting intoxicated with synthetic drugs androids and machines alike are forming relationships with each other each of these actions mirror humanity perfectly neither the machines nor the androids are mere machines anymore they are becoming more human the game has so many mysteries for the player to solve many of which are puzzled together from hints gained in side quests or just briefly mentioned in some conversations however the main topic always seems to be related to existentialism the purpose of life the game introduces three major playable characters serious and later more emotional 2b combat type android more extroverted curious and joking 9s sensory type and later in the game a2 a reckless older combat type who likes to keep to herself many side characters are named after real life figures contrasting their real life images in various ways most of whom have something to do with the thought of existentialism here is a few pascal as blaise pascal major contributor to the philosophy of mathematics jean paul as jean paul sartre one of the key figures of philosophy of existentialism simone opera boss simone de beauvoir french existentialist philosopher goliath bosses engels and marx as friedrich engels and karl marx the writers of communist manifesto as you finish all three playthroughs and go through a huge emotional rollercoaster as everything becomes clear all the mysteries are solved and every question gets an answer at the end of it all the game challenges you with one last bullet hell sequence in the end credits as weight of the world plays in the background and tears were streaming down my cheeks the game asks you following questions give up here do you think games are just silly little things do you accept defeat at the same time you receive encouraging messages from other players all over the world who have beaten the game as you keep dying in this sequence over and over again the game asks you this do you admit there is no meaning to this world no this game has opened my eyes to witness the true potential of video games as art pieces one last time you die and game asks you do you accept a rescue offer from a player you are no longer alone you receive aid from other people who have beaten the game before you as the end credits song evolves into a chorus you are finally able to beat the last sequence in this magnificent orchestra of emotions you are not weeping but tears just keep streaming down your face as you smile in the end game asks you do you want to help a total stranger in exchange for all your progress in the game all your saves all your effort gone i did it with a single click of a yes you have just experienced something legendary thank you yoko taro thank you platinum games thank you square enix this game is perhaps one of the most influental video games ever created this game truly is a masterpiece
