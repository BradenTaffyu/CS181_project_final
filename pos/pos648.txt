2017 product received for free i think this is one of the best games i ve played in a singleplayer mode however no game is perfect pros really nice atmosphere and tone brings a good mood lots of different things and choises to do as player farming adventure dating rpg mining and a few mini games all in one you may actually feel like you re living in a town as a farmer there is not a right way to play this game you can really spend a lot if time playing this game it s worth the price even with all the cons this game is a wonderful experience cons still waiting for the multiplayer my gosh i m anticipating it the characters don t really age even if you play the game for 60 in game years also the festivals and celebrations could differ more each year instead of being very similar should include a tutorial there could be more ways to conquer someone s heart non material ways and to gain friendship points a minor minus is that milking the cows is sometimes very annoying the mechanic just does not work well sometimes traveling the distances feels unnesessary even with the horse as you can t take the horse with you to the shortcuts the game saves only when you sleep in game which breaks the feeling of a casual game a bitbuy if you like the concept of being a farmer this game will be a lot about farming and making a life of what s around you the game gets better after you ve put a couple of hours to it and start to get a hang of it if you consider bying harvest moon buy this instead this is a better one
