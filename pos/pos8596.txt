2023 great game very addicting but rewarding the high reward system is probably what makes it addicting anyways this a slow paced game so if you don t like walking around for 20 30 minutes before seeing anything then this isn t the game for you however if you don t mind the slower pace each shot you take will get the blood pumpin and the adrenaline runnin love the game p s made this review high probably doesn t make sense at all
