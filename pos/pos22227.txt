2016 dark souls 3 let me start of by saying i tried dark souls 2 ages ago and i didn t like it at all so now during the winter sale i decided to give the dark souls series another shot so i ended up buying this gem right here i played for 2 hours then said to myself is this really a game i can play i struggled a bit with the first boss and struggled even more in the next area i got sent too however i ended up refunding the game which was the dumbest thing i could ve done after the refund i obviously uninstalled the game but after an hour or so i wanted more alot more as i said earlier i haven t played any dark souls games so i can t relate to what they are like however the bosses in dark souls 3 starts out by being mediocre the hardest part is by far to get to the bosses halfway through or so the bosses starts to become extremly effin interesting and the is difficult really took a 180 and ramped up like nothing seen before especially the namless one replayability tough one once i finished the game i ended up hunting a few achievements then i set sail into ng and instead of making a brand new character i respecced my character completely went from being a warrior to a pyromancer going from a warrior to pyromancer was a major turn aswell playing the pyromancer is so different to being a melee character a completely different way to play or simply just beat the game as your starting class or completely switch mid game completely possible the game is so free in that sense you can do whatever you want well almost conclusion best game i ve ever played the story was absolutely amazing aswell i rate it 9 10
