2020 overall this is a really fun game if you want to relax and kill some time however there are a few very minor things about this game that really bug me my problems with the game and suggestions for improvement are as follows 1 there aren t enough paint colors personally i think a simple rgb color picker should be used in order to have any paint color imaginable in fact this should be available for other things too like siding carpet tiles etc 2 the snap feature should be upgraded ideally it would be nice to see the grid when you re placing an object i myself like to center things when placing a ceiling light it would be nice to snap the the center between 2 opposing walls it would also be nice to have joining objects like 2 matching counters snap to the sides of each other it would also be nice for an object to snap as far back against a wall as possible 3 base parent installations should be purchase able when placing that type of child object for instance when placing a sink it would be nice to be able to purchase the installation for it when you ve outlined the spot where you actually want to put that sink kudos for recently making the placements semi movable more user friendly 4 exterior doors and windows should be place able and remove able maybe the same with stairs too i m fine with the exterior of the house having a fixed shape or outline but it would nice to be able to control where exterior doors and windows can go again i like to center things so i like to make rooms with centered windows in some houses that s impossible to effectively do 5 please add half walls that is from the floor up 6 please make all objects rotate able to be perfectly parallel there are some objects in the game that can t be rotated to be perfectly parallel to the wall it would be nice to have a button that points an object to the closest cardinal direction 7 applicable to garden flipper only perhaps add grass seed that grows grass in a centralized area around where it s sown if there is an object with an angled base such as a tree it s hard to angle the turf rolls if you want to get if flush with the base it starts to get expensive too with grass seed grass can grow everywhere in a general area also some properties have patches of dirt that you can t actually reach with a turf roll nothing outside of the property line should be imperfect i m just throwing out an idea if grass seed is added it can only be applied to dirt it needs to be watered with a garden hose it has to take a full day cycle to grow and it grows tall and has to be mowed
