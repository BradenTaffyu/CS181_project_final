2015 early access review tl dr get it do it this is the game i ve dreamed about as a destructive child a simple child melting my match box cars with gasoline i grew up playing with crash test dummies i ve played every system since atari i have waited decades for a game like this bunout series destruction derby series vigilante 8 series route 66 and next car game nothing compares to this yes i know those games are different genres but nontheless you know what maybe i am overzealous or maybe just maybe this is what i ve been waiting on for my whole gaming life all i can say is if this game wasn t touched again by developers if this was the final product i d pay 100 for it i may trade my xbox one for it rare replay included i was uneasy purchasing the early access but beamng drive called out to me i could not wait and the positive reviews after the update were the final straw i am 31 years old thirty one people i may be too old to get one off when vr porn comes into full futrition but at least i can say i have experienced my gaming destiny beamng drive developers i love you
