2023 initially i avoided playing new vegas because i had tried fallout 3 and 4 and bounced off hard after being battered with youtube videos that contained nothing but effusive praise for the game i grudgingly gave it a shot and i am glad i did in many ways it feels like a shining example of what a modern western rpg should be filled with great characters great stories and fascinating choices to make the dlcs are possibly even better with strong narratives that are not only great self contained stories they connect to major background characters in the main game and build up to the final dlc lonesome road the only downside is playing rpgs afterward won t feel the same again why can t these games be as good as new vegas will nag you for a long time note i played with the set of mods listed by viva new vegas to improve stability and performance issues i did not use any content mods outside of better brotherhood even with these mods installed i still had occasional crashes it is not the most stable of games
