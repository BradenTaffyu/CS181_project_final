this game is the warhammer 40k rpg no other 40k game can compare in the amount of care detail and passion dedicated to the lore of the setting the character writing is excellent with the majority of the quests felling important impactful moreover despite its length the game does not lose its initiative as the story chapters progress the rng of the classes can sometimes be felt too much even after going super niche in certain builds however this does not stop the game from being an extremely enjoyable experience for any fans of 40k and proper rpg games well done owlcat games will definitely support further content for this game highly recommended
