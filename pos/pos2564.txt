2023 edit 21 07 2023 this review got a couple comments about the latest update and my note about the in game currency please see my response in the comments below tl dr at the very bottom this review is spoiler free i was very pleasantly surprised by this free to play gacha rpg having expected the usual gacha game trappings of constantly running into content roadblocks and needing heaps of currency to build a viable team but limbus company proved to be different at the time of writing this review project moon has not only been very generous with its currency lunacy with prices being very low even for the lengthy battlepass but has often giving out lunacy packs to every player every time they patch something or simply go down for maintenance project moon has treated their community very well the biggest surprise was how deep the rpg story goes the characters and style alone were enough to draw me in but the story turned this game into an addiction set in the same universe as project moon s prior games lobotomy corporation and library of ruina limbus company is set in a large city separated into different districts in which you manage a band of 12 sinners that fight to obtain magical objects the sinners are able to adopt unique identities from alternate worlds each one having their own set of powers and abilities lunacy is spent on rolling for these alternate identities though players can also save up sinner shards from duplicates to outright buy new identities even so the base sinners are all very strong and can get the job done so players that don t roll often can still enjoy most of what limbus company has to offer limbus company s story ranges from typical anime silliness to deep traumatic emotion with the characters having to fight to survive in a gritty unforgiving world though some story chapters suffer from a bit of padding with extra fights the general pacing is fairly tight when the story dips into despair and cruelty the game s narrative peppers in moments of comedy that don t feel out of place though limbus company is technically the third game set in the same universe new players do not need any prior knowledge going in the game does a great job of getting completely new players such as myself up to speed while still giving veterans a lot of new content to sink their teeth into the gameplay can be a bit daunting to new players as there are multiple systems in place during fights when you choose a move for a sinner to use they clash with an enemy every attack uses coinflips with heads generally increasing the attack s score and tails decreasing the score last one with points left gets to attack the other you do have to take element damage types into consideration and status effects tied to each attack can help or complicate things but at the very top the game gives a one word summary of your chances it ranges from hopeless to dominating and could be anything in between there are also shortcut buttons where the game will pick the moves most likely to win or the moves that will do the most damage if they land so while the game may seem daunting to play at first it doesn t take long to get the hang of combat all in all limbus company has quickly become a favourite in my entire steam library and i would highly recommend this game to rpg fans who appreciate a great story and players who enjoy a tricky yet straightforward layer of strategy in combat this is an excellent game worth any amount you invest into it tl dr excellent story and characters very cool and stylish design engaging and fun strategic combat very generous with in game currency base sinners still viable choices for fighting heavy investment not necessary to make story progress rewards from some timed events can still be picked up with in game generated currency greatly expands the lore and story from past project moon games but prior knowledge is not necessary for new players to enjoy limbus company recurring game modes challenge players and change things up to give veterans more to do can be greatly enjoyed for free some chapters suffer a bit of padding from additional fights tutorial fights don t explain every aspect of the game in great detail new players will need to read carefully
