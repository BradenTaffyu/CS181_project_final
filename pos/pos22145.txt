2016 now with my vast experience of every soulsborne game and each of those from the dark souls trilogy on at least two platforms i believe i can offer a well educated judgement of dark souls 3 i will be comparing it to its predecessors naturally but i shall also judge dark souls 3 as a game in its own right so for those that haven t played a souls game before and won t understand my comparisons dark souls 3 is an amazing game but don t buy it go play the others at least dark souls 1 or i ll come to your house and slap you until you do right for those experienced in souls and want to know what dark souls 3 is like prepare to be both amazed and disappointed by this game dark souls 3 keeps the complex combat of the previous games in face goes one step further by making it so complex that it makes no f ing sense diminishing returns and the peculiar new poise mechanic make ultra heavy armours mostly useless as they weigh you down it s fine for me because i always had 0 poise but for those that always killed the 4 kings by r1 spamming in havel s gone are those days but chugging is easier as usual there s a hell of a lot of weapon variety unfortunately only a few from each class are viable as many weapons are wholly outclassed by others in their category the same goes for armour but nobody cares because fashion is what s important despite what some say magic is viable in ds3 and actually remains the most powerful thing in the game if used correctly hyper armour is a new addition certain weapon types now offer hyper armour during parts of their animations this is good since there is a lack of useful poise but is very easily abused and so 2 handed hollowslayer is very powerful against someone who can t parry not kidding among the best weapons in the game the world design is similar ish to ds2 mixed with demon s souls but the individual area design is more akin to dark souls 1 in general it s bloomin good i just wish the world as a whole was more connected the hub of the game works a lot like ademon s souls and bloodborne host to your very own maiden doll for levelling merchants a blacksmith and gathering place for various npcs it feels a lot like the nexus in this regard it is also disconnected from the main world the story and lore is just as expansive as its predecessors and only more theories and secrets are coming to light as time passes the same goes for a npc quest lines they are very akin to those in ds1 boasting unique encounters with npcs and witnessing their stories unfold as yours does take ostrava siegmeyer solaire and logan s quests for example most quests are as complex in nature each with their own emotional and compelling story as well as new kinds of gameplay features to improve upon the quests honestly i think ds3 is host to some of the best npc quests and characters on par with bloodborne and dark souls 1 unfortunately we have no mephistopheles asking us to kill everyone but there is one similar quest and obvious reference the soundtrack is amazing on par with that of predecessors and accompanied by equally awesome bosses there are slight disappointments as with all of the games but the majority are very good just be warned bosses are more aggressive in ds3 finally i ll summarise dark souls 3 has its fair share of disappointments but the are few enough not to tarnish the beauty of the game and they are almost all mechanic based disappointments that may or may not be altered in later patches the game as a whole however is fantastic and absolutely worth buying pvp takes getting used to because of the changes it is still good and some covenants suck but that s nothing new however don t let it deter you from getting yet another fromsoft masterpiece ps also do buy that ps4 for bloodborne because it is worth it
