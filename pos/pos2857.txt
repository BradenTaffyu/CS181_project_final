2017 found a pig burning alivedecided to bless the pig to put out the flames it thanked me and ran offlater on in the game i ran into the pig again it reveals to me that it is actually a witchtry to help the pig by leading it to a shrine for the god she prays to hoping it ll turn her back into her human formarrive with her at shrinerealize there are bloody clouds surrounding the shrineremember that i was skipping dialogue a few nights back because i was absolutely exaughsted and needed to wrap stuff up so i could sleep which caused me to somehow anger the gods and curse the shrine to forever be clouded with mysterious bloody cloudsof course i ignored that fact and went to bed however i suddenly realize today this may have an effect on the pig if i let her bathe in the shrinesave before i up shrine was about 3 days ago so no going back nowlet the pig go bathe in the shrineshe s human againshe explodes into a bloody mess youtube video views 0 also i a skeletonedit as of 10 16 17 i have 248 hours of running around being the biggest in divinity i m only halfway through this game there s 4 acts and i just now got on act 3 so if i keep going around doing all the sidequests messing around and main story missions that should add up to about another 250 hours of content not to mention the fact that its worth replaying the whole game to follow different paths and play different races this game is amazing and huge its well worth the money as soon as i m done taking a break from it beceause south park the fractured but whole is coming out tomorrow i d give it 2 days until im done with that game i m rushing back to this to play another 250 hours of amazing content i love this game its definitley worth a buy for you and your friends
