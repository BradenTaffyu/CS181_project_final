2018 i was not interested in stardew valley at first because farming doesn t seem to be my thing i bought the game for the new multi player feature to play it with a couple of friends i tried it in single player mode just to learn the basics and for the next two weeks playing this game was basically what i did besides sleeping this is the first game i have ever spent more than 100 hours on i didn t know if i spent so much time in stardew valley because it was the perfect escape from real life or because i fell in love with the game but now i know it s both i wish i knew that farming is just one of the many things you can do in stardew valley there are so many details and secrets in one small town to be discovered and you have all the time you need to discover all of them you can forage and dig up things everywhere you can socialize with townsfolks each with unique personalities likes and dislikes and fall in love with them you can mine the heck out of the local mines and then mine the heck out of a limit less mine elsewhere you can play the game however you want and pelican town still stays beautiful and vibrant regardless i recommend this game i know my recommendation is just another one in a sea of positive reviews but hey it deserves my recognition still thank you concernedape and chucklefish for stardew valley this game is a good time
