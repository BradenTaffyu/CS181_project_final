2022 early access review i love this game of all the games in my library my summer car is the one i think of the fondest it s ridiculously hard charming funny frustrating engaging and addictive all at the same time there s just something about having a garage full of parts putting them together after a ton of frustration and cursing and finally firing up your rust bucket of a car for the first time it s so satisfying and gives you a real sense of ownership that i haven t gotten in other games like this is my car it s a piece of crap and backfires nonstop but it s mine as you get further into the game you eventually learn how to tune your car so it runs well get it approved for the road and enroll in rally competitions the competitions are super tough but again rewarding and when you inevitably crash your car and break everything now you get to fix it all part of the experience like i said my summer car is nowhere near technically perfect but if you re the type of person that loves building and tweaking their creations you re gonna fall in love with it just like i did
