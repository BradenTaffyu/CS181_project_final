2019 as i age i find my gaming opportunities are far more casual aoe2 hd was okay for that one of my favorite additions to de is empire mode which starts you at the end of the dark ages with a small base it saves a ton of fiddling and gets you closer to the action it s incredible and optional it s one of the many amazing additions to this game i miss the modded ai of the hd version which replicated player actions quite well this one s ai isn t terrible but i m eager for mod support to help it that s all i have to say really i d recommend this to any aoe2 fan there is so much content and improvement added to aoe2 not to mention the graphic upgrades that it s mind boggling the developers clearly listened to the fan base the core gameplay remains the same but has been greatly refined and developed 10 10 buy it for the family
