i stare at the numbers and my eyeballs know calm like nothing else this game scratches all the same itches that games like factorio frostpunk and ixion do if you enjoy any of those games you ll certainly enjoy jwe 2 i would recommend getting the dominion bundle which includes the two campaign dlcs the rest can be bought piecemeal as desired if you go for the everything bundle wait for it to go on sale as much of the content is simply reskinned dinos or freakish franken hybrids
