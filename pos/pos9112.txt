i m not a huge fan of grand strategy but stellaris is outstanding combat is mostly terrible this is totally fine the there s too much to manage problem with late game strategy is partially solved here as the game more or less forces you to give up micro management of most planets as your empire grows the negatives out of the way the emergent storytelling this game offers is why you should play it it s among the best experiences a strategy game can offer don t be scared by the amount of dlc the base game has plenty of meat on the bone and all the dlc goes on sale periodically pay attention to the dlc reviews as well as some are we ll say less essential than others
