2017 i love this game but there are a few issues you should know before purchasing so i guess these will be cons first then i ll hit up the pros cons my biggest gripe with this game there is another one we ll get there has to be the optimization there s no settings that drastically affect fps in any real sort of way aside from resolution and the more prominant oh of course these settings will affect fps but those are only one or two settings textures shadows reflections all of that jazz can be set to medium high settings and you won t see any difference in fps if you usually played on low this sounds good yes but if you re wanting to get rid of that constant 40 fps in one area you re not going to have any settings to help increase those frames and frames are important in this game the other big gripe i have has to do with the camera the camera controls have been seemingly downgraded from the past souls games which i didn t think was entirely possible dark souls 1 had a great lock on system where you could lock onto an enemy from further away and it knew what you were wanting to lock onto if you were surrounded by enemies in dks1 changing lock on to a different target was a breeze but in dks3 sometimes that changing enemy lock on move just doesn t work getting attacked by a giant crab that deals half of your hp while simultaniously being surrounded by tiny crabs that do hardly any which do you think lock on should lock onto the massive crab or the little one apparently it thinks that the little crab is more of a threat thus ending your character s life with one swift claw strike awful pro tip a lot of bigger enemies have super slow wind up attacks it s hard to predict a lot of the time but with practice you should counter it well it can be very annoying to get hit by slow attacks because you expect them to be faster but it s okay onto the pros i ll keep these short because all the other praise has been said in other reviews bosses are fantastic for the most part each boss has a personality and backstory that makes fighting them either extremely exciting or super sad each boss has a second sometimes third stage which can throw you into a fit of rage or make you shrug because not that much has changed but the intensity is fantastic in these stages the lore in this game takes after the lore from dark souls 1 while you don t need to know exactly what you re doing in order to play and have fun it s suggested that you either buy and beat dark souls 1 and 2 if you want but nothing significant really happens there not from what i can remember or watch lore videos on youtube whichever works for you either way the story unravels in item descriptions and they re probably the most entertaining thing to speculate and hear about when you re not actually playing the game the story is amazing you just have to think a little and finally my favorite thing about this game is the fact that it took everything that i loved from dark souls 1 and made it better while also removing everything i hated about it too for example you shouldn t need to know how to toggle escape from a chaos zweihander you shouldn t hate invasions because of backstab fishers and abusers i think that s about it for what i have to say tl dr it s pretty fun worth the money buy it ps get the ringed city dlc first if you don t have enough for both dlc s pps dark souls 3 did invasions right fight me about it
