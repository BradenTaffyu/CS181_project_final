2023 the reason you won t get on with stellaris is because it is a very complex game with many systems that you need to understand and get to grips with before you can be successful i ve owned the game since the 1 0 release and put a relatively large amount of hours into games i didn t finish i d start build up what i thought was a good position and then quickly get overwhelmed by the ai and give up rinse repeat i came back to the game recently and started watching some of montu s videos one of the key lessons i took from this is that much of success is about pops managing your economy to maximum advantage and that means being very careful about the jobs pops are doing there s lots more about optimising ship builds picking the right traits civics ethics and so on you have to master quite a bit to create a viable build i ve now won a couple of games and am turning the difficulty up rather than down i m not yet anywhere near grand admiral and 25x crisis but i m actually having fun being competitive with the ai this is the very opposite of a casual game you need to invest a fair bit of time into learning how to play if you do it gets fun
