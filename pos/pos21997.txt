2018 hmm mmm oh yea 1 my noobism i ve heard about games from the souls series for many years i ve always had an approach to this series like a typical newbie i never played i always thought that this game is difficult i do not have to say how i was very wrong and how much i have lost over the years 2 reviewthis game is addictive and satisfying only some souls like and rogue like games can match however the games from the dark souls series offer an unforgettable atmosphere constant anxiety but also fascination and fulfillment the game offers a lot of combinations of builds thanks to a large number of armor sets weapons classes spells statistics fighting styles and special abilities there is so much that i do not want to write about it anymore regarding the soundtrack i have never heard the greatest music in the main menu and at some matches maybe only the one from the witcher 3 can match subtle motivational climatic unforgettable the quality of non player character voices is the highest class i have not heard such a good voice act in a long time multiplayer is quite specific can be liked or not calling other players to help at the same time exposing yourself to the invasion of hostile players is original unfortunately if someone is accustomed to the classic co op and passing the game with a friend he may feel a little disappointed every time you die and use the checkpoint you must repeat the monotonous procedure there are so many secrets to discover so many connections and dependencies that without a guide you can easily overlook something still i recommend playing this game twice once for the experience the second time to test another build discover the secrets take part in even more demanding challenges you can go through this game several times and still discover something and of course still feel satisfaction unforgettable defeats and victories getting to know new opponents learning new tactics etc everything will stay in my memory for many years now i m able to believe that dark souls games can change a human being to a certain extent praise the sun
