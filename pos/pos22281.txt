2021 i just finished this game which is my first souls game and i just had to write a review for it before i start i have to say that if you are planning to buy this game you should buy it asap because my biggest regret is not discovering this game sooner this was a very fun game in my opinion in terms of its skill cap it was very fun clearing areas finding new items and beating the mobs that would stand in your way exploring the beautifully designed world of lothric is also always worth because of its amazing aesthetic the weapons system was also quite enjoyable to me because discovering new swords armors and spells always opened my options to more character customization and broadened my view on more ways to play the game in regards with the bosses they gave me a whole load of happiness by doing them i found it fun learning how to fight them to dodge their attacks and learn their weaknesses in order to succeed each boss victory with the exception of the relatively easy ones gave me always gave me extremely happy leaving me with feelings of accomplishment with the lore however i found that the game itself actually doesn t give you much details you would have to watch a couple of youtube videos to learn it this doesn t mean though that the lore isn t good the lore for me is very exciting and fun the story and the world of dark souls is in my opinion one of the best in all the games i have previously played for anyone who reads this i hope you find this review useful
