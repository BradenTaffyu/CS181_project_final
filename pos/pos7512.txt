a brief summaryanno 1800 is a real time strategy game set during the industrial revolution focusing on the development of supply chains and logistics between multiple islands profits from internal sales and trade can then be used to subsidize the less profitable construction and military supply chains that enable the player to expand and enforce their claims against competitors while the supply chains are never very complex the game is slowed down by its obtuse trade route system and extreme lack of instructions on its core mechanics in spite of its flaws anno 1800 generally provides a satisfying level of complexity and progress with little downtime gameplaycity developmenteach residence will supply workers that can be employed to harvest and process goods most goods are consumables which can be supplied back to the island s population to fulfill their needs increasing the number of workers per residence and boosting approval a fully supplied residence can then be upgraded to house workers of the next tier unlocking new supply chains to support them higher tiers bring more complexity profit and power unlike other colony sims anno 1800 is somewhat unique in that workers and storage don t need to be placed in any particular pattern to mitigate transport time this pushes the player to maximize the value of their space by packing in the buildings as tightly as possible the game provides tools to edit and copy blocks of buildings to minimize the effort required to expand existing sectors leaving the player to focus on new developments colony managementwarehouses serve as portals into an island s total inventory effectively linking nearby structures to the stockpile to transfer items between islands the player needs to set up shipping routes different islands often have access to different resources that are necessary for certain supply chains for instance hops cannot be grown on the player s starting island and are a mandatory part of the beer supply chain further the island attractiveness system and the space needed for farms push the player to export their low level and polluting industries to other islands concentrating wealth on one island allows for more advanced supply chains and a higher profit margin provided the player can form a robust shipping network like most aspects of the game the player is rewarded for thinking ahead to plan and defend their goals naval supremacywith the introduction of steel and weapons factories in the worker tier of citizens players can begin constructing warships to control the seas the smaller gunboats are effective at pursuing trade ships but can be completely deterred by frigate escorts a ship of the line carries twice the firepower of a frigate finding its niche in locking down channels and conquering new areas while the settlements owned by competitors can be razed their coastal batteries are able to outclass anything a ship can carry large settlements however will typically crumble without regular shipments from their colonies ships are slow to produce and mobilize but their costs are more than justified by the value of the trade they can secure influenceinfluence is a limited resource that can be allocated to control various aspects of the game to benefit the player while players with a larger population will have more influence it comes with a larger area to secure every ship and coastal battery consumes influence as do claims on islands and the ownership of competitors shares a large military and merchant fleet may come at the expense of economic and civil bonuses the tax gains from propaganda can conflict with the player s ability to claim new islands influence serves as an adaptive budget that can be allocated across both the player s military economy and empire to support their strategies over the course of the game difficultythe difficulty options in game impact a number of factors that significantly influence the game the easiest difficulty has larger islands with more plentiful resources more importantly the easy rival players are rooting for you offering donations and alliances without being prompted the easy difficulty can help an inexperienced player fudge their way through the campaign without cutting out the core mechanics higher difficulties are then used to explore worlds with fewer resources forcing conflicts and demanding more of the player the cast of characters used on such difficulties is adapted accordingly to be faster more ambitious and opportunistic though it s pretty clear that the npcs cheat to some extent their capabilities are believable and they are well characterized through their actions ultimately the difficulty options are done remarkably well problemsa lacking tutorialformally the in game encyclopedia has a single entry describing what lifestyle needs are while the campaign demonstrates the early supply chains that s it notably the player is not taught essential mechanics like how to colonize new islands nor are they offered any explanation as to where the money comes from spoiler it doesn t come from either external trade or even taxes the bulk of the money is generally obtained by passively selling goods back to one s own population like many things the details are left to be discovered by hovering over elements in the various menus in the game or more likely looking up guides online moving itemstrade routes can be set to move a specified quantity of items from one island to next on repeat though demand is usually measured in items per minute the trade system offers no prediction to the average throughput of any given route should multiple routes pull items from the same island extra capacity in any of them will suffocate the others to make matters worse there is no control to make a one time transfer from one port to another or even offload the unique contents of a ship when it arrives at its destination despite being a game about logistics and supply it is extremely painful to move items from wherever they are in the player s territory to where they are actually needed slowing things down and generally inhibiting the player s economy in ways that are prohibitively difficult to resolve slowthe amount of fiddling required to move items results in delayed construction and poorer coordination between the player s islands the wasted productivity then becomes a substantial loss for one s treasury further restricting development all the while the player needs to stop to manage the supply and demand charts on top of the flood of reminders that somewhere a ship is under attack while setting up a new supply chain is relatively quick with the necessary resources on hand constant distractions and logistical difficulties easily inflate what would be fifteen minute tasks to hour long affairs as a result the quantity of supply chains and level of management needed to debug them takes up enough time to largely invalidate the upper half of the technologies in the game alas the game is certainly an active experience conclusionanno 1800 is generally a good and capable game while it does a poor job of communicating its mechanics the game supports the player with excellent npc competitors in its difficulty options while there are a lot of tasks that require the one s attention on a moment to moment basis the player is almost always actively planning and engaging with what it has to offer there is a constant progression and anticipation for greater things throughout the game the logistics are pretty frustrating though it s pretty good though far from perfect follow our curator page summit reviews to see more reviews regularly
