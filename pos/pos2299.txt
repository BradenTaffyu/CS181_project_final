2022 i ve been playing fo76 since the beta back then i used to stream and i streamed it for 24 hours straight i know how painful that game was at launch an empty world unbalanced glitches bugs beautiful but boring the original fo76 story is a legit fallout story but how it was presented is its weakness you follow the trail of dead people to uncover mysteries if those npcs were alive the game story wise would have been great then the game had several dlcs free always with wild appalachia the game expanded a bit but the core problems remained the same never been a fan of the card perk system there is no commitment for the character build if you can just re spec the battle royale was a good idea but cheaters prevailed and destroyed the experience then wastelanders came and now it feels more like a fallout game with the reintroduction of npcs and choices sadly the wastelanders story is not that good its decent but no among the best fallout stories then a two part bortherhood of steel storyline which is also decent enough a bit more interesting but short i have a love hate relationship with this game i play it and then i stop for months the last time i played this game was the day before cyberpunk 2077 was released and just came back just to check it out again it has potential and they have built something over a mess but its core problems are still there this game never will be a 7 but it went from a 2 3 to a 5 which means average and i only recommend it to people that wants to unwind blowing stuff up in a big and absurd open world oh yeah microtransactions fallout 1st membership and stash limitations are other big issues but is true that you can manage without expending any real money if you have it for free like in game pass worth the while if you get it on a sale also but never pay full price for this already old game
