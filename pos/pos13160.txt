2017 before you start playing this game you need to know a few things prograde retrograde gravity turn apoapsis periapsis deltav twr isp tsiolkovsky rocket equation normal anti normal swing by suicide burn aerobraking those will really save your a soi oberth maneuver kessler syndrome escape velocity propellant payload mass fraction karman line planetary phase angle ejection angle launch window geostationary transfer orbit geosynchronous orbit interplanetary transfer gate orbit space rendezvous aerodynamics ssto vtol dzhanibekov effect intermediate axis theorem angular momentum translation force fluid dynamics terminal velocity bernoullis principle this game even simulates that g force angle of attack free fall semi major axis lpe lan newtons 1 2 and 3 law of motion six degrees of freedom ins imu rcs sas relative kinematics and most importantly the deep space kraken and then you can play the game like its intended and enjoy it without randomly trying a bunch of things until it somehow works and my teacher said i would never need rocket science in my daily life lol
