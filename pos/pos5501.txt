2022 early access review caves of qud has layers beyond count the kind of person who will appreciate this game is the same kind of person who would enjoy creating dnd campaigns it takes a small amount of patience to learn enough to have fun once you really start to dig in you will see just how much there is to uncover a creative mind helps to enjoy the sometimes difficult to understand visuals a quick tip hold alt to see where creatures and certain types of objects are i recommend new players use the preset builds and classic mode permadeath for the first few playthroughs until you begin to develop preferences to certain skillsets and playstyles i would suggest trying to build completely different characters each playthrough once you feel more comfortable with understanding the mechanics since there is just so much to try out i did reach a point at which i switched to roleplay mode checkpoints in towns simply because death is inevitable and i wanted to experience the mid to late gameplay having said that at almost 80 hours myself i feel like i have experienced less than 5 of what the game has to offer my favourite thing so far is this fungal infection my character got from walking too close to a mushroom it is described as millions of tiny mouths speaking incoherently each mouth saying a different thing from the other but sometimes they all speak in unison and tell me secrets about the world 10 10 would get infected again
