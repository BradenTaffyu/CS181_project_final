2016 i m just going to say what everyone else is the game itself is awesome and the planned expansions will make it one of the best games ever especially for warhammer fans the problem is their dlc policy it s going to push the total price of the game to ridiculous levels it s probably best to wait 2 or 3 years when they ve released their 2 dozen or more dlc packs and two expansions and it s all rolled into one neat game of the year edition or whatever they ll call it and is hopefully far cheaper if you can t wait that long like i couldn t try and buy a cheap steam key from somewhere other than steam for the base game and pick just a few of the dlc packs from the current ones i d recommend the king and the warlord and the grim and the grave you can live without the rest they can be bought much later on when they fall in price
