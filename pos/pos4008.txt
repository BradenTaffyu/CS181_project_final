2023 i was going to write review for this game after got that one last achievement for finishing a whole game in under 20 minutes i have tried many times but i still unable to do it so i finally decide to move on to other games not much left for me to review in the game as everyone has given a 97 positive rating of over 120 000 reviews simple graphic awesome character card design fun and addictive game play that will eat your free times away so many different strategies to discover and so i am super looking forward to your next game 9 9 10 with nearly no flaws and i will keep review short and simple the only lost of point is some of those achievements are really hard to get and require just too many different tries if you haven t played it try it and you won t regret it i support game developer 100 and i am with you to say no to unity engine and their unfair policy updated for award
