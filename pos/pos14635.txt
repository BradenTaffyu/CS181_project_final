2016 what s for dinner my kids asked i ll pick up some pizza i responded when they asked in just one more turn i promise 6 hours later the lights are off in the rest of the house i think they gave up and fed themselves cereal or maybe my wife packed them up in the car and left to go to her mother s house i really don t know i ll go check after this one more turn or maybe after the next one seriously who does that i only made them wait an hour i m not that heartless because the steam awards requires an update a couple thousand turns later my wife is back home the kids haven t starved and i still enjoy playing this game civ vi is very deserving of the just 5 more minutes award if it was up to me i d rename it to the just 5 more hours award if i could
