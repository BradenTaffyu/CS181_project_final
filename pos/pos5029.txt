2016 so back to the big one todd howardyes i am one of those people who pre ordered the game if you want to judge it go ahead so yes the game contained a lot of bugs glitches and gamebreaking problems but even though the framesrates kept destroying my insides my protagonist falling through the world several times and quests not completing properly i made it i beat the game wait what i personally think that a fallout game is not supposed to be beaten it s supposed to be lived and played and explored but the world just didn t feel alive it felt scripted and dead of course it s a world after a nuclear disaster but still fallout new vegas kept me going so hard it just never stopped being alive despite it being well dead to this day i still have not played through the story mods and dlc s and stuff but fallout 4 felt empty compared to new vegas lifeless not fun so after i beat the game for the first time i tried some mods but not much was done yet and dropped the game 2 months ago i decided to go for the season pass sale i saw it had a lot of negative reviews and after reading a few i was like this i ll try it and i was not disappointed despite that they had fixed the frame issues and fixed all the gamebreaking bugs i could honestly tell something was different about the game i started a new save made new decisions and enjoyed it still not through still doing all kinds of crap still enjoying it more and more each time i start it up even though not much was added to the storyline or the world itself the game feels more alive more fun don t get me wrong it is still a really good game even without dlc s but it just feels incomplete in new vegas the game felt complete and then you get three more extra games that were all complete in itself anyways fallout 4 is good now even better it will never compete with fallout new vegas but it s still a very good game if you think of it as a stand alone title include the dlc s you might actually get a complete game experience pro s you can craft almost anything especially with mods build your own settlements and gain settler who will work and sell things a good story with different outcomes depending on your choice different fractions a lot of sidequests a lot of hidden things to discover you can still go outside the map and explore new locations yus well spoken character relationships with companions animal human companions choices a now beautiful looking world modifications on armor weapons even powerarmor modscon s framerate issues in cities for some no karma system not enough fractions to side with or discover some quests feel empty and don t get me started on settlements preston companions could be smarteri won t tell you how amazing crafting can be and despite being all adventerous you can just be creative and build your own cities especially with mods get them now but i will tell you that fallout 4 is still a fallout game and since the season pass release and the fixes it s livable again not just beatable i have to admit i was sceptical but fallout 4 lived once again up to its legacy if you re a fan you ll love it if not then you should totally check it out when it s on sale war war never changes yeah but fallout did 9 10
