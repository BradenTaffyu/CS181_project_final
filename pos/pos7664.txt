2021 early access review for all the guys that say beamng is empty and without content i have to say your imagination is empty and without content as a child i used to play with my toy cars and i made up huge crashes and everything blew up in my fantasy and beamng is like the virtual playground i always wanted to play in you can choose a stereotypical type of car which you can tune and customize as you wish and make up huuuuuge crashes with the most realistic deformation i have ever seen in a real time simulation i can not suggest this game enough to people that always wantet to know how it looks when a semi truck rear ends a traffic jam or how it looks when you crash your sports sedan with 180 mph into a static object i love this piece of art and its my favourite game here on steam you can always jump in and drive a few hours and i will promise you that you will smile at some point
