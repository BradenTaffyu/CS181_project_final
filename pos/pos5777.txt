2020 early access review this is the game we were waiting for sadly the it meme won t work anymore and well the game left me a bit disappointed waiting all this time i and i know many others were expecting a lot and don t get me wrong it is still a fun game but it feels a bit like a reskinned version of the holy warband for 40 euro s and 12 centuries of waiting i expected more why would i still recommend it because it is mount and blade the sieges did improve combat is slightly better crafting better settlement management but these increases are relatively small i found myself sometimes going back to warband because it simply felt better this could be nostalgia i still love playing the game and i would recommend buying it especially if you haven t played the older ones but i d say wait for a sale at least until it comes out of beta i hope the developers carry on their good work maybe when it goes out of beta it is a more solid experience
