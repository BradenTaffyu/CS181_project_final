2018 wow this game is good great story fun combat moving music and the world setting is very interesting nier has lite rpg elements in an openworld with for the most part good sidequests and unlocks if that s your thing i first picked up this game based on rave the reviews online but was worried this would be another jrpg grind fest what i found instead was a very engaging and emotional story and great experience all around i have not been this attached to characters in a game for a very long time this one hooked me right away and the ending s had me cheering and or crying the story is pivotal to the game this game so it s very spoiler sensitive but my advise since i think some people miss it the end of the game isn t the end load up your save and play it through again for a different perspective of events and then again for the next leg of the narrative three at a minimum playthroughs is the real length of the game i am typically the last person to play through games again once they are done so i almost didn t do it trust me it s worth it and a different experience than what you expect enjoy
