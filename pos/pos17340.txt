2021 my first total war game was shogun total war 2000 the original title in the series i poured countless hours into it followed by medieval rome medieval ii rome ii and so on i played many of the titles which followed up to attila and i ve even dumped a fair amount of time into warhammer and warhammer 2 here s the bottom line for me three kingdoms is one of the best games in the 21 year history of the franchise hands down it s one of the most balanced and polished experiences overall with a fair amount of technical complexity but mechanics that are approachable and easy to learn battles in three kingdoms feel similarly easy to enjoy riding a line between strategic complexity and fun accessibility the strategy map ui features some dramatic changes that take getting used to but they re good overall the updates feel geared towards refining an approach that had gotten messy and stale over the decades it s slick and it makes sense ultimately i m looking for a total war experience that expertly rides a line i want depth historical immersion and complexity but i also want to a polished experience that i can enjoy with ease there are total war games which lean harder into the former at the expense of refinement and accessibility there are titles which feel overly streamlined and almost arcade like i love the franchise but in truth it s been a while since i ve landed on a total war game that strikes the right balance for me three kingdoms by contrast is my goldilocks total war it s what i m looking for deep but not byzantine accessible but not dumbed down beautiful rich and immersive and most of all fun
