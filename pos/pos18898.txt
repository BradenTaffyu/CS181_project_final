2019 this game is extremely addicting haven t seen my wife and kids ever since i bought a month or two ago i just have to conquer the entire world as ulm but it just keeps calling me back for more i would call it painting the map simulator but it s more than that its a drug like cocaine or heroin i need it to survive everywhere i go in real life i can t help but to think damn this province could really use some more development in order for the renaissance to reach it faster it follows me everywhere i go and i cannot leave behind that feeling that someone is building a spy network in my nation 10 10 really do make you feel like ulm
