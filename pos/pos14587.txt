2017 civilzation vi was one of those games that i absolutely did not care about or at least did not understand the hype when it was first announced i had not played civilization v nor had i followed the series i knew that it was a strategy game and so disliked it however a few months previously i had bought stellaris and so grand strategy games were slowly flying into my radar including civilization v then manyatruenerd started a let s play on civilization vi suddenly the game was the only thing on my mind it was one of those scenarios where when i wasn t doing anything else civilization vi took up my spare head room gameplay scenarios and diplomacy screens and beginning screens in the game dominated my brain when it finally came out without thinking i purchased the deluxe edition kind of a let down as the added civs since release weren t all that special cool but in relation to being dlc eh very quickly civilization vi became my most played game on steam until i got into paladins and even more so dominated my mind i will explain the reasons pros a very easily addictive game civilization is the origin of the term just one more turn and its addictivity is self explanatory the music is great after about sixty hours i turned it off to listen to my own though most of my other points fall under the first point the design choices that firaxis made when deciding upon the new art style mmm daddycons most certainly religion even with the new rebuild of the system another civ began next to you and happens to have a religion yeah goodluck even struggling to keep your own cities worshipping your own religion any nearby religion will immediately bum rush you not even taking into account the fact that you are currently converting their cities and it never ends say you make a gigantic push into their territory and convert five of their seven cities aw too bad they had seventy inquisitors just around the corner diplomacy obviously not only do enemy ais completely ignore anything that you ask of them including pretty please could you like stop converting my fu ing cities but they also get angry as all hell if you ever do the same to them you wanted to settle in a certain location this is especially applicable to the early game and did so but then the kongo denounces you for settling to close oh hey one of their cities was shrouded in the fog of war whoops you settled somewhere then two turns later germany settles right next to you oh well darn guess germany hates you now obviously diplomacy is the largest issue with this game now while it might seem as though i riffed on the cons for longer its only because i feel very strongly about them and so remember them that much more clearly but really isn t that the case for most things we remember the bad with much more intense emotions than we do the positive and that is heavily reflected in this review but i know for a fact that i love this game dearly definitely check it out if you like 4x games but admittedly probably hold off if you were really into civilization v at the end of its development cycle
