2016 this game is like a piece of candy not any candy mind you it s the candy you eat when you crave for a very certain sweet it s one of those games you d want to experience every second of enjoy every bit of it do i recommend it ofcourse i do for the following reasons it s affordable price is quite reasonable the soundtrack is amazing probably one of the best in a while the story is unique and easy to follow the thing i loved the most about this game was the characters once in a while you really want to connect with your protagonist in a special way you know laughing and enjoying the moment as she does crying your eyes out when everything just goes to hell the determination she s feeling just feeling this rollercoaster of emotions you get to decide your faith ofcourse it s not all on you but when you have the opportunity to choose naturally the entertainment value of the game raises at least in my eyes very stylized it might not have the best graphics but the world it potrays has been done extremely well
