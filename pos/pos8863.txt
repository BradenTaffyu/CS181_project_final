my playtime clearly shows that i like the game i m a paradox fan whether it be hoi or ck and stellaris is one of if not my favorite out of those types of games they develop my only real complaint is less the game and more the company if you buy the base game from the start and buy the dlc as they release you won t really notice the cost as much the dlc are usually overpriced for what they add and realistically the value of my stellaris hoi4 and ck2 games and dlcs are probably considered material at this point due to how much it all cost i spread it out over the course of all the dlc releases but if you are trying to get into it for the first time good luck time to take out a personal loan because the game and the dlc will set you back a lot
