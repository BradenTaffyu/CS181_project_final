2022 early access review similar to factorio but with better graphics it seems like an isometric version of satisfactory great tech tree so far and you really get into patterned building though the geometry of the worlds sometimes makes that difficult it s quick enough to set up a new base with the proper rare materials the hardest part is knowing where you put everything a beacon that let you set waypoints would be fantastic highly recommend
