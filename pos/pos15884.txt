i think this is unironically my favorite fps there s a reason they made a casual game about power washing it s just so damn satisfying cleaning things with a heavy stream of water is satisfying enough on its own but this game adds the most satisfying dings i have ever heard when you complete a piece of something it doesn t feel better than this aside from the inherent satisfaction of the job you do there s still more solid game here the story is staggeringly well told and honestly enthralling to me i m not the type to get motivated to keep playing because of a game s story but that s absolutely what happened here you get so intricately familiar with the stuff you clean that the story can be told through details that you yourself naturally just notice slowly building up and up to a climax you expected but is even more exciting because of how you were able to predict it this is how you tell a damn story also the dialogue in this game is completely unhinged and insane and i m genuinely terrified of whoever wrote this if they re human or otherwise they re otherwise the dlcs are great too don t let the mixed or mostly negative reviews dissuade you they re solid very thematic romps with lots of care and small details put into them the crossovers are insane of course spongebob back to the future warhammer 40k but they re honestly very clearly cared for by the devs and infused with so much love and character the only reason they re reviews are as negative as they are is due to their lengths which yes are short but i still find that a pretty ridiculous reason given that they re a fun few hours my favorite one is the back to the future one btw also if you re a completionist make sure to look up the special achievement for the job you re about to do before you do it so you don t have to do the job twice powerwash sim is a clean and ironically low pressure game awash with character and flooded with charm objective 8 10 subjective 9 10
