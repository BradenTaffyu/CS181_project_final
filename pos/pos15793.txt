2022 i have played over 400 hours of this game and i will continue to do so i have just finished the main story line and all the maps are beautiful and just hella satisfying to clean the game is relaxing and as a person who routinely suffers from anxiety i find the game almost like my happy place when i am having a bad day or anxious about a situation that has come up this game helps i hope the developers know how much i love this game and i am hoping they will continue to update with new maps even if the career mode is now complete i would very much love to see new map updates as this is going to be a game i will always return to thank you so much power wash devs it has been an awesome year of cleaning and i look forward to the years to come
