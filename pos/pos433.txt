2016 i met the girl of my dreams i visited her every day and talked about everything i could think of i showered her with gifts time went on and i continued to do everything i could to make her like me it was time for the spring dance this was my chance i went up to her and asked her if she would dance with me she politely refused i went home and cried and did the same in stardew valley real reviewthis game is fantastic and incredibly enjoyable somehow i have been able to amass 15 hours in the game already after 2 days during a school week and there seems to be tons left to explore and unlock from mining to fishing to farming and just exploring and having fun i always feel like i have something to do and with the wide variety of things to do even if i get bored of one activity the other activity is so different that it becomes completely enjoyable again the gameplay is deep you feel accomplished when you plant and water crops for the first time you feel excited when you finally get to harvest the crops you ve watered every day pulling up a big fish is equally satisfying and getting to the next level in the mines is fantastic talking to npcs isn t particularly exciting as there aren t gobs of dialogue but there s still a pleasant amount to keep me wanting to talk getting an npc to like you makes me feel happy though there could be a bit of polishing in this way i ve noticed a couple of spelling errors in the dialogue and sometimes wish i could know more about a character but i m still pleased with what there is i ve never played harvest moon or rune factory which i ve heard is what this game was inspired from so i can t say how similar it is to either but since this is my first time playing a game like this it has been awesome not knowing what to expect but if you ve played either game before and liked them i would assume this would be a great updated version for you also this game was never in early access and was made by one developer which is such a pleasant change from what has been the good and the badprossimple diverse satisfyingly enjoyable gameplay that is hard not to love even after hoursunique lively characters and a beautiful world to exploreinteresting developments in the story and characters that helps fill in the occasional slow parts of the game a lot of high quality gameplay spent 15 hours playing thus far and it seems like i ve only scratched the surface beautiful graphics for a pixel gamewell suiting music and sound effects that fit well into the mood of the gamegreat map that might seem small at first but has a lot more depth to it than first thoughtconsnpc dialogue could be better in my opiniona few very minor bugs that don t affect much but should still be brought up spoiler maybe you have to replant after each season causing you to lose any currently planted crops excluding a couple crops like corn it would be nice to know this ahead of time or at least make it clearer as it was quite frusturating for me to wake up to all my cauliflower that would have been ready in a few days now wilted i know this may be obvious to hm players but to players new to the genre like myself it would be nice if this was mentioned edit players now receive a letter two weeks before end of spring stating that this happens thank you dev the map showing the location of your character needs improvement as it is now it just gives you a general idea of where you are which isn t that bad but i would prefer if it showed the exact location night lighting could be improved tldr stardew valley is an amazing game and going to go on my list as one of my favorites its intuitive unique gameplay is fresh to see i would say that it s probably not for everyone but i think everyone could enjoy at least a part of it well worth the 14 99 price tag and excited to see what the developer has in store
