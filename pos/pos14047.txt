2019 this game is amazing if you enjoy factorio you will likely enjoy this very similar in their core elements of progress and goal different systems though oni to me compared to factorio at least is more about management rather than ramp your production after 560 or so hours i launched my first rocket this was because my play style is to play until i get a new playstyle for my next base eager to try it out i end up starting a new one before i progress far enough while i reached that stage my play time in that was about 100 hours i am guessing i was about 3 4th of the way from beating the game i am very distracted from real life responsibilities when playing this because of how invested i am in it that can be good but it can also be bad not every game suits to everyone s playstyle this should be obvious if what i have described so far appeals to you even slightly i highly recommend this game i have played plenty of games and i am confident that as of 2019 this is my favorite game ever played klei is an amazing company who always produced fun and engaging games i just cannot recommend this game enough if you have any interest in this if you are on the fence at all at least watch some videos on the game
