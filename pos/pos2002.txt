not gonna lie i was skeptical about this but i saw zanny playing it so i give it a try what the fussy about and about an hour i was kinda addictive to this and then another hour i was like wait a minute this looks like my jam and then so on and on until i beat the jedi knight story i was like ok maybe this game is not like any mmorpg i known so i yeah i recommend this game it s free and have 8 each class story so i got 100 hours of gameplay and don t forget this is mmorpg and of course it s have microtransaction but again if you don t wanna subscribe to this game you can still have 100 of hours to get into this game
