2021 pretty fun game but i play it pretty much entirely as a single player game fun to just do the story missions and experience the plot of the game the classes are varied and each have their own story giving it pretty descent replayability subscription not needed but gives some convenience items if anything it s free and gives a good star wars story seems to have a lot of things to do for people that are really into mmo stuff but frankly i just ignore all that i ll play the story stuff and be done i have no interest teaming up with other players for doing pvp
