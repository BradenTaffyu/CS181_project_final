2020 so please realize what you re buying here is an engine capable of simulating physics on a table that s what this entire thing is what you do with it is up to you literally almost any tabletop game board game card game and some that aren t even any of those are yours for the taking so go out onto the workshop find a game you like play it with your buds and have a good time and if there isn t anything on there for you then make it or come up with something else this program is legendary as far as i m concerned if the 20 price tag and my hundreds of hours is any revelation to you then get it
