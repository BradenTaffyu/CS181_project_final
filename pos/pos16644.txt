2021 early access review today i lost another save i had nearly twenty hours logged from the last two days alone and to a single mistake which i already knew to avoid it was lost within seconds despite being straddled by a helmet and seat belt thankfully after four 5 hard seltzers and two tequila shots it doesnt seem so important and i think im ready to try again maybe i ll stop playing for good after this next life
