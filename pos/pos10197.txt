2017 early access review 6 years later still the same feeling when i started the game and still have my army of chickens learning curve is not too bad picking up everything back up once again wasn t too difficult love the mods and how much you can do and the story you choose always will be one of my top 3 games to play original review 2017 i was not sure if this game was worth the 30 bucks well the amount of hours i ve played and enjoyed i say it was well worth it there is so much into this game that will make you loose track of time it did not take long for me to get the basics down and i was doing pretty well too watching some tutorials will definitely help you and after that you ll have an amazing time building and maintaining your colony there is so much content to this game it s amazing that there is more content to be added there are castastrophic events that you would have to deal with such as raids toxic ship etc and there are good and crazy ones too like getting invaded by 30 muffalos and boy did we stay comfy throughout the whole winter season also having to raise chickens was a crazy experience i created a farm for my chickens and later they laid eggs that hatched to chicks worst mistake of my life to create a farm for them because i had over 100 chickens and my food supply was diminishing lol i m not doing that again i really recommend this game every colony has its own story and there s so much to it that will keep you playing continuously and entertained
