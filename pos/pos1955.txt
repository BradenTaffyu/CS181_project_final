2023 i ve played nearly every aaa title in 2023 and the game i enjoyed the most is this old dated theme park ride from 2011 why is this game so good graphics hold up extremely well due to the art style and the game feels after 10 years of updates extremely polished as a player of the original kotor games and sw galaxies pre post updates i found this game to be impressive interestingly i was taken aback by a lot of dark themes and mature dialogue which was enjoyable compared to modern disney era of star wars in 175 hours i played only one character following one story going through the sith academy starting as a peon being betrayed back stabbed manipulated left for dead outsmarting rivals discovering relics and secrets elevating through the rankings of the sith defeating contemporaries and rising to become one of the dark lord of the sith on the dark council more interesting of an experience to be had than in jedi survivor which i finished in only 10 hours in swtor i stumbled upon side quests on planets off the beaten path that answered lore questions about the rakata i had from the original knights of the old republic back in 2004 it honors the legacy of the first games very well
