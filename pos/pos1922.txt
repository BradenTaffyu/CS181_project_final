2021 by far the best mmo out there but most importantly by far the best star wars game out there you can play it as if it was a singleplayer rpg you get all the typical mmo content like pvp raids etc in addition each class has their own long story full of dialogue choices and everything you d expect from a great singleplayer rpg i won t talk about the story here to not spoil anything just know that i highly recommend imperial agent and sith inquisitor swtor is worthy of being basically a kotor 3 in terms of story it s the closest thing to the true star wars unlike the disney stuff you can be who you want to be you choose between jedi knight sith warrior jedi consular sith inquisitor trooper bounty hunter smuggler imperial agent each class has their own fully unique story each has 2 advanced classes for you to choose from for example sith inquisitor can choose to become a sith sorcerer rarely using a lightsaber and focusing on unleashing full potential of the dark side or sith assassin a darth maul class basically jedi knight can choose between guardian who uses a lightsaber defensive fight style and the force or sentinel who uses 2 lightsabers and focuses on high damage a trooper can choose between a commando or a vanguard and so on in addition each advanced class has 3 specs to choose from all of this and some expansion content is free if you subscribe you will get access to all the expansions and other bonuses the amount of visual customization transmog weapons etc truly allows you to create whatever character you want all transmog items and all cartel market items can be earned for free because they are all sellable on the market for in game credits that you earn by playing and can farm like in any other mmo the expansions rise of the hutt cartel shadow of revan continue the amazing storylines knights of the fallen empire and knights of the eternal throne take already amazing storytelling to another level it feels like those 2 easily could be their own game you have all kinds of content like galactic starfighter where you as the name suggests take part in space battles piloting your own starfighter this is truly the best sw game i ve ever player and i played almost all of them i personally play singleplayer story focused rpgs almost exclusively and i hate mmos this game however is just something else it s both the only mmo i like it s also one of the best singleplayer rpgs out there not technically speaking but in terms of the story content in it i absolutely love this game my favourite class is sith inquisitor i loved all of them and enjoyed all the story content of all classes but sith inquisitor and sith warrior gave me something that no other game ever did a true feeling of being a dark side user i ve read the books about darth bane and while playing sith inquisitor exploring korriban s tombs searching for dark side artifacts and holocrons and without spoiling anything doing what sith tend to do in the old republic era i got that feeling from the books and that s just the beginning of the story i m gonna stop here because i could write a whole appreciation book about this game and i d spoil everything for you in the process tl dr is this game has everything for everyone rich story with choices and great characters customization and all the mmo stuff for people who like mmos but for me personally this is a singleplayer rpg and most of it except few expansions is free one last note i played a lot more than my steam hours show i played this game since 2014 or so just added it to steam recently to have it in one place with all my other games if i had to guess how many hours i have in total it s really difficult to say because of how this game and it s story content makes the time flow because i played 62 hours this month i m gonna guess my total since 2014 is easily in thousands
