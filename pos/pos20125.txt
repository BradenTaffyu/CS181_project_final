2017 i played fallout 4 on ps4 when it came out first i thought it was and was a waste of money and expected new vegas to be similar in fact i only bought new vegas because people claimed it to be the best fallout game but i was plesantly when i found myself to be enjoying the game to me fallout 4 was very bland and and most locations felt very generic and although many of the towns in new vegas were not that exciting when i first entered the new vegas strip at first my mind was blown or when you discover jacobstown at first and the suprisement you feel when see that the guards are supermutants or swimming to the bottom of lake mead makes for all the dull towns like goodsprings and primm fallout new vegas is not a casual game and you will have to put plenty of hours into it to get the most enjoment possible you do not buy new vegas as a pick up and play open world shooter like many ubisoft games or sadly fallout 4 new vegas has absolutely terrible gunplay which might put some people off like it did to me at ther start but once you get used to it and start using v a t s you forget how bad it is and slaying ghouls and radscorpions becomes second nature to you the point i am trying to get across here is that if haven t played new vegas or like myself hated fallout 4 go on give it a try that s what steam refunds are for right
