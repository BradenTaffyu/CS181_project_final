2020 nice game for ones who love three kingdom history but the city name especially those spots around each city with varied features lack a specific history background causing a loss of immersive gaming experiences for me and other history lovers which is a shame other than that the heir system is even a greater manifestation of the messed up understanding of chinese ancient history of the developers for example it is extremely significant for a ruler to make sure his sons are going to safely take over the power after his death which is why there had been so many domestic infighting throughout lots of regimes overall i love this game and i enjoyed it more than civilization because of the three kingdom background all i have stated above just means that i strongly believe this could have been a much more exquisite piece of work with a bit more attention to the chinese history timeline also i m looking forward to seeing the new update coming in a few days it is worth a full price purchase after the recent free patch update the game gets better with much more details to be discovered and more strategies to be deployed this patch has made the late game much more fun to play with comparing to the earlier version
