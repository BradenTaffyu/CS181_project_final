2022 fallout 76 is a game of contradictions which at once improves upon the series formula in ways while also fumbling some of the elements you d expect out of any fallout game it s difficult to definitively say hey if you liked fo3 nv or 4 that you ll certainly like 76 it s just too different in the ways you d expect a game in this series to play but that also doesn t mean there isn t a lot of fun to be had let me just go over why i ve dumped 100 hours into it across steam and xbox and this is without knowing how the game was at launch or pre wastelanders 1 the world is legitimately one of the best designed in the series that is the map is so outrageously huge 4x larger than fo4 according to bethesda and yet it also never really feels empty fo76 s appalachia feels expansive diverse and always seems to find new ways to surprise if you have a few hours to spare you can be in a toxic desert one moment abandoned farmlands in another a crumbling charleston the next and then you re off into the hills where you ll encounter raider camps and an untouched golf resort for as much as i love nv there is just way more interesting things here to stumble upon along with some amazing vistas that had me smashing the screenshot button i d go so far as to say this is perhaps my favorite fo map so of the 4 3d entries the downside here is that the wastelanders patch is what introduced npcs before that there wasn t as much emphasis on character stories like that so if you want to head into a town and find it overflowing with npcs you won t get that here appalachia is not alive with npcs in the same way the other games were it worked for me on a certain level though since the idea is that you re reclaiming a part of america that had mostly died off during the war people lived after the bombs fell or attempted to live and then either moved on or died if you enjoyed piecing together environmental storytelling in previous games there s a ton here as far as npcs though you won t find many outside a few specific spots 2 the main storyline is actually pretty good i enjoy with a game attempts to give players as much agency as possible nv did this perfectly fo4 forced you to play a parent who is searching for their son which i disliked a lot fo76 allows you a lot more wiggle room to approach the main storyline as you see fit you never feel pressured to take a certain side or behave a certain way you can be cruel all the way through or as benevolent as the wasteland allows the downside there is not a whole lot of reactivity in fo76 outside of a handful of moments there aren t many times in the quests themselves that provide you the kind of freedoms any other fallout title usually allows i simply haven t run into any moments in the story where consequences were a thing this hurts the experience but the game still allows you to express yourself in other ways in the open world because of how open the game is i rarely felt like i was being railroaded into doing anything 3 the multiplayer now all the faults in this game can ultimately be traced back to the multiplayer and how it was implemented was it worth the sacrifice maybe this once i can t deny that i ve been having a blast running around appalachia with friends looting places empty taking on waves of enemies tacking events and bosses plus there s the interactions with the community who are by and large very kind the game allows you to create your own custom settlement and basically at will drop it wherever there s room some of the players predictably have gone all in on this feature and have built some amazing spaces out there in the wasteland that are a joy to visit plus reaching a certain point in the game allows players to nuke areas of their choice so you ll often see mushroom clouds rising up in the hills followed by a concussive boom from almost anywhere in the map the downside is that you re playing a game that s historically been singleplayer and now it s always online this means vats does not stop time there is no waiting feature bobbleheads and magazines provide temporary buffs stealing is no longer punished unless it s on a player s workshop and the ai is abnormally dumb to accommodate an online environment plus there s a player economy that needs to be balanced which can interfere with certain builds being viable or certain things being salable and of course when the servers go down for maintenance you cannot play the game 4 random positives inon zur s soundtrack is amazing perhaps the best he s done in the series there really aren t that many instanced areas which means you can travel and explore and loot for hours without hitting a loading screen some of the quests even if you re not really talking to npcs are some of the best in the series there s a lot of fun stuff hidden in all the game s text sometimes hinting at loot or secret areas as is tradition all this to say i think if you re a fan of specific elements of the fallout formula fallout 76 may potentially blow you away with the sheer amount of stuff that it has going on the amount of places to explore the stories to stumble across whether it s fulfilling a dead photographer s dream of touring appalachia exploring a family s failed underground fallout shelter or piecing together the slow collapse of a group of survivors who attempted to set up medical outposts throughout the region even if you never want to touch the multiplayer there s a lot of fun to be had
