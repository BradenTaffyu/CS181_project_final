2019 as a long time total war fan i wasn t looking forward to this one i have no interest in the time period or location my favorites in the series are rome 2 and the warhammer series i decided to give three kingdoms a try and now i don t think i can ever go back it is so good it makes every previous tw seem archaic specifically diplomacy and the campaign side of things have been improved so much the choices you make affect so much more with coalitions alliances and vassals there is a lot more character development to the point that you care so much about your council members family members and allies these individuals become intertwined forcing you to really think about each negotiation indeed if you lose a general you care about your other generals in battle will go berserk with rage if they have developed a good relationship another impressive feat is performance aside from a weird ui issue on the campaign map side battles play absolutely beautiful i have engaged large battles as often as i can to really push my computers limit i7 7700k 16gb ram 1080 duke video card and i rarely get a noticable drop as a side note the music is awesome whether it s when a battle is about to commence or during the battle itself the fanfare really draws you in three kingdoms has not just set a standard for the tw series it s set a standard for strategy games you can tell how much work went in to this game and how much attention to detail there is it is truly an impressive experience and i can t recommend it enough
