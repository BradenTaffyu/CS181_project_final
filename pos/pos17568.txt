2019 dlc is not needed to enjoy this game yes the paid dlc is kinda of pricey and you should wait for sales but they are by no means required to enjoy the game there are not any core features lock behind dlc only extra lords and factions even off of the base game i got over 100 hours before i was interested in the dlc and i m only now getting wood elves and beastmen with the sega sale this is a great game you dont have to buy dlc for if you don t want to or can t afford it
