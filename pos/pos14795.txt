2020 early access review very good game why 1 better car physics than most other racing games2 physics like you ve never seen in another game before realistic lighting smoke and lense effects it s simply gorgeous3 this games blows my mind even with just the realism and immersiveness of the sound effects4 it s dang fun there is still one big caveat though due to the game s use of the opengl rendering api people with amd graphics cards will get less performance than the equivalent nvidia counterpart that isn t to say the game will run bad people with amd gpus should just instead lower the graphics settings and the game will also run at solid framerate hopefully the developer will consider making a vulkan or directx implementation in the future which would boost amd users fps drastically update good news dev said he s currently hiring someone who will try to port the game to directx and vulkan another edit the game has just got an update which now makes amd cards perform almost as well as the equivalent nvidia counterpart ps return to monke
