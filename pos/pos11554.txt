2016 early access review when i played the game for the first time i just thought what is this but after some time and updates i thought its getting really good so atm im playing on the alpha 14 7 and i have to say that the game can have a good future if the admins continue the work its one of the best survival crafting games i know so far atm i would say 7 out of 10
