by now most of the issues have been ironed out the game now runs quite well looks really great the world design is very immersive maybe for the first time i have enjoyed a single player rpg as much since skyrim or cp77 the first season of the game i spent most of my time doing just side quests and collecting things around the castle this part of the game can be quite engaging as well encourage yourself to walk towards your destination instead of fast travel flying over it as you can find many random interesting things along the way this is the hallmark of a good open world rpg there is one con for me i have an oled hdr monitor and can not recommend enabling hdr in this game i cannot get it to be properly calibrated the overall atmosphere of the scenes look better in sdr mode
