2015 tl dr if you look for very emotional games with amazing story and characters you have to play lis i wanna start by saying that dontnod s developers deserve all the praises omg life is strange i love this game i ll be honest here i was so fascinated throughout the whole story i went blind into the game without knowing much and i didn t expect to be mindblown so it was one hella surprise it quickly became one of the best games ever for me d of course everyone got their own points which make a game best or good but for me the most important part are them strong and tearful emotions it s a very interesting and beautifully crafted masterpiece which focuses heavily on story and characters with fantastic time bending gameplay you will care about the characters a lot much love to max and chloe d ultra crush on m c lol who feel so real as characters by the way their voice actors hannah telle and ashly burch do superb work in the roles also the soundtrack is so wonderfully beautiful it hits you right into the deep emotions lis is like an amazing journey through friendship and life it s as if you are there with max making all these moments become so real i would say that it s kinda a mix of telltale games heavy rain 80 s twin peaks tv show and butterfly effect movie it made me remember my younger days and old friends which is amazing i was able to relate to the characters a lot especially max because of my similar experiences during school life relationships and shyness for example i don t often play a game with so much decision making and some of them honestly feel super difficult so need to think a while about what choice is right it has a lot of funny stuff and some puzzles too you make your own unique adventure in cool ways during first minutes it might seem like only some typical school drama stuff if you aren t still interested in it but trust me the more you play the more awesome and mysterious it gets and it will surprise you as you progress further you will know what i mean as it gets jaw dropping i was already addicted to it from the start of ep1 the journey through max s and chloe s time together is unforgettable experience to me with choices that made me laugh and cry tears of joy and sadness i didn t think i would cry rivers at first but especially endings of every episode and 5th it was unavoidable and i m a sucker for this kind of story rich experiences about friendship yeah i do love games that make me shed some manly tears because not many have given me something like this during my 20 years of playing and i personally think it is truly special for a game to give that it is one of the best game i have ever played lis touches closely to my heart and soul anyways long story short everyone should live through this strange life i know developers make art when they make me care about characters so much to feel this way and when i can t stop thinking about the journey i rate it hella 11 10 thank you so much dontnod bae 4ever it inspired me to start drawing again too after 8 10 years now after almost a year i still listen the ost every day play it think of it read fanfictions and made me meet fantastic friends from all around the world lis hella changed my life 3 and i think it can make people to become better
