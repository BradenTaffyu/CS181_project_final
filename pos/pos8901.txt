2016 i have played many paradox games in the past euiv ckii victoria ii and even hoi iii although i didnt like it much i have spent well over 1000 hours in these games combined so my expectations were high stellaris delivered though it is everything i could have hoped for and more i expect to play this game for hundreds of hours to come i have never reviewed a game before even my beloved ckii but i thought this was well worth the effort
