2020 product received for free this is pretty much my most favorite game on steam i ve started about 3 days ago and already dumped a good 60 hours into it i mostly play solo now as my other friend doesn t play much or isn t as passionate about it as me however this game is enjoyable when you re alone just a tad bit harder as i write this review i m on spring day 15 year 3 i ve got a good amount of energy as i ve been playing the event s and getting the stardrops if they re available the mines caves are so fun i love a challenge the music is very soothing this game reminds me of terraria but obviously less intense and more calming as i said before it s fun with friends or your lover or a sibling anybody but it s very fun as well solo so don t be afraid to get this game that it ll be boring because you play alone trust me it s not
