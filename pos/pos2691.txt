2018 mind blowndivinity original sin 2 is easily my top game of 2017 and probably up there in my list of most favorite games of all time my mind was completely blown every step of the way through this fantastic journey start to finish positives you do not need to play its predecessor to understand what s going on in this title that voice acting every line every banter even the narration when nothing needs to be said between characters it s fantastic a beautifully detailed living world you can see how much love and work when into this so much to explore so much to see so many little secrets tucked away here and there not to mention while in combat every single turn needs to be thought out depending on the enviroment around you the assortment of items weapons and armor is definitely not lacking the ability to freely make your own class for yourself and your companions mix and match whatever skills you want whatever suits your playstyle if you want a skeleton guy to be your main healer with necromancy then do it i finished the game on the easiest difficulty in about 85 90 hours give or take and that s without finishing all the side quests or companion quests the amount of content stuffed into this game will leave you plenty to do co op yes you can play the entire game start to finish with a friend with a few friends with strangers it doesn t matter dungeon master mode does creating entire campaigns like dungeons and dragons appeal to you then heck yes i never really took much time to dabble in it but i can see the appeal to it replayability this is huge for me so many choices that will leave you wondering what if i had done this differently negatives it s been a fair bit since i played but i had an issue finishing a companion quest that was tied into the same npc as another companion i had once completed one companion was stuck and could not progress i ended up finishing the game without completing it a few bugs here and there but nothing gamebreaking most notably in the arx there was one house with locked doors in which you could run right through them i noticed here and there a fair bit of an fps drop in combat when my screen is exploding with spell effects divinity original sin 2 is unforgiving doesn t coddle and definitely doesn t hold your hand but taking the time to learn the combat system and all the little bits and pieces is worth every penny from your wallet and every second of your time find more reviews at balance patch
