2018 while the story and role play mechanics might not be as great as the other fallout games i still think this is an awesome game the story is still good fun in my eyes the game world is beautiful and settlements are a great way to be creative and build your own towns the thing that makes this game awesome are the mods you can literally download a mod for anything in this game graphics models environment mods new settlements everything it just never gets boring trying new mods out and play the game over and over again definitely worth the buy
