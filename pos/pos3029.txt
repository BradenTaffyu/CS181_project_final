2018 divinity original sin 2 is a true modern crpg instead of just emulating the infinity engine itself it preserves the old school soul and complexity includes all the things you would expect from ye olden days adds many positive surprises on top of it then frames them into amazing shiny 3d visuals with functional ui and tons of convenience even though there is number 2 in the title it can be played as a standalone game without prior knowledge of the previous os or others in the divinity series the game world is just packed with stuff to do every few steps you bump into something new happening and that s above and below ground as the game features quite a lot of caves dungeons ancient ruins cellars and even a pocket universe the player has always plenty options to chose from how to proceed abilities like persuasion or lockpicking are really useful and talking to animals is just awesome the story is serious in tone with many mature subplots but it s not lacking some needed moment to moment humor either usually when doing side missions not as unnecessary comic relief to main line there are many memorable characters situations the companions are great and well fleshed out each of them quite distinct their stories often intertwine with the main plot so they all feel relevant while the game is fantasy in nature and there are plenty of things we re used to there are also many quirks and ideas unique only to this world enough for it to feel fresh most of the time it s not perfect though but close there are limits to what you can do although there is very high chance you ll be able to execute most plans you come up with the pacing was a little weird as well the 2nd area with driftwood was just too huge and not particularly structured they might have been aiming at more open feel after the initial island but it just turned out to be tiring by the end of it and i couldn t wait to get out of there i m aware that if i wasn t a person hell bent on scouring every inch of the map and doing absolutely everything i might feel otherwise but that s just the way i like to play so that part didn t mesh well with my game style i had to take a break a bit after that but later areas nameless isle and arx were great again part of that issue might have been due to combat there was just too much of it for my taste the combat at first is quite confusing since many useful skills are too spread out between different lines and it introduces some new concepts like surfaces then you get the hang of it and it s fun for some time and later on you get overwhelmed by sheer amount if it there are many epic fights all right but at the same time even though i appreciated the variety and scope of them sometimes i just wanted to get it over with and progress a bit faster turn based battles can take a while but overall d os2 is simply outstanding highly recommended written after 173 hours played 84 of 97 87 achievements earned
