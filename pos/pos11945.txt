2017 early access review greeeeat another indie pixel art pretend metroidvania roguelike that markets itself as being hard we all needed another one of those right why recommended this one is actually worth your time and moneythe pixel art graphics are done by folks who actually know how human eyes work and use color and visual cues in such a way that s not only pleasing to look at but is conducive to enjoyable gameplay gorgeous game and just as functional this also goes for the audio and combat feel as well just about everything feels tight and responsive more on that at the end though the level design aesthetics are brilliant and for a brutally hard roguelite hurr durr it s rarely cheap or unfairdead cells borrows much of its progression system from games like rogue legacy every run really does feel like progress and really good runs are very profitable and you make big leaps that you can build off of so dying and starting over doesn t feel like a massive loss of your timespeaking of dead cells does something that literally no other roguelite i ve played does it treats you like an adult you can exit the game from any run in progress and come back to it later and resume it exactly as it was why is this the only one of these indie roguelites that does this why does every other roguelite dev think it s cool to frustrate their customers and waste their time as a bonus it doesn t feel at all like early access right now it feels like a complete game and i ve yet to encounter a major bug glitch or crash after over 35 hours get it now while it s still in ea because it can only get betterthat said there are some cons you unlock new better equipment as you play but you don t get to choose what equipment you start with and the equipment drops around the procedurally generated maps are a gamble so sometimes you re stuck with garbage equipment through entire runs which is never fun if the dev s implemented either a system where you can pick your starting equipment or if you could at least sell back blueprints of weapons and skills you don t like so they don t spawn anymore i ll delete this con from this reviewalso they really need to do something about ledges ladders if they re going to insist on such tight corridors densely populated with difficult enemies i have bricked at least a dozen good runs because i initiated the fight only to have my character annoying glue himself to a ledge or ladder rope pipe this problem is universally acknowledged by other players so i hope the dev s figure it out one day
