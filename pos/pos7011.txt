2021 early access review some spoilery stuff but hopefully enough to prevent you tearing out your hair in frustration if you love figuring it all out yourself and won t just give up and refund the game don t read what is below but i wished i d know some things at the start this game could be frustrating to someone just downloading it going in on the normal difficulty or into some online worlds they join vs creating a world there are things you have but lots of things you don t know exist and don t know what combinations allow you to open up new things you can build meanwhile the animals shark others are dangerous food and water are a crisis and you do things that aren t too bright building stuff while you need the resources for more important stuff drinking seawater etc i would recommend the following steps 1 read some community or internet beginners guides maybe some videos will help 2 understand the order of criticality for items you need to secure clean water production through a working purifier and a plastic cup you need to take water to the purifier and to take water out to drink materials to build a replacement hook when your hook fails a paddle helps steer you into flotsam streams or get yourself to a place where your raft will stay snug to an island until you can find enough rocks etc to build a one use anchor a fishing rod so you can catch fish and you want to get a grill up as soon as you can as it increases the value of food after that a one use anchor a reusable one is a long way off planks to replace what the sharks tear off some sun shade would help if you can spare the materials and your research table to you can start analyzing the new finds above and below water so you can learn more things you can build 3 start a creative island just so you can see all the things you could one day buy in a normal game world and just build stuff and experiment with how to get water purified a grill to work all the way up to figuring out crops and biofuel production you can t go anywhere but you can get the feeling for the stuff you can build how it goes together in systems and what you can produce from some of them 4 start a peaceful world to begin to play like the game food and water matter you have to watch yourself diving or swimming away from your raft you need to harvest resources from islands and mostly from flotsam flows etc but the wildlife is not hostile that means the shark won t tear your raft apart and the other various hostile animals will not be beating you down whenever you get close you will have to use the research table a lot with new stuff to get the designs for new items but if you did step 3 you already know what s out there in the game only once you can master those two levels then i d consider easy or normal level play in survival mode once you know how to manage resources collect them etc and all the systems you can then add on more hostile environment and animal life i think the game is great i got it for my daughter and wife to play with me i m glad i took the learning curve and fought my way through many deaths to discover what i now know they would have given up on the game that s about the point i figured out a peaceful world would have given us a better environment for them to start with which is what we will do when they join in there s a few glitches in the middle of some actions you can t do some other stuff that can be annoying but just change what s in your hands and options will come back watch out for opening loot chests or chopping stuff down when your inventory is full you want to have clear space to receive any new types of items that eventually makes storage container construction important and don t swim away from your raft get tired and not get back or have to swim uphill against big waves to get back to your raft even if the sharks don t slay you you ll still have a problem and make sure your raft is steered to a decent spot where the current will push it up against the island and it won t immediately float away trying to pull a raft back to an island with a paddle is a failure prone operation even modest current makes that fairly difficult with a plastic paddle there s something kind of zen about fishing cooking harvesting flotsam purifying seawater etc it s kind of relaxing if you are a bit ahead of the surviving point and island exploration is fun until you run into hostile animal life once you master the basics you can start to research better gear visit larger islands dive deeper etc but you ve got to get the hang of the basics first and going solo nobody can help respawn you on the harder levels of the game it may not be as pretty as some undersea games but the gameplay is half minecraft and half survival and exploration it s a good mix
