2017 as a professional truck driver of 17 years who lives in california i am fairly impressed with this game the developers did a great job capturing the feel and geography of the southwest and truck operations there were some little niggling graphical oversights no joshua trees in the mojave desert biplanes patrolling calfornia freeways but they are minor complaints i was able to recognize specific landmarks and though the developers took some artistic license with the freeway systems they remain close to their real life counterparts i would enjoy seeing more states added i think the western 11 states would be good the central us would just be too boring to recreate anyone up for a drive across nebraska kansas north south dakota but the east coast could be a blast to drive their could be more truck specific options added like an interaxle differential switch or an expert option where the player has to adjust the tandems and fifth wheel slide to make legal weight or if you are a real nerd the requirement to operate under the 11 14 70 hour rules i look forward to seeing more states and trucks added and i highly recommend this game
