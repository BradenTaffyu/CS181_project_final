2021 american truck sim is legitimately probably the best catalyst for novel thought out there besides a heroic dose or an extended soulful backpacking trip it sounds pretty boring it s a truck sim what the are you going to do besides drive from point a to b well i mean honestly it really is only that plus some it s better to think of this game as more of a tool than as an entertainment device while you listen to an audiobook podcast a more complex album or get lost in sorting out your own thoughts the game quadruples your engagement it basically acts as the perfect fidget spinner which sounds trucking stupid to say but it s true the game s environment and gameplay of managing and driving a massive 18wheeler across the united states provides just enough engagement to put your brain into the perfect learning mode all the content you engage with passively and might tune out subconsciously but would rather remain fixed to and engaged with gains the ability to perpetually grip you and consequently everything they have to teach or have you experience can be received in absolute it s based besides its mentioned utility the game is also incredibly well built by a dev team that genuinely cares about the product they re making and who continues to flesh it out with more content and soul all the time the game is filled with the cities you d expect to find well designed and are in a game like this but it also contains plenty of small towns and roads that are fantastic to drive through and really flesh out the world and show the soul of what most states truly are definitely pick it up if you have interest in it there s a lot of dlc too but on sale it s all relatively cheap and is absolutely worth it i can definitely recommend some jazz like hermitix anchor fm a podcast in your target language coffeebreaklanguages com or the epic greg sadler when jiving
