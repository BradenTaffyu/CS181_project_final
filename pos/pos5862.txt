2020 early access review so a lot of people have been bashing this game saying negative things about various features crashes missing content guess what it is called early access for a reason there will be bugs there will be features missing things will not be 100 finished still work in progress people complain about the story campaign it s a sandbox game you doofus patched people complain about crashes that is what early access is for to find the reason s why it crashes to fix it also the developers put out patches everyday to fix crashes bugs and what not people complain about lack of content the developers literally said the game is not finished and is missing features people say the engine is disappointing have you even played warband before people complain about facial expressions why are people even complaining about this it looks fine sure it s not 100 fine tuned but warband didn t even have this people complain about arrow drop this isn t cod gravity with arrows is something you have to deal with people complaining about slow skill increase you are telling me you can be a legendary smith after making two swords it takes time to increase your skills and no it does not take forever just because you play 2 hours doesn t mean you will be able to use a bow like legolas people complain about how higher tier clans have more influence than you this is irrelevant as influence is gained based on fiefs owned and from battles not clan tier people complain about lords not joining their faction when you ask them you want a lord to abandon his her king queen to join you and then be called a coward betrayer deserter for the rest of theirs lives yea no they demand huge payment you are asking them to literally betray their king queen patched people complain about various current unbalanced features again early access features will be unbalanced and guess what the developers already patched a lot of the unbalanced features people are too freaking impatient people saying the game is empty and has no content there is literally the same amount of content in bannerlord than there is in warband plus there is additional features you obviously have no idea what you are talking about people complaining about the graphics wtf are you even talking about sub par graphics for 2020 do you even see the improvement they made over warband did you even play the damn game this isn t a triple a company who have thousands of people working on it there is so much more i can go over a lot of people just do not get the concept of what early access is so let me phrase it for you early access is for developers to put out their game early in order for them to allow the public play at the same time they get the public s opinions and comments on various features so that they can be balanced improved removed etc they also have crash reports to help fix any crashes that may occur early access is there for the developers not you leaving a bad review 4 days after release is extremely stupid you are leaving a bad review on features that will get fixed and patched in the weeks to come instead of giving the game a bad review why don t you post on their forums to give your input stop bashing this game for going into early access for those of you who are curious on getting the game get it the game is on sale you will have loads of fun playing don t let the negative reviews change your mind as a lot of them are just irrelevant and made by impatient people if you read all of this thank you for you time
