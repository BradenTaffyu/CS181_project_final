2015 it s as good as fallout 3 and new vegas were on release some things like bugs and menus are atrocious and the dialog is simplified in a bad way but the shooting feels better levelling is more streamlined and the crafting is really nice as someone who really disliked fo3 and played fo2 several dozen times i think this was worth the 35 euros i paid for it i m not sure i d recommend it full price considering some other exceellent games that were released this year
