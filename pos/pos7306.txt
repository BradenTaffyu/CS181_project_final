2023 would recommend if you re after a really chill game to play while listening to youtube or shows i like it not only for the chill driving but the fact that they add a bit of management where you can buy garages hire drivers and buy upgrade trucks each city dlc adds new stuff for you to deliver and they re very well done i would say buy it on sales but this game is worth full price but get dlcs on sales or at least explore more the base game before getting dlcs so you know that you really like it enough to invest more money
