2019 it s really hard to describe how i feel about this game but the conclusion first highly recommended my first impression was not that good bad environment graphic texture and my 1st run ended without too much surprise however it broke my common sense some time later when i made my 2nd and 3rd run with brand new visions of what the creator wanted to tell me i was genuinely astonished at how the story unfolds and all that lead to ending c d and e the game is more like a science fiction rather than an action adventure game they constructed the story and the world in a creative way so i consider having at least the first five endings collected is a completion of the whole story i was touched by both the story and the way it s been told especially when i was asked these questions during the final scene it made me feel that we players actually matter our spirit and our love to video game matter also the topic of scientific and technological ethic it brings up is something i myself am willing to dive in and think about i just love the creativity and the spirit they put into this piece of work showed me how thoughts and expressions evolve definitely a great game
