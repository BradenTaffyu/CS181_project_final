2018 important notes update after bethesda net problem and fallout 76 fiasco if you want to buy any bethesda games well buy it at your own risk i dislike and never support any microtransaction type in any game including this so called creation club or what peoples known mostly as paid mods but this thing is completely optional and never stopping you to modding this game from free mods you usually got or use for free let s put aside the negativity towards creation club this detailed review below it s all about the game itself gameplay etc based on my first 100 hours playtime with no dlc and mods installed and with mods installed after that detailed review pros this game has a nice and fluid graphics compared to the previous fallout series like fallout new vegas fallout 3 etc character creation make your own character look like as you want it to be fun and slightly immersive gameplay and sandbox elements like settlements builder addition make this game more immersive and addictive for some people high replayability replay value but limited replayability if you just want to replay it for the main story or alternate endings only plus you can mods this game as you want good and better combat mechanic system compared to the previous fallout cons fallout 4 main story seems lackluster compared to previous fallout like fallout new vegas in general compared to fallout new vegas fallout 4 has no karma system and lack of choice matter dialogue you will encounter several repetitive quest like defend this or attack that settlements related quest some faction related side quest etc if you were unfortunate you will encounter some bugged mission that you can t finish or start at all because the mission is not trigger or finish properly as it should be happen to me when i can t start progressing through shadow of steel mission let alone finish it i need to use in game console command to finish it overall if you are fallout series fans from day one maybe you will got a litle bit dissapointment in term of rpg element main story choice matter dialogue in this game but if you are looking for games that has character creation building and manage something open world somewhat immersive gameplay and environment and high replayability replay value i recommend this game 8 10
