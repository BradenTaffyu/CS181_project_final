2019 call of the wild oh how i love theee as long as i don t think about it tooooo much i came back to this after a 12 month sabbatical expecting a serious improvement to the underlying issues heard a rumour devs had decided to get serious about some of the glaring issues reported since day one errors that have somehow evaded correction because the dlc conveyor belt masked their view we re all aware ew has an executive structure chasing kudos and bonuses that sits above the dev team we know they are far too busy to listen to the rabble from the lower decks so this tl dr is just for them tl dr ffs let devs fix the freakin game properly now with the tl dr out of the way for you the serious stuff just yesterday i dropped a whitetail doe at 414m 453 yards and there was that rush you get when you make a good shot and for all its ills cotw does this very well it takes positioning thinking and preparation to make such a shot so sure while only a doe it was a rare chance to set for a shot that is on the very edge of the maximum range in cotw it s worth the slug because cotw is nowhere near a fait accompli arcade style sim most of the time you have to hunt you can stalk or ambush and even skill for same and eventually both but don t expect animals to walk up to you holding a target whispering please personally as an australian perhaps i like the long shot and with the africa dlc despite it s ugly environment i take great delight watching herds of wilderbeest well about 20 or 30 grazing in the shimmering heat as i watch a lion stalk a springbok a view i have through the scope at 350 metres indeed cotw is a brilliant atmospheric environment to play in sometimes frustrating rain and fog obscure your gameplay and wind will mess your shots but oh it is so so real a flash on the horizon can be counted off to the crack of thunder not like the many flash bang storms depicted in other titles sure the sound is off hey it s 5 kilometres away it should rumble guys not throw me out of my chair but it s a nice touch i feel cold wet or hot it s great the short visuals walking through crispy tundra grasses or autumnal forests with dappled sunlight is very very impressive some of the longer view up on mountain passes has an ugly jagged look to rocks and trees that makes me avoid looking watching some animals come out from behind plastic foliage can break the moment but up close ranges below 200m it s damn good the hunting at first is a mish mash of progression that really makes it frustrating for new guys so i urge you to work on the missions at the layton lakes or hirschfelden reserves to gain valuable dollars and experience you re after the money the xp the skills and perks necessary to unlock weapons and accessories to make your hunting experience easier and these serve as pretty good tutorials missions are a plenty on all reserves and can give you purpose if sand boxing the hunt doesn t suit if you ve never hunted you re in for a tough time stealth and environmental awareness are key to success in this and it will feel very grindy and slow first time around finding animals is easy once you know their routines and to be fair while they are effectively on rails they mimic rl pretty well finding rare diamonds is hard graft and can only really be done with experience it balances somewhat and quite well weapons are reasonable but i too often find i m looking for the right weapon and range and it s just not available even with weapon pack dlc so you often end up carrying more than you need when you want to do a general hunt and this can make carrying a blind or a tree stand a pain you can carry a tent and setup in situ but you know what if i can carry a damn tent that suddenly contains all my gear it really is only a small step to let me choose my damn backpack size to something a little bigger all that walking and hauling 800kg packs of meat out of the forest should stand for something right we have about 3 scopes for rifles with the best being a horribly small apertured mess that has you set what feels like a foot back that leaves many shots dazzled by reflections i end up using the hyperion scope ultimately and in fact was what i used for the 414m shot mentioned earlier glaring anomalies in animal ai like whole herds stuck in place or individuals being stuck in trees is really really horrible to witness you re torn between blasting the whole lot in the face with a shotgun in either a burst of revenge or sympathy or walking away and pretending you didn t see it and hope they get unstuck a tracking system lets you track into a hunt or after a shoot there are certainly some serious issues with this that are sometimes resolved with good luck or 100 persistence or not at all all i can suggest is bring lots of patience or learn to shoot every creature so it drops dead on the spot and does not run sure you ll find most of your poor shoots as long as you don t get turned around or completely cut off by the 100 s of superfluous tracks left by other beasts which also seems to be the cause of the failures all in all this is a a good experience if you can get this on special and have the persistence to hunt and want to enjoy what could only be called a beautiful walking simulator otherwise have at it mind the dlc only buy what you know you need because some of it is little more than stocking fillers 7 10 i haven t played mp this time around so i have nothing to say about the mess that it was in this review just make sure you do your research if mp is your preferred game
