2019 i have put hundreds of hours into this game between ps4 and steam since about 2016 this game is amazing to me and i love restarting the game and roleplaying as a different character each time i always seem to find something new with every playthrough there are many random encounters and easter eggs that are fun to hunt for and experience i liked the wide variety of customization options for weapons and armor the settlement building and the crafting options for chems and other miscellaneous things i would have loved for the scopes to be uniquely colored and styled for each gun and specifically the recon scope comes to mind i loved the graphics but i wish there was more foliage around the commonwealth i also loved the dialogue but it would have been nice to know exactly what the character would say like in fo3 and fonv i have beat the vanilla game with each faction and i wish the endings weren t so similar in how the main antagonist is dealt with i loved each of the dlc but i wish there was more bad guy factions for an evil character playthrough the nuka world dlc was a big step in the right direction but i noticed that choosing to eliminate the raider gangs left very little for the player to do in nuka world i wish there was more to the dlc when siding against the raiders such as an alternate questline where the player systematically brings down the raider gangs the dlc is fairly short should the player kill all the raiders upon entering the park itself i understand that this game had a budget and a deadline but these are some things that i believe would enhance the player experience overall bethesda did a great job with this game and i look forward to future installments of the series if i missed anything or you have another idea of how the game could be improved please leave a comment thanks for taking the time to read my review
