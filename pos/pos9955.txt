2023 rimworld is a fantastic game i thought i knew what i was getting into when i got this game i thought i was well prepared my first real base was a fairly big mountain complex that just happened to have a big open air area with lots of grass in the center what luck i thought i could eventually put my solar farm here an animal pen maybe even artillery where it was all secreted away from prying eyes turns out this would be my downfall after many hardships raids and quests though i was becoming quite proud of the now self sufficient underground complex my little colonists had been creating complete with hydroponics layered automatic defenses armed and armored colonists kill boxes and only one way in i thought my mountain fortress was impenetrable i figured heck i wouldn t even have to do anything at this point i could just give the colonists the wheel i decided to put that to the test within maybe half an hour nearly everyone was dead it was almost as if randy had suddenly decided to punish me for my hubris to remind me that no one on my land is ever truly safe it wasn t even hard for him tl dr 10 10 would totally anger randy again what happened literally about a minute into my silly experiment a dry winter thunderstorm struck one of the solar panels in the middle of the night blowing it up and causing a fire my denizens immediately sprang into action but they had to get through a series of heavy doors to reach the fire when they were nearly there the fire reached a wooden column holding up a roof over a large battery bank when the roof collapsed it crushed the batteries causing a massive explosion which blew open a nearby wall instantly killing 2 of the responding colonists on the other side the lights and heating then went out as a vital power line had been severed fire then spread to the animal pen where i was keeping admittedly a few dozen too many boomrats who then scurried out into the fires the remaining colonists stumbled onto a chaotic scene of fire with random explosions everywhere as casualties began to mount the wounded were being taken to a cold dark infirmary where the only two highly skilled doctors got to work at this moment a large infestation appeared in one of the dorms and while this wouldn t have been a huge problem with the help of the turrets everything was still offline slowly the bugs began to dismantle everything including the unpowered defenses and walls which was also causing random cave ins the two dead colonists in the destroyed hallway were also really putting everyone on edge and the random explosions burns and freezing cold weren t helping the colonists began to lose it one even ran out to the outer perimeter fence to pick a fight with a guard dog another began wandering aimlessly and happened to open the exact wrong door and was immediately decapitated by giant bugs for it suddenly now with some direction the bugs began to charge the door the man came through and burst into the main hallway the base s only two doctors had been passing by to get medicine and to their credit they tried to open fire on the bugs but were quickly and surgically killed with a stab to the brain and heart i may have overestimated the protective abilities of the plate armor and helmet from there the bugs simply hunted the wounded down in the dark freezing hallways of the collapsing mountain base as most of the crew tried to get the solar farm situation back under control i found the guy that went crazy earlier outside the outer fence laying on the grass bleeding out near the guard dog which was also bleeding out it must have quite the sight for the tribal raiders that came right after i like to think that as the tribals arrived on scene to witness a mountain caving in on itself with fires all around bug chittering sounds and the occasional explosion echoing in the distance they found the last barely conscious survivor whispering to himself randy why before carrying him away probably believing they were doing him a favor at that point randy random you gotta love hate this story teller the difficulty was only adventure btw
