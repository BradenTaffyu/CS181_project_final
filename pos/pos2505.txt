2023 obligatory disclaimer this game is the third of the project moon games lobotomy corporation and library of ruina being its predecessors knowledge of these games is not required beforehand but they help with understanding various points of worldbuilding why limbus company was established to begin with also they re fantastic games that all being said here s a breakdown of limbus company story the main draw of the game the twelve sinners are based off of literary counterparts e g ishmael and moby d ck heathcliff and wuthering heights etc but the re interpretations of these characters are incredibly refreshing they re fun and have interesting dynamics with one another even npcs in this game are simply fantastic i was honestly shocked by how invested i d become in the game s side characters the story is well balanced between gut wrenching sadness horror and genuinely fun heartwarming interactions as of writing there are three story chapters with the first one being a great warmup for the laughs and grief to come the second being a delightfully fun romp that brings to mind a terribly incompetent but still effective d d party and the third starting off fun before ripping the player s heart out drawbacks the story is still ongoing with chapters appearing to drop every 2 3 months if you get on this train for the story you re going to be in it for the long haul gameplay if i had to describe the gameplay in one word unique this game is an rpg and strategy based with each enemy having different sin type resistances make sure you re clicking on enemies to check their weaknesses and damage type resistances blunt pierce and slash you also need to keep an eye on your party s hp sanity and speed for each turn sanity can make or break the effectiveness of your party s actions hitting a certain percentage of hp lost can stagger a character for a turn and speed can determine which characters can block evade clash with different enemies on the field out of all three project moon games this is the easiest one to learn but difficult to master i ve been playing for about 100 hours now and i m still learning new things just about every day with this game drawbacks it can take a long while to begin to understand this game s mechanics and it doesn t help that project moon is unfortunately a bit infamous for their tutorials only explaining maybe 25 of the gameplay elements you ll have to work with looking up a guide or several tends to be the pm game experience which can be a downside or a plus side for new players depending on how much research you re willing to do once you approach chapter 3 the gameplay can be very grindy you ll want to collect plenty of egoshards thread and exp tickets in order to power up your sinners and acquire new identities but it will require patience over many days on the plus side though dailies are easy and tend to require minimal effort i usually finish mine in approximately 5 30 minutes depending on whether or not i throw in a mirror dungeon run also the game has plenty of little bugs since it s designed to be both a mobile game and a pc game nothing that makes it unplayable though and the devs are great about fixing issues especially for a small indie group just some text bugs that were around for a day a particular character s skill making it so that they were invisible on the battlefield etc so nothing crazy as far as i ve seen also this is a gacha game let s delve into that part shall we the gacha i would like to preface this by saying i hate gacha games i actually really really like this one here s why f2p is incredibly easy your main resource to getting good tm is going to be enkephalin modules which you can make from enkephalin or you know stamina naturally you re going to be building this up by occasionally checking the game throughout the day converting some enkephalin into modules and using those modules to grind for resources two and three star characters are pretty easy to obtain in the gacha pulls but you can easily make do without them your base sinners automatically upgrade every story chapter making them occasionally even more useful than two and three stars by chapter 3 where fully upgraded characters are more essential than their rarity also the devs are insanely generous like ridiculously so wait a few days and the devs will be handing you lunacy or extraction tickets used for gacha pulls because of scheduled maintenance patches etc out of the few gachas i ve ever played this one just doesn t feel gross and like it s making a blatant cash grab at my wallet if you do like shelling out gacha money i d say the prices are really fair in terms of how much bang you get for your buck especially with the season pass 11 for an obscene amount of resources a cool banner loads of special ego attacks your characters can use and a third option for an announcer in battles this one s a steal drawbacks it s still a gacha unfortunately if you struggle with controlling your wallet around them and don t think this is a hurdle you can get over this may be what stops you from playing the game but at least there are cutscene comps on youtube sound effects yes the sound effects are getting their own section of the review because i enjoy them that much the sfx is varied and interesting and that coin flip ding you hear in combat music to my ears i d listen to that on loop for an hour if i could voice acting is only in korean but it s top notch sound quality on the vas is impeccable and each one has such a broad range of expression and distinct feel to their acting that makes me instantly recognize every character who s speaking even if i don t know a lick of korean side note the characters sing during the credits roll of their story chapters and god i damn i can they sing oh my god the music you know how some games get a little boring repetitive to listen to after a hundred or two hours i still haven t felt a hint of exhaustion towards this game s soundtrack there are really solid bangers from average enemy encounters to background music during cutscenes don t even get me started on the boss music ranging from songs i aggressively bang my head to in the car to well mili songs that i still bang my head to in the car yes mili is back to making music for project moon games you cannot believe how excited i am for this and how i am still going positively rabid at the thought of the next iron lotus coming in future story chapters between two worlds slaps hard but i know there s an even more insane banger to come drawbacks there is a lot of bloody squelchy noises during combat you can turn the sfx down while keeping the bopping music playing at full volume but it s important to keep this in mind if you get queasy at even the thought of squishy squelchy noises while watching cartoon blood splatter during combat tl dr this is an incredibly unique game with a combat system unlike any other while it can occasionally get frustrating or tedious if you re not a fan of grinding or waiting for story updates the characters and worldbuilding are insanely rich in a way only project moon can pull off it s gory it s funny it ll rip your heart out and it ll have you smiling and laughing i m rating this one a solid 9 10
