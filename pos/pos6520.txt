2019 i personally do not care for driving games i do not own driving games they bore me i am more into fps games and a very few simulation games only if they crossed into work i use to do for real and this feild of work happends to be one of them i am impressed on the work that was done by scs and expected more child play and less detail of how the game would function but to my suprise they really put this togeather there is no slop work at all or child like functions you can almost feel your in a real truck from the physics in the game to how the tractor and trailer respond and handle it was not what i expected i was expecting something more like the wheels of the truck go round and round type of game and ets2 is not that kind of game this game has a large fan base and many dlcs scs tries to stay on top of errors and bugs to get them resolve i personaly found one in the game and once i brought it to their attention it was fixed this alone speaks volumes to me it is a single player game the basics is you run a trucking company in europe and you make money by delivering loads to their locations and can increase the size of your company by buying more truck shops and getting employees to drive for you as you level up you will be able to increase your abilities for what kind of loads and how far to go with them you can also customize the truck and trailers yeah i said trailers you will be able to buy your own trailers to use and if you get them for other shops the ais willl also choose to use them or not how ever one tip i wish to point out that i noticed when you are lost in upgrading your own truck do not forget to also upgrade your trucks that the ais use when they are upgraded they tend to work better bringing in more money so if you love semi trucks and the ability to run your own buisness for what ever the reason is this maybe the ideal game for you i recommended
