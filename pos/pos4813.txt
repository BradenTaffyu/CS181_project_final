2022 i pick every quest that preston has for me i walk him to destination and i watch him complete his own quests if he goes down i get him up to celebrate him getting the castle i put up on the wall glowing letters forming preston we love you i had bunch of differently dressed mannequins put around castle and settlements to make him think that we have more people that we actually do i ended up cosplaying silver shroud just because at one point he said he likes this character preston be praised
