2019 with nearly 200 hours in this game and nearly full completion i can say this game is a great game i recommend it to anyone even since the first beta of the game this game was loads of fun there s a lot to do now so many areas and interesting slimes at first glance the game seems like a simple childish little fun game but it devolves into a bit of a strategy game well that s the entire point 1 introduction the game s start is a great experience and is friendly to veterans and new players new players get to search around with little harm to their character and can learn the basics at a relatively fast pace for people who ve played before who want to just start a new world they can grab a bunch of food and just pop a gordo then enter whatever they want or if you re feeling particularly fast you can just hop up into the moss blanket with the jet pack or the indigo quarry 2 mid game this part of the game is where things pick up the new player has found out the wonders of slime largos and is trying to learn the real strategies i e favorite foods perfect largo combinations yada yada this is where the first economic boom happens in the game for the players just having 10 honey boom largos with a mint mango farm gets a lot of things done really its surprising how much money a simple strategy like that gets you 3 slime science my favorite part of the game is the slime science before this was added slime rancher absolutely needed something like this the new player gets to learn so much more about these new mechanics and the veterans get to do nearly anything if they immediately know what to do this is also the area where the player has most likely unlocked the ancient ruins 4 strategizing officially the new player now thinks of ways to get more money with the grasp of the favorite foods they now look into faster ways to make money after maybe a look on youtube or the forums they find incredible strategies to really get the money going this is also where the 7zee corporation come in here the new player will want to play the game more to get the ranch to look way better 5 the glass desert this deserves its own section due to how complicated the glass desert is new players will have an incredibly fun and hard time trying to figure out what they re doing there finding all these new slimes the events that happen its a crazy mess but its satisfying whenever you learn it they reach the end of the game which is just the credits not going into detail for that because of spoilers 6 replayability there is an incredible replayability in this game but it does die off after some time when no update happens after you ve done everything in one save file which is harder to do now but is still possible you can t really do much else you can start a new world or look into other aspects of the game 7 sound music design i personally am a song writer but not like this i can give credits to the entire staff team behind the sound and music design as they have hit the jackpot on perfection the slime sounds are a complete staple to this game and everyone knows it the songs are a distinct yet simple combination of everything it s pretty much perfect 8 game design the simple artstyle of slime rancher is something that distinguishes it from the rest the slimes look specifically different and the largos are always a great look the world design is what i m mainly getting at i don t have a great computer and cannot run this game at maximum graphics but even with the lowest settings it looks great not able to voice my opinion much here though 9 things i didn t like the five day rush was a thing before and i don t remember when it was removed and changed but i don t like this new rush mode i wish the developers could either get rid of rush mode and make it five day rush again or they could have both modes that s about that 10 conclusion this game is a very friendly game and everyone should have the chance to play it its a great experience for new players and everyone should be welcomed into this game i hope the updates never stop coming thanks monomi park
