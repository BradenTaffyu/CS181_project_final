2016 early access review my first experience with this was short lived i ran outside of my front door and wielding a trusty baseball bat attacked a group of zombies i was scratched and bleeding on the foot and i couldn t find or figure out how to bandage myself so i died from a cut on the foot second character starts to freeze to death within just a couple of minutes of playing so i get together some materials for a camp fire and make it in the safety of my bathroom 30 seconds later my character is running around the garden being chased by zombies with his legs on fire watching his house burn to the ground third character survived for a long time i found a warehouse and wanted to look for axes or sledgehammers but there were too many zombies around so i lured them all to follow me planning to trap them inside a house and then run out the back door an excellent plan i opened a house door ran inside and the zombies started pouring in an excellent plan i thought wait where s the back door there is no back door cue laurel and hardy music as i sprint circles around the living room as more and more pour in the door by the time i d remembered that i could climb out of a window it was too late my first multiplayer experience with this was like an episode of the walking dead i created my character an illiterate clumsy oaf with incredible strength and tough skin and then spent the next 6 hours trying to get the server to work if you ve tried everything but still can t get it to work on the router settings make sure the device the game is connected with is your ip not your local machine ip or your router s ip but your ip not your public ip damn it s complicated for me it starts with 192 but there are two of those one with 256 at the end the other with 140 at the end the 140 one is the one i connected the game to and then it worked but nevermind that my character s name is rick grimes i ran out of my door taking a bunch of food with me and sprinted down the main road leaving a bread crumb trail so i don t get lost i find a huge warehouse where i scavenged a few planks and hammers a buttload of nails and duct tape and also somehow managed to fall down the stairs breaking my leg i ripped up my vest into sheets and tied a wooden plank to my leg as a makeshift splint sorted my friend at this moment managed to log in we cheer but then sigh as he has spawned in a house filled with zombies and the doors and windows are barricaded shut wtf he screams he sends me a voice message telling me he s already getting pissed off with the game and that he s about to log out hold on i tell him just hold on i go online load up the map of the area and tell him to take a picture of his house zoomed out i manage to match up this quirky looking road out front of the house to where it is on the map and balls it s miles away nevermind the distance i thought i m going to rescue my friend hang tight i tell him i ll be there soon as soon as i start sprinting i realise that a broken leg in this game actually means something so 45 minutes later i arrive at his house to my astonishment he s actually managed to take down the 5 zombies in his house with his bare hands and he s just been waiting there starving to death the feeling of seeing him stood there through the crack in the barricades on the window was pretty amazing my friend called it a golden gaming moment i looked through my inventory and myself i don t have a hammer i can t take down the barricades so i start wailing on them with a golf club bonk bonk bonk nothing panicking that he s going to have to wait another 20 minutes for me to find a hammer i remember my schoolbag i open it and ah yeah there s my hammer i take the barricades down and i know for a fact if there was a brohug emote in the game we would be spamming the hell out of it we survived for a good hour and a half before we started to get cocky trying to take down small hordes of zombies around our safe house i got scratched and cut on my leg and arm bandaged up no problem but my friend got bitten on his chest and it was deep and needed rebandaging every 2 minutes or so he was losing health instead of continuing to back away from this horde we stupidly decided to carry on trying to exterminate it one zombie at a time i got scratched on the foot again and decided to just back off and give up but due to miscommunication my friend decided to balls out try and kill them all by himself he got swarmed i managed to push them all away and i went rampant as they swarmed him managing to knock down or kill the last of them my friend s waddling around leaving a trail of blood hold still i yell to him as i frantically begin the medical check he has 4 injuries and is already half dead i bind one wound ok another wound ok i bind the third wound that wasn t a wound i just took off a dirty bandage at that moment he dies if i had bound the last wound instead of unbinding the old wound he would have lived but in the heat of the moment i couldn t focus and i got him killed there s silence i head back to his safe house with the barricades and i take all of the best food we have scavenged so far from the fridge with a plan to rendevous with him at his new spawn location his new character spawns incredibly luckily in my safehouse barricaded windows two story for look outs sheets over everything to stop any zombies peeking inside tons of food in the fridge oh and a bunch of turd weapons and backpacks sorted i run back to meet him and we begin our plan of scavenging the streets for food and stockpiling it all over again but this time his character looks like patrick stewart and my legs still broken next time we play the plan is to get a small farm going build a wall around the house to further protect it and head out to try and find some assault rifles or axes i honestly can t wait until they add cars and npcs into the game it s going to be incredible my friend came up with an awesome idea also that there should be little missions that happen randomly like the power can just randomly cut off in a large area meaning that you have to go to a power plant or something to essentially fix it yourself i added that without good electronics skills you would have to just flip the switch which would turn the power back on but it would set off a loud alarm which would make escaping and getting home difficult the hints that the military are going to be implemented and ideas about being able to sit in the back of pick up trucks shooting zombies while your friend drives around are the reasons why i ve given up on all farming survival games in favour of this one for the foreseeable future check it out guys you won t be disappointed
