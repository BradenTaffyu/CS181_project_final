2017 are you kidding me you re reading reviews of fallout new vegas deciding whether you should buy it or not are you insane you can get the ultimate edition with all of the dlc for like whatever some small amount of money that would feed a hungry somalian family for a month but for you is just pocket money no i m not trying to guilt trip you here spend the money on this somalia is far away and totally not much fun new vegas is very fun remember how your high school guidance counselor told you that maybe votech was the way to go for you they were wrong weren t they hmm maybe not welding can be a lucrative career but that s just like fallout people will tell you what to do and where to go just like any rpg but get this you don t have to listen you can walk out the door after the intro and just wander wherever you damn well please you ll die but still the world is as wide open as my ex when i worked third shift with plenty of room for anyone who wanders by and there is no one preventing you from just heading out into the wilderness with nothing but your wits and a cheap rifle but yeah you ll die but isn t that the beauty of bethesda games both elder scrolls and fallout they ve made these large open worlds that invite exploration and risk i guess it s not for everyone but man if you can t find enjoyment here you might have anhedonia one reason i haven t reviewed this game is that i am too attached to it i always have trouble reviewing a game i really love because my reviews are pretty much also as of this writing there are 35782 reviews so it seems a bit like being behind ron jeremy in line at the gang bang no ones really gonna remember what you brought to the table amirite no really it s ok sometimes you just don t measure up so you have one job deliver a package that s what a courier does easy enough but the package you have is very special and someone kills you for it but um somehow you survive being shot in the head and buried setting of a chain of events that culminate in you basically being more powerful than jesus i mean you can t turn water into wine but is that really a useful skill when faced with a deathclaw whoa there buddy can t we just have a drink and talk this over good luck with that i suppose that is one of the main draws for me the progress from a humble nobody with a crappy pistol and ragged clothes to the ultimate killing machine armor plated like a tank and carrying so much firepower that isis declares you their new caliphate shiariously though fallout games will make you feel like a god or at least a reasonable facsimile thereof that takes time though and you will spend a good bit of time exploring and collecting tin cans in order to upgrade your gear it all pays off in the end though picture that guy who always drives through your neighborhood collecting anything metal you put out for the trash now imagine that one day he s suddenly driving an m4 sherman tank he built out of the scrap that is how fallout do aside from the progression of your character there are factions you can choose to side with questlines to follow and the house the house always wins well not always if you somehow have never played this i won t ruin anything but still it s not house rules in fallout it s your rules that is what makes fallout great even though it is all scripted and planned you can feel like you are important and that what you decide really matters i guess in the end that is what draws me to the fallout games i m the one making the decisions and dealing with the consequences maybe freedom is an illusion but here its a pretty convincing one
