2023 forza horizon 5 stunning visuals yet more of the same and underwhelming dlcsso what s it about forza horizon 5 is the follow up to forza horizon 4 now taking us to mexico where fh4 shines with better stories fh5 supports newer technology making the game look better the goodthis is one the best looking arcade racing game i know of most of the great mechanics from fh4 are still there what this series does well is divide the cars into tiers so to have more fun you can always go for a lower tier and the opponents are scaled accordingly the game is impressively optimized with an incredible level of detail a vast collection of customizable cars awaits ready for tuning improve the appearance and the tools are really easy to use if you don t feel creative then with a few click you will be able to download designs from other players online is isn t obligatory it s perfectly fine to play offline and most of the game features will still be there i like that the creative tools from fh4 return so you can play tracks other players put together the map will be absolutely cluttered with icons of races events and much more thankfully there is a good filter with which you can hide the events you don t want to see there are so many activities and achievements accolades to achieve if you want to do it all you ll be busy for quite some time weekly and monthly missions offer attractive rewards including rare cars you can even adopt the role of a car dealer in a way purchasing sought after vehicles at low prices and reselling them at auction which then allows you to buy houses and more expensive cars the not so goodeven if you bought the premium edition developers require additional payments for two dlcs that introduce cars unobtainable through in game means the wheel spins and timed exclusive cars subtly encourage loot boxes and virtual currency consequently logging in daily becomes routine i wonder if at one point fh moves to an ea loot box model where you have to spend more money to have a chance to win something fh5 plays it safe with no real gameplay improvements actually it s worse as there is no longer a racing track and there is no atmosphere the endgame is plain and boring while beautiful the world doesn t feel alive at all it also feels there are fewer human players on the road compared to fh4 in the end fh5 feels similar to fh4 but then the boring version of it it also doesn t help there is no real difference between seasons unlike fh4 nor that there is any form of meaningful progression you get rewards and prices for just about everything this means it loses all value there is such an overwhelming number of cars and many are similar that none really stand out the stories are annoying why anyone thought spanglish is a great idea remains a mystery online cars can teleport back and forth especially at the beginning of the race sometimes the ai is also rubber banding the soundtrack music radio gets old quickly i ended turning it off completely and just play my own songs i never felt that need in fh4 i was even reminded how much better the songs of fh4 were while playing the fh origins story as a pc player i wonder why text chat isn t available as an alternative to the clunky link system for player communication i don t understand why we still need to use the xbox overlay when we purchased it on steam bugs and glitcheswhile the game in general is stable the game occasionally experiences crash to desktop ctd while in the auction house ah the ah occasionally prevents new bids after being outbid and bids may fail even after refreshing the page claiming funds before bidding seems to fix the issue at times your connection with the fh5 just drops even though your internet connection is still alive usually connections restore automatically but occasionally restarting the game is the only option some of the achievements are buggy if you know for certain you achieved it but the notification doesn t show up then it s best to completely leave the game and restart i also experienced that some achievements popped up before i achieved the goal in the last mission of drift club there is still a bug present where you lose all control at the beginning of the race for a minute there is nothing you can do just wait and hope there is enough time left after you gain control this bug present for over two years remains unresolved occasionally my car fell through the game world the dlcsof the 45 dlcs most offer cars or limited car selections some dlcs offer minor benefits expansions bundle no longer available immediate access to the rally dlc and the hot wheels dlc the premium vip no longer available offers some additional content the welcome bundle some extras to start out with as everything is so easy to come by i would not recommend to buy it separately you will get one car voucher i would highly recommend to use it on the 5m cars the treasure map works similar to fh4 reveals all the secrets from the start instead having to go through a guide as the locations will be shown on your map additionally two dlcs introduce storylines new cars and locations forza horizon 5 hot wheels i wish you were not so stuck to the orange tracks as it gets old quickly to have the hw cars is ok but the rest of the dlc is forgettable and the story feels like a commercial from hasbro you only get a handful of hw cars and online racing is limited to just a couple of tracks which all look the same the dlc is artificially extended at the end by having you win 20 races on tracks you already played on forza horizon 5 rally dlc in this dlc you will play for three different teams it s lacklustre it s small and the worst dlc of fh i played i didn t feel it was a rally theme to prolong the duration objectives are added like having to break three different kinds of boards crates etc for each team and races have to be done twice the helicopter flying in front of you and obstructing your view during the races doesn t make sense summaryfh5 is beautiful and has a lot to offer but it didn t raise the bar for the series and after a while it felt more of the same and started to feel boring there is no endgame and the lack of progression hurts the game finding human players can be a challenge and the dlcs aren t great the stories are poor and the music choice gets old quickly it s bad business practise that even when you purchase the premium edition or car pass you still have to buy extra cars if you want to have everything that doesn t mean that fh5 is a bad game but comparing it to fh4 fh4 has more entertaining dlcs stories and events fh5 looks a little better by offering the latest technology but is more of the same if you can get a good deal on fh4 play that first then get fh5 on sale if you still want more note i would highly recommend using a controller it is a much better experience than mouse and keyboard
