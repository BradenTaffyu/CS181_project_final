2020 i really like this game it s got basically everything you d want from a gt simulator with the sole exception of that big long road circuit in the woods and around the hills of germany but hey maybe someday an sro event will go there right now though everything that s here is great there are plenty of things to learn and plenty of cars and tracks to race in and on respectively it s got a pretty deep system for tracking your statistics in various ways most importantly for online racing your safety it also has a pretty great weather and time of day system with plenty of options however i d like to highlight a couple of things i think would really help the game first is the lack of information you are given about the cars in game it didn t occur to me at first because prior to purchasing acc i d watched videos and read up on things myself as well as spending many weekends this year enjoying real world gt racing however i don t know the bhp of any of these cars or if they are naturally aspirated or have a turbo or even the engine placement likewise the gearing the top speed and what the engine maps do are all mysteries until you find an outside source via a video guide or a forum post even then you can t find all of the technical aspects this is somewhat baffling for a racing game maybe manufacturers don t like to spill the beans when it comes to their car s capabilities that s one thing but this knowledge is already in the game it s just not told to you i only found out the audi r8 gt4 had seven gears by mistake and that its ginetta counterpart topped out at 149 mph after i took it around mount panorama which has very long straights compared to some circuits what makes the porsche 911 cup car different from a 991 gt3 car how s the 2018 991 gt3 different from the 2019 one they all look basically the same it s entirely reasonable for someone not to know how they differ but completely unreasonable for the game to give you no way of finding out before driving them the tracks have short blurbs on their history a corner count a total lap length and a map showing the path they follow along the ground if this basic stuff is there for circuits it should be there for cars as well secondly and less importantly is how locked down everything is perhaps it s a licencing issue but not being allowed to use custom liveries in official races is silly i would say it s akin to not being able to make transfers in a football manager title this is my game so what if i want to race a porsche with a haribo livery at a circuit where that never happened and with teammates called gleep and glorp even the newest f1 title lets you put a whole new team on the grid and in acc being able to set how many cars are on track means you can already change the official car line up of a race anyway it s just a strange little hang up the game seems to have that would be nice to get rid of or around thirdly i would say the game needs a free mode where no stats are tracked not lap times or driver ratings being able to increase safety rating and what have you offline is great you won t be sabotaged by a dive bombing maniac unless you re the maniac doing the diving but for a new player having a way of driving without needing to worry about invalid laps or totalling the cars would be great i ve got a lot of invalid laps around tracks i d never driven before and i was still trying to work out which view i was going to drive in which don t exactly seem fair to have on my personal record from now until forever trying to drive in the rain is another instance where i d appreciate a free swing lots of sims don t have rain so even experienced sim racers might never have had to worry about a flooded track and torrential rain but once again that s a big fat failure if you aquaplane into a barrier during practice that i ll never undo this has gone on for too long and i doubt anyone with any ability to effect any of these changes will ever read it if anyone at all does hopefully though some of these ideas might spread around the community and gain some traction so to speak
