2023 don t get me wrong there are performance issues but the core gameplay is very good and already leaps and bounds ahead of cs 1what you don t get 10 years of dlc s rrgular patches bug fixes mods etc what you do get new and exciting mechanics optimised ai more enjoyable management vastly improved detail of nearly all in game assets new playstyles strangely enough for me rtx 3080 5800x the performance is jittery at first if i try loading in with max settings but after 30 mins or so switching to 1440p and running almost max settings is absolutely fine only at 20k pop so can t account for large city yet buy it
