2017 divinity original sin 2 is a strong contender to game of the year and with few meaningful tweaks it could easily compete to rank among the best rpgs of all time like for its predecessor its strong points are the massive amount of player agency permitted one of the best turn based combat systems in the business a great degree of environmental interaction and very solid encounter design disappointingly enough this sequel fails mostly in the same area that hindered its predecessor itemization and stat bloat larian s stubbornness with randomized loot over unique and hand placed items means you ll never get rewards that are meaningful just generic items that can drop anywhere or pop in any merchant s inventory at any given time that kills a lot of incentives to bring down strong enemies solve quests and explore for hidden treasures when every action can potentially get the same outcome it doesn t really feel like accomplishments matter that much on top of that the problem with stat bloat emerges few hours into the game while the problem presents itself from the beginning by the time you ll get all the pieces of the first armor set in the starting area they ll be completely obsolete it becomes genuinely grating past level 14 15 as you ll quickly get to the point where the jump in values at each level will be so ridiculous you ll literally double your hp damage armor values etc this essentially forces well strongly encourages the players to replace all the equipment for his entire party at every level up that s not just annoying and a bit pace breaking but it also has the not irrelevant side effect to make you feel like no piece of equipment you ll find no matter how strong at that given moment gives you any long term value there were surely better ways to handle these aspects even just looking at the past this game with the baldur s gate 2 itemization could have been a all times classic
