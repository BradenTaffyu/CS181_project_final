2014 europa universalis 4 is an extremely entertaining real time strategy game similar to all the others released by paradox interactive in the game one is able to create armies and navies invade and conquer your neighbors and colonize the world it has no real end goal however world domination is nice with a felxible starting date of anywhere between 1453 and 1800 there are centuries of history to play through as historical countries even though keeping to their set history is up to you europa universalis 4 provides a platform to do the impossible to conquer europe as china to maintain colonies accross the world to destroy the largest empires to invade russia in the winter however europa universalis 4 is a game riddled with challenge it is not easy and players hoping to start off as the tiniest nation they see are almost certainly going to have a difficult road ahead of them if they wish to succeed there are also other nations like france austria portugal and castille if you are in the mood for an evening of steamrolling the weak nations and conquering the world in one fell swoop micromanagement is also a crucial aspect to gameplay and it can pose to be difficult but also rewarding to fully manage an economy organize military forces mitigate crises and handle diplomacy however this amount of micromanagement provides a sense of immersion into the game and allows a greater sense of pride in tasks like maintaining a surplus and such europa universalis iv is a great game for strategy gamers who have no doubt at least heard of other paradox titles but for those looking for a walk in the park as they see every nation fall to them may not be able to enjoy the game
