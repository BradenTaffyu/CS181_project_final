2022 this is a fantastic game i highly recommend it for achievement hunters looking for another game to 100 as well as the casual players looking for a chill game to play on their downtime the visuals are cartoonish yet elegant and high in detail so it s almost always very pleasing to just stare at for hours it honestly just hits so many marks for what makes a game enjoyable what to expect i won t delve too far into the details since exploring and finding out for yourself is all part of the fun but you play as a woman named beatrix who has just bought the far far range from someone a set of ranches on a planet thousands of light years away from earth you re now taking in the sights experimenting with farming feeding and caring for various slimes selling their poo i mean plorts as well as completing rancher quests all in an attempt amass a fortune with the currency gained from selling slime shi plorts you can manage your farm unlock new areas of the far far range upgrade your equipment and partake in an optional rewards program although it s basically necessary got any grrripes this game engulfed me for quite some time but here s 3 aspects of the game i didn t exactly enjoy or would ve liked to see improved do not let this deter you from playing the game and forming your own opinion i wish there were more upgrades for the various plot buildings the use of extractors in resource collection although easy feels very monotonous even though there are 57 achievements i feel as though there were many missed opportunities to earn more with some of these i m not entirely sure what could ve been changed to make them more enjoyable but that s that for achievement hunters the majority of the game has achievements associated with it that are very easy to understand so you shouldn t need any help but the rush mode achievements seemed daunting to me at first if you feel the same way i d suggest checking out epokk s youtube video linked below my guide for rush mode in slime rancher
