2017 this game is pure gem and from all the grand strategy games out there this i can tell you is my most favourite and i played only the vanilla not to mention there re many mods to chose from and enchanse your gameplay experience gameplay is fantastic and i enjoy playing every game you can create your own interstellar empires and play against them if you want to the customization is left at your imagination basicly this is real time strategy you build and expand your empire with diplomacy colonizing or conquaring there re many options to chose from before you start your game for 93 hours of gameplay time i ve completed 3 games 2 vanilla and 1 with mods and i ve always played on 400 stars map if you want to play with more stars you need very good cpu visually the game is perfect the soundtracks are awesome and all other sounds from the game are perfectly matched what devs do are patching the game and create new content which you need to pay for i don t have dlcs for now but probably i will take some and start a new game just go there and create your interstellar empire republic or purging civilization and start expanding
