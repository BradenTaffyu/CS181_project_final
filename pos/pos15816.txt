2021 early access review this game is great for when you need to sit back and let your adhd brain experience something soothing and something you can completely sink into similar feeling to using a real power washer or watching a video of one i am a completionist myself and i speed through games like nobody s business however for some maps it takes me days to complete it makes me want to take a break and come back to it the next day and most games can t hold my attention like that once again def get this game
