2020 porting issuesas pretty much everyone already knows it s not a good pc port there are several issues with the port the most commonly mentioned being the full screen resolution bug but there s several other issues like non native resolution for ao and bloom ps2 quality potato textures and the mouse lingering on the screen at all times even when using a controller thankfully kaldaien s far mod github com fixes the vast majority of those issues while the pcgw www pcgamingwiki com and gpunity s texture pack www nexusmods com resolve the rest once you ve put a bit of effort into fixing the pc port it s probably the definitive edition of the game it s just a shame it s not that out of the box story lore and quest designthe story is absolutely phenomenal it s one of the most unique techniques of storytelling that i ve ever experienced in a video game the story is told throughout multiple playthroughs from the perspectives of different characters the first and second playthroughs are very similar and can feel a tad bit repetitive but the third playthrough is substantially different and effectively the second half of the story unfortunately i don t have many positive remarks about the side quests there s a of side quests in this game most of them narratively contribute to worldbuilding but gameplay wise are just fetch quests so they felt mostly like a chore to me i did practically all of them leaving only the arenas incomplete i honestly don t feel that most of the side content was a great use of my time the nier universe is pretty fascinating i ve never played the original nier game but i ve read through the wikipedia summary en wikipedia org and watched several recap analysis videos and i feel like i have a decent grasp on the story now automata takes place thousands of years after the original game so it s more akin to a spin off or spiritual successor than a direct sequel but there s still plenty of references and several characters from the original game that i wouldn t have recognized were it not for reading up on the previous game gameplaythe moment to moment gameplay is so good i went into it expecting a character action game that necessitated learning combos like bayonetta but it s not that type of game it s more of a hack n slash than it is character action that said the combat is amazing especially after expanding your deck of plug in chips character upgrades each character controls differently as well which kept combat feeling moderately fresh throughout the multiple playthroughs soundtrackholy this game has a god tier soundtrack the tracks tie in so well to the storytelling and emotional beats of the game it s just so good it s hard to pick a favorite track but since i m putting myself on the spot to do just that i m going to have to go with the sound of the end conclusioni spent far more time with this game than i expected to a great portion of my time was spent doing side quests that i don t think were a valuable use of time but every time i came back to the main quest i just fell in love with the game the world and the characters ultimately i m walking away from this game sincerely hoping that square enix and yoko taro can put together a sequel that s even bigger and better
