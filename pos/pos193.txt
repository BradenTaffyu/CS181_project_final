2020 this game right here is a good way to spend time in those days with nothing to do you can spend hours maybe days in this game and always have something to do perfect for the corona virus quarantine days edit the freaking pandemic might have ended please china stop but the game still has something that drags me in you can install some mods to make it more awesome also the game is going to be updated soon maybe it might contain zuzu city but if it doesn t still is a solid must buy so go ahead give stardew valley a try
