2021 divinity original sin 2 definitive editionoh boy here we go again another long a reviewwhat to say about this game being a d d newbie myself i tried to avoid this game like i try to avoid taxes i m glad i finally decided to purchase this game it was the best wasted hours of my life a simple and quick scorethis game is another 10 10 in my list combat systemyour typical turn based rpg but this time the enviroment takes part you can sneak in throw a explosive barrel set the whole terrain with bombs and traps and make your enemies explode combine different elements like fire and water to make a smoke cloud poison it i don t know the possibilities are there you just gotta master it it s a rewarding game for those who want to explore and play with it character creation development progressionthe game has a total of 14 classes with 6 main attributes and 17 abilities trees you might think this is too much get me out of here but it isn t that complicated at the beginning of the game you re left with 2 options create your own character or pick from the different default main characters whatever you choose you can t fail it s your adventure after all if you choose to create your own character you ll have the opportunity to meet the main protagonists of the story and make them join your group trust me it s worth it to see how they end up plot questsquests there s a lot of them many can be ruined by doing the wrong thing at the wrong time you can say it s another decision matters type of game perspective and you re not wrong you re left with your own consequences which i m not gonna lie i love it like i ve said above if you choose to make your own character and decide to gather a party of main protagonists their quest will develop with time taking you to unique quests and unique consequences that s why it s replayability is high it will take you a few tries to complete the 100 of the quests in the game some of them requires you to be an smart man and by smart i mean an scholar exploration and ending the reviewthe game develops around chapters there s a few points of no return and when you reach it you find youself in a different landscape than the one before the exploration in each one of them can be exhausting sometimes but hey this is not a race if you re into reading and taking your time grab a coffee and enjoy the lore from a lich to an undead king to a hell what the f ck is this dog satan itself please make it stop you can find some interesting things out in the open i loved every single chapter of this game and would play it again without a doubt if you re scared of not knowing d d rules like i was don t worry this game doesn t rely that much on it it s very newbie friendly and really rewarding once you get to know what things you can do just buy it 4headfinal scoreit smells worse than 2 dozen rotten eggs soaked in a vat of vinegar over here 10and just like i ve said in the witcher 3 this game is all about the journey not the destination thanks for making it
