2021 similar art style to don t starve but vastly different still being survival game it s hardcore your mistakes matter to what you do and the time you use to do these things the game is very fun if you can get behind it there s a lot of automation you can learn about and plenty of mechanics to run about visuals are charming little characters you control are sweet and silly expect this game to be challenging as time passes as your resources start to run out you ll have to keep moving and find new ways to make your colony work and survive one thing about this is that it is time consuming but you can keep it running as long as you want for a while keeping the game on while going to do other things just don t overextend or your colony may suffer somehow it s all a drive towards sustain if you can sustain your colony and keep exploring in the process it s one of better games out there i recommend on trying this out
