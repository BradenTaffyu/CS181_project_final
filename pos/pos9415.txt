2018 you don t need friends buddies or a girl friend you just need assetto corsa a good racing wheel we talking about a sim racing game which is 6 years old and thats my opinion please dont hate me the graphic and the sound are decent the physics and the realism are awesome even better than competitor the options for setup settings is great actually i didn t find any negative points competition ranking is missing for multiplayer weather is missing day night option is missing overall its a awesome game 100 worth it to buy doesnt matter how old this game is
