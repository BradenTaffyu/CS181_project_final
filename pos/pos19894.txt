2023 age of empires ii definitive editionafter getting 100 achievements it s time to give a review the graphical difference for the de vs hd is pretty well done with all the reskinned that has been done in this game supports 4k resolution improved visuals fewer but new types of achievements and two games in one if you buy the dlc new buildings and a better overview now i like doing achievements but i don t like doing the same over and over again when it comes to converting i did it on age of empires definitive edition 1000 times and age of empires ii hd 1000 times again and now here as well i m okay if it s a few but come on 1000 plus more again on de the creators of this game love the word wololo for some weird reasons at least i didn t have to lead each faction one hundred times to victory again just once now you get achievements on some of the campaigns themselves some of them were pretty hard to get like the one called rome was destroyed in one day where you need to complete the campaign in less than 30 minutes by destroying all the castles in the roman city it took me 8 10 tries to do it you can also play the age of empires definitive edition on this called return of rome with a few changes and new stuff the portuguese in this game are way too good with their building called feitoria with that building they can fight forever not only that but if your teammate makes you his enemy for a few seconds he can convert that building and use it as well only if you don t have locked team on sharing is caring after all now when it comes to multiplayer i had problems many times when several people tried to join the game which made it very difficult to get the achievement called masterpiece where you have to win over 3 human players alone i tried playing randomly with 3 and almost got it but some of the players rage quit before finishing them off which ended up with me not unlocking the achievement good thing to have friends for this they change how the ai plays itself on maps but you can change it from cd hd or de the way the ai does things they started making walls haven t seen that before the game comes with many new challenges on the campaign if you liked playing on easy now you have to play on hard difficulty on some of the campaigns if you want the achievement overall would i recommend this game to you yesif you want a good strategy story build and fighting game this is the game for you and your friends where you can play several different factions if you don t mind buying the dlc
