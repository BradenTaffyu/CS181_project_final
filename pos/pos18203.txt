this game sets out to be better sins of a solar empire rebellion which at this point is aging somewhat poorly in the ux and performance and this sequel absolutely knocks that goal out of the park with rock solid performance a massive graphical update and refined mechanics allowing the factions to be more unique soase had a countering system such that every faction had to have a rock a scissor and a paper in order to function so they often felt more similar than they should have if you wanted sins of a solar empire the modern gaming experience you will be well pleased with this product but it isn t a massive overhaul to the gaming cycle of soase so maybe avoid this if you didn t like soase
