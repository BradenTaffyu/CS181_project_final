it was 1944 again i never left the front the war continues boys let s win this for the fatherland erhm i mean for democracy or liberty or something like that i ve been waiting for this since i filled out a survey from relic a few years ago about whether i would like to see a company of heroes game set in the mediterranean a dream come true my wife s boyfriend says company of heroes 3 is like a chinese company tried making a knock off coh game like it has all the ingredients but none of the charm soul that the original two had like the people making it had no clue what made them fun in the first place so just how good is company of heroes 3 really well besides coh2 there s no other game where i ve said i f king hate this game relic trash f k this game and kept playing daily the game has some interesting graphics fun gameplay most times a short but entertaining campaign and it s not call of duty so that already puts it above many games out there for me like many others i too was full of negativity when i started playing this game but slowly realised there are both highs and lows the north african campaign was fun but short the skirmish was meh but the total war style italian campaign was genuinely fun coh3 was a flop on release and for good reason but they re making improvements and it is becoming a fun game they ve fixed a lot of issues and the core gameplay is intense and better than ever still has a long way to go but the factions and combat are starting to round out though the sound of the mortars still make me cringe sounds like a puffy pewpew baby toy the game is suffering the same issue as many other games today it s unfinished however there are comparably few bugs and at least for 1vs1 and 2vs2 the game is very enjoyable from a competitive gamers perspective this is an awesome game and i would recommend it for that it s interesting and fun to me i find the factions tech trees and individual units in coh3 to be a little more fun than coh2 so i prefer it now coh3 has something about it that is also just a little more satisfying that i cannot put my finger on better infantry play maybe base factions have more versatility than coh2 as well light armor and indirect fire is more accessible i m a big fan of a lot of the other qol features like auto reinforce auto vault and half track recrew and new gameplay mechanics like breach spice up building camping and towing allow you to exploit out of position at guns even if they are a little buggy i think people are used to coh2 s balance unit match ups and expect that of coh 3 overall lots of tech and upgrade options movement is improved for troops too sadly the coh2 diehards like my wife s boyfriend will never like this game because they feel betrayed that it s not more akin to coh2 they don t like that it s more of a successor to coh1 in terms of gameplay and feel this game doesn t have the same tone as coh2 when it comes to gameplay art and atmosphere and it never will there is also a fair bit of rose tinted glasses nostalgia about previous coh releases remember coh2 was barren at launch too only two factions and a campaign involving only one faction people need to take their rose tinted glasses off for coh2 and realise that game took a while to become the beast it is today i have no doubt that with time after a few content releases and sales of 40 or more coh 3 will overtake all previous iterations of the series some also criticize the general feel of the game for being too vividly coloured and cartoonish but as someone who s spent a long time of his life in southern italy i think it fits the actual place southern italy during summer is a very beautiful place full of colors and green fields how can you expect it to look as grey and dark as the ardennes forests during winter or how can you expect tunisian deserts with white houses and sand under the scorching sun to look like frozen russia again everyone has their preferences but i just wanted to stress that coh3 looks very different from its predecessor because they have very different settings as for describing this from a gameplay perspective this is hands down the best multi player rts experience especially when it comes to 1v1 this is where the game truly shines and if you really want to see if you d like it watch some gameplay casts on youtube the game is nowhere close to being bad the way my wife s boyfriend and other people make it out to be it s a good game that was released early and is being polished patched slowly at the end of the day i d rather have a slightly undercooked third entry that doesn t just try to make its predecessor obsolete as a company of heroes 2 remake it s prefectly fine to have preferences for setting and mechanics actually it s an amazing thing that all three games in the series can be appreciated and have fans regardless of their age i just get annoyed at people like my wife s boyfriend saying coh3 trash game oh how the mighty have fallen without even giving it a chance even if the game isn t perfect there is still so few games like company of hero s it demands a level of respect rts game genre just isn t as big as shooters but for me all rts games are great and worth it this one is no different i recommend it just be aware it s still has a couple things that need to be polished 8 10
