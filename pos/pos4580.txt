2017 so you re telling me if i make my mount ride fast enough i ll get the sudden urge to point my lance forward and if i make it past the hard working sapper s line of stakes the trolling sapper s tnt line and the firing line of random pipers with a few guard infantry i might just be able to kill that one guy on the hill standing and crouching rapidly while keeping his hands in the air that said my mother was a hamster in world chat sounds easy enough
