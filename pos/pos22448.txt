2016 wow what can t i say good about the game that has me hooked like wildfire this was my first real playthrough of a souls game of course after i played it i went out and beat the other 2 just to say i did and also because i fell in love with the rich lore of this game every item you pick up in the game has a description and most of them can be traced to something in the previous games you can find subtle hints of things you ve seen before in the game and hints about bosses and the purpose of the placements of items and the gameplay in this one is far more polished than the previous two save for the low stamina costs but to be honest with the way these bosses work you need to dodge a ton from the very beginning of the game they pit you against a tough boss if your new to the souls series but don t let anything intimidate you in this game take the world of lordran lothric by storm head in without fear of dying because you probuly will die and there is nothing you can do about it just learn from every encounter and be sure to recover your souls your in for a wild ride not for the faint of heart or for those weak in courage the game has plenty to offer in terms of multiplayer as well you can team up with 3 other friends to take on the challenges of the game which can be some of the most fun in the game but beware you are also suseptable to being invaded by another player who wants to take your ass for a ride and then kill you then again you could turn to the same method and go invading yourself the game also has a dueling community aka a group of players who participate in friendly duels with one another the latest dlc for the game has streamlined the whole dueling process by adding matchmaking to dueling you can also do 2v2 3v3 4 and 6 man free for alls and more final verdict dark souls 3 is a challenging experience with a ton of replay value the game will grow on you if you let yourself get hooked also a great game to play with some friends big notice controller highly reccomended this game is near impossible to play with keybindings get a damn controller if you wanna play
