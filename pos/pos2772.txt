2017 early access review it s finally out absolutely phenomenal 10 10 i don t go a single moment in this game without being mesmerized by how fantastic it is i ll list some pros beautiful art style everything looks amazing combat that is both simple and incredibly difficult at the same time after two to three encounters the player will have a good grasp of how combat works but throughout the entire game they ll be learning new ways to manipulate the environment and their abilities to play better fantastic writing honestly amazing perfect soundtrack every sound and song in this game is so perfectly adjusted for the situation it s seamless and very immersive highly addictive once i sit down to play i m practically rooted to my chair to continue companions you ll care about it s the tragedy of lesser rpgs that your companions are boring and lifeless but here everyone has their own ambitions and goals and will pursue them there s very little wrong about this game previously i mentioned that voice acting won t be included which would be a con to some but in a complete surprise larian have voiced the entire game despite the fact that was never planned throughout development highly recommend purchasing it you really can t go wrong on this purchase
