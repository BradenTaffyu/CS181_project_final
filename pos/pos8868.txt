2022 it is a very complex game and takes a long time to play so if that s not your thing this game isn t for you i always play on ironman mode because it means i don t have to remember to save it also makes it more realistic because i can t cheat by reloading an old save if something happens that i don t like lol dlc is overpriced for what you get so only get it on sale this happens pretty frequently though so if you re patient you can usually get a good price
