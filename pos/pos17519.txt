2021 there is a heap of review bombing going on from salty three kingdoms players but this game doesn t deserve their wrath others are calling it a glorified dlc for its sequel but that is revisionist history i had hundreds of hours in it before tww2 came out it will give you a great time even if you don t own the sequel or any dlc it set the standard for total war fantasy games and allowed the sequel to be as good as it is i agree it should have a price reduction 5 years on but lets not pretend its a bad game on top of being an excellent game in its own right it is also the best dlc for game 2 though you could just as easily say game 2 is just a dlc for this game either by itself is incomplete but the two combine to unlock the mortal empires and that is where the true meat of the series is found according to ca s game analytics the most played faction in the entire series to this day is still the empire from this game that tells you even people who own both games still mainly play this game s content this game is a must have for the series do not ask if you should get game 1 or 2 get both anything less is an incomplete experience wait until a sale if you must mow some lawns sell your body do whatever you must but get both games
