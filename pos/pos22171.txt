2016 love it dark souls 1 was my favorite only due to the dark feel and story while i enjoyed dark souls 2 my biggest complaint was that it never felt like it had any direction or purpose to follow dark souls 3 fixed that issue while going back to dark souls 1 s dark gothic atmosphere while also bringing in so much awesomeness into the combat system with the new stances and weapon arts the game requires a lot more planning to break enemy shields and blocks and pvp feels more indepth dark souls 3 is easily my favorite of the 3 games however i will say that if you re coming to dark souls 3 for the pvp and expecting a change in the latency you will be disappointed there are still huge delays when being invaded and having to fight someone another thing which bothers me while not a major thing is if you summon someone into your world for help you will be invaded shortly after which kind of sucks when all you re trying to do is kill a boss or something the good thing is often you are 2v1 and can easily dispatch the invader either way i give the game a 9 10 would be 10 10 if the latency issues were addressed if you enjoyed any of the previous dark souls you will love this one
