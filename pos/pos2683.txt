2020 this may just be the best game i have ever played i hadn t played the first divinity original sin game but i purchased this because i enjoy rpgs turn based games and games that can be played local coop but never did i expect what came next my girlfriend liked it too we played this game every day for weeks and weeks loving the exploration expansive story and difficult but rewarding combat finally we beat the game after maybe 200hrs in what was a campaign where we thoroughly explored every corner of the game so then we bought divinity original sin 1 beat that then started a lone wolf campaign on 2 beat that and still we were finding stuff we missed through the first playthrough i seriously cannot recommend this game enough also the aforementioned girlfriend is now my wife and i am not saying that is because of divinity but it certainly didn t hurt
