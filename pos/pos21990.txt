2020 no clue on how to preface this so i ll say it outright what an extraordinary game i ve had plenty of grievances with it and looking back on it i still do but holistically this is a game for the ages it is so thematically dense and the way fromsoft managed to marry that with the gameplay in one of the most non intrusive ways deserves praise on its own i got the deluxe edition for 12 50 from wingamestore shoutout to them gg deals for their incredible platforms and it s been a blast below you ll find the approximated number of times it took me to defeat each boss base game iudex gundyr 1 vordt of the borreal valley 1curse rotted greatwood 3crystal sage 1abyss watchers 3deacons of the deep 2high lord wolnir 1old demon king 8pontiff sulyvahn 10yhorm the giant 3aldrich devourer of gods 13dancer of the boreal valley 16dragonslayer armour 3oceiros the consumed king 5champion gundyr 4twin princes 18ancient wyvern 3nameless king 5soul of cinder 2ashes of ariandel champion gravetender 3sister friede 13 the ringed city demon prince 8halflight spear of the church 4slave knight gael 12darkeater midir 9 comments on the bosses i started hitting a wall right after pontiff a reason for that being bloodborne and the idea that i had to unlearn what i had apprehended from beating the prior bosses in that game i started using shields more and i was never good at managing stamina this was until i realized that i had to pace my strikes adopt the more conservative playstyle of waiting around for the boss to exhaust their abilities then riposting myself and so on and that s how i started mastering the unspeakable ability of timing the i frames on the rolling mechanic and i felt like a stranger no more bloodborne this is not and though traces of that game are to be found here i found that i had to be more patient and clear headed in this one i adored the more methodical approach required for dark souls iii and learning the mechanics of it all served me well anyhow another wall i hit was while going against aldritch i had plenty of trouble with the rng plus i ve honestly never been particularly ecstatic to fight caster bosses to boot this one also happened to be quite disorienting to fight against then came the dancer of the borreal valley fantastic boss but this was a moment wherein i truly had to learn to master or at least develop a semblance of mastery rolling and timing and simply not letting greed take over too many times was i only one hit away from victory that i let go and had the dancer kill me it took me quite a bit but i can t say i regret learning all of that the toughest boss however wasn t dancer in my case the twin princes were by and large the toughest enemy faced in dark souls iii the dlcs included i had difficulties keeping up with lorian s teleports and then came the second phase and the heals from his bastard brother and the spells jesus christ praise the mount after all for it was lorian s alacrity to down me that was the most troubling the degree to which the twin princes punish greed cannot be understated you wait for an opening get one or two hits in and that s it patience is the name of the game in this fight and i d be lying to you if i said it didn t frustrate me it did but in the end there was no bigger feeling of pride and accomplishment than upon seeing the lord of cinder fallen text and the bonfire that came with it my favourite bosses champion gundyr was probably the most enjoyable fight look at the kick look at the moves gundyr what was that fighting sister friede was quite a splendour too she s such a dumb dumb she trips over furniture while she s invisible i loved gael midir was a clunky fight but all the spectacle makes up for it the demon prince fight was also a fantastic gank battle dancer twin princes are also up there conversely fighting oceiros was a tad frustrating if not also a reason for the thought that they d added some scrapped bloodborne bosses in here oceiros is a bloodborne boss simple as that is clearly not a fight designed for the pace of the combat in dark souls iii the nameless king fight was also kind of annoying in the sense that i had trouble making him out in that arena the camera was not designed for that fight just as it wasn t for midir soul of cinder felt unusually easy for an end all boss i can see why people consider gael to be the true end game boss a sentiment i concur with to conclude buy this game it s got a charm few games can even come in spitting distance with now i mostly spend my time at the ariandel chapel bonfire lending a hand for those in need with the elfriede fight if you ever need any help with the later bosses i ll be happy to help
