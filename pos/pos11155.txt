it took me 254 played hours to get all achievements and goals completed in this game and as soon as i finished that last achievement i wanted to start a fresh new save and do it all over again this is the only game on steam i have completed with all achievements and the only review i have ever written i absolutely cannot recommend it highly enough the music is great the narrators are perfect the gameplay is chaotic and fun and it s so satisfying to wrangle your mess of a fledgling hospital into a well oiled machine my only complaint is that they ve stopped updating this game and there will be no more dlc for me to play
