2022 well i always wanted to review stellaris when i got at least 100 hours on it i look away for a second and now i nearly have 400 hours so i think its time to give my opinions on the gamein all honesty if this is your first ever 4x game it will be quite confusing and hard to get into the tutorial does a good job at explaining the basics however as you progress you may need to look up a few videos guides thankfully the community for this game is very helpful active you can find multiple channels dedicated to explaining the game which can vastly help you understand the basic mechanics pros fantastic gameplay replay ability i m combing these two categories because stellaris gameplay promotes its replay ability you can constantly find yourself starting a game with a premade empire or a custom one you craft yourself and spend hours crafting the perfect empire in a large galaxy then decide to start another run with a vastly different empire just to see how they differ from your previous one this gameplay loop is not only satisfying it also never gets stale or boring because every single run you do is different and unique to that specific empire it leads to an addicting and fun experience because you never know what challenges and difficulties a new run will bring a huge amount of content in the base game i will not lie i have barely managed to scratch the surface on how much content and events you can find in a galaxy there s hundreds of solar systems filled with many many mysteries just waiting for you to discover each time you find something it is exciting and makes you want to learn more about your empires precursors and beyond the amount of content is vast and you will always find no 2 campaigns are the same constant updates dev s actually listen to the community innovate the game this can be a double edged sword if a game constantly changes it could lead to newer players not really understanding what they re meant to do however in light of that i am can assure you that this rarely happens all the updates that happen in the game generally always strive to improve the game the dev s always ensure to listen to community feedback and change things in the game accordingly nerfing buffing specific stuff in game to make it more balanced reworking certain systems to make them more streamlined in depth and easier to understand etc etc this has lead to the game feeling constantly fresh and new very in depth customisation although this isnt an mmo game the amount of customisation available is insane not only can you make a unique empire with its own traits preferences on how it handles diplomacy using robots or being reliant on extra dimensional powers being friendly not friendly to aliens its origins what types of weapons your empires ships use etc etc however you can also dictate how the empire you crafted reacts to events and galaxy wide crises the game allows you to do practically anything you wish once you start very impactful dlc s that expand on the game s content they dont feel like content that the devs didnt have enough time to flesh out in game and simply tacked on to make a bit more money most of the dlc s impact the game and allow you to play empires in even more varied and unique ways with each new dlc certain systems are reworked changed with free content patches to compliment the features the dlc brings to the table such as the overlord dlc being focused around conquering and controlling other empires leading to the dev s updating the whole system with a free content patch whilst releasing the dlc to help build on that updated system a very very good modding community personally for me this is the biggest selling point for stellaris as with each new patch the modding community brings out more and more unique and fun mods to try out these mods can be very impactful and flesh out the game s mechanics and build upon them such as mods that add in more unique events expand upon the political diplomacy side or even add whole new planets for you to explore and conquer or they can be as simple as different ship models from other series such as star wars star trek mass effect etc i cannot do the modding community justice with this review each and every single mod brings something new to the table the mods are constantly updated with every new patch which keeps the game constantly content rich even when no new dlc s or patches are being dropped cons stellaris reliance on dlc s can be quite annoying at times what i mean by this is that due to the high amount of dlc s that add content and keep the game fresh interesting it has left the base game a bit stale dont get me wrong you can get hundreds of hours of entertainment from the base game however the more you play it the more you realise just how limited the base game is without a few key dlc s this does not mean that you need dlc s to enjoy the game however it does mean that some dlc s are needed to if you want to have access to specific in game mechanics that should ve came default with the game the biggest culprit dlc wise is utopia stellaris without utopia in my opinion feels like it has 80 of the content i would expect from a 4x game that is set in space whilst the other 20 is locked behind utopia dont get me wrong you can certainly play the game without the utopia dlc however if you love the game i would recommend getting the utopia dlc as your highest priority it adds a bunch of content that should ve came with the base game in my opinion in a perfect utopia stellaris should come bundled with the utopia dlc for a bit more of a cost however unfortunately that is not the case other dlc s are also very much worth it however if you simply want to play stellaris at a base level and maybe buy 1 dlc i would always go for the utopia dlc some mechanics aren t as deep as other paradox 4x games due to the game having a lot of fleshed out content that you can go very in depth in it has unfortunately lead to a bunch of mechanics very bland and generic the biggest culprit of this right now is the ground assault army system where you can build up armies on planets you control embark them where the soldiers somehow magically turn into one large ship and invade another empires planet that you are currently at war with the system on paper sounds quite fun you can pick and choose what planets to pluck from enemy empires and rule over them once the war is over however in execution the whole system is just well bland and not very interactive you build armies embark attack a planet you look at a screen and see the enemy numbers go down until you eventually win theres no strategy or gameplay its mostly just oh i have the bigger number so i win space combat also falls into this a little bit however it at least has customisation meanwhile the ground combat is largely based on what troop types you have researched and how many troops you make on a planet before sending them down other systems are also not very fleshed out however they arent as noticable thankfully the modding community has helped rectify this by creating mods that expand on this system and some other less polished ones due to new content being added the ui is slowly becoming more and more bloated with buttons alerts and multiple notifications on your screen it can be hard to navigate through all the content and find specific areas you want to focus on especially if you have dlc s as new buttons areas are unlocked which can be easily missed however there are mods to help with that i am confident that the dev s will update the increasingly bloated ui so it is a lot more user friendly
