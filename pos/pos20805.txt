2023 i will keep it brief as many have already stated in their review this game is simply magical they fleshed out the books and the movies of harry potter and made every aspect of the world come alive spent the first 8 hours of my time in just hogwarts marvelling and getting lost while looking for collectables and lore a huge thank you to avalanche for making the game we all wanted it was crafted with love by people who love the wizardling world and it shows this game is in my top 5 of all time and worth your time and money i am 30 hours in and have so much more to experience keep the hate and the politics out of your games your life will be better if you just play games to have fun that is what they are meant for it might have taken over 20 years to get here but finally your invitation to hogwarts has arrived
