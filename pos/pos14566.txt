2018 as a completely new and clueless player to the sid meier s civilization franchise it took me a lot of hours of gameplay tutorials and walkthroughs to finally learn how to properly play the game even at my current playtime which is 30 hours i m 100 sure that i have not explored even 1 4 of the game civ6 is also educational for someone like me who doesn t know much about history you get to learn about past civilizations and a hero that lead them to the peak of their time you also get a description of every wonder that you build and every time you proceed on the science and culture progress you get a quote regarding the matter that you researched which i think is also a very nice touch i must also add that it is awesome having the ability to interact with the other leaders playing on the same session declaring friendships asking for alliances doing trades making them mad or happy with your actions etc i can t compare civ6 to any of the previous games because as i stated before i haven t played them as someone who got introduced to civ on this date and this version i can t say i m dissapointed that i gave this a try
