2020 i m probably not the best judge of this game i use it to help me focus while studying i turn it on in the background set it to pause whenever there s an incident play it at the slowest speed and set it to the easiest setting the music is great and is a lot like the stuff people study too and the sound affects mix well with it i check in on the game during my breaks since its a fun game all on its own i get excited to study because i ve associated it with playing this game
