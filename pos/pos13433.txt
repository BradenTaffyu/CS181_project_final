2021 kerbal is a fantastic game in short the game makes puzzle solving and creating fun and enjoyable while also making you think of real science concepts i barely touched the depth of this game and am enamored with the game as a whole the building of space and flying vehicles is fun and lets me be as creative as i want to be when i build something that fails it is also forgiving and makes trial and error part of the fun experience when you make something that works you feel a sense of accomplishment and feel compelled to try new things and aim higher when all is said and done this game is the best i have played in this style and a must play the game is worth full price but never say no to a discount if you can find one thank you squad developers for making such a fun and beautiful game
