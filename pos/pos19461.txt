2023 fallout new vegas is probably one of the best written games ever this is my first time ever playing a fallout game and i genuinely very much enjoyed all the diverse types of dialogue in this game and how distinct all the factions are extremely awesome how the ending adds the companions you made along the way and also depends on if you did their sidequests or not which change their own outcomes most dialogue options have a lot of different options which go for different reactions from the npcs the music is great no matter where you are the characters even the really bad ones like the legion are amazing the map is pretty big and i m sure you never really run out of options you don t even need mods to enhance the gameplay it is great by itself i also adore how i made a female courier and the legion still looks at you different for being a female because of the misogyny in their lore extra points if you ve never played a fallout game i d suggest playing this one ps i love yes man and joshua graham all the characters rule
