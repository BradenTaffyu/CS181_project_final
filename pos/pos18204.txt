a very early review that i ll update throughout the day but so far the game plays smoothly and is deeply reminiscent of it s predecessor so an easy pickup for those who have played the first haven t gotten deeply into some of the new mechanics yet but excited to see them update 1 2hrs continued to enjoy the game does seem like the ai is a little lacking in one game i was able to invade their home system and they didn t attempt to bring their main fleet back until i d already razed conquered a planet it takes a little getting used to over something like the paradox style outliner but the summary views you do have of your planets are great i would recommend playing the tutorial as a lot of the smaller new things are harder to discover on your own without being walked thru really enjoying the combat and overall gameplay loop though update 2 4hrs game has continued to run smooth on larger maps which doesn t seem to be the norm these days the ability to go to x10 speed is great when things have slowed down looking at you crystal income the orbital mechanics are a little crazy but fun suddenly had two of my systems warp lane separated by the home planet of a rather grumpy minor faction while my fleet was mostly on the far side of the map update 3 8hrs still loving it my only complaint so far is the ai is a bit lacking it s not terrible but a human player targeting specific ships during combat is going to have a pretty big advantage
