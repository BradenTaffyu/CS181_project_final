2017 the big a3 welcome to arma 3 the big one if you didn t just start pc gaming an hour ago you ve probably heard of arma 3 every time someone says the names call of duty battlefield squad red orchestra verdun or any other shooter title out there they do so in hushed tones and with their hands over their mouths for fear of the inevitable tongue lashing they re about to receive from an arma fan fans of the arma series are fiercly loyal and totally uncompromising i have little doubt you ve heard the following phrases if you want realism you should play arma only casuals play arma 3 is way better because and it s annoying and inarguably elitist but in their defense also mostly true arma 3 is not for someone who is looking for a casual shooter experience arma 3 is for those of us that want to camp out in the trees waiting for the three guys you saw 30 minutes before and hoping you can pull of a successful ambush quickly quietly and without getting hit then walking for another 30 minutes to link up with another squad grab some vehicles and truck a few kilometers out to set up a new fob you can expect to go upwards of 3 hours without firing a shot on certain servers which brings me to my next point the game within a game within a game within a game one of a3 s major selling points is it s massive active dedicated and diverse community of modders arma 3 has a great single player campaign and a few nice king of the hill and wasteland servers that you will want to visit occasionally but arma gets particularly interesting when you go mod shopping in the mood to lose track of 30 hours while you re dodging police officers and rival gangs as you fight to expand your criminal empire across altis and or tanoa asylum life servers are a personal favorite of mine complete with a living player driven economy impactful politics between gangs and a police force trying to keep control of the island as these gangs throw lead and shade at one another in a constant struggle for turf if that sounds familiar to you make no mistake gta v doesn t come close to touching the complexity of life servers there are mods for different eras of warfare gamemodes for about anything you can imagine and you can find most of them on steam workshop making it easy to access and giving you infinite playtime you literally cannot run out of things to do because there is always more content i could honestly write about arma all evening but i ll leave you with a few pros and cons and then i ll wrap things up for you pros infinite play value you can never run out of contentsatisfying and memorable moments come to those with patiencegame modes for almost everything thanks to the modding communitygreat graphics for excellent immersionendless selection of weapons vehicles gear etc shed your casual title and pick up the mark of master gamer cons arma 3 is not well optimized and is very cpu intensive still perfectly playable at 30fps though you will need a high end i7 if you expect to get anywhere near 60fps on most multiplayer servers amd users be warned seriously not for casual gamers i cannot stress this enough it can take hours to accomplish simple goals depending on your game mode highly satisfying when things come together though expect to move slowly while learning controls arma 3 is a game that uses just about all of your keyboard and it will take you a while to master but should i buy it i can t recommend this game enough but if you re a die hard call of duty fan but you still pick up this title you re in for a rude awakening casual gamers be warned
