2015 after a very long wait iracing is finally on steam and im very happy especially them giving out keys to existing members this game is subscription based which i don t mind by having a subscription it shows that the members are serious about sim racing i normally do my subscription for one year when they have there subscription s on special iracing a screenshot of iracing by fulysic content you do start out with some cars and tracks i personally can t remember what you start with its been so long but iracing has uploaded some pictures on the store page of what you get is the content expensive yes it can be if you buy all the content like me but if you buy only what you like it s not so bad but keep in mind all tracks are laser scanned so from every bump right up to every building is modeled into iracings tracks this also goes for the cars they take hundreds and thousands of photos video and sounds to bring cars too life i have been a member for over two years and easily have over 1000 hours of driving time plus i own every piece of iracing content all cars all tracks and this includes tech tracks i won t sugar coat it this game takes a very high level of driving skill and great deal of time to master it s not easy especially someone who is coming from an arcade game this game is pure simulation i used to use iracing for practice when i had my real race car and iracing was good place to practice now i no longer race in real life i still play iracing its great challenge with a great large community iracing a screenshot of iracing by fulysic i personally recommend using a wheel and pedal set to play iracing but you can use it with keyboard or game pad etc i personally find it near impossible with keyboard and you can achieve good results with game pad with practice the racing is as close to real life as possible and some times your lucky enough to brush door panels with real famous race car drives there is a full licence structure and also system to report deliberate rammers if you find one in two years of play i have had three rammers you can personalise your cars to make them who you are and using trading paints you can upload custom paint jobs for example maybe upload replica of your favorite race car or create your own in gimp or photoshop or use pre made ones on trading paints or use there in house paint system possibilities are endless car setups are highly detailed and represent their real life counter parts this takes time and practice to learn sometimes the smallest adjustment can have great change but if your unsure about setups when starting in rookie you can visit the forum and grab a pre made setup from a fellow raceror use iracing pre made setups or race in fixed setup race s i recommend this game only if your into full simulation racing but i think iracing should offer one month free so people can try before they buy iracing a screenshot of iracing by fulysic
