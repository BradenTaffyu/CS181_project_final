2021 early access review super good heavenly good so much so that after pirating it i actually bought it here are some things i have done in my 138 hours of gameplay ditching my original body and trying to survive as a goat roleplay as happy mask salesman but instead of charm i had an axe and the masks were freshly ripped of my victims take jaunts across qud with space time vortexes dominating various creatures and then sending them as scouts through these portals most fun tbh commiting local genocide on powerless tribes for fun and profit mostly profit finding a rare liquid weep and crashing the water economy wine weep install playable slime mod and become a literal psychic god able to crush foes with mere thought spawning countless clones of myself to decimate the entire map for once trying to do a normal playthrough only to get to level 12 and rush into the jungle thinking goatfolk sowers can t hurt me anymore they absolutely can explore the lower left region of the map do not research getting delimbed and beheaded by a fish oh yeah this game s got a pretty active for a game of this caliber workshop which has some mods which make the game so much fun one important thing to note is not once in my 138 hours did i actually complete caves of qud it s a freaking hard game but as long and you re not looking to win but to just have fun it s the perfect game
