2017 early access review i once had a cult that worshiped cthulhu tribesmen tried to raid me but i chased them away and took their people as prisoners after harvesting their lungs and kidneys i sacrificed their bodies to the lords of the underworld in exchange for knowledge on my research project many colonist approved of my actions but there were some who were against the cult s beliefs when i wasn t looking my preacher found the non believer and beat him to death i was sad about the death of my colonist so i did the next best thing i sacrificed his body to cthulhu i received great gains in my research project and was able to complete the research within 1 days time even after death you were very useful r i p poppy10 10 would recommend
