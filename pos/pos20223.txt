a good crpg with a warhammer 40k theme sci fi explore space with a variety of companions fighting via ship and planetside graphics are pleasant music is solid gameplay is fun be warned the game is very wordy and not a lot of it is voiced however there are plenty of choices consequences to be made which impact your story plenty of freedom to play how you want bugs were encountered in the later chapters hopefully these will be ironed out in future 4 5
