i enjoyed the game but definitely wouldn t say it has a re playable quality after a while the combat is repetitive the treasures that you find around the map quickly become boring and useless to your leveled character and the story was a bit flat for me it has an absolutely beautiful map and you can tell the creators spent most of their time on that aspect anyone who is a harry potter fan will enjoy playing this if not solely for the feel of being a part of the wizarding world and for those of us still begrudgingly waiting for our letter this is a nice bandaid to console us for the present
