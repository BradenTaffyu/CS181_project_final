2017 early access review i tried it out it seems cool okay now the serious review the basicsto start off this game is one of a kind you will not find another modern day game that has this realistic of vehicle physics the game has countless things you can try and no two accidents will ever be the same you can simulate everything from hitting a wall at 25 mph to being rear ended by a apc at 300 mph the crash physics of this game is so realistic that we actually use it to sometimes recreate accidents that have happened in real life accidents aren t the only thing you can do in this game you can have vehicle pursuits plane crashes off roading hill climbing racing truck driving or just general around there is always something new to do in this game it ends at how creative you are my favorite thing to do is have ai cars driving around and me in a police car chasing another ai every turn is a risk and intersection is a risk will there be a car there who knows pros the game runs pretty wellgood fpsdon t need a nasa computervery funalways something newgreat modding community no steam workshop yet very realistic crash physics and vehicle handling cons does sometimes crash at very high speed accidents talking like 350mph accidents makes you lose track of timeno multiplayer and probably won t be ever updates for the game come out every few months which can get old if you experience a problem overall this game is very fun and is a great time killer you will never have two of the same accidents chases or race the graphics are pretty amazing for the game and it runs well for how complex the physics engine is if you re looking for a game that does not get old something you can alwasy try something new in or just something to kill time with this is your game 10 10
