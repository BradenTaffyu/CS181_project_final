2021 early access review so after my first 144 hours in game i have decided that the early access has a really strong foundation the good the graphics are nice combat is excellent including horse movement and weapon use the battles are excellent including formations and orders sieges are much more improved from warband with the addition of optional siege equipment the towns feels alive the factions are interesting and feel different culturally i like the leveling up system it feels pretty free and not too complicated with some nice benefits to putting time in to skills you are using in a way you enjoy the game anyway trading is fun and a good way to make some cash though the economy needs work as a whole talked about below i prefer the sandbox mode over the campaign mode as it just plonks you in the world alone without a main story much like warband though the story is fun the first time desptire the tediousness of constantly getting repetitive quests your family tree is also amazing getting a spouse having children watching them grow up start families for themselves eventually dying of old age and having your child take over is very immersive the badsmithing needs a rework as its really over underpowered depending on what you are currently making though its necessary due to the below while i like the clan system over all it needs some work mechanically for instance allowing lords to join you despite their clan s intentions this could work either as the lord forming a new clan or they are put in a rogue lord category until they are back in the same faction as the leader of their clan the uglythe economy is absolutely trash you can t make enough money naturally to achieve any of the necessary goals smithing cheese pretty much has to be used to balance the lack of money required for basic mechanics this ties in to below diplomacy is also absolutely trash the way you end a war is just throwing a random lord 150k gold to stop it no negotiations or agreements between the leaders of each faction which is a step back for warband or your council can just agree to pay a daily tribute to stop the fighting again without agreement from the enemy you are paying tribute too also lords can just get auto ransomed or escape very easily without your say or ability to stop it this means that during a siege for example you can defeat a lord capture them then have them come back with a new army during the same siege that is a mess you should be able to lock people up forever if you so want or at least only have it so another lord breaks them out or a tiny chance to escape based on the security of the settlement summaryin its current state the early game is incredible the mid game is fun but the late game only is really fun if you are a vassal having your own kingdom just isn t fleshed out yet i think the game could be pretty easily perfected by removing the economy aspect from the diplomacy aspect not having to bottleneck the game with silver and instead having diplomacy work on merit and situation alone would improve the game tremendously edit spelling mistake
