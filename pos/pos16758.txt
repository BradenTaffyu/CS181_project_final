2020 are you a millennial that yearns to decorate the inside of a home you ll never be able to afford are you a closeted goth that knows they have to dress professionally to survive but just wants to paint an entire room black with a single doll on the floor do you listen to podcasts but have nothing to do with your hands while listening in all seriousness though this game is relaxing and fulfills my need to decorate in wildly different aesthetics without bleeding my actual money dry the money flows easily very little grinding if at all and new content comes out on a regular basis i m still waiting for the garden dlc to dip in price but the game stands alone very well without it highly recommend
