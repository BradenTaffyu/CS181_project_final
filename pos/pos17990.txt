2021 game certainly had a rocky start but after my latest campaign i feel i can recommend this game to others as a fan of grand strategy total war has always been on my radar i was hugely disappointed with the release of total war rome ii but over the years the game has not only come into a more playable state but is actually quite fun now there is a huge variety of factions and units if you own all the dlc beautiful graphics that hold up even today and with a very user friendly interface the game is fast to learn biggest downside is that the game really does require much of the dlc to be fun in my opinion the dlc fleshes out many of the more underused factions to make them more interesting and campaigns less monotonous as you begin to rack up the hours my biggest complaint however is the ai i rarely see them backstab me or even declare war on me even on higher difficulties this can be rectified with modding but you d think with all the experience under ca s belt with this franchise that they d be able to get the ai perfect aside from that i would recommend a purchase on sale game is a blast and a great time sink
