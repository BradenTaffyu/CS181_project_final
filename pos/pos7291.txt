2018 anyone who played euro truck simulator 2 may find the game a little too familiar in places the interface and structure are pretty much identical and it feels like they ve picked up the old game and dropped it into the new location even different colours or visual flourishes on the interface would have been welcome just to remind you that it is indeed a new work as a result if you were already burned out on ets the new setting might not be enough to reignite your passion it s a very similar experience overall the trucks of which there are only two available at launch don t really feel that different to their european counterparts it s more like an iteration than a fully blown sequel but if scs are as tireless and passionate with ongoing updates as they are with euro truck simulator 2 ats will only get better as it grows america is a vast varied country with a lot of different scenery and more states to drive through will make for more interesting journeys for now this is a polished strangely enjoyable simulator that you can easily lose hours to but if you want to travel further afield you might want to wait until there are more places to go to a great start but american truck simulator will really begin to take shape when more states and trucks are added
