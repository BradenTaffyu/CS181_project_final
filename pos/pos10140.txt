2021 i didn t know i needed rimworld until i got it and now i need more of it i am not addicted part 1 general opinion as for the game itself i can totaly see how this game is not for everyone the game is like trying to fly a plane with one lesson on piloting and a how to be a pilot 101 handbook the handbook being a search bar with a list of short explanations on certain things you may need on the top right of your screen sometimes it can be useful but more often than not the info is a bit too vague but here is the thing for some people it is way more fun to actually rummage through the game s menus trying to figure out what things are possible i ve reset my world 6 times now trying different places different people and just generally exploring the posibilities this game offers at the current moment of writing this review i ve played the game for 59 2 hours and it still feels like i ve barely scratched the surface of the things i can do so if you would prefer a more straight forward gameplay expirience this game might not be for you part 2 replayability that part of the game that i am looking forward to but haven t quite reached yet is writing scenarios these are basically the rules for your playthrough you can start with certain items or researches you can start with different faction hostility or friendliness you can even determine your worlds temperature so you can finally get your frostpunk experience in rimworld you can come up with a start and then decide for yourself an end goal so that you have something to work forward to that will conclude this story you ve created this opens up a space for as much replay ability for as many playthroughs as you can come up with and if you are running out of ideas i am sure you can find tons upon tons of ideas within rimworld s community part 3 some notes even as a beginner i would still recommend choosing the permadeath mode the ability to reload your saves makes the game a bit too easy though having the ability to reload can be fun if this is the kind of playstile you enjoy so don t let me affect your choices here too much this game has a great modding community there are tons of mods that can shape your playthrough from different scenarios to additionall content this community has a lot of it there are little mods i can recommend to everyone it all depends on what you want really so i ve got only one recomendation get p music and camera they are absolutely great thanks for spending your time to read this review now spend no more time and get yourself some rimworld if it sounds like your cup of tea
