2016 in general if you want to drive trucks build your very own company by hiring drivers well this game is for you i have been playing ets2 for quite a bit of time which is based in europe so now this game is based in america currently it includes 3 states california neveda and arizona and i have to say that they have really improved on the map road textured day cycle etc is this game worth over ets2 well it s really your choice depending on which continent you wanna drive in but if it was for me to make decision i would have gone for ats over ets2 due to few reasons i listed above is this game worth the money yes they actuallydid a very good job you won t find any better trucking game then this right now the game is lacking dlc s obeviously it s new but in time to come there will be better and cooler dlc s
