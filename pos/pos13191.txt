2015 early access review this game will teach you more about physics than any bloody school starting off my ships all exploded on the launchpad eventually though i managed to get a ship to 10 000 meters up in the air before it fell back on the ground killing everyone within that i thought was the greatest thing i have ever done fast forward a week or two later and i have already mastered orbiting have landed on the mun duna and eve and am ready to set up my first refueling space stacion and send a rover to duna this game pumps more adrenaline into my veins than any fps out there and is probably the most rewarding game i have ever played landing your first ship will make you jump i promise you that the only downside is that there are some fairly annoying glitches for example warping time in atmosphere your ship up badly but they don t appear all that often definetly a must buy
