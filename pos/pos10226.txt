2016 early access review one of the great games which worths paying for full price bought the game on the first day released on steam start playing since a14 donno what to do when i first playing the game after they added a tutorial on a15 after that still lots to learn i search every wiki and walkthrough tried lots of map dead loads of time um few months passed i still put all my time non stop playing rimworld everyday your friends and family may gonna hate this game i also a big fanz or prison architect but they are nothing similar both are so fun to learn how to play and build better bases to live survive i love it still on early access cos they keep updates every few months recommend to all who loves simulation and sandbox games and dont keep loads of animal pet in your colony still my favourite game on 2017 i really hope it will gets some awards
