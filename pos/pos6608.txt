there are two types of players 1 playing as realistically as possible treating it if as though it is real life2 playing it like forza and driving 160 km h down every highway with a tandem trailer until you either crash and flip over or make it with at least 50 damage for the earnings to instantly go to repairs plus points for the broken physics engine making you do 300 flips in the air both ways are really fun 10 10
