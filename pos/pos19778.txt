2021 the best thing about the definitive edition is that it doesn t look like the original version of the game but it looks just like how i remember it looked like 20 years ago on modern hardware it gives me the same visual delight i had with 15 crt monitors you know when computers couldn t offer more pixels back then we did our own upscaling in our brains imagination played a big part on how games looked like other than this nostalgic value age of empires ii definitive edition comes with some quality of life improvements gameplay wise and i really liked them sure the game has some minor glitches and pathfinding problems for units but it s still a solid game for even the newcomers
