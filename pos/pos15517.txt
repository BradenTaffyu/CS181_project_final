2022 painstakingly realistic this game has helped me diagnose a lot of things not only on my own car but on other cars at work yes i am also a technician irl anyways this game has me tearing my hair out in some points during diagnoses i just had a car 370z lookalike that had a knocking noise in the engine bay found most of the issues wrong with the car like bad fuel rail bad ignition coil on plugs and a bad cam and there was one unknown cause left damn near tore the whole car apart till i randomly found that the engine air filter box was the issue what makes me so mad is that its a likely scenario and that it was in a videogame the only thing missing from this game is the incessant swearing when working on these cars other than that 10 10 would recommend
