2016 if you like harvest moon or animal crossing you will love this game it s not a clone of either and it does enough differently that it s unique but it does draw inspiration from them in addition to an extremely deep crafting system it also has a sense of heart that most games don t the level of care put into the minute details of the town is perfect and the townsfolk have a surprising amount of soul this game is an utter gem i highly recommend it to any fans of the genre as well as those who like snes era rpgs
