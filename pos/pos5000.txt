2018 enjoyed it about as much as the other bethesda games which is to say a lot i went in with tempered expectations and after hundreds and hundreds of hours in all other bethesda games wasn t nearly excited for this entry i knew what to expect but ultimately it delivered in spades the map is so dense and every area is unique spent way more time on fort building than i thought i would could be a game unto itself and would be great for multiplayer but as it is there was no real incentive for me to continue to build out my forts i eventually abandoned fort building outside of setting up basic defenses pro tip local leader perk is essential allows you to share resources between settlements and especially if you re a pack rat like me saves sooo much time traveling while overloaded far harbor and nuka world dlc is great automatron is good if only for letting you build robot companions my red rocket base is completely run by more than a dozen custom robots wasteland and contraptions workshop were useless to me didn t think i d enjoy it as much as i did and it ended up being my favorite entry in the series one of my top 5 games for sure
