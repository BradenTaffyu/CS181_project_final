2023 i m a long time total war player and this is my favorite one in the series it s taken me a while to write a review on this game because i was thinking to myself well anyone who likes strategy games must already know how good total war warhammer 2 is but now i m here on a thursday and thought to myself why don t i go to steam and review all the games i really like you know what normal people do total war warhammer 2 is one of my favorite strategy games of all times the sheer variety of factions you can play is incredible a feat on its own the play style difference between two factions even some within the same race is one of the main selling points i use when roping my friends into spending way too much money on this game sorry bois you can play orks and your boy can play goblins and the issues you have to deal with and the problems you have to solve in your empire are going to be vastly different the way that they have seamlessly woven so much warhammer fantasy lore into the mechanics of the game is incredible magic items from books characters from stories it s all there most of it anyway the map dude the map it s so incredibly detailed and beautifully rendered you can see every little mountain top you can see dragons and griffons flying around mountain peaks the only thing i dislike about the total war warhammer series is the immortal empires campaign with multiplayer and how they sorta handled it if i wanna have a decent experience with my friends even in warhammer 3 all of us pretty much have to have own all three games you could still play if everyone just owned the same one but really the experience isn t complete and there s some restrictions i would ve liked to see some system where if the host owned all the games the guest could choose from any faction or something idk man i m not a game designer kinda like stellaris does anyway i love this game if you love the total wars series or are a fan of the warhammer fantasy lore get this game thanks luv u bye
