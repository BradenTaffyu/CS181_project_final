to think that stardew was made by a single developer the breath and depth of the content is amazing even if you use the wiki to somewhat cheat and find secrets there is still a seemingly endless amount of content to discover aside from all of the secrets and characters it s nice to just walk around the stardew valley and escape into another virtual life i highly recommend this game for anyone from a casual gamer to someone into more resource optimization
