2019 i ve never played the first and the second game simply because i was intimidate by the dark souls franchise it s a franchise that is well known to be hard unforgiven and that only a a human with godly reflexes can beat but obviously that s not quite the truth the game is not actually hard the only thing that is hard is that it s complicated at first for the player to understand that he isn t an overpowered human that can cut through an army of demon with a chainsaw or a semi god that can kill gods with his bare hand you are just a nobody that has to fight his her way through a dark corrupted world you have to learn how to fight against giants knights and a whole bunch of other creatures that are much more skilled than you you will have to understand that to progress in this game as well as any other from software any game in general you will have to take some hit to learn how to dodge them you will have to miss your attacks to know when to attack you will have to lose to know how to win the most important thing is to stay determined no matter what if you are dying against a boss over and over again just stop playing for the day and come back the next one it worked for me so maybe it will for you after more than twenty hours i finished the game and yes it wasn t easy i died 104 times and yet i haven t fought against every single boss i think that i am missing like 2 or 3 maybe 4 and i think that i will start on ng to see everything that the game has to offer this game is worth your time if you are willing to let it teach you how to play it
