2017 creative assembly rebraned the game emperor edition to write off bad reviews given at launch and sort of reboot the game and i can t really feel angry because the game has completely changed since its launch if you tried to love the game and couldn t do it back then then i definetly urge you to give it a shot especially if you find it on sale definetly a good game now
