2022 you can tell from my play time that i enjoyed the game enough to play it for that long it wasnt just the game being too good but the community and the developers are very nice and respectable believe me its too much fun to play and chat with others sharing knowledge with other players since this game is knowledge based even the developers are there for you and ready to answer any question you have which is nice because you dont see that everywhere i will start by rating everything i can remember since this game feels endless to me which is awesome you know the genre of the game so no need to explain it gameplay doing missions once isnt the end you can challenge youself in harder difficulty to see how you improved or if you want more challenge why rate it when its what you basically do when you play if i disliked it i wont have over 250hours of gameplay classes sorry the number is very long for this post the possibilities are endless you have over 700 masteries with so many effects going from basically increasing stats to conditions like if you one shot an enemy you can act again or counterattacking or even reviving stealing buffs freezing silencing so much this post cant handle oh and by the way this is the most fun part of the end game missions you suffer with as a full team eventually will be easy to do with less members even beasts taming 1000 1000 you cant just walk around in the city without bringing at least a dragon or earth crab wink with you seriously though taming beasts is not just a challenge on its own but also training the beast can make it as good as an extra member which is amazing some beasts are capable of taking hits for days or clearing a group of enemies with one big aoe attack or even both why not possibilities are endless crafting 1000 1000equipments can have so many types of stats depending on what you aim for like more speed and critical stats or more hp and block dodge stats crafting isnt bad at all doing late missions few times can get you enough materials to craft more and get the stats you need they add too much to what the character or class is capable of dandylion awesome developer team always listening to us whatever the problem we had was you always fixed it in time your hard work is very much appreciated ah i need to stop this post is too long already i just want to say my favorite character is irene hero irene villains watch out if i ever see you i will come at you from the window with my flaming kick justice power thank you dandylion for this awesome game much love
