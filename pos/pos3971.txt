2022 this review is for casual to mid range gamers because there are plenty of reviews from the competitive crowd that go into much more intense detail than i am capable of doing i ll keep this short because in the end all i m doing is throwing my hat in the ring with 97 of other slay the spire players in saying this game is 100 worth your money so i ll address the one thing i haven t seen any other reviews talking about the difficulty complexity curve in slay the spire is about as close to perfect as it gets each of the four characters plays fundamentally differently and each has multiple viable paths for building a deck as you start learning the game the first thing you ll be doing is unlocking additional cards and relics for each character allowing those cards and relics to show up in future runs these unlocks slowly ramp up the complexity of the game by providing the player with more options and hinting at new deck archetypes to shoot for in future runs by the time you ve gotten all five unlocks on a character you ve likely won a run or two winning your first run unlocks the first of twenty ascension levels for that character each of which progressively makes runs on that character a bit more difficult in different ways which are clearly noted in the character select ui i haven t progressed too far into ascension as i m still working on a final couple of unlocks but even as a gamer who prefers to play games for story over mechanics i am thoroughly impressed by how smoothly slay the spire eased me into the game this is not to say the game is not difficult it is unforgiving moderately luck based and occasionally infuriating but the developers have done a splendid job of crafting a new player onboarding ramp that makes it honestly difficult not to learn the basics of how the game works i ve never seen such a smooth onboarding for such a difficult game and it makes the experience far more welcoming than it has any right to be given how gleefully the rng will royally screw you over at times so for casual to mid range gamers wondering if slay the spire is too hardcore for them well it probably is but it ll do a damn fine job of getting you to a point where for at least a little while for a few runs every now and again you can be hardcore too i highly recommend it
