despite its pitfalls at launch i am very much enjoying this game performance is manageable and in my experience little different now to the first cities skylines building is smooth and infinitely faster than in the first game a junction that would take 45 minutes to complete to still end up looking questionable can now be done in minutes so many frustrations and quirks of the first game have vanished i find this game infinitely more enjoyable than the first it is unfortunate that mods are not released in an official capacity yet but at the moment a realistic ish city is more than possible without any i think this game is getting too much flak based on assumptions that it would live up to every niche expectation that was available in the first game anyone looking to build a city and do it peacefully easily and enjoyably should get this game
