2014 early access review this is the one thing this game was missing multiplayer and it is extremely well done you can host your server from the game without the need for port forwarding downloading extra server files etc the way the servers handle mods is also great if the server has a special server mod it is automatically transfered to your client this is unnoticable with the exception of some client side mods ui related and such all in all if you love don t starve you must get this expansion even if you don t have friends you can play on public servers the community is great out there p s i gave the extra copy to one of my friends already so please stop adding and asking if i can give you the extra copy i write this only because i have recieved multiple friend requests from people who saw this review asking me if i could give them the extra copy
