2022 this game took my soul oh yeah play stardew valley a cute little farming simulator the event that occurred next nobody could have predicted an event of great magnitude and catastrophic cost i have dedicated the past month to achieving all 40 achievements this game throws at you it starts out easy oh yeah get 50 000 gold oh nice cook 25 recipes however what they don t tell you is the majority of the achievements are only gained at the end and i don t use the word end lightly it took me 3 in game years to achieve this feat yes it can be done in two but at this point 2 years 3 years 10 years it all feels the same the monotonous tasks of filling casks with fruit to make wine grinding for the mythic prismatic shards it takes so long and none of these tasks are boring or un fun the entire time i was thrilled but i lost a part of myself somewhere along the journey something that i will never get back maybe it was when i accidentally spent all my qi gems on 250 qi seasoning or maybe it was the time i mis clicked a mega bomb after finishing designing a part of my farm wherever whenever i lost that part of myself doesn t matter its gone for good all we can do now is look to the future keep our heads up and keep on marching maybe one day i may wake up and it will all feel like a bad dream and only then will i be able to rejoin society as a normal person once more someone not scarred by the wound only stardew valley could inflict maybe i will feel okay again maybe10 10 would play again
