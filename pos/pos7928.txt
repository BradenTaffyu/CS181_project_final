2018 early access review where to start this game is an absolute masterpiece even in its early access state the amount of fun and goofing around i ve had in this game is nothing short of staggering in this game you have the freedom to do whatever you like with a bunch of combinations of vehicles if you like recreating crashes or just hitting walls you can do that if you like racing you can do that if you like drag racing you can do that if you want to rock climb you can do that you can do all of that an much much more with just the base game i havent even mentioned mods yet the modding community is my favorite part of this game creators have added countless cars maps new sounds etc my personal favorites are all the monster truck mods if you haven t bought this game yet do it now you will not be disappoined 10 10 my favorite game on steam
