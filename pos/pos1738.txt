2018 this game is uniquely flawed you ll see exactly what i mean in the opening sequence of the game in order to even access the main game new players are forced into frustration when they are thrown into the deep end with a long prologue there is very little in the way of guidance players aren t even aware that they can open their inventory for healing items unless they find this out on their own on top of new players having to grasp new combat systems they are also not afforded the luxury of a save point throughout the entire prologue which includes 2 boss fights meaning every death forces them to restart which inevitably becomes tedious and leads to frustration i can only imagine the impact this has had on the games success after all first impressions are immensely important and judging by the way the game expertly toys with players later on i have to believe that this was done entirely intentionally but wait they intentionally hurt their own success by creating a frustrating introduction maybe i m thinking too deeply here but i believe that that is part of the charm of nier automata it s very deep and very thought provoking and you won t appreciate the game unless you stick with it to the end forcing yourself through the prologue is an ordeal but the game is only better for it even if you only come to understand that after completing it nier automata is a story driven action hack n slash rpg so let s go through these one at a time the story the main focus of the game you play as 2b a combat android under the command of yorha a military force set up to combat the machines that now inhabit planet earth by the human race who now inhabit the moon without spoiling anything i will say that the plot is intitially very vague and confusing even after completing the entire game consisting of 3 story arc s the player may not understand the entire plot it can come off as simplistic even if the player doesn t do their part in trying to understand it the story does make complete sense though you just have to do a lot of the thinking yourself you can t just focus on the events happening to the main characters because the story isn t just about them they are only pieces in a world with larger dynamics at play it s incredibly complex deep and philosophical there are lots of little collectables you can find that give you more pieces of the puzzle too all in all the story is the main reason for playing the game and if you re into philosophy and deep thinking it s totally worth it if you are expecting a more souls y experience which is light on in game plot and focuses more on challenging gameplay you may be disappointed keep reading for an in depth review of the other elements of the game if you are interested action hack n slash this game is action packed there are amazing cinematic moments and really stunning visuals and map design which changes as you progress through the story the camera angles are actually used to add to the experience generally to the game s merit though on occasion it can be frustrating to get the camera angle you are looking for during combat combat isn t incredibly deep you re limited to light and heavy attacks or a mixture of the two as well as a dodge which grants the player invincibility frames the ability to counter attack an enemy and has little to no cooldown the player can also find a sizeable range of weapons which apply variable move sets to your attacks combat is very fluid and enjoyable if feeling a little dumbed down the only big issue i have is that the pc port has the dodge hot keyed to double tap i don t know if they actually play tested this because double tapping a key to evade is considerably more difficult than a single key bind unfortunately you are also unable to re bind keys which makes me feel like they really didn t put much consideration into the pc port rpg the game acts like a traditional rpg with a bit of a twist as an android the player is able to improve their stats by using chips dropped by enemies that s not all though the player is also given access to chips that affect every element of their hud allowing you to add or remove gameplay elements at will little things like this are common throughout the game and personally i found they occasionally came off as a little cheesy but still add to the game s charm the player can level up their character as well as upgrade their weapons using materials gathered from destroyed enemies personally one issue i had with the game is that i explored too much of the game which meant i was way ahead of the level curve and pretty much steam rolled everything there s no exp cap in place on enemies and the accumulative exp it takes to level up only increases slightly throughout the game so there s nothing to prevent the player from getting far ahead of the level curve and once you re there you generally stay there conclusion all in all the game was an exceptional experience one which i m still trying to fully explore and understand days after completing and if i were rating it based on the story alone it would be an easy 10 10 there are issues with bugs i encountered occasional screen freezes and bugged npc s and the pc port is pretty bad as well as the other issues stated however so my final score is a respectable 9 10
