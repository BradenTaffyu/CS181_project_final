2016 early access review note believe it or not my hours played are much higher and i d say are in high hundreds if not above a thousand as i have played the game mostly off steam review build build 33i recommend this game but i will start my review with the cons and not the pros cons indev for at least 5 years as of writing this review i suspect a mayor feature creep being the problem having read all mondoids developer updates i ve seen some features make it in without being mentioned before while the ones that are promised soon are constantly being delayed while the explanation is always given i can t help but say that the developer team has a policy of not promising anything with a release date that they failed to keep that on numerous occasions pros no drma huge pro for me as i hate drm in all of it s forms steamworks and having to keep steam client on included you can play the game without steam client if you so wish i bought it before indev launched on gog single player zombie survivalanother huge one for me as i m a very single player oriented gamer probably the only zombie survival game in which single player is actually enjoyable why that is later there is multiplayer of course but i can t say much about it as i didn t play it moddingthe game is extremely modable with plenty of great mods that expand the game available already a huge pro from a gamer like me who likes to mod and play with other mods sandbox modei will say i am not a fan of preset difficulty modes the game allows you to customize just about all aspects of your game in it s sandbox mode zombie lore included how the infection spreads zombie intelligence and whether or not they can run is up to you survival itselfi believe that over the past few builds the game has really became a heaven for those who enjoy survival all of the options are valid you can do risky loot runs and live off canned dog food have a farm set up traps for small animals or forage for mushrooms and berries believe me when i say it no matter what you like you ll get it whether you re an action oriented gamer who likes to bash z brains in like me or one who prefers to keep in the shadows mechanics are there and they work graphicsa game from an isometric perspective that mixes 2d and 3d it looks a tad worse than fallout tactics to be honest i love that game but i have found it s style to be the perfect thing for someone like me i admit that this is very subjective though if you like isometric graphics games like fallout 1 2 or tactics you ll like this if you expect cryengine type of stuff and can t live without it consider this a big con as i know that not liking graphics can seriously kill the enjoyment audio soundtrackpz has recently integrated the fmod system the sound quality is good you can tell where they are coming from and there is plenty of ambient sounds to make the world feel alive the soundtrack is a masterpiece of zombie genre i want to buy it now the guy who composed it really knows his stuff and i believe he designed some of the best music you will hear in a zombie game different music will play in game depending on what is currently happening and it works very well communitynever saw a better one to be honest and that is all i ll say active developersthe developers provide the community with regular updates read cons they frequently reply to criticism with well founded arguments and are in general very helpful to the community whenether we have any questions all in all i truly recommend this game to all fans of zombie survival genre especially if you re sick of all the fps tps zombie games this is something fresh for you despite being older than dayz itself it is a game crafted by people who wanted a zombie game before zombie games were a thing and it shows note everything i mentioned in this review is in the game as of build 33 i might update it if something big changes and i will update it after release
