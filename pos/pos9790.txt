2021 there s a special feeling that only a game like rimworld is able to conjure at face value it seems like any other colony sim the player manages a society of people on a harsh planet and your overall goal is to create the happiest and healthiest civilization possible given your knowledge of the game s mechanics and the game s resources this is often when the trial and error ensues and with each failure or victory players learn more about the game s systems it s a safe albeit tired formula that i occasionally like to fall back on when i m craving more casual gameplay this is what i thought that i would be getting when i purchased rimworld but i m so glad that it s not what was delivered to me instead of the typical colony manager rimworld employs a proprietary system and titles itself as a story generator this is the first major difference between contemporary examples of the genre and rimworld story generator i wasn t sure what to make of the description but pressed on into my first playthrough a world seed is procedurally generated and players are asked to choose their starting location anywhere from the arctic ice sheets to tropical green jungles being my first time i simply chose the temperate forest i selected 3 characters with a variety of traits and assortments that looked very commonplace for a game like this some characters are builders some are farmers others are perfect for guarding your colony in the security role while others still fill even more niche procedures like taming animals and cooking this is all very standard and most players who are at home within the genre will have no problem discerning these attributes for themselves what did stand out was the personality traits that had also been gifted to my colonists ruby my miner didn t like to hurt people due to the non violent tag that had been randomly given to her kolchek my security guard was an excellent shot and even better in a melee fight but he had a horrendous addiction to chemicals this is the sort of nuance that i was excited by it s through the ai that these colonists will interact fight and co exist with each other as they each live out simulated lives complete with happiness sadness mechanics it s important not only to make an infrastructurally sound colony but also a recreational one as well colonists will need stimulation in a number of forms to perform at peak level these will often be dictated by unique traits bestowed upon them my colony went smooth for a time i constructed buildings advanced industry and had a respectable stockpile of food that was refrigerated from rot and decay but then the ai storyteller that you choose at the beginning of your game shook things up a bear attack my hunter was wounded out in the field nearly mauled to death the only person with medical training in my colony hauled their bleeding body all the way back to the infirmary and began to implement what little help they could but it was all in vain norbert had died they buried him a day later sadness debuffs descended on my colonists and the two remaining members of the colony visited his grave until they starved and froze in the coming winter hardcore this game does not mess around it will give you the basics and teach you how to survive but it will also be unerring when it delivers sweet retribution to your doorstep on the first night that your colonists don t have a roof over their head they will be unhappy on the fourth night they don t have a roof they will die of exposure you will run into complex problems like the antelope you just killed for meat is rotting in the hot sun and your only chef is laid up in the hospital with stab wounds from yesterday s raid do you have a novice prepare meals and risk food poisoning or do you forgo and hope the cook regains consciousness before the colony starves the game will ask you to manage medical emergencies does that bullet wound get penicillin and bed rest or do we plug it with an herbal remedy and give the colonist a slap on the ass as they limp back to their job these are all things that must be considered and a game like rimworld is the perfect environment to ask these questions the true marvel comes from the unexpected interactions and facets of story that the gameplay creates almost without the player even noticing if you like sims and management games i m surprised you re still here reading these words when you could be playing one of the best in the genre like the review check out my profile for more coming every week and don t forget to subscribe to connoisseur s club for latest news
