2014 never thought that a strategy game would be the most thrilling gaming experience i have but scrupulous hour long planning and carefully forging alliances and marriages while keeping an eye on which direction rival countries are sending their diplomats to because one wrong move can turn your plans to dust is much more addictive than you might think the relief you feel after a long term plan of yours is finally set into successful motion is not describable one of the few games where careful planning and thinking is actually rewarded no simple rock paper scissors battles like in other strategy games even though my enemy may have the bigger and more advanced army i might have won the war through logistics already everything that needs to be said about this game has actually been said already but i just can t pass on the chance to show my appreciation for it i m 90hrs in and i m still finding new ways to play this game everytime i start it up it s complex deep and rewards the player that thinks on a larger scale one of the best purchases i made in years
