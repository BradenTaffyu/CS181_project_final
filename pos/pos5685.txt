2020 early access review is it all we hoped for no is it still really fun yes the first few weeks well lets not speak of those the game in its current state is enjoyable mods fix many issues and the single player experience is solid some perks dont work balancing still needs to be perfected and yet i have sunken more hours into this game than any other in a long time 9 10 needs more looters jk
