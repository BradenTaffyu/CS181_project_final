a lot of people complain about the card acquisition rate and the value of the ultimate card the credit card i get those complaints but at the same time you get a ton of free as someone who hasn t played magic before but has played countless other online tcgs you get a ton of cards for free as a new player they re obviously not going to be world beaters or top tier cards but you will get some decent to very good ones i can t walk into my local gameshop or walmart and tell the employee there yeah uhh hey i won 15 matches in magic today can i get some of this for free i understand the difference between physical cards and virtual ones if you re like me and you re not super interested in physical cards but enjoy tcgs regardless mtg arena is a solid way to invest your time also magic probably has the best card art in any tcg i ve played seeing it in high def with pretty animations and sound effects is just amazing there are a ton of different boards to play on each with their own theme music
