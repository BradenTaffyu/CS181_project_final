2015 fallout 4 is the sixth title released in the fallout series and the third released since the series was revived in 2005 the story takes place in the ruins of the commonwealth of massachusettsand and surrounding areas the best way i can describe the fallout 4 experience is think of fallout 3 having a child with borderlands 2 the skill system and perks are vastly different from prior titles in the series vats is no longer a stop motion targetting system but instead a slow motion one playing on survivor mode is a challenge but the ai seems less advanced than fallout new vegas there are a lot of mixed reviews coming out about fallout 4 mainly i think because people have expectations of what they think it should be what you need to remember is fallout 4 is supposed to be a better performing game this means there needed to be changes to the way previous fallout titles were made i think they did a good job of balancing everything as fallout 4 appears to have a lot less bugs than fallout 3 and new vegas put together however there are clipping issues in a few places i ve discovered but other than that i haven t run into any major problems the building system where you build your own fort on the ruins of sanctuary hills feels a little like a first person shooter version of fallout shelter taking place above ground you can create various stations trader stalls resources defenses building components furniture and more you need to defend your town against creatures and invaders alike and are able to build your town to attract new residents from the commonwealth wasteland this part of the game feels like a separate game in itself at times and can be a lot of fun as far as the exploration options the map is very small compared to the size of new vegas some have compared it to a similar size as the fallout 3 map though i have noticed individual buildings seem to have their own internal instances which might explain why the map is a little smaller there are familiar landmarks from massachusetts which are always a nice touch in the fallout universe the beginning tutorial pre war is absolutely fantastic and whets the appetite for more pre war content for all the differences to previous fallout titles and the inevitable disappointment some will have at this fallout 4 is actually a pretty good game it is still fun not as rpg as previous titles but still an extension of the universe and thus worthy of a playthrough even if you don t care for for the changes i personally find it enjoyable to play the story interesting and the visual effects to be a nice change from previous titles i would strongly urge fans of the series to give this game a chance and am excited to see what downloadable content bethesda comes out with
