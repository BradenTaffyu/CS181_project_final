2018 early access review so rimworld gotta say i m enjoying it so far but the best way to sum up my experience is to tell what s happened so far i think that ll help you decide if you d like to try it better than just talking about it so my second and currently ongoing colony first one only lasted about a week it s three people only one of which a women named benditez isn t a pacifist or scared of conflict so she gets the rifle and armour i then find out she s only got a shooting skill of one and she spends almost two days trying and failing to hunt a tortiose at the very least she gets much more accurate as this happens the base grows at a steady rate expanding to a fourth member who stumbles across us i panic for a while that we have a warg wandering around our base then realise it s apparently our pet ok occasionally hunts dead animals i don t mind that pretty helpfull ocasionally this later comes back to bite me it s been a hard few weeks a psycic droning is driving all the female colonists mad in my case that s all of them to make matters worse a heatwave starts but my ac is good and i ve even built a freezer room it s fine i think we ll weather this out no problem this is not the case one day when two members of the colony have collapsed from heatstroke a wild capybura goes beserk from the heat now the only two members awake are benditez and one of my new ones who s as bad a shot as benditez was originally benditez is knocked out but survives thanks to her flak vest benditez has shot two club weilding madmen dead so far to date but no the giant rodent gets her great the other one is less lucky and starts to bleed out as the other two wake up from the heatstroke the capybura savages them too three colonists are bleeding out and the only other member is unconsious by the time they wake up and this time finish the wounded animal two of the wounded are two hours from bleeding to death one is four hours from bleeding to death and i still can t make medicine and in trying to save them i use my entire stock of meds the two with only two hours left bleed out including my second fighter however one named rozalina survives and unfortunately they re the one that doesn t get along with benditez the two even having fought in the past this then gets even worse with their owner dead the warg goes beserk as well we survive the fight but only because a mysterious stranger in black named ben who thankfully is a vat grown super soldier apparently shows up and saves the two however we re in a bad way food is short we re a long way off harvest time there s blood and vomit from an earlier case of food poisoning everywhere and the colony is in a complete mess after burying the dead we get a message that someone s been captured by bandits but that we could save them they re only lightly guarded i decide that since we couldn t save our own we ll take all we can to go save them instead if we die trying at least we tried at all we ve enough food to get us there and about a quarter of the way back hoping there ll be food as well as someone to save all three arm themselves and head out and almost immediately the camp now empty comes under attack a single bandit with a knife easily dealt with if we were still there instead he sets fire to the main building which is basically all wooden great and destroys the wind turbines this disables the ac which in turn defrosts my few remaining food stores all are rotten within a short time thanks to the high heat however the group arrive at the prison camp the two turrets cover the building but not the entrance so i m able to get quite close benditez is injured but ben picks up her rifle and kills the jailor we free the prisoner take everything we can carry food included thankfully and start to head back then things start to go bad the prisoner catches a disease ben splits off from the party when we hear rumours of a weapons cash including a very high quality smg and sniper rifle that s actually rather lightly defended i can t make any new weapons so this is a godsend and not a chance i ll get again any time soon since it s not far from home i send him alone hoping he ll somehow make it on limited rations the prisoner we rescued dies of disease ben is starving and lost in the jungle benditez and rosalina are starving and overburdened so i m forced to ditch a fair chunk of our loot then only about a day away from the cache ben goes mad and starts wandering in circles in a daze i assume he s done for and focus on the other two who have somehow made it back to the burned out ruin that is my base only the rain stopped the whole thing burning to the ground they pig out on the last of the potatoes skipping cooking them entirely as they ve been starving for a while now the mood is terrible the base is a mess their two close freinds corpses have been exposed when their graves were smashed why that bandit thought oh i m raiding a base let s smash the steel grave nahh that won t be a disproportionate amount of effort i do not know and food reserves are at zero though there are potatoes if they can actually bring themselves to harvest them i decide to make the two bury their freinds again to at least try and improve things a bit as the last body goes in rozalina snaps she goes beserk wandering and looking for someone to fight she was a pacifist i thought but has apparently picked up a pistol i send benditez after her hoping that being shot will calm her down then i realise ben who s still out in the jungle had her rifle she makes a dash for the only pistol in the storehouse which is directly behind rosalina she gets it but is too close to fire and the two break out into a melee fight and rosalina somehow knocks her out then i get a message telling me ben s apparently not only avoided stavation somehow but is actually sane again i d love to bring him back given the situation but he s too far a way so i leave him to keep going then i get another message rosalina s sister is on her way over seeking refuge from someone chasing her i accept immediately despite the fact that rosalina herself is still wandering beserk the one chasing her gets lured into a fistfight with rosalina and at the last moment her sister gets the gun benditez had gone for and kills her chaser and even better the sight of her sister alongside her injuries snaps rosalina out of her fury and the sister saves them both 10 10 ben still lost in jungle i m not making up any of this this all happened i was seriously tempted to abandon save after i lost the first two so glad i stuck with it any game that can organically make a story like this is good as far as i m concerned
