2023 early access review here are some tips and overall gameplay experience of project zomboid i hope it helps with your troubles first of all zomboid is not about grab a gun and kill hordes of zombies your ultimate purpose is to survive as long as possible always use custom sandbox settings design your zomboid world however you like you won t find some game mechanics fun play sneaky and cowardly avoid crowds and act cautious and quick loot everywhere don t try to take everything try to crouch when moving around instead of running all the time and please don t run think you are some ninja and everyone tries to kill you if you start to default you won t have any problems regarding food and water for at least the first 20 days start in rosewood if it is your first game as it should be less crowded and smaller while west point is the most crowded and largest one before you level up your related skill always read the book of that skill first the books are named beginner 1 2 levels intermediate 3 4 advanced 5 6 expert 7 8 mastery 9 10 how to gain experience for skills carpentry dismantle wooden furniture doors etc with a hammer and a saw electricity dismantle electronic devices watches televisions etc with a screwdriver metalworking dismantle metal furniture metal doors sinks etc which requires a propane torch and welder mask mechanic dismantling car parts that you may find on the roads requires a jack lug wrench and wrench first aid go to the forest nearby start to run and hurt yourself and bandage your injuries you can craft basic bandages from clothes the remaining skills are arguably not important to me there are levels that have a chance to become infected if you have been bitten by a freaking zombie scratched has a chance of 7 percent of zombification and laceration has 25 percent if it says bitten in your health status q then you have several days before being another there is no cure use guns as the last resort guns are pretty useless in this game except shotguns they attract zombies a lot and might trigger a horde try to use good melee weapons such as baseball bat crowbar axe hunting knife machete and katana most of the players in project zomboid including experienced people die in closed areas so be careful when you are in a house apartments or a large building there are useful traits that you should have some of them in the character creating menu fast learner eagle eyed dextrous keen hearing organized and lucky for bad traits weak stomach slow reader since you can fast forward slow healer smoker need to find cigarettes high thirst fear of blood you can get extra skill points by watching life and living channel on tv check for the program time for each day in the zomboid s wiki it is very important as it boosts your skills like hell after around 14 days later there will be no electricity so you will need a generator and also a how to use generators manual to use the generator correctly it requires gasoline don t put it inside of your house always check and use some of the communities great mods there are many cool and life saving mods out there and why not give it a try remember that the game is still in early access
