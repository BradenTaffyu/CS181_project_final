2023 as a longtime fan of the tw series since the first shogun i understand the negative comments most of them are people bored with repeatable tw turn mechanics uninterested in the bronze age and simply desiring a new medieval game since most fans of the series are either rome fetishists or crusading jarheads go play crusader kings iii as for someone in love with the ancient era the game is absolutely mesmerizing and engaging it s so far the best tw and a videogame in general when it comes to 1 bronze age warfare and politics2 egyptian hittite graphics rivalring those of assassin s creed origins3 replayability finally every faction is and feels truly different4 religion economics technology and all strategy support system robustnessmy favorite rome attila tw 1000h was a much worse game at start than this one is thank developers for this it s a great expansion and improvement of what was learned in troy which was similar but lacking if the developers continued and built a second timeline dlc around the rise of assyria adding the fertile crescent this would be a complete bronze early iron tw everyone were satisfied with since that would complete the world indeed greece was already made for troy why not use it but i guess due to unhappy medieval fanbase this unique jewel of bronze age game will be forgotten shame
