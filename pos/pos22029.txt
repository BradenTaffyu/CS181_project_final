2022 wow just realised that after devoting 400 hours and 100 completion of this title i haven t recommended it obviously i recommend this its hard but not unfair the lore is extremely deep but takes a lot of investigation via item descriptions and environmental ques but every item every placed creature or background furniture is placed with purpose to provide the story and build the tragic world you are experiencing
