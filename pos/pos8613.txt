2017 if there were a half thumb up half down button i d choose that first of all this is an amazing game it has extremely impressive scenery if your device can run on high quality graphic settings the hunting experience is a lot of fun each time i play this game i sink at least an hour usually more than that if i have time on it because there are too many interesting things to explore you need both patience and intelligence to compete against those smart animals however i definitely understand why so many people have written negative reviews the two dlcs that have come out so far don t cost the developers much effort to design yet they are very important to players gaming experience i didn t mind paying a little more for the dlcs since i had spent 30 dollars already but they are overpriced players always spawn at the outposts every time entering the game unless you have the tent dlc it s a ridiculous design which apparently aims for the money you have to pay for the right to spawn anywhere you like similar thing to the atv dlc so to those who are still deciding whether to buy consider the prices of dlcs on the top of that of the main content because only in this way can you enjoy a complete gameplay
