2016 i was stressed tired nervous and pretty much burned out and i decided to play this game and i felt peace just like the good old days when i used to live in a farm by the countryside i don t have time to play games anymore thanks to my job but i just scheduled an hour a day to play this game one hour of peace and hapiness in this sea of stress and work
