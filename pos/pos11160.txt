2022 two point hospital is a great sim albeit not realistic of running a hospital the game is very fun and full of comedy that only adds to the enjoyment of playing i also have all the dlc and have played most of them with only the newest two yet to be delved into as you start play the game helps you learn how to play by giving goals for you to reach in your very first hospital this goal focus recurs as you play once you meet your first set of goals you will be given your first star for your hospital the next set of goals appear and once you have accomplished those you will get your second star once the third set of goals are accomplished you will complete your 3 star hospital however getting your first star will unlock the next hospital for you to learn how to run the goals are usually achievable without a whole lot of frustration occuring but their are some that can be pretty difficult the hospitals are set in special areas in the two point county map that have 3 hospitals per area which are unlocked as described above as you start play you begin with minimal special rooms to start building in your hospital for example a general practice room for your doctors to meet your patients and decide what if any other diagnoses your patients need before receiving treatment if they do need more testing some other rooms they may visit are general diagnosis and cardiology to name some beginning rooms when you progress your hospitals you learn about new treatments for new diseases which in turn gives you new rooms to build in your hospital to take care of your patients once diagnosed besides designing diagnosis and treatment rooms you also can decorate your hospital which the game provides many things for you to buy with your in game special money called kudosh which can be acquired by finishing challenges and goals you can also manage your staff by hiring doctors nurses staff and janitors which all have special skills and whom you can train to improve their skills so they diagnose heal handle customers and clean repair better you can customize your staff s wardrobe as well as what jobs you want them to do the game even lets you click on individual staff as well as patients to check out all their info so with all the different hospital areas and the customizations of building your hospital and customizing your staff and all the additions the dlc s add the game is highly replayable i have played the game over 330 hours and have yet to play every hospital let alone 3 star every hospital if you like simulations this game won t disappoint highly recommended
