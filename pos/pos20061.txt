2023 freedom in every sense of the word a great rpg that ll give you an awesome and immersive time and is worth picking up if you haven t played it even if its a game that came out 12 years ago its unreal how many different ways you can play this game you really can t experience everything fnv has to offer in one playthrough with how much content it has and the insane amount of options it gives you when it comes to literally everything your choices matter alot and you can clearly see the effects of your decisions through the world and the npcs around you that alone is enough of a reason to do multiple playthroughs for all the different paths you can take and feel the consequences of each one of them the writing the world design the quest design and even the music are all masterfully done the combat is good enough nothing special however fnv is not perfect far from it obsidian was given only 18 months to make the game and while impressive was also a major detriment as the final product turned out to be a janky buggy mess that would crash constantly some of the issues could be fixed with console commands but some you either just deal with it or install performance mods which i highly recommend doing tbh to make it actually playable and not give you an aneurysm and its really not a good look when i have to install mods just so i can play without crashing every hour or two it didn t help that the game stopped getting patches not long after its release but that s the only real problems i have with the game mostly on the technical side almost everything else is near perfect the visuals could ve been better too i guess but i don t care that much about it caravan suck ass but you know you might enjoy it the dlc s are worth playing through most are great they re not all equal when it comes to quality one in particular while i did had some fun i ll never redo again for reasons if you know you know overall a wonderful game that will give you an experience unlike any other i recommend getting it even with the flaws i ve pointed out above because the pros this game offers heavily outweigh the cons
