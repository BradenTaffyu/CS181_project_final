2018 tl dr a fantastic game worthy of whether you buy it on sale or not i could ve paid 60 for it and i still would be happy with my experience the developer concernedape should be proud of the work he s done here it s a fantastically enjoyable piece of art to start i played this game cooperatively with my girlfriend from the start to the end as a side note if you re going to play with a friend from the start you want to enable extra cabins the extra cabins allow 1 extra player to join you you can start without cabins and build them super cheaply but if you re wanting to jump right into it you ll next the extra i m a very seasoned gamer having played video games since the original nes it wasn t too terrible for me to the get the hang out it right out of the box i suggest enabling always on targeting marker in the options as it will greatly help with properly aiming also make sure you re not standing on the tile you wish to interact with such as tilling land my gf is not a seasoned gamer this was her second game she s played on pc utilizing a mouse and keyboard i had her enable the aiming marker as well and she had a relatively easy time figuring out what she was doing for the most part there is a ton of stuff to do in this game and you can t go wrong with any of them farming is easily the most profitable and you don t even need to worry about which crops are the best cash crops it s very appealing to try to have a crop of each type due to the benefit of cooked food as well as quests that require various crops if you only grow one crop you ll missing out on other aspects of the game fishing is a bit rough and continues to be a bit rough throughout the game some of the fish are a pain to catch and remain a pain to catch but it s because it costs very little to fish and can yield large payouts should you get good at the fishing mini game crabpots are a great way to raise fishing and acquire fish for other endeavors and easy money mining combat these two are together because they go hand in hand you go to the mines and later elsewhere and in the process of mining for ore you encounter monsters you don t become an almighty god amongst mortals in this game you need to rely on placement timing and farming cooking to help you have the easiest experience especially once you re done with the mines armor is your boots and buffs from food your weapons are a melee weapon and ranged weapon i ve never used the ranged weapon in combat food restores energy and heals you your crops and livestock can provide better food that is actually cooked that provides buffs villagers are an important part of this game and you want to work on becoming friends with them there s a calender in town square next to a job board keep track of birthdays find out what people like and given them those gifts doing so leads to extra content within the game it s completely worth it foraging is actually beneficial and provides a source of income food and goods you use your hoe on worm tiles and you receive items typically for the museum i suggest doing this as it can give you a leg up on making money and give you access to things that you couldn t get yet all in all i d say i love this game my girlfriend loves this game it s been an enjoyable experience for a seasoned gamer and someone new to gaming they did it right with this one and deserve all the praise they get if you can play with one extra person farm life will be exceptionally easier for each extra person the more specialized you can get fishing is always relevant mining is always as well farming is only useful as long as you can grow crops and have money for the seeds or get a seed maker with two people we were able to get a large portion of the content done we re just down to getting the last pieces of end game gear and wrapping up maxxing out friendships a few tips if you do decide to get into it enable always on targeting marker don t stand on the tile you re tilling if you have nothing better to do go mining work on friendships work on the community center grow all the varied crops don t be afraid of the wiki crops were my usual pages play with a friend if you can make a friend to play this with if you don t have one all options are valid upgrade the watering can first gold if you can upgrade the hoe next gold too but not as important as watering can don t worry about buying too much equipment for the mines just bring food for healing energy the upgraded backpack is so worth it especially while mining don t concern yourself too much with min maxing it doesn t really matter be patient take your time if you re going to the mines try to make 5 levels each time you go the elevator saves progress every 5 gather all of your crops no later than the 28th they all day next season except some all crops die in winter store at least a couple of everyone i kept the highest tier i could get sold the rest use winter for mining and reorganizing most useful for solo or duo play most of all have fun and relax don t stress too much there s tons more tips but this is a review pit s a great game worth every dollar i don t regret buying this full price the devs deserve it and i hope they can make another great game like this sci fi next time hopefully
