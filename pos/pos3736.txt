2022 pros a powerful and somewhat complicated story told in an intriguing way emotions mechanic has lots of versatility allowing for multiple builds to arise and plenty of skills to work with them main cast is lovable and indepth tons of side content humphreycons a lot of the headspace sections are dull and boring often railroading you through mildly amusing events and non sequitur characters before letting you continue doing the interesting stuff humphreyoverall this is a fantastic and fun game that i d highly suggest to rpg and psychological horror fans
