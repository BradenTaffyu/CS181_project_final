2016 first impressions this review is for less then 30 mins of gameplay will revise it later after more playing i have been playing the civilization series since more than 8 yrsgame runs stable and smooth so far on my old pc with windows 7 and with amd phenon x4 cpu r7700 hd card most new systems should be able to run it very smoothly players who have plaved civ 5 and are familier with the other games in the series will find this game to be a marked improvemnt in 1 smoothness of gameplay this runs smoothly and with more fps than civ 5 improved multicore support of cpu with direct x 12 also certainly helps 2 visual graphics are much better 3 the game has some improvements in gameplay will write a detailed review on that later after more gameplay it has improvements in the number of resources different types of resources barbarian units have started scouting also goverment type screen and associated bonuses has been introduced and its much more streamlined replaces the earlier screen of culture based bonuses they way to interact with city states has changed research tree is much better cons 1 one thing i did not like was that it is not easy to auto explore as earlier also could not find the button to promote a unit after it gains experience easily the developlers should do something to fix it in the patches 2 game is overpriced as with all sidmeier games that also prevents me fro playing many other games in the series 2 k game firfaxis should have priced at atleast 35 lower also i can bet that the dlc s coming out will be sold seperately and at a high cost also its unlikely that this game wil go on discount anytime soon for players who are new to to civilization series this is one of the best turn based strategy games out there the learning curve is also not very steep in short go for the game if the price is not a deterrance will write a more detailed review later
