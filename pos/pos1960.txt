2020 i have played this game on and off since its launch and i was a sub for most of that time i have also experienced the game as a f2p model for a very short time because it wasn t playable to say the least it was very very limited now that this has changed and i ve experienced the new model i can say that they have finally made a game everyone can enjoy subbing for 1 month unlocks all dlcs you should also keep in mind that this game runs on an old engine which isn t very good and the updates take much longer to develop plus it s an ea funded game and who follows their work knows what that they either don t want to fund it properly or don t know how content the game is full of it not all aspects are at their full potential though decent initial story and amazing expansion stories will keep you captivated for a long time if you re into single players if you re into mmos you ll like the other aspects of the game as well it s great to know that you can play it however you like whether you like to play with others or not also keep in mind that the game is fully voiced over and that all conversations have an impact on your light dark standing and standing with your companions music it s star wars music folks those who enjoy it will definitely enjoy it in this game as well it s great sound in general is good but some aspects of it aren t so good e g your own footsteps when strafing while keeping the camera straight ui great you can set it up in any way you like they did this very good from the start you can save your profiles and load them on other characters you can also do this with the keybindings combat is still repetitive and can be boring at times but it definitely feels more fluid than before which is what was driving me crazy at times with some classes and skills spells for a lock on targeting game it is good now dare i say almost on par with wow pvp is not to my liking as it can be a bit confusing at times due to the gameplay speed and the amount of stuff happening on screen and you shouldn t play it at all before you get all your skills spells as you won t stand a chance against those who have their action bars filled out you can join from level 15 and only get your stats scaled up also if you wish to level in pvp it s possible but getting gear not as much fashion is there but it s mostly in the cartel market real money store the stuff you get from questing and group activities is ok but not great if you want to look like a basic jedi or a sith you ll get that look almost at the beginning of your journey and for all of you mountain climbers and out of bounds explorers don t get your hopes up this game wasn t made for it in fact it has too many invisible walls and sometimes you won t even be able to jump on a small platform that should be accessible from that spot even more annoyingly you ll be getting stuck between objects and some shady textures the game could definitely use an engine overhaul but it might be too late for that but it s not all that bad it does feature a decent amount of jump puzzles throughout the game as for the endgame i can t really talk about it as i haven t played the latest stuff for level 75 level 60 is for f2p if you wish to continue playing make sure to set up your security key in the account settings this will of course protect your account but it will also give you 100 cartel coins per month 500 cc for subs so even if you don t play for a couple of months you have some income
