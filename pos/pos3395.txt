2019 my playthrough youtube playlist the review larian studios actually did it they improved upon the prequel in every way for one this is the first divinity game that have selectable races the graphics look far more sharper than original sin not to mention the story is way more enthralling than previous games the game plays just like original sin so you still get that tight rpg experience can we just appreciate that we get a divinity game where you are trying to achieve divinity do i recommend this game this is a game where you can a lizard prostitute you tell me
