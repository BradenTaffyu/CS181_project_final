2021 review edit i can t believe after 4 years this game still crashes i can t believe after 4 years this game has an ai so stupid politics suck uncanny realm decisions unbelievable limitation of diplomacy terrible i can t believe after 4 years this game still has no dismembermenti can t believe after 4 years this game still has no gore optioni can t believe after 4 years this game is still not modding friendly no it is not i can t believe after 4 years this game doesn t have a dlc with boats and i can t believe we still cannot save a character creation i don t want to touch a new game anymore i am tired of thisi still thumb up because because i can t believe after 4 years i still love it but please devs do something i don t know i love this game and i literally hate it at the same time one year it s been release and crashes are still there it shouldn t be but this is not the main issue with this game the ai my god the ai the ai in that game is the utterly most moronic ai i ve ever encountered the stupidity of the ai is beyond human comprehension it is unfathomable and in that kind of game i can t possibly understand why the ai is so bad after all these hours playing i feel empty when i see my own troops doing stupid things beyond stupidity and i don t wanna play anymore but i continue playing anyway i just don t know why ffs i guess the game is good and addictive enough ok new review after release more than two years this game is born lot of things had to improve but still no dismemberment please make it happen my companions can participate to a tournament and win it but why don t they get the winner item in inventory this doesn t make any sense i still don t understand why horses and cavalry are so dumb unbearable break out system from captivity you don t have any chance to really escape you can spend hours with a lord who has imprisoned you if he proposes you to pay for your liberty just say no go make dinner or else because you won t go fast and like 3 seconds after being released he comes catch you he or anyone passing by before the release you could beat an outnumbering enemy i mean 50 100 minimum i got the impression that it is not possible anymore whatever the efforts most of the companions are so lame voice acting is not consequent enough i remind you that the game has been released since one month after two year don t release it if it lacks so many things i still recommend this enjoyable game but obviously can t take the risk of modding it anymore because we ll probably get one or two patches a week during months which i hope will be an effective and good thing ah yeah and can we not chose if we wanna play the main quest or not because i think it sucks and brings nothing to the game but i really like this game anyway enjoy or endure
