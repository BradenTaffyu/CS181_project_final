2016 early access review day 1 mondayi begin in a house located somewhere in what i suspect to be the finnish wilderness wandering around my home i find a full case of beer and a pack of sausages a few minutes later of spinning and twirling the sausages around and i eventually learn how to consume what is surely a healthy diet of warm beer and sausages my immediate needs met i continue to explore around the meager lodgings and eventually discover the door leading outside only to be met with what looks to be my objective the sports car that surely every auto enthuist dreams to have one day only it s missing every single part that makes it run being only the car body itself in one word potential stumbling further along bright eyed and surely confident in my abilities and common sense to attach bits and pieces labeled a to slots marked b i find myself in front of what i assume to be the garage doors opening the doors my dreams and hopes of soon recreating scenes from the classic movie vanishing point are broken and dashed away by the seemingly hundreds of parts and pieces scattered around me with no manual or instructions in sight never having actually worked on a car or engine before i dive right into assembling parts of the main engine of the vehicle further twirling and spinning putting rods into slots and disks onto what should be spinning bits a myriad of nuts and bolts and screws that i hope actually go where i think they need to i quickly become bewildered at one stage when i cannot attach a part to where it seems to need to go and submit to the daunting task of building an entire engine from scratch why can t this piece go there did i get all the bolts screwed down you need that wrench to do that i relent the fact that there is no manual for engine assembly but quickly reconsider that maybe this game hates me and if it were kind enough to even provide one it would be written solely in finnish i resign myself back inside the home after hours of tinkering and frustration odd calls from the phone inside the house of people yelling at me in a language incomprehensible to me and trying to make sense of the world around me throwing what s left of the case of beer on top of the bed and drinking myself to sleep after what can t be happening that i m unable to complete what surely thousands of others have sleep comes day 2 tuesdayi awake the next morning my view shaking in what i can only guess to be from the massive amount of alcohol consumed the previous day i attempt to rectify this by drinking more beer it doesn t work i once again venture into the garage to assemble what bits and pieces of the engine are left when my eye catches the bright red bar in the upper left hand corner that i am apparently dying of hunger the fridge is empty no food is in sight panicking not wanting to lose what work i ve done so far i fumble my way into the drivers seat of the working blue van parked outside in my desperation and mad dash to where i think the main town is located i run full blast at 100kmph after being sideswiped on the highway straight into a tree the only memorial i have left to what i attempted is a spot in the newspaper of a patch of grass day 1 mondayi begin in a house located somewhere in what i suspect to be the finnish wilderness msc is a very frustrating game a frustration that only adds to it s overall charm once you overcome these frustrations on your own without any kind of documentation tutorial or set of directions after fully assembling the satsuma it s a piece of car that backblasts and overheats constantly but it s my piece of car and i love it
