2021 so far i have over 1010 hours for sims 4 on origin the hour counter started all over when i came to steam to play and had to re download the game to steam this was the only issue that annoyed me but i m sure i ll be up to thousands of hours on steam too add all that to the hours that i have played the sims 4 or other sims games in the past since i was 17 and that is a lot of playtime off and on over 20 years of play honestly most people prefer the sims 3 because of attention to detail and more complicated personalities but sims 4 has it s own charms personally my old sims favorite was the urbz sims in the city id love to play that game again it gave you a direct path and set achievements as well as some big personalities so welcome to the sims if you are new this game is pretty hard to explain its what you make of it the sims is like real life all the things that happen depend on your characters choices that the base game itself stands alone well and you don t need to get the packs and extensions if you do get them however most of them will create a new way to play and sometimes a new town or a new world so honestly to me that is kind of like a new game i enjoy getting the packs but they do usually cost the price of a new game there are also smaller packs and add ons that are pretty fun too again the packs aren t needed though the game is unique and interesting by itself you will never find another game where the characters come to life like this games typically center around a goal that your character must accomplish the environment people around them and the reactions of your character are written out already and pre planned you are watching the game play out the way that it will play out for millions of other players the sims however never plays out the same way even when players try the same sims challenges the turn out will be different and the interplay and things that happen will be random and totally different the sims characters have minds of their own like ai their own feelings and their own changeable and achievable dreams that is what i love the most about the sims the psychology and realism of play when it comes to personalities emotions psychology relationships and life events is wonderful it is the whole reason i play avatars and characters in other games just do not have the random emotions or random decisions like the characters in the sims each time you open the game there are so many random things that can happen your own sim character will have its own mind and so will every sim in the game that interacts with your sim the interplay between characters is what gets interesting just be sure to learn to take care of their needs and balance fun with work and life with dreams and their life should end up entertaining and funny as your character ages they will change and grow and develop skills traits abilities favorites and more they will most likely have spouses children and even grand children and each of them will be different as well your sims can have pets too and new to the game are farms and once they retire and age and eventually die you can switch your mindset to guiding the lives of their kids and grand kids it all goes on forever the life of your sim is a little world of its own with no specified goal just like real life you are not made to do anything but exist eat sleep wash go to the bathroom and have a bit of fun everything else about their life or goals or destiny is just dreamt up by the player your character can dream of any kind of life and each kind of life is a new game in itself one sim could want to be homeless and living in a tent from town to town another could become the most famous actor ever your character can be a hardworking you tuber or a scientist who gets abducted by aliens be a detective and solve crimes or be a veterinarian you can now even be a jedi or work for the empire you can have a cottage with a little farm or be an interior designer you can work with the paranormal and catch ghosts or just raise a family there is so much open to you that you are creating your own game you can also farm in your garden make money from knitting or just be a mommy with tons of babies you can own a dog cat or even animals like leopards the cc custom content that players create is all downloadable for free on safe websites and is also accepted and encouraged for use in the game so that opens up hundreds of opportunities as well if you are creative at all you wont be able to stop dreaming in this game there is always something new to do the cannon characters are great as well each character from the game creator will be complicated different from any others and surprising all the characters are lgbtq friendly as well the sims had lgbtq characters back before anyone else you can add to your cannon sims town by making your own new neighbors for your town and replacing all the original neighbors with characters you custom make or you can stick with the old favorites my favorite cannon family is the goth family who since the first game were the adams family of the sims sure their house in sims 4 isnt as spooky as it becomes later in their cannon story sims 1 and sims 2 are later in the timeline but you can make it as spooky as you like once you play since you can edit all the land houses and characters in town bella goth is my favorite sim and has always been kinda why i play great personality spooooky ooooooky family enjoy this game make it whatever you want also if you become a fan and start wanting to play the older games you will never be disappointed each sims game is packed with so much to make it unique from the others sims 3 still stands up to sims 4 and still competes with it in many ways if you try it you ll see why anyway i hope this helps someone oh did i mention that every word in their language is really translatable dag dag ps never play the phone sims its nothing at all like the actual game play here play the full game with the crazy personalities everywhere the phone games are okay but they dont have the same ai type sims the sims on phone games have very little personality so to everyone the sims are worth a try but you ve got to know what the game is about first be creative and open your mind you ll also need the cheat codes allowed by the creators and encouraged maybe a little of the mods also encouraged a few packs for spicing it up and an idea of what you want to create so look it up on you tube or watch streamers on twitch so that you know how to go about making a really fun game for yourself
