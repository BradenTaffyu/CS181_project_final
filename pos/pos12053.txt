2017 if you are considering getting this game first of all you need to ask yourself how much disposable income do you have because games such as assetto corsa project cars and rfactor 2 are technically better value for money but this game has something that those games lack a genuine online career mode for example in assetto corsa you can drive a modern ferrari f1 car if you get the red pack dlc straight away online even if you are very new to it and cause an accident because there is no penalty in iracing you have to earn the right to race an f1 car online there are multiple career paths whether you are into oval racing nascar indycar circuit racing touring cars open wheel cars endurance cars and even recently dirt oval racing of various classes with rally cross coming later in the year is this game punishing yes is it expensive depending on your tastes very is it worth it i have to say yes it isnt perfect but i love it and i recommend you give it a chance
