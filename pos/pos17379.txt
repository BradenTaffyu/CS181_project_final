2022 i ve played many total war games three kingdoms stands out to me in it s political and region managements systems comparing it to tw warhammer games each turn on the campaign i was putting a lot of thought into what buildings i was building where they were located what units and generals i was recruiting who was running my commanderies i was checking the diplomacy screen almost every turn i was actually invested in watching the npc leaders keeping track of who they were allying with and at war with the battle pacing feels good graphics are good a distinct art style on the map makes it very appealing the toughest thing about this game is if you re like me you know little of china history and its geography the large map is very large and it is overwhelming at first after about 15 hours of play i started to be familiar with my half of the map only to be lost again when i started a campaign on the other side of china a great total war game in all
