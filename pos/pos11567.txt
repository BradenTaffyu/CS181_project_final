2015 early access review it was the middle of the night the light of the full moon poured through the gaps in the boarded windows setting a sense of calm about the place the shack that dave and i had spent a few days building and fortifying stood strong and sturdy we hadn t had much trouble from zombies during construction and fetching supplies just a few stragglers here and there the only thing is however i didn t know whether that was a good thing or a bad thing a very bad thing a stag roamed past our shelter this morning so quick to spring into action i aimed my crossbow at its rear and pulled the trigger it tried to run off a few paces before collapsing to the ground i approached the stag cautiously making sure no zombies in the nearby area had heard its screams of pain and come to catch an early lunch i pressed my knife into its throat and yanked hard down to its abdomen the warmth of the beast reminded me of home home before everything was so up snuggled on the couch with a blanket watching the walking dead wondering what life would actually be like if a zombie apocolypse were ever to occur i guess i found the answer to that one wrapping the venison steaks in leaves and putting them in my backpack i headed back on arriving dave was boiling water over the campfire in a cooking pot placing the steaks down by his side i noticed him wipe away a tear and swallow his sorrow normally i would have asked him what was wrong however i knew the answer yesterday we lost frank it was only meant to be a quick in and out supply run to the local village for antibiotics but while searching a medicine cabinet frank did not see or hear a zombie dog behind him poor guy never stood a chance a few hours later dave and myself were just finishing a nice bowl of venison stew a single candle burned between as to not give off to much light or heat to draw attention to ourselves the windows were boarded up good but you can never be too safe taking both our bowls over to the rusty old sink i peer out of the window and there reflecting off the light of the moon pressed to the glass i see the harrowing face of a spider zombie i get a shock and drop the bowls they shatter into tiny pieces off the decayed brick flooring the noise alone is enough to set the spider zombie into a raging frenzy its long black fingers crept through inbetween the wooden planks used to board the windows solidifying its grip it pulls with all of its strength however it does not budge aggrevated starved and looking for another way in it climbed onto the roof pounding with its almighty strength onto the wooden plank roof reinforced with scrap iron it knew that that wasn t going to work either by this time dave had ran upstairs and fetched two shotguns from the gun cabinet a long barrel and a sawn off i took the sawn off loaded it and held it tightly to my chest and then came the sound we know the horror of all to well the spider zombie on the roof let out an almighty screech which echoed off into the distance an eerie silence hung around the shelter so thick you could bite it and then from over the nearby hill a screech was returned the silence came and went however this time was broken by the sound of footsteps not walking footsteps but running footsteps and they were getting louder and louder and louder then like an army of charging horses all at once the horde smacked against the side of the house with a thud so loud it was like a gunshot going off inside your head faster than we could think of a survival plan the wall crumbled and the zombies came hurtling in they were hungry very hungry dave was first to shoot the buckshot spread enough to cover 2 maybe 3 zombies at once quick to follow i too took aim our gunshots rattled the woodwork in the shelter and i began to think we were overwhelmed there were spider zombies all over the house bloaters spitting acid and disintegrating the foundations dogs growling and snarling from every direction saying a quick prayer i signal to dave that we should make a run for it even if we could fight off this horde the repairs alone would be pointless and starting fresh elsewhere would probably be quicker opening the back door and making a dash for it we clear a smaller crowd running low on ammo confirmed to me it had to be this way we were low on ammo low on stamina and low on hp running up the nearby hill we had lost sight of the horde pausing for breath we stood for a while looking at the remains of our home crumble and fall and it was at that exact moment a couple of crawler zombies come out of no where and killed us both gg 11 10 would die again
