2022 how much can ninja kiwi add to a 4 year old game i don t know but they keep on doing it from races to odysseys to paragons to liches to if you like tower defense games you ll love this plus it is kid friendly so you can play around the fam without worry the best part for me is that if you create a ninja kiwi account and get the game on mobile in addition to steam you can progress on one account no matter where you are but why do both well at higher levels the sheer amount of bloons will make your phone laaaaaaag tremendously so mobile for quick and easy distraction games such as standard map completion and running holiday events and steam for your longer runs plus everything above you ll have fun either way
