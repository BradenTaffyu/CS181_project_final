2021 early access review difficulty my 90 year old grandma could play it easy normal hard dark souls graphics ms paint bad meh graphics dont matter in this game good nothing special beautiful masterpiece music bad not special music slaps but theres like 8 songs total good beautiful story this game has no story like playing temple runners for the story it s there for the people who want it well written epic story imagine kingdom hearts but on crack price free underpriced perfect price could be cheaper overpriced complete waste of money requirements you can run it on a microwave average high end nasa computer length long enough for a cup of coffee short average long to infinity and beyond fun i d rather watch paint dry hard to enjoy repetitive actually pretty amusing the kind of fun you ll remember ride of your life replayability it s a one time experience only for achievements if you wait a few months years definitely infinitely replayable bugs never heard of minor bugs can get annoying ark survival evolved the game itself is a big terrarium for bugs worth buying no wait for sale yes
