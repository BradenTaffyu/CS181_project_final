2017 best fallout title to datemassive amounts of content worthwhile exploration faction affinity and looting as well as immersive side stories after having played fallout 4 i realised one of the things i loved the most about this game was the dialogue options and skill system you can become a professional and your dialogue reflects it if you ve got high medical skill you ll have unique conversations with doctors got guns talk to gunsmiths and so onthey also included the classic fallout intelligence dialogue feature in that if your intelligence is really high you speak clearly and concisely and if it is really low you basically just talk like a super mutantcan t recommend this game highly enough
