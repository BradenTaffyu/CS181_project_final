2019 early access review whole lotta people whining about what isn t in a game instead of enjoying what is frankly a perfectly good game the way it is because there is a great deal to enjoy here plus it is updated constantly the devs have shown no signs of abandoning it a lot of the negative reviews in this case really are just a bunch of morons complaining that the stuff that is coming isn t here right now that they re taking too long that they only update every month cue baby mario whaa twits they re upset that the game they put 100 s of hours into and bought years ago isn t done yet well you did get 100 s of enjoyable hours out of it and it is still being actively worked on so remind me again why you re complaining there is some feature creep but it really isn t that huge of an issue other than that it s a good game and 100 worth playing even in it s current early access state get it now enjoy it now and enjoy it even more later edit 2 2 2020 since the latest animations update the game has truly never been better it feels new and fresh again in a way that it hasn t since i first started playing it don t let the early access tag turn you off if you want to play it because this is one of the best zombie survival games that has ever existed
