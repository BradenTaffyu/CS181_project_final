i have finished the game today with a bit over 90 hours hogwarts legacy is one of these few games which you will love and remember for a long time when many other games you forgot about the castle the land the flying all the creatures and characters quests and things to do connected me so deeply to this world and rarely have i wished i could just live there mind you i never was a huge fan of the potter books or movies so i think that says something about the game for completionists like me it is both heaven and hell lol but for those who want the true ending be at rest you do not need 100 of everything there are plenty of chance to be good or bad it is a huge game so i had to take it with breaks but every time returning and continuing felt awesome it is sad the game got hate from some people because this is a game in itself and a very good one at that for fans of magical worlds and being part of a great story i recommend it 10 10had an awesome time i shall long remember
