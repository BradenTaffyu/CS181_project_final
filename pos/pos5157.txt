2018 fallout 4 is getting a lot of bad reviews recently due to its lack of rpg elements and more importantly for its paid mods via creation club although it might not be as good as previous installments of the fallout series fallout 4 is still an incredible game that offers a rich post apocolyptic atmosphere and some of the best dlc content that has ever been made it might be riddled with bugs and the story leaves much to be desired but at it s core fallout 4 is a great title to enjoy and if you haven t picked it up yet i strongly recommend that you do with all the dlc and the endless amounts of mods that are available you re easily looking at hundreds of hours of quality content
