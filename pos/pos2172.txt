starts out with you smashing your highest level drops together into absolute freakish frankenmecha for the first 2 chapters but once chapter 3 hits the fun really begins you start getting to invest in the parts you like upgrading both their level and rarity as well as tailoring the passive bonuses they have to suit your needs if you have any love for lasers explosions and robots this is very much worth your time
