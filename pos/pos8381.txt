2022 thoroughly original refined mid sized survival city builder edging one more turn or rather a shift syndrome a steampunk take on an ice age climate apocalypse set in alternative history victorian era setting surprisingly cohesive and strong debut of a new survival strategy ip while there is no shortage of things to praise as a veteran of this rts subgenre the mentioned format scope and depth of frospunk is the thing that stuck to my mind the most together with the general identity and visual presentation as a matter of fact it is still a fairly unique game in terms of its weight and complexity especially when taking into account relatively high production value frostpunk is a story driven fully single player experience with a very well balanced approach that can be constrained within 20 40hrs of gameplay time depending on the dedication to complete all available challenges when taking into account the depth of additional and expected endless game mode plus achievement completionist approach the whole journey through frostpunk can very easily double these numbers still that is a fraction of gameplay hours that might be expected from other leading city building series like anno tropico and especially juggernauts romancing with simulation formulas like cities skylines all things considered a more appropriate starting point for gameplay comparison ought to be games like banished and that feature a feeling of completion and closure that doesn t take many weeks or even months to realize itself is enjoyable and weirdly refreshing and makes frostpunk stand out from among the competition that usually holds onto much greater aspirations simultaneously it is far from being a shallow and boringly streamlined walking simulator take on survival strategy settlement building and economy system entwined with survival mechanics that tie the whole thing together the main pillars of frostpunk s gameplay are toned down in complexity but still offer a decent amount of variety within themselves and are enhanced by random events scenario exclusive objectives and variety between distinctive maps available for each scenario there is certainly enough depth here to leave both casual and more dedicated players satisfied packaged in a way that doesn t overstay its welcome for anyone wanting more the skill ceiling thanks to a few difficulty levels a customizable one still provides a lot of breathing room to improve your management skills master game systems and an opportunity to sink additional tens of hours of gameplay looking back i m very grateful this war of mine preceded frostpunk its success and philosophy of approach to the subject at hand and the players alike are felt throughout the entire game it is a feeling of maturity seriousness and narrative dedication without breaking 4th wall or the presence of undertones of infantility around the edges that would break the immersion and tone frostpunk s designers were aiming for it s an unspoken acknowledgment of trust that players can handle a lot of moral grayness that accompanies a lot of decision making within every scenario even when the impact of said decisions might not be extensive or with long term consequences their mere presence might encourage asking slightly more serious questions and a bit of self reflection and that s more than the vast majority of similar games can accomplish all that creates a very compelling setting and is a fantastic foundation to support engaging and immersive gameplay smooth and dynamic enough and invoking the familiar one more turn sentiment that makes it harder to put the game down it is a result of the mentioned great balance of core systems of which none becomes tedious overwhelming or annoying even when the situation gets very dire and especially on harder difficulty settings it does get to that point frequently tides or rather cold winds turn often enough to keep even long playthroughs dynamic enough and challenging in creative ways being stuck against the wall is not fun and the game provides enough tools for the player to deal with whatever is coming his way and crawl out of the hole not without economic political or even moral sacrifices and lip biting but always with a sense of satisfaction and relief in the end harmony between style and substance is crucial for a game with strong subject matter and at any point frostpunk doesn t come off as a subpar strategy game using its themes as a crutch to hide incompetent and lacking foundations said well thought out coherent and harmonious design guarantees solid fun regardless of the degree of emotional investment in a given story and circumstances or a passion for min maxing in strategy games lacking any of those elements won t ruin your time with this game but at the same time readiness to pay more attention to its setting and mechanics in the end will make that time more rewarding and the whole journey even more memorable and impactful together with the base game three pieces of dlc were made to accompany and expand the core offering and all of them combined do provide a hefty amount of new content i d say it s highly advisable to grab the complete edition of the game right from the start these days it will most likely be a nicely discounted package and from that perspective it is a great deal new mechanics buildings and scenarios make the journey through these frozen wastelands simply more engaging and intricate the modding scene for frostpunk doesn t really exist and hopefully that will be a viable thing in the second installment but to be honest at any point in my experience with the game i didn t feel a need for fixing or improving anything substantial while new buildings expanded systems maps additional city decorations or challenges would be appreciated everything on the table works and looks very solid four years after its release frostpunk is still eye candy with a lot of soul and nothing about it feels dated and half hearted its uniqueness stood the test of time and is a testament to the skill and thoughtfulness of the creators and i m convinced this game will be worth recommendation further down in the future so frostpunk modern genre classic at this moment the latest and greatest offering from polish developer 11bit that is on a quite steep upward curve with the anomaly series and this war of mine released beforehand both thumbs up and fingers crossed for the success of the upcoming sequel still without a release date but most likely coming out late 23 early 24 plenty of time to catch up with this hit good luck with the successor 11bit
