2018 product received for free the short of it please note that everything that i write is based on my experiences with the definitive edition and will also be looked at as standalone rather than compared to its predecessor pros the world of divinity os 2 is vast and deep the characters are fantastic applies to npcs but especially the origin characters an easy enough to understand combat system that possesses a great amount of depth absolutely stunning graphics from the sound design to the soundtrack and especially the voice acting it s superb the modding community is impressive to say the least with tons of ways to augment your experiencecons more in depth spoiler free story let s start this off with one of dos2 s greatest points the story and world while of course staying as spoiler free as possible the game comes with an incredibly vast world for you to explore and venture through as you work towards your ultimate objective which i ll be withholding for any prospective players interested in the game from the main quest to the side quests from your perspective as the protagonist to the npcs in the game s world larian has truly given thought to how they d flesh out every area in terms of it s lore the greatest part of all of this is that despite being a sequel there s no disconnect for the player even if you having played the first while i recommend playing both i can assure any of you who were hesitant about diving straight into the second it s completely alright to do so this point on just how deep the world of dos2 goes becomes apparent the moment you attempt to create a character and are revealed the origin characters which i will be focusing on next origin what is an origin character origin characters are a set of 6 very unique characters that already have their backgrounds integrated into the very core of the game you can think of them as the closest thing to a preset character when thinking in terms of rpgs but you needn t fret they are completely customizable on their stat spread and what class you wish to play as i especially love these origin characters because they add an entirely new layer to what s going on you re not only worrying about the current state of the world as the story tells it but also your own circumstances for example very minor spoiler ahead one of the origin characters is a red lizard with the title of the red prince born for glory yet fell from grace for cavorting with demons and on his own quest to reclaim his rightful throne given his position in the overall world of the game he s an important figure to say the least as a result very early on in the game an assassin will make an attempt on your life that is just a very small insight as to what dos2 has to offer these origin characters could each have their own stories told separately but no they intertwine into a much bigger tale the amount of content you get from the narrative of this game alone is astonishing and for that larian studios deserves a round of applause gameplay now let s get to the real meat of the game shall we how does the game play in a word spectacular the game as a crpg gets the job down without many issues from traversing the various lands to engaging in combat the game both looks and feels great as a keyboard and mouse user at the very least i found the controls to be quite intuitive combat is fairly simple you learn skills and associate those skills to your hotkey of preference activating said skill will either require that you choose a target or a specified location area of effect which will be controlled by your mouse pretty simple right however the battlefield is ever changing and the higher the difficulty the more considerate you need to be of what exactly is happening and how you should react accordingly there are many factors that can go into a fight than just slinging spells into the face of your enemy environmentals and utility based effects can be the key to turning the tide in a battle this may sound like rather obvious advice but i can t think of a crpg that s done it better than how larian studios has like in d d where you will often hear the comparison made the game really starts from the beginning of the game the character creation yeah we re back to good ol character making the distribution of your points from the beginning and how you proceed from thereafter is crucial especially if you re a player that wishes to challenge themselves with the highest difficulty one particular stat in the game that i d like to bring up in reference to this point is the memory stat memory is a stat that you upgrade when you wish to assign more skills to your hotbar learning the spell is one thing but you can t cast that which you haven t memorized as a summoner caster hybrid of sorts i cannot tell you how much memory played a factor in how i progressed because there is such a wide variety of builds i wish to try you can of course find a few mods to make this easier but that s completely player preference i personally like the restriction otherwise i d be a walking arsenal which is fun in it s own right hehe the game is easy enough to understand but there are a number of factors that will make or break you in this game if you aren t careful be it in combat or otherwise graphics typically a crpg s main concern isn t how it looks but dos2 has been crafted with very special care in this regard the environments are beautiful in more than one sense depending on where you re looking the character models are fair and above all else magic possesses a special sort of impact i don t see in other games of its genre i m particularly infatuated with the animations and poses performed when casting spells the details on these animations alone are something to be in awe of sound i must say the sound design in this game is great given the variety of different types of skills there are to learn in respect to the background music in character creation you can actually select an instrument of choice to play the soundtrack this i found to be a very nice touch as someone who likes his music however the aspect i m truly stunned by is the voice acting just pure high quality voice acting planted throughout the game for every npc including animals this is a standard i wish more games had already adopted but we live in a world where many aaa titles still cheap out on giving certain lines any audible lines mods the game provides a plethora of content on its own but that s not all the fun that s to be had say hello to the world of mods if you re playing dos2 the modding community for this game is incredible there are many quality of life mods class overhauls or completely new classes altogether with specially made animations just for that class of course that isn t all there is to modding in this game but i feel that those are the major ones to point out modding can truly enhance your experience or extend the lifetime of this already eternal game by an unfathomable amount if you feel bored playing a game once even in a game with as much diversity as this well mods will change that conclusion i could nag about the infinitesimally issues that rarely popped up here and there like the particular position of the camera interfering with a particular action but there s just too much good content to talk about to even try no matter what angle you try to look at this game from it easily stands out from the rest and establishes itself at the top of its kind a truly divine game this product was reviewed with a key provided by the developer s
