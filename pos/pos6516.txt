2020 there isn t a better driving sim sure there are great racing sims with bleeding edge realism and laser scanned tracks but none have ever captured the experience of driving on the open road quite like this this isn t setting track times or breaking speed records this is navigating traffic construction and getting there safely this is a real road experience and it s hard to compare it to anything else
