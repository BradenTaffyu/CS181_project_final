2017 probably the best total war game to date total war warhammer is a must have for strategy lovers pros great differences between races each is unique starting from its campaign map strategy all the way to the battles and the way you approach them excellent optimisation unit lag seems almost removed units range from ground to flying units infantry heroes cavalry and monsters good ai especially on difficulties above normal excellent modding scene modders figured out how to add new maps units heroes and even new races into campaign and custom battles dlc seems great since most add new units races and campaigns some excellent free dlc bretonnia included into the game cons dlc price is a bit steep tho each of the race ones is like a new expansion some dlc seems to have been forced removed from the main game and should have been part of it
