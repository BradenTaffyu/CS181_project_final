2021 early access review honestly i can t believe i waited this long to review this game i want to open by saying this game is fantastic i wholeheartedly recommend it and that s even as an incomplete game because of the deep love the developers have for it the games story is found but given which adds an element that makes the story almost completely skippable you only learn what you have the desire to learn and only read what you have the desire to read this element alone will make it a 10 10 for some exploration driven people it also lets you build how you d like the new parts that you learn help you progress to new places while also attempting to reinforce knowledge you already had it s a 10 10 game and well made
