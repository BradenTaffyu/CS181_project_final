2017 i have been an adamant supporter of wargaming net for several several years for the longest time i had this bias that war thunder was a simple knock off not worth my attention in that time i paid out to wargaming in support of their efforts something changed recently that made me look into war thunder a change in wargamings customer support policies that made me rethink my proposition of supporting that company not mentioning the issue here i came over very distraut mind you to expect a horrible experience after many off steam reviews that i read surprisingly the steam reviews seemed to alter the opinion some then after downloading i played the game i was floored at how easy it was to get into how much detail was spent on how an aircraft flies or a tank is destroyed in world of tanks you have a typical health bar that dictates how much you can hit and what you can kill typically people who fork out tons of money can get golden shells that help enhance that experience and one shot players in this game however i found that i a regular average joe could one shot players i found that i could actually get back into the game i fell in love with it i admit that while players one shotted me and often that i felt somewhat iffed unlike world of tanks however this game shows you why you were killed off a detailed scene plays out showing how the shell penetrated your tank and the damaged it caused realistically you understand why you died like i did i m not familiar with how real life tank battles work only theory so based on that i understand the experience to be similar to put it bluntly i didn t feel cheated by the game when i died the game told me why i died how i died and in some way even demonstrated what i could do better by the death scene as it played out you watch it and literally go next time i should try this instead of in world of tanks how i d go what happened in air combat mode unlike world of warplanes you actually feel like you can shoot down planes two times your better there s even a reward for that in land combat mode everything feels fleshed out and while they don t have a death scene for air combat mode obvious reasons i d say you do get to see yourself shot down there s a detailed brief message on why you lost control of your plane the reasons can reach from pilot knocked out to watching a wing fall off and your crew whose still in full control as you press the fire button crash to their death you understand why you died to me understanding why i died means a whole world of difference in conclusion i feel that war thunder has demonstrated itself to me in a way that feels familiar world of tanks yet completely different instead of feeling in the dark when i m shot down in air combat mode i see explanations instead of feeling like i m some piece of trash to be chewed and spit out in land combat mode the game shows how i died and by contrast demonstrates what i could do better i feel there s been a lot of attention to detaul placed into war thunder that wargaming seriously lacks in most of their games i feel that having played warthunder in this short amount of time on steam i m in love with it no doubt that may change but the feeling that the game isn t cheating me being gone plays a huge part in my new honeymoon phase
