2022 my first adventure with simracing and i love it acc is detailed gt3 gt4 racing simulator built on unreal engine 4 while it doesn t have many cars or tracks the quality of content and polish is trully amazing from visuals audio to feel of the cars are superb it s a game that offers a lot if you don t mind it s all about gt3 and gt4 cars single player is great for practice and learning experience as i mentioned it s my first real experience with simracing and acc is pretty good for beginners the main fun starts with multiplayer and league event racing you can find plenty of activities online while some simracing games are lacking here or require monthly subscription acc offers you everything out of the box with plenty of players to race with i personally recommend joining league there are plenty and are so much fun to participate joining random servers can be hit or miss and building up own rating system takes a bit of time and practice in the end what i like and what i don t about acc amazing visuals and audio runs really well on old pc high quality and detailed car models very satisfying driving and physics model plenty of activities online active community rating and reputation system that really works and motivates to improve your driving style somewhat good career bit basic racing and fighting with other players in multiplayer is what it makes the most fun and it s very addicting only gt3 class gt4 and other cars are paid dlcs not too many tracks only gt licenced tracks some come as extra paid dlcs other games have better newbie friendly introduction systemwould i recommend assetto corsa competizione absolutely yes as my first simracing experience it s exactly what i was looking for
