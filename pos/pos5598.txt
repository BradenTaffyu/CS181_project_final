2023 i really don t want to give this game a negative review but the things in the game force me to do so however for the thought that they are patching still this game and will eventually fix it i will not give a negative review firstly i want to talk about things that bother me castles in this game literally don t do anything and are useless they do not patrol around the villages attached to them whenever you re at war with faction s the enemy lords raid your villages attached to your castle and your castle doesn t even care about defending your villages all they do is exist to do nothing and it s really annoying like which one i will prioritize saving my villages from raids of my enemies or attacking enemy factions diplomacy doesn t exist in this game at all it doesn t depend on kingdom strength or anything it is completely rng the game wants you to establish a kingdom but how can you do that when everyone randomly declares war on you i had to play as a clan hopefully they don t declare war on you if you are a clan for a very long time until i was able to withstand against them however i failed the quest to create a kingdom due to time limit all because of this stupidity when you re at war with a faction although you caused more casualties than them captured all their fiefs they don t give up always you have to propose peace and if you do you still have to pay tributes to them come on man like why although i like the battle system it lacks features for example when you fight an enemy they either create a shield wall and wait for you to attack or charge at you you can create a lot of formations such as circle skein square loose but they don t do that i still don t understand why there s a kingdom council in this game if i am gonna eventually say the last word even if everyone in the kingdom is against the a decision i can still enact it it would be nice if there were limitations for my ability to enact or veto anything these are what this game lacks however i believe they will make this game better no matter what now let s talk about what it is fun to do combat system is great and fun there s decent amount of armor and weapon and they re cool you can also download mods for more there are decent amount of quests although i wish there was more some of them are fun to complete hideouts are also great and it s my fav thing to do in the game even if i m in the end game section it s still fun to do game s soundtrack is great fits the medieval times you can visit your fiefs and talk to people and clear gangs in your city or become a gangster also you can sit on the throne at your settlements there s arena section where you get cool rewards if you win it s super fun arena s very useful in the beginning of the game btw and more to sum it up buy it when it s on sale despite the important features it lacks i believe they will be added and fixed eventually by the way through mods you can add the features i mentioned that this game lacks it s fun and i think you ll enjoy it for now i d give 6 10 but will edit as the game gets better
