2021 early access review undeniably the greatest zombie survival game that has even been created whenever we play other games where we mow down unrealistic amounts of zombies there are never real consequences in project zomboid you look for food water weapons and pretty much everything else that would keep you alive in this scenario firing a gun in this game does have consequences not planning where you are how many zombies you have to shoot how many of those bullets will miss how many will be attracted to the sound the whole shebang vehicles too routes must be planned parts to be repaired and depending on the quality of said parts determine how loud the car is was a nice surprise to hop into a car only to be assaulted by over 200 zombies crowding inside a nearby house you can sustain injuries or get ill depending on what you do and if you don t have the specific medical supplies you will die overall the devs thought of everything when they came up with this game a very long time ago def worth the money
