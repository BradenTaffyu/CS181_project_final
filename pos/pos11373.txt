2017 early access review day 1 almost got killed by some wild zombies had nothing but a wooden club to defend myself hid in the attic of a house until daylight came day 2 ate some cat food found a pistol continued to search for a safe place to live in day 3 found a motel cleared out all the zombies and blocked up the gate day 4 reinforced the fences and walls day 5 set up traps and spikes around the motel day 6 the defense became pretty solid started my own farm day 7 found a computer that s still working and started playing 7 days to die it s as good as the real world zombie apocalypse
