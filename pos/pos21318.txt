2019 early access review i ve decided to edit this review since i ve played about 200 or so more hours than the first time i wrote this yes 200 hours this is an absolutely amazing game with a premise so simple that it s perfect up until recently this game was just pretty great the limitless variations of battles you can make is truly something special only limited by creativity and boredom and the constant flow of new maps factions and units have certainly kept me from being bored but what recently has made the game simply amazing is the unit creator as of writing this it s still in beta but even in its current state the unit creator has completely renewed my interest the interface and unit creation system is so well implemented and i ve had so much fun already creating my own personalized factions so i m confident that even after this game is out of early release and the big updates slow down the unit creator will still leave something to be interested in 24 7 in conclusion i love everything about this game the premise the art style the maps the unit creator everything i get that a lot of people just don t enjoy having total creative freedom and get bored quickly with these types of sandbox games but i still think this game is worth a try regardless and definitely worth the money my hat goes out to landfall for such an amazing game also in my original comment i said the game ran fine on a very bad graphics card it really didn t i was just telling myself that to feel better lol i ve since gotten a better one
