2016 early access review i should start by saying that i am huge fan of the last game and i came in with the highest expectations my only problems for the first game were 1 character customization and 2 the lighthearted nature of the story well so far original sin 2 has fixed those problems with a jackhammer i mean the customization isn t perfect but it is leagues improved from the last game and the tags are awesome as for the nature of the story it is much more grimdark plus with the tags you can already tell there will be tons of replayability the game is beautiful and it s scary to know that this game is going to get so much better heck knowing this studio we ll probably get an enhanced edition this isn t a full game and i don t usually recommend games in early access but considering the source and based on how much fun i ve had with this i have to recommend it
