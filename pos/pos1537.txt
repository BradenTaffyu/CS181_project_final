2018 let s get this out of the way first the game itself is great but the port is terrible the vanilla client makes everything lag beyond point of comfort and causes all sorts of issues luckily for us pc users the far mod does wonders i wouldn t advise playing without it i ve spent an hour just tweaking the graphical settings but it was worth it i managed to achieve smooth fluid gameplay and played 93 hours without a single hitch no thanks to square enix as for the game nier automata is at its core a jrpg but it incorporates several other genres like a platformer bullet hell spectacle fighter shoot em up etc and it blends everything surprisingly well camera perspective will often shift between 3rd person view top down view and a 2 5d left right platformer view core gameplay consist of following the story doing side quests exploring the world to find secrets or extra loot collecting and upgrading weapons fighting multiple enemies at once impressive bosses and adjusting character loadouts where you slot plug in chips granting you wide variety of enhancements overall the game is absolutely mind blowing the visuals are beautiful the music is epic astounding gameplay is amazingly varied feels fresh it positively surprises at every corner after just an hour it managed to both awe me and make me tear up but the overarching narrative is not stellar if you read sci fi cyberpunk you probably already read many vastly better stories than nier a if you read philosophy you ll find it quite shallow in comparison basically the game just glances over some concepts as well as keeps most of its characters a bit one note however what nier automata does exceptionally well is that it strings together series of emotionally loaded segments each story segment lasts probably around 1 2h and it has everything self contained and well executed with a new objective you go somewhere are greeted with breathtaking vistas and motivated to act by one of the most invigorating soundtracks i ve ever heard usually there is urgency and or intrigue and everything wraps up in a satisfying mini finale so even though the main narrative is on the weaker side is not a serious detriment because the flow was designed with gaming sessions in mind which for a game is a good thing since you ll experience enjoyment and payout every time you sit down to play the gameplay is fluid the characters are animated really well their mobility is off the charts it s a pleasure to control them you attack the enemies both with melee weapons and fire ranged pod at the same time the dodge mechanic is a bit overpowered it is instant interrupts whatever animation the character was doing the i frames are quite long and there is no stamina bar meaning you can just dodge constantly and will avoid pretty much everything as long as you re pressing the button there are plenty of plug in chips that expand your options like time slowing on dodge cutting through bullets to make them explode countering sends portion of damage back to the attacker taunting risk reward glass cannon system where damage output increases both for the protagonist and the enemy etc there is a limit of what you can slot the upgraded chips take more space so you ll find yourself constantly tinkering with the system as you can t just slot all the best ones not too mention there is just too many of them you can swap them out on the fly as well as create different loadouts for different situations things like auto item pickup or showing chests on the map are plug in chips too as well as displaying mini map hp bars or cooldown timers so you re not only optimizing combat capabilities but also balancing them out with utility and convenience on top of customizing the gameplay via plug ins there are 3 different characters to play as protagonists 2b is a combat type that can use 2 weapons many combos and is your starting character 9s is hacking oriented he still can fight but is slower and less effective than 2b or a2 his hacking capabilities are overpowered though if you re good at the hacking minigame you can basically one shot mini boss enemies and take large chunks of boss hp in a single hacking blow not to mention remote control enemies or make them fight for you a2 is also a combat type with one of attacks replaced by a convenient taunt she has the longest and best looking dash as well as unique berserk mode which allows dishing out large amount of damage while her hp constantly drains it s fun to try to build her with various hp enhancing and regenerating chips for uninterrupted berserk mode as long as there are enemies around to play through all the content some side quests intel or activities are tied to a character or particular point of the main story you need to experience 3 routes route a where you control 2b is just a bit less than half of the game and while route b re tells that same initial part of the story but from 9s perspective you get access to additional cutscenes more data providing better insight and filling some of the blanks in the sections where 2b 9s were split apart you get new content mostly revolving around 9s unique playstyle route c is the continuation to the events that happened to 2b 9s in a b is vital to the plot and provides most explanations from the c ending you just need to reload the save and pick different option for remaining canon endings d e also after route c you unlock chapter select so you can go back to any point of the game and finish up either quests you missed or your collection i had a blast definitely worth playing written after completing the game with 93 hours played 47 of 47 100 achievements earned
