2023 product received for free haven t played stellaris much since it came out but because of a friend i showed it to my 10 year old daughter who now absolutely loves it we have been playing multiplayer together on and off for a couple weeks and that caused me to really get back into the game in my free time when she and i aren t in multiplayer i have been achievement hunting and having a blast if you are at all a 4x kind of player and like space this is the only space game you need
