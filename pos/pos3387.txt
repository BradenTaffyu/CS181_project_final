2017 it feels really overwhelming in terms of wtf am i supposed to skill go do but once you are comfortable with the basics its really fun and you are able to enjoy the setting a con though is that the difficulties isnt mere more less hp or dmg but the enemies changing their whole attack pattern f e in tactician hard mode we hade a fight where they bursted our group in the first round with tons of elemental combos when in classic normal mode the same enemy encounter on the same level didnt use any element even once in the whole fight feeling whise its going from naked in a snowstorm to idle on a caribbean beach thats only from hard to normal cant imagine the very hard mode i assume that even on classic mode it gets a bit harder as the game continues concidering my review takes place in the starting area besides that i really enjoy the game and think its a must buy for every rpg penpaper player
