2020 it s good now it was a horrible mess at launch this is finally the game that was promised the new main quest is really fun no more constant holotape hunting intertwined with spotty netcode and laughable quality control even older quests get spruced up with npcs and dialogue choices and there is a huge new quality pass for the ui and gameplay the world is still such a joy to explore with insane sightlines huge cities and terrifying enemies i hit level 50 about 60 hours in almost totally solo so you can just treat this as a proper sequel to fallout 4 rather than just a multiplayer spinoff i never thought i d say this after the disastrous launch but seriously go get this if you like the fallout series i m sure you won t be disappointed in wastelanders which fixes almost everything wrong with fallout 76
