2014 early access review i was able to learn and actually understand far more about orbital mechanics by playing this game obsessively for 2 weeks than doing an astrophysics course for a year at university this was originally a neat little rocket building and exploding simulator that attracted a couple of hours worth amusement before being returned to the may play again later shelf after many updates it has grown into an immensely satisfying personal sandbox space programme simulator the first time i landed a kerbal safely on the mun was a historic moment and very emotional until moments later when i wondered how jebediah would possibly get back swiftly a rescue mission was devised hours were spent meticulously over engineering an overly capable craft until i realised i felt quite hungry i couldn t decide what to eat when i noticed the name of the planet mars equivalent seeing it as almost divine inspiration i went out and got a duna kebab very satisfied with the food the game chose for me i spent the next few hours trying to fly the monstrosity that could only barely be called a return vehicle without 1 exploding on launch 2 tipping over and exploding whilst landing after many reverts and quickloads it was finally successful a celebratory viewing of apollo 13 ensued followed with feverish design work on the next more ambitious project and then it was 6am the game is far too addictive i now wish i had studied aero engineering instead there is a full solar system to obtain science on explore with lots of ways to do it contraptions which can only be described as adorably ridiculous yet surprisingly effective may be constructed to your heart s content as with many other sandbox games you provide your own amusement set yourself ridiculous tasks and restrictions be efficient or over engineer the out of everything such that the littoral combat ship looks like a very sound and practical design with or without mods of which there are many you can build almost anything from planes and land vehicles to giant flying space horses and bananas official multiplayer support in the future was announced a while ago and there is currently a multiplayer mod that allows you to build space stations or conduct joint missions with friends and partner agencies it is still currently in development with more and more features being added with each major update even in its current state i would be more than happy to pay double its current full price based on how much enjoyment i have gotten out of it tl dr spectacular failures decided what i should have to eat one day and now i regret my key life decisions would buy again
