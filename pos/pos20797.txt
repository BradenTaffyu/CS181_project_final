2023 ok so let s get this in the way pros 1 it looks great even on the low graphical settings2 the minimum recomended specs are actually incorect you can run this game on lower end hardware specifically an i7 3770k 16gb of ddr3 ram and gtx 960 the storage recommendation is to be heeded unless you want to wait for 2 minutes for the loading times to catch up after any and all loading sequences 3 highly explorable and now to the conscons1 limited spells 2 cheesy story and sadly the 30 of the side quest where just as cheesy 3 arachnids i hate arachnids 4 the usage of the room of requirements 5 no quiditch even tho it was advertised 6 no access to neither diagon or knockturn alley nor gringots all in all i could make a top 10 things wrong with hl but i did enjoy my time in this game sadly this game has no multiplayer nor any purpose after completing the main story unless you re hunting 100 completion hopefully the sequel can improve upon the great blueprint that is present here
