2021 early access review i could describe dyson sphere program as factorio in 3d but that wouldn t come close perhaps satisfactory on more than one planet and with an actual end game goal would be a better fit there s so so much more but that s a good starting point i hate it when someone seems like they re raving about a game but that s what i m about to do there s a summary at the end if long winded prattle isn t your style saddle up here we go at the time of writing this review i have 46 hours played and i only bought it 72 hours ago i played it for 15 hours in my very first session and only stopped because my wife insisted i get some sleep i ll admit that i left it running while i slept for about 9 hours but in my defense i was trying to break the game by flying to another star system remember no man s sky i am quite pleased to report that traveling to another star system is totally a thing i was also flying there without warp capability the game told me i needed drive tech 4 to reach it but i only had drive tech 2 i tend to tech up slowly because i m a mechanics hound i have over 600 hours in oxygen not included but have never launched a rocket i have over 1 000 hours in fallout 4 two weeks of which was spent breaking the economy in survival mode with the workshop dlc by smashing tens of thousands of lunchboxes nuka cola is too heavy to be good for commerce but if you drink it you get a bottle cap pens and pencils on the other hand are weightless even in survival mode the game told me it would take roughly eleven and a half hours to get where i was going which was surprisingly accurate about 2 hours after i woke up this morning i unlocked my screen to find myself close enough to the system i aimed for to check out the planets in it and spent quite a while gleefully doing exactly that and taking notes i went on to visit several star systems although none was nearly so long in journey time as the first trip i did some irl things while i coasted through space at a mere 1 000m s for an hour or two on my way to neighboring star systems that were only a few light years away as far as i can tell the sole penalty for not using warp drive is that it takes much longer to get where you re going i regret being too impatient to research just a bit more before i left my home system stars are rated by their letter just like in reality the letters roughly follow the alphabet in scale as an example sol our sun aka the star in our own solar system is a g type star as is the star you start on in any new game f type stars are slightly hotter k are slightly cooler relatively speaking things i have learned in my travels through half a dozen or so star systems in this game the planets in g type star systems tend to be quite comfortable and there tend to be more of them they also tend to have large chunks of basic resources on them f type stars seem to be likely to have a relatively good selection of basic resources and to also be relatively comfortable if slightly less densely populated by planets than g type stars systems k and m stars seem to have more rare minerals but the very few planets are let s just say less hospitable lava or ice were prevalent features on many if not most that i visited during my journey b type stars have amazing amounts of resources on a fair to middling number of planets but those planets tend to also be slightly less pleasant than would be ideal warm and dry would be a good descriptor although less hostile in general than the fire and ice i found at the k m end of the scale the only water oceans i found were in orbit around f or g stars i saw but did not visit both a neutron star and a black hole as well as several red giants and white dwarf stars i m looking forward to visiting those but did not feel like 30 real world hours of travel time could possibly result in a payoff that would be worth it i may come back and update after i achieve warp travel but don t hold your breath my takeaway from my brief sojourn across the galaxy and the wikipedia entry on stellar classification stay as close to g type stars as you can in the early game leaning toward f type rather than k type if you have the option skip m type and b type until you ve got a solid logistics system and or can bring a base in a bucket with you don t forget to bring fuel for the return journey unless your plan to get home is load a save file oh and research warp drive before heading for another star it makes the journey much faster getting back to the review the music is excellent sound effects are stellar and positional audio is so immersive thank you devs the graphics are top notch for an early access title it s obvious that a lot of time and effort went into the art assets and i don t actually feel like anything is missing at least in what i ve experienced so far oh i did encounter an unimplemented technology in the research tree but it s labeled work in progress it s not selectable and skipping it doesn t prevent other techs from being researched so the actual impact on gameplay is practically non existent the translations to english are bit sketchy and the grammar is kinda gnarly in places but i would imagine that will be polished to perfection when they get around to it and it still manages to mostly get the point across although i did have to read a few phrases more than once to understand the intended meaning to be fair i ve seen worse spelling and grammar in titles that only had english as a language option so this is perhaps another point to be impressed by rather than an actual issue summary i ve seen aaa titles with less polish and less functional gameplay if this is early access and guessing by the versioning info about 60 complete then i can t wait to see what it looks like once it s actually finished well worth the money i paid for it in its present state and knowing what i know now i would easily have paid twice as much buy it before the price goes up this one is phenomenal
