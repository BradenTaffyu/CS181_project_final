2021 early access review you know that feeling when you play dwarf fortress adventure mode and the scope of possibilities is palpable for the first time i feel caves of qud very much like that it s a great charming retro roguelike it s very classically difficult and full of content but also beautfiful the first time you walk into the great planes of salt wow and the music i m also very much confortable with the politics inside the game and find very suspicious that other people are not but that s just me you can still play as the in your head g ebbels live and drink
