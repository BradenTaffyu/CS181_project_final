2018 possible spoilers for both fallout 4 and new vegas all right buckaroos i m back and ready to do this thing again this was my first legitimate review so i do love it dearly however it is just awful in retrospect and is riddled with spelling mistakes so after a few years and a few hundred hours later i feel i am properly prepared to redo this review of fallout new vegas i compared this game and its nephew fallout 4 in my first review quite a few times but i have played a bit more fallout 4 recently and have recanted some of my previous thoughts about the game mainly the negative ones fallout 4 is no masterpiece but it does have i believe it does a few things better firstly i think the transition from tracking someone down to siding with a faction is done a bit smoother than in vegas in 4 on the way to find your son you are forced to interact with many factions and with synths this gives you some motivation to side with a faction based off of the things you see as you find your son it even gives you some conviction to fight for a side given your son could be your ally or opposition raising the emotional connection between the player and the factions in vegas i often find myself wondering why i care about what happens to the mojave as a courier the player character has a lot less of a connection with this place than even a simple resident the jump from tracking down benny to siding with a faction just seems like a stretch to me i do want to mention factions but i ll keep this part a lot quicker than it was every side has pros and cons and no side is the correct side this gives the player a much more difficult choice when it comes to who is the best for the mojave for instance ceaser s legion looks like a bunch of machete welding and slave owning bastards but then you learn that all towns under the legions control are the most prosperous in nevada possibly even the united states its just a real sham the dev team didn t have enough time to put some smaller things in for each faction to expand them a bit more the good most of the quest are interesting and have meaningful rewards or outcomes the characters are all funny or interesting the weapons feel great plus all the unique variants make you feel like a total badass the incredibly open open world allows for all kinds of play just a damn good game the bad speaking of that open world it is also one of the downfalls for this game the open world feels so open that especially when replaying the game you don t have any real motivation forward the player gets overwhelmed with options so ends op picking non of them i often feel myself getting bored with the game after only a few minutes though i suppose i cant entirely blame the game for that conclusion this game is amazing but it is not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination i would talk more of my love for this game but i ve not got the time it is most certainly worth the cash it s dlcs are also worth the money by far if you want to see my original review on this game i have left it below this one old review factionsa comparison i find myself thinking of is fallout new vegas and fallout 4 in fallout nv i can play for hours and still have plenty of fun while in fallout 4 i can play for 10 minutes and get bored since fallout nv had interesting characters fun and interesting factions and award winning dlc however in fallout 4 i find that all the factions are hi we build robots and are evil hi we send you on boring quest please like us basicly i theres cookiecutter good and bad however in a game like new vegas i find myself pondering what faction i truly good and bad and ive come to the conclusion that there is no concrete good and bad its all sides of the story you see caesars legion inslaving people so you think its a bad faction but when confronted you learn that they do have good ideas that could be helpful i feel similarly about mr house on the outside he is such a jerk yet when you hear his plan for nevada in my opinion he has the best plan to save it i could go on and on about factions but there are more comparisons charactersin fallout 4 i find that characters are dull and boring i see a person i think there either useless are have a fetch quest for me none ive met have ever just wanted to talk like an real person they never say anything interesting or funny they will either ask me to go get something or to investigate which just means go kill some things in a area find something repeat until quest is done while in fallout nv i will admit most will ask me to do something but some will just want to talk and they dont have a quest you can just talk and i think that adds to the immersion if your thinking well you said in fallout 4 some people dont give you a quest yet when it happens in new vegas why do praise it as a immersive experence well what im talking about is in fallout 4 you try to talk to them and they just say something and walk away while in new vegas you can really talk to them ask questions find things out about them even if they dont require a quest to be forfilled opposite sidesso fallout new vegas is not perfect and fallout 4 is not the worst game ever made so some things fallout 4 does right is the power armour gives you a much more powerful feel than other games such as fallout nv and 3 but it is so much harder to transport well not harder but it is less easy you have to get power cores and they are scatterd and go down a lot quicker in fallout new vegas there are things that are less than perfect such as the followers are not that good some followers are pretty bland and are just hi you travel i dont have anyone i care for so i guess ill blindly follow you however there are plenty of followers that i love and alwase get when i replay such as boone the whole idea of killing the person who sold a mans wife to the legion is just great choicesin fallout 4 the choices are vary linear with people like prestion the only way to move on with the minute man quest line is to save a base 40 times plus talking choices are vary linear as well you either dont talk or immeditly he gives you a quest however with new vegas such as the boomers once you make it in you talk with pearl first when talking she congratulates you on making it trough there defences then she ask why you came to there base after she gives you a choice to either leave and if it comes up you can say to ignore them or to become friends with the leaders of the faction and spends time to connect with these people and create friend ships to get there help taking over hoover dam or you can just kill her thats what i love about this game their are so many options to deal with this but with fallout 4 you only have one option deathsso this may sound edgy or sadistic but players should be able to kill whoever they choose so what i mean pretty much all characters in 4 that you can talk to you cant kill in new vegas i havent met anyone i cant kill i can kill all main faction leaders i want and there are up sides and down sides to doing such things it is also in such award winning games such as half life and dues ex you can kill whoever you choose why may be a qustion you have and heres why it gives the player more control over the game and in turn it makes it feel less like there following the tale of a person and more like you are the character making choices for yourself summeryin short fallout 4 is such a lesser fallout game i would buy any other fallout game esspecialy new vegas and if you are deciding what fallout game you should play or are just deciding what to do on a weekend than fallout new vegas is a great way to spend your time
