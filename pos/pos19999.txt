2019 i played fallout new vegas many years back back when i still played primarily on playstation consoles i remembered enjoying it greatly during my first tenure into the mojave wasteland yet i never got around to finishing the additional content i was younger and less patient back then now many years later i returned to the mojave with a better appreciation for the nuances of new vegas and an almost complete play through under my belt i can safely say that this game has quickly become a new favourite of mine i should make mention if you are considering playing new vegas especially with mouse and keyboard i and many others before me would recommend modding the game with bug fix collections and stability improvements as new vegas vanilla has some issues with mouse control and stability regardless of the technical hiccups the combat may be a little archaic in action but it makes up for it in the depth of its character customisation and progression its main story is great offering 4 main paths to the game s conclusion but it is the sheer variety uniqueness and quality of side content that truly makes new vegas shine all 4 of the major dlc content packs offer a unique and interesting experience each with its own unique gameplay gimmicks and focuses and yet all carry inklings of a new interwoven parallel storyline in the background that ties it all back to the main game all are worth the price overall i cannot recommend fallout new vegas enough obsidian entertainment managed to create an outstanding wasteland survival game arguably better in many aspects than fallouts 3 and 4 my only hope and pipe dream is that one day fallout new vegas can be remade with the combat mechanics and graphics of 4 while maintaining the glorious customisation mecchanics and excellent stories that made the game so amazing in the first place i wish obsidian luck on their future endeavours hopefully the outer worlds can deliver an experience that i ll remember as fondly as i remember new vegas
