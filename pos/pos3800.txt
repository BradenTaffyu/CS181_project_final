2023 this is a complicated review to write the game is a lot of fun not super complicated and very entertaining i finished it i do not finish games i do not really like hell i don t finish plenty of games i do really like but dear god the writing the actual general plotline s coherent enough but the writing makes it harder to comprehend than it needs to be i m not sure if english isn t the first language of whoever wrote most of the dialogue or what but it can be very bad words get misused a lot or misspelled and the tone can shift wildly in a way the writing isn t up to pulling off also lots of stuff happens that isn t particularly explained or sometimes that just seems to come out of nowhere it got noticeably worse toward the end too there s also frequent little points within the story that just don t make sense i can t really explain it without a ton of spoilers but suffice to say a lot of character actions just don t seem coherent the most spoiler free example i can really think of is probably the default male main character romance which is basically i can t stop thinking about you ditto not exactly a deep attraction based on mutual anything and it s odd because the other romances seem pretty decently crafted for a lot of the game lots of things are unclear and there are several major things that just make no damn sense this contrasts very badly with the bits that are well done and those bits are there some other late game moments definitely had similar issues or simply didn t make sense also many of the flaws the writing and plotting does demonstrate are those you d expect from people who d watched a ton of anime without tempering it with other media i e the things that don t make sense are things that frequently don t make sense in bad anime the bad decisions are those that frequently are made in bad anime the wild tonal shifts that the writing isn t up to pulling off those of bad anime etc also also some of the voice acting is excellent sybil jaromir raskuja and stefan for example most is at least adequate but those voices that are bad are excruciating jules and abigayle were unbearable imo also despite being brother and sister both raised in the same country they have different accents in fact somehow abigayle has an accent that neither her brother nor her fellow countrywoman share it s slightly odd because the people who did the voices appear to have done multiple ones so it s not a question of them actually sounding like that on the bright side i do feel much less bad about saying it in that context anyway it s an excellent game that really really really needs a story and copy editor
