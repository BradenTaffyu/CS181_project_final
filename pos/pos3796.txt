2022 i played this game while it was in beta and klokked in over 100 hours i played not only on the medium difficulty but the highest difficulty on permadeath ultimately i didn t get to beat the game as the beta ended early but i made it to chapter 29 31 and so i saw the vast majority of what symphony of war had to offer i m klokinator a 20 year veteran of the fire emblem and advance wars scene i have played a lot of turn based tactical strategy games while i may not put symphony of war in the 1 spot it s definitely in the top 3 for me right after fire emblem 7 and 8 that s a high compliment as those are my favorite strategy games of all time sow is a game that emphasizes squads over individual units you place down a leader unit and their ldr score indicates your squad s capacity if your leader s ldr is 50 your squad has a capacity of 50 with each squaddie you add ranging from 8 12 cost then you place them down and try to maximize your damage effectiveness the order your units attack when engaging enemies and so on by having a leader unit you still get the identity of solo characters like in fire emblem but their squad mates are effectively that character s fully customizable stat spread by the end of the game you can and will absolutely have leaders with nine man squads which is the maximum number of units you can fit in the 3x3 grid range but even when you only have 4 or 5 units in your early squads this presents a lot of tactical opportunity do you roll with two archers behind three heavies emphasizing small hit and run chip damage with the occasional melee clash do you roll with five horses to race around the map and claim objectives while avoiding enemies with polearms polearms grant extra damage against cavalry do you place down one polearm unit and surround him with other units to maximize his polearm buff that boosts ally attack and damage or do you put 5 polearm units all next to one another to stack their power scaling just squad composition alone is its own metagame but by the time you reach chapter 3 and 4 and beyond you also start getting lots of artifacts these grant squad wide bonuses that can greatly change how individual squads function you can give one squad vampirism at the cost of losing max hp each turn or you can make a squad always attack first so the enemy loses their attack bonus the gameplay of sow is truly incredible it is deep replayable and i ve already sunk 100 hours into it as for the story of the game it s pretty good i wouldn t say it s my favorite ever but it s plenty enjoyable and has some truly touching moments the cinematic maps and cutscenes have a classic snes feel to them and the characters don t just walk around but actively strike at one another make jabbing motions and so on the story is ahem very reminiscent of fire emblem 4 the holy war so if you liked that game s story you ll definitely like this one as for the music i personally turned it off so i have no strong opinion i listened to techno the whole time but the music sounded fine it just wasn t my cup of tea a lot of people complain about the character artwork personally i think it looks good it s not my favorite artstyle but the characters all look good and some look truly great my favorite character is beatrix a sassy mage who can annihilate entire battlefields all on her own via firestorms of wrath this game is a true gem the developers are already starting to work on big updates and additions for the game so if you want to experience the best srpg since pre modern fire emblem check it out you ll find tactical options aplenty one last thing if you do buy this game keep an eye out for a special mercenary called kutthroat klok an assassin with treasure hunter and thievery you ll be rolling in the dough if you buy my merc
