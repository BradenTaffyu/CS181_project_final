2023 this rules play it i don t know what else to sayalright update i ve played a solid like 120 something hours so i m ready to actually review this this game is fantastic and has slowly creeped its way into being one of my favorite games of all time i m surprised i bounced off it many times before because ever since i got into it i ve literally been doing nothing but playing new vegas in my free time for an average of what like 8 hours a day it s insane i really love the writing of this game and as someone who really cares about characters and narrative they did so good for an open world game the glitches and bugs can up the experience but for me this isn t a game where i ll be particularily mad if i get a bug i enjoy playing it so i m already ready to fix it glad this has console commands to help with some bugs too played all the dlc besides lonesome road so far i didn t really like honest hearts that much but the others were like the best ever i don t know i m just consistently wow ed by this game this will always hold a place in my heart update 208 hours in steamtime wise 130 hours gametime wise i have beaten this game now and i still second everything i said above i went with yes man for my first run i feel empty knowing i ll never get to play this fantastic experience for the first time ever again
