2018 early access review raft is a fun relaxing game in an open world rather open sea think minecraft but you re a bobbing speck in a cast ocean you come across deserted islands buoys with supplies you scoop up mats as they float by i enjoyed my first few hours with raft tremendously and then i tried to 100 run that s when the game becomes a chore hooking 5 000 items and surviving 365 days isn t for anyone who has a normal attention span i suppose this could be made a little more tolerable by adding in a lot i mean a whole lot of end game content but i still doubt that anyone would want to go thru the monotony of manually hooking items when your collection nets can do the same thing for you however my achievement related rant aside overall it s a fun game well worth your money go sharks
