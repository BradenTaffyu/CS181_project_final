2017 slime rancher can only be described as delightful it is one of the best games i ve played and with its seemingly lack of content it accomplishes what most complete games can t even come close to it is probably the most joyful and happy game you ll ever play and will function better than any antidepressant on the market the graphics are somewhat minimalistic but fit the theme perfectly to the extent that a lack of hyper realism cannot be seen as a flaw the controls are easy to learn and the vacpac s gimmicks are always fun to use after playing a measly 3 hours of this game got 97 to go there is only two words i could find fitting to sum up this game kawaii slimes this was my review from march about 10 months ago most of it holds true but the fact that back then i said seemingly lack of content accomplishes should be a testament to the work ethic of the dev team after writing the review i kind of dropped the game for quite a while and have started it back up and been loving it more than ever as of late one thing that particularly astounded me was the amount of content that has been added in just those 10 months i can confidently say this game is flawless in achieving exactly what it s aspiring to do buy it it s cheaper than therapy
