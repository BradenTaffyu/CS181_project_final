2017 stardew valley what can i say that hasn t already been said it is a true spiritual successor to a game i never played called harvest moon first thing first if you love harvest moon please go buy this right now and dig in if not hold on and hear me out then go buy the game the game has you inheriting a farm and building a life for yourself on the farm you build relationships and explore in the new community that you are thrown into the core of the game is based around a daily cycle everyday you have to decide what you are going to accomplish each and every day this come down to farming fishing exploring mining and shopping but the seasons put pressure on you to handle your farm correctly and time everything down to the day it gets to the point you want to just spend one more day of in game time playing much like civilization has the just one more turn phenomenon associated with it overall there is very little to be upset about in this game i would recommend this to anyone that wants a nice and relaxing game this goes into my gold tier of games and i can t find any reason not to give stardew valley a 5 5 it is honestly worth it just to pay for the game at regular price
