2018 this game is one hell of a good time it can be super easy as you roflstomp over enemies or it can be soul crushingly brutal were every turn and reload of the game finds a new way to shaft you but here s the kicker you keep coming back for more the vanilla game is absolutly amazing and even without the mods you will have hours of fun but the mods oh lord the mods are just on another level so much love is poured into them it is astounding now lets say you are a youngling in their teen years and you see this game and you think urghhh it s old let me tell you friend this is the golden age of games before pay to win it was a time of the love of creating the game and hilarious glitches stupid ai where you need to take a second of shaking your head to contemplate how it can be so dumb then it kills you ohh lord it does i had never laid my eyes on this game until this year and if you find another game from this time period just know that it will most likely blow your socks off cough knights of the old republic cough in short you will love this game you will hate this game but most of all you will come back to it time and time again
