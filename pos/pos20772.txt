2023 magic is no different from any other power what really matters is the one who wields it eleazar fig description hogwarts legacy is the first instalment of the beloved wizarding universe since 2013 so it s no surprise that the open world rpg blew up the market with many series fans eager to embark on this new magical adventure however despite the stunning visual designs and a diverse range of creatures plants and potion recipes the rich package quickly becomes stale with some shallow formats employing the disillusionment spell to hide flaws setting summarythe journey begins a century before the events depicted in j k rowling s novels with a custom rendered protagonist who has just begun their fifth year at hogwarts school of witchcraft and wizardry the talented wizard has shown a strong affinity for magic over the past few months and with the aid of friends and strange acquaintances they will set out on an epic journey that could help them reach their full potential who knows what secrets they may uncover hop on the jacobite steam train and find out for yourself storythe main plot follows the traditional harry potter formula with the protagonist discovering their calling that connects them to a greater purpose the colourful cast that takes up the mantle of supporting characters further reinforces this factor as they are intertwined with your wizard s personal growth and progress but yet with such diverse personalities and some solid chain quest activities the overall narrative keeps falling flat the more you play the game and the main reason behind this can be found in the dialogues since the harry potter universe has attracted players of all ages avalanche software took the safest approach by offering a child friendly experience as a result many times you either encounter npcs that talk like children or even worse they are treating you like a child despite the fact that you murdered three wizards prior to the interaction gameplay in contrast to its weak narrative elements hogwarts legacy provides solid gameplay in both combat and exploration the plethora of customization options and unexpected interactions between spells and consumables provide all of the tools needed for unique role playing sessions but this does not imply that they check every single box with equal efficiency stunning locationsavalanche software faithfully depicts hogwarts and the many regions that surround it capturing both the beauty and the mystery that the wizarding world is known for the hogwarts castle is the game s pinnacle with many hidden rooms and interactable objects cleverly placed in crowded corridors or isolated locations while the surrounding fields add an extra layer of diversity with various underground caverns cosy villages and mysterious forests although an overwhelming amount of beauty is bursting at your screen the developers made sure to take things slowly by opening up to the numerous mechanics without imposing limitations consequently you can adjust the pace of the progression according to your needs the only deterrent to the aforementioned formula is the map by having such a diverse world i was expecting a much better navigation system similar to other big titles of the same genre the 3d interface for instance offers zero functionality aside from being visually stunning because it cannot be customised to highlight particular points of interest and the distances are frequently inaccurate showing long path roots that could be avoided breathtaking scenery community created artwork for steam artwork by majordomo the game s high point is the hogwarts castle the surrounding fields with their assortment of cosy towns eerie forests and dangerous underground caverns add an additional layer of variety bringing life to this rich arsenal while fairly simple in nature combat is very engaging as it opens the door to many combos and unexpected interactions the six elements of magic used in spell casting the most potent of which are the forbidden spells are stationary your toolkit holds a total of sixteen charms that you can equip but you can always quickly combine different abilities depending on the circumstance the beauty behind spell casting can be found in two main parameters the rotations and the cooldowns in order to prevent players from constantly using avada kedavra each spell has a time limit before it can be used again as a result your heavy damage dealers become somewhat limited forcing you to plan ahead of time before engaging in combat furthermore in order to maximise their potential hogwarts legacy introduces weaknesses to your adversaries that encourage experimentation and quick thinking spiders for example are weak to fire damage while dugbogs become vulnerable when you expose their bellies finally the clearly overpowered potions and plants you ll brew or grow in your workshop will broaden your lethal abilities adding another layer of complexity epic wand fights community created artwork for steam artwork by majordomo while fairly simple in nature combat is the bread and butter of the whole experience as it opens the door to many combos and unexpected interactions engaging activities besides the main story hogwarts legacy is rich with puzzles collectibles and minigames that are slowly unravelled as you learn new abilities the merlin trials for instance were the most memorable of the bunch because you got to use the knowledge you have been honing so far in order to move objects or simply destroy orbs and pillars in a timed manner such activities were a welcome diversion from the main pump action story sequences but despite their novelty they were clearly outmatched by the game s most prominent feature transportation flying on a broom proved to be exceptional mesmerising and most importantly fun to such an extent that it could be transformed into a game itself with the necessary adjustments last but not least i would like to touch upon the lack of sandbox elements that the overall experience could clearly benefit from regardless of how charming the world is it unquestionably requires a moral compass to keep our protagonist from overrelying on forbidden spells the absence of such an addition is a missed opportunity especially given that both students and professors comment on your previous actions jaw dropping scale community created artwork for steam artwork by majordomo flying on a broom turned out to be exceptional captivating and most importantly fun to the point where with the right modifications it could become a game in and of itself visuals staggering visuals neat animations and colourful spells combine into a canvas full of passion and grandeur the world is a love letter to the harry potter fanbase creating a very faithful template to the original series even the smallest details have been meticulously crafted with the falling leaves during autumn being one of the most impressive and breathtaking effects that left me speechless everything is tinged with mystery and magic almost begging you to abandon fast travel to fully appreciate the beauty which is why i consider the lack of a photo mode feature to be a crime audio even though i appreciate the fact that music and spell effects are reused from the original harry potter movies there is nothing new in the overall mix sure the environmental sounds are remarkable adding lots of personality during conversations and cutscenes but i still find them very lacking in comparison to the visual approach the voice acting is superb with new voice actors getting a chance to shine but as previously stated the dialogues can become quite irritating verdict after nearly 70 hours of gameplay i can confidently say that hogwarts legacy is by far the most promising fantasy world adaptation i ve ever seen in a video game paving the way for a new era of harry potter titles the game is excellent yet not perfect with both unexpected and twisted turns that in spite of their shortcomings prove to be mostly masked by the shroud of nostalgia our song like a sparrow s seeks to be heard but unlike the bird we sing on paper follow us to the scriptorium and let our words take flight
