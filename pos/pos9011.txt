2023 it s worf not woof mr worfreviewing modern 4x games is actually a pretty bad idea i mean back in the days things were simple there was say civilization or master of orion or whatever and that was it nowadays it s a totally different story most of such games act not as stand alone products but as online services and it doesn t really matter how exactly they sell things to you what matters is that they do and there are consequences you leave the game for a few months and then boom you re a bloody gandalf having no knowledge of this place when you return it s pretty much the same thing with what we have in mmos like i said reviewing modern 4x games is a bad idea just because people who ll pay for the whole thing would have totally different experience from those who ll only buy base game all those dlcs you see on the store page those are not stand alone things those are additions to the main game some of them are ridiculously overpriced some feel more like an update and how should we feel about all that i have absolutely no idea still let s try to look at the core mechanics shall we so 4x games what are those the term that was invented by computer gaming world s alan emrich means explore expand exploit and exterminate and aside from an obvious question about mr emrich being dalek that s pretty much everything casual player should know about em there s a map usually very schematic and your goal is to explore it expand your borders exploit the resources and naturally deal with your opponents one way or another that s it and before you ask yes technically you can say that all of such games are exactly the same but that s where actual gameplay begins because obviously this kind of games is all about the details the addictiveness micromanagement stuff like that and in both matters stellaris does surprisingly well what i want to praise the most is the expanding element do kids nowadays play dots or at least know bout that game anyway it s a game in which you re supposed to connect dots on paper and it s pretty addictive because reasons stellaris while not following the same rules have very similar effect expanding your borders here is just fun no idea why it just is bloody dots anyway we ve got the addictiveness what s about micromanagement well it s a paradox game and the guys are like lords and ladies of the grand strategy genre naturally they know their ways around such stuff most of the things here are surprisingly thought through don t expect any noobish mistakes like you won t need manually move every single colonist there are always comfortable menus to help you you can control a lot of things and you won t suffer while doing that thanks to that it s almost impossible not to like this game just because it looks like paradox aimed for perfection here they didn t want revolution they didn t want creativity they just wanted to make a game people would love you know playing a game people have in mind while dreaming of their own perfect experience did they succeed well almost my personal first hours in the game were like ok this is nice this is smart this is comfortable and i see what they did over there paradox did fantastic job putting an impressive amount of details into a comfortable and easy to get package like any good game in the genre stellaris is easy to learn yet hard to master the game gives you a great toolset to express yourself in a vast galaxy every civilization comes with their own views and self boundaries which makes politics very juicy and yes elections and your leaders lifespans play very important role here you can even do some researches to make those live longer now isn t that every aladeen s wet dream a lot of your favorite things from stardock s titles are also included like you can design your own ships edit civilizations any way you want etc in other words tons of fun here easy to learn easy to control so that s it we finally got ourselves a perfect 4x game in space well not really no i mean maybe on paper we did even though i can t say i m a very big fan of real time battles but in reality not quite i m sure every player will come up with their own share of complains but here s mine first yes i want to complain about dlcs without those the game begins to feel kinda empty in a second half of big run when you ensure your survival and begin to grow fat at that point it s either having dlcs or sticking with pretty dull day by day experience ok can be seen as fair unfortunately dlcs add only tiny bits of content and only combined together can pass as a real deal the best way to deal with all that is to buy the complete package but as usual with such stuff it just keeps going and going and going like an energizer bunny from hell while complete package is not even a thing another big problem is lack of ways to win some people would say that winning in 4x games is not that important but i strongly disagree solid amount of victory conditions is must in my opinion while stellaris is clearly lacking in that pretty much everything in the game contributes to so called victory score and that s pretty much it sounds dull and guess what it is you just do things for your greatness the end the funniest thing you can do is to buy dlc that allows you to become so called galactic nemesis but still victory conditions in this game are way too dull and boring in my opinion don t expect this game to be a technological wonder either while having 39 99 price tag and forcing you to buy dlcs this game looks and feels very indie if you know what i mean nothing here screams aaa quality and before you ask no it is not perfectly optimized either during endgame with many things happening on biggest map possible you ll sure regret not playing on one of those nasa computers you can say it s a price for a game making tons of calculations but come on john carmack put an authentic version of doom on jaguar by thinking out of the box surely it s possible to do better here performance wise what i hated the most though is that the game looks like a shameless rip off i mean paradox it s not 90s anymore you know you can t just take popular setting make video game based on it and pretend it s your own creation everybody did that some of the most iconic names were born that way warcraft is a nice example but that was 90s having something like that nowadays feels ridiculous everything in this game from design and lore to the actual lines was stolen from star trek like there s united nations of earth which clearly is not the same thing with united federation of planets and doesn t come with nearly identical logo that can t interfere with pre ftl civilizations affairs there s their mirror counterpart there are borg oh i m sorry homolog who want to assimilate things with all dat what were they thinking isn t that obvious that such an approach adds a very unpleasant feeling of chinese rip off like you don t need justice league son we ve got sense of right alliance yes it s a thing at home still stellaris is a very good choice for those who love 4x genre what makes me sad is that it had almost everything to be even better the next big thing a must have title a name to remember unfortunately it ends up being just good not good good but just good you know how it is still you want paradox s take on 4x in space here it is and it feels good most of the time
