i ve played this game ever since 2014 16 i ve bought it across multiple devices and yet in those many lost hours i never left the home system i recently took a leap in leaving the home system and went to exotic planets such as eve and duna and it felt great even if i crashed and burned in some of those missions from those failed missions i learnt more and more and i started to gain some odd ideas to go further ksp is a place where your craziest rocket ideas come to life thanks to the limitless amount of designs that can be made in this game i ve been able to go further with my most recent leap being landing a kerbal on laythe in one of the most odd designs i ve made but the most important thing is that i did it and it felt incredible but what if i want more the need to want more can be quenched through the vast amount of mods created by the still thriving modding community this game holds change the solar system add new parts fictional and real my point is ksp is a game that can be tailored to your needs whether you want a more simple game or a game made for the most hardcore rocket scientists out there if you have the time and money buy this game you ll have a blast even if you choose to stick to the gravity of the home planet
