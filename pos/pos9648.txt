2015 reasons to buy this game the physics engine is very realistic all tracks are laser scanned so even the smallest details get put in the game cars sound exactly like in real life i m a track marshal at zandvoort so trust me on that multiplayer on dedicated servers with 25 players works fantastic with a 360 controller without having to fiddle with settings i am able to accurately steer and keep up with wheel users the game supports quality mods many of which are readily available across the web kunos adds regular new content in the game a few times a year mostly for free despite being a sim the game is not hard to get into all assists can be modified reasons not to buy the game you only play racing games where you do 200km h drifts and you don t like sims career is a bit meh you believe that braking before corners is for sissies
