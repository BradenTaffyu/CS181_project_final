2021 a massive game that has no filler only meat the freedom of actions you can do is awesome but sometimes can be overwhelming the exploration and side quests was the best part of the game for me i almost feel like a detective when i have to dig in the truth by talking to npc or searching the rooms for the clues especially the tiny houses of the arx was joy to just zoom in and see so much detalis also the amount of recorded voices is insane there are some things that didn t click for me like time consuming itemization in inventory difficulty spikes in battles have to turn down the difficulty setting to lowest reaching for help outside the game because there was no hint what to do also the controls was something to getting used to but overall the game is worth your time and effort story rich rpg with a soul worth checking out
