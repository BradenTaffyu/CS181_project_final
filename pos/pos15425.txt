2019 product received for free survival games has never been a genre of game that i play a lot but this game is a major exception the mods are helpful quirky and funny all the original cast characters have their nice charm wendy abigail ftw the only thing i sad about is that you can t play any of the dlcs from the 1st game mostly shipwrecked looks like it d be a blast playing with others and add a nice change of pace instead of the usual map one of the cons for me that it can be boring if you play it on a daily basis i d recommend doing it every now and then aside from that have fun surviving
