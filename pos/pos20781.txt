2023 i was playing the game on another account and i have no reason to write a fake review or get paid for it so calm down about game timemy rating 9 10 hogwarts legacy a magical experience only for harry potter fans in hogwarts legacy we play a new student who comes to magic school as previously known we start with the character in fifth grade and not as usual as an eleven year old in the first year and yes as the story progresses it becomes clear why that is the main mission series i e the core of the game has been implemented flawlessly is absolutely creative and not only takes place in the open world i was really impressed with some of the things the developers came up with especially towards the end of the main story in addition the cutscenes are graphically on film level and the story is told in an exciting and interesting way also there is no shying away from death and violence and you experience a lot of fan service with attention to detail and only rarely does it get overly sentimental the character editor is solid but doesn t allow for an excessive number of options you can only select pre made faces and characters unfortunately there are no other personalization options therefore the number of assets is also noticeable in the game because in the castle you always meet the same people or very similar ones basically the castle is not overly busy and it is noticeable that grades one to four six and seven are not available at all i can imagine that this is partly due to the fact that not so many character models should be designed and even more npcs would probably have caused a stuttering orgy i also have the feeling that the character animations have been cut back a bit and there are some clipping errors basically however all character models are really pretty and the coats scarves and capes are designed great even if they quickly develop a life of their own when moving and flap around wildly it just looks really amazingif you overlook the few little things you get an absolutely beautiful game that can convince with both the graphics and the spectacular scenery the faces look alive and you can read the emotions that go with what is happening and the overall animation of the characters is very believable in general the world is very harmonious and you quickly feel at home the areas in the castle are strongly inspired by the films and outside they have detached themselves more from them but still made sure to create a world in which one likes to move you can tell on every corner that the developers put their hearts into it and you constantly come across lovely details such as decorative objects scattered lore and one or the other side quest and finally the musical cherry on top of the sundae with cream there s no direct soundtrack from the films but the music is pretty damn close and really really good i also liked the fact that there is no excessive continuous sound and the developers have found a good mix of when scenes are bombastic accompanied and when things should be a little quieter the overall result is a production that really convinced me and made me forget the real world for hours and there is so much to dothe main missions are quite varied and the game world changes as they progress there are several seasons that change when you reach certain story moments the side missions on the other hand are not tied to the seasons and therefore cannot be missed however it can quickly become confusing in the quest menu if you only accept the challenges and never complete them as far as the demands of the side missions are concerned this varies greatly there are classic boring collection tasks but also missions that lead you to hidden places that you probably wouldn t have seen otherwise and for the fact that these are purely optional areas some of them are really impressive in the lessons you can expect a wide variety of challenges depending on the subject all the different types of teaching are all well implemented and the professors appear as believable personalities who take great care of us after all we have a lot of catching up to do and that happens with exactly homework sounds really bad but it really isn t because it loosens up the events for a while and there are additional magic rewards i think that with the spells a lot of attention was paid to player friendliness because there are almost no annoying elements and spells have a long range and there is no cooldown for them outside of combat to infinity and beyondflying with the broom which you unlock after a few hours of play and use constantly from then on was also implemented very well the controls work great and i m really not a good flyer in such games you re fast in the open world and it feels great the view you have is absolutely awesome and i like to fly a little longer instead of using fast travel a little less spectacular but somehow even cooler are the flying mounts that you unlock a little later basically these do exactly the same thing as the broom although they may seem a bit slower and don t feel quite as agile but there s something absolutely epic about it compared to a magic broom wrong place at the wrong timeof course you will have to fight too and these are great fun we have a standard spell a block counter mechanic and the different spell classes enemies create colored shields that can be countered with the right type of spell the great thing is that each spell also has a unique ability and it s not just the color coding that matters this allows you to try different tactics and quickly develop your own magical fighting style and what about replay value and continued play value the game still has a replay value because the main quest is played differently in the different houses and the students react differently to it and since you often have the choice of how to decide a second run is probably just as much fun because you can try out the unused dialogue options ultimately however it is up to each individual to what extent the passages then differ from one another even after the main story it s still worth playing because the final exam of the fifth grade is waiting for you so there s a good reason to keep zipping through hogwarts after the credits roll doing side quests and engaging in battles the game doesn t reinvent the wheel and comparable fights quests and open world tasks can be found in other games but the creative and clever implementation of the story events in a video game design coupled with the new game mechanics that are presented every few hours i was pleasantly and positively surprised the game has many allusions to the harry potter world but still has its own and new ideas that the developers turn into unforgettable game moments review date february 11 2023my pros and cons long story campaign magical and enormously detailed game world atmospheric music great fights through magic combos lots to discover game mechanics clearly explained letters give backgrounds to the game world harry potter charm with lots of fan service interesting side missions and collection tasks world invites you to explore countless puzzles and mysteries quite stiff facial animations no morality system quidditch sometimes very artificial looking dialogues played with visit me in my little world
