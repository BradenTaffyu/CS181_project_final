2017 early access review what can i say this is belgium s jewel in the gaming industry the kind of game developer we need more of more content more polished and more fun than any triple a game developer will give you at 2 3 the price and no hundreds of holes to add paid content later even in the early access phase this is already more polished than most games are 3 months after official launch the game itself it s the original improved and better in every single way graphics look great and the engine is very well optimized already the combat and progression system is very well done and fun multiplayer even better integrated than the original storyline and characters are interesting and well written the music i absolutely love it affordable even if you fear the early access tag just buy this if you re into this type of games at all you won t be disappointed and you ll actually be supporting a developer that delivers and makes games for the gamers not for mass revenue of course they re a business in it for profit too but there s a difference between 45 euro for a full game and 60 euro for a game with 10 strategically placed holes for paid dlc pushed into release with game breaking bugs larian studios actually ditched their publisher and switched to crowd funding because they forced them to make and launch the game the way they didn t want it that should tell you enough larian studios as a belgian i can say you make us proud please keep doing what you re doing never succumb to the attitude most major developers and publishers have it d be a huge loss in the game industry
