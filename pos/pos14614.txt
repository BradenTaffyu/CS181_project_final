2023 the first game in the civilization series that i got my hands on it s like playing chess with an octopus on roller skates hilariously challenging the ai opponents are like overconfident squirrels on a caffeine binge but with practice you can make them scatter like acorns i haven t played any online matches because they require a lot of time but playing against bots is quite enjoyable i definitely recommend it for a good time
