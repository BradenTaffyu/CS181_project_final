2017 ok so after 24 hrs and over a decade of playing total war entries i think i ve experienced enough to establish a clear idea of what this game can offer and what it cannot so here we go first of i gotta say i ve encounterd no bugs glitches i know this game hada bad launch but they did a really good job of fixing most of the stuff and getting this game to a playable state but that s not saying this game has no problems this game even on a high end pc s like mine will have very stiffpreformence especially on the fps with that s said let s move on to a more short review wich will summarize all of my opinions positives great and fun real time battles graphics are real nice great variety of factions and units different looks for each in addition strategy is requierd more than other total war entries in the series negatives after mid late time on the grand campaign most factions are way too easy other factions are not challenging enough even on very hard once you establish your economy and have ton of money nothing is really a challenge ui is one of the worst ever in a total war entry nothing really tells anything a lot of stuff are left out and is left to you to understand alone my overall score 7 8 10thanks for taking your time edit as requested my specs nvidia gtx 970 16gb memory 1 5tb
