2017 mostly positive is a fair way to describe this game the mechanics are superb a great improvement over 5 city planning is a fun new aspect and the inspirations make for a new and dynamic game every time you play as you take advantage of the situation you re given the best you can waging war is rewarded as well unlike in its predecessor when having more cities crippled your infrastructure through unhappiness and let s not forget an excellent presentation including wonderful music heartfelt narration and utterly charming graphics and character design several problems are worth bringing up however the ai is terrible diplomacy is scarcely worth attempting as the designers tried to balance the game by making computer players hate anyone that is doing well and stamping tremendous relationship penalties for each city you take even when at war with a third party and even when you are not the aggressor on top of that cpu players don t understand combat at all to a downright embarrassing degree it s unclear how the designers could have screwed that part up so bad as the combat isn t all that complicated there are also several interface issues from unexplained mechanics like ranged unit obstructions to combat predictions randomly displaying combat values in the tens of thousands the civilopedia is miserably incomplete and not always helpful prompting excursions to the unofficial internet wiki to answer questions then we have the more egregious issues those who purchased the deluxe edition got ripped plain and simple on one hand it s the own fault of consumers who threw their money at something without any concrete promise of what they were getting back but on the other hand it took a very long time to get but a few extra leaders and civs we ve been promised cross platform compatibility between windows and mac since launch they still have no definite date set for this patches have been slow to come and haven t fixed the major issues aspyr has by all appearances been very forthcoming about what they are hoping to achieve but results have been consistently disappointing ultimately this is a very very good game but it s anything but solid for multiplayer it s the best civ game out there and overall it s one of the best 4x games out there but i still think you should wait for a good sale
