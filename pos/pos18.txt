stardew valley feels like coming home i can t remember which playthrough i m on which is a rarity for me i ve revisited childhood favorites like zelda and mario countless times cherishing each experience however as an adult this happens less frequently maybe it s because modern games don t resonate with me as deeply or maybe my gaming habits have simply changed over time yet whenever i boot up stardew valley it hits all the right notes whether i ve talked with the residents of pelican town dozens of times or played through its events repeatedly the game retains its magical allure it feels like a nostalgic return to childhood gaming a comforting experience i can enjoy every time of the year what s truly remarkable is the developer s commitment to continually expanding the game with substantial updates and expansions all provided for free stardew valley brims with passion and love despite its status as one of the most successful indie games of all time the developer continues to pour his heart into it enriching the experience for players i deeply respect and appreciate this dedication which unfortunately is no longer a given in today s gaming industry and after all these years i ve finally reached the summit
