2016 i m not really sure what i m doing food is running low people are getting depressed from how bad the accomodations are on this planet i mean what do you expect we are living in a small alcove carved out from the sheer mountain wall in a desolate alien planet it s no ritz carlton my main hunter got sad from sleeping on the hard rocky floor for too many nights in a row he threw his rifle on the floor took off his shirt and pants off and started wandering outside eventually fixating on a wild turkey and followed him around for days i wonder why he decided to do this rimworld is an attempt to replicate a semblance of dwarf fortress s complexity with actual graphics i ve always felt df was one of those games that was much more fun to read about rather than play somewhat like eve online from what i understand rimworld doesn t come close to emulating df level complexity but it is extremely intricately detailed in its own right injuries are simulated all over the body to the level that a guy can have his right ring finger bitten off by a beaver colonists have their own personalities and wants skills as well as unique traits these make all the colonists feel more like real people as they have a semblance of personality for example some of them won t really mind living in squalor while others want an extravagant bedroom or nice chairs or something you can assign tasks but not all of them can do everything so optimizing job priorities is a large part of the game s challenge colonists will develop relationships with one another ranging from falling in love alll the way hating one another and starting fights you really get the sense that yes you can tell them what to do but they are their own self contained entities with wants and needs that require management or else on day they ll decide it i m out and start stabbing and eating everyone else or something combat is more interesting too with cover based shooting melee combat automated turrets traps etc it is much more complex than the standard right click on someone and go hit him of other similar games rimworld s graphics are the simplistic charming prison architect style with similar mechanics in zoning and construction mechanics this game has been in development for years and it shows there are plenty of features and mechanics in this game as well as a distinct lack of bugs so far my one complaint is that there isn t much of an in game tutorial but there is a helpful advice message system which helped me out a lot still i would ve preferred a small mini campaign like in prison architect so i can at least get a general idea what i should prioritize and what i should work towards but i m sure this information will come with time as i mess around in the game more highly recommend this if you like colony simulators it s amazing really
