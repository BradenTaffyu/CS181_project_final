2017 where to even start with this game i just finished 100 ing it after 68 hours and i am in a state of pure awe of what i just witnessed playing through this game this will be a different type of review than my other ones because i have a lot of things to get off my chest after going through this it will have pro cons at the end but it will be a very personal review i will start by saying that i haven t played a yoko taro directed game before but i have heard a lot of great things about his weird world that he has created that links between multiple games and franchises nier drakengard respectively so i was really excited when i heard that square decided to give him a good budget and a very well known studio for their character action games platinum to make a sequel to the original nier from the previous generation so without any doubt and after hearing that it got a pc release i instantly purchased it because i was fascinated by what yoko taro could do and what a fantastic job he and his team at platinum games have done a game that shouldn t be passed on by anyone because it does something that i personally haven t encountered in a game before which i won t spoil here because you have to experience it yourself imagine a platinum game that has exquisite combat a director that is so masterful in how he presents the story giving small information and tidbits as you go along and a soundrack by a composer that is well known keiichi okabe that you take a few moments from playing the game just to listen to the music it s that good i won t go much into the story of the game because it s very easy to spoil but the story and overarching plot is so well done and it makes you question a lot of things about humanity emotions life itself and many other things now onto the more technical side of things i will go for pro cons conclusion and a small ps at the end of it pro unforgettable story yoko taro at his finest outstanding soundtrack keiichi okabe fluid combat gameplay a la bayonetta metal gear rising revengeance multiple weapons combination alongside a robust rpg system that includes crafting leveling skills etc good cast of main characters and npc s multiple endings true ending good pc port turn off aa if you want performance boost msaa ruins your framerate open world side quests some of them are worth doing for the rest see cons arbitrary resolution support 60fps albeit still locked and can t go higher the color palette of this game although it looks a bit washed out it fits with the setting multiple difficulty settings for both casuals and hardcore players that want to test their mettle codex for enemies weapons items story for weapons that unlock via upgrading themcons side quests that include a lot of backtracking i think this was intentional so you can keep your focus on the main narrative 30fps cutscenes that are locked at 900p and they sometimes also drop in framerate they are jarring when transitioning from a 60fps in game scene to a 30fps with drops in a cutscene a few technical bugs regarding fullscreen that can be patched grinding for materials and chips aka bonuses is required if you want to play at higher difficulty levelsconclusion and overall thoughts this has been an eye opening experience that i will never forget from the amazing soundtrack by keiichi okabe to the wonderful directing and story by yoko taro and the combat by platinum games they all mesh together to create one of the best action rpg s that i have ever played yes the fetch quests can be tedious and grinding can be a pain at times to achieve everything this game has to offer but i did not waver and was fascinated by this world i really hope this game sells well enough so that square greenlits a remaster of nier 1 on pc ps thank you square enix yoko taro keiichi okabe platinum games everyone involved for creating this amazing game pps if you ve read until this point i want to thank you for doing so and urge you to go and buy this game because it s one of those games that doesn t deserve to be forgotten in a slew of big releases horizon zelda mass effect andromeda and the reason why it s going to be my goty this year i will now post a quote from jim sterling s review that resonated with me so much that i cannot state it better as an ending to this lenghty review nier itself is important it is as far as i m concerned historically significant in terms of its design and the way in which it uses the framework of a videogame to tell an evolving story if i had my way every budding game developer would play this game to the point of acquiring endings a b c d and e before acquiescing to its final and alarmingly direct request few games are able to showcase the power of the medium like nier automata if history forgets this game then history
