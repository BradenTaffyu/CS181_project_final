2018 fantastic game as a mostly newcommer to total war warhammer 2 did a fantastic job of pulling me in and making it easy to learn my first total war was actually attila but the tutorial was awful performance was poor and i found the game frustrating and kinda boring i only ended up putting in 6 hours and was ready to give up on the series i gave warhammer 2 a chance though and i m so very glad i did it fixed everything i disliked about attila fantastic tutorial smooth performance highly entertaining and a rich atmosphere brimming with lore it has quickly become my most played game on steam and there s more content than i ll probably ever have time to play i see many reviews complaining about the dlc policy but i don t think it s a problem at all i don t usually buy dlc but i m glad to for warhammer yes it seems like a lot if you add it all up but the value is insane take the 19 tomb kings dlc for example you get four campaigns each one likely taking 30 50 hours to complete even if you only play one which is what i m doing for now as i want to try a new race each time that s still comparable to many full 60 games for less than 20 play all four and the hour value is more than generous you don t have to buy all the races up front they are still there in the game you just can t play as them just buy one at a time as they interest you by the time you get through all the base races and any dlc you own you will be happy to pay for more
