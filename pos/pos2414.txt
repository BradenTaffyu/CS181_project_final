2020 when this game was released i could barely bring myself to play it constant crashes bugs glitches all sorts i gave up on it until wastelanders came along and now i absolutely love it not only thanks to the inclusion of npcs but patches the switch to steam seems to have ironed out so many technical issues and it now runs just as well as my fallout 4 does granted my pc is a bit behind the times these days but it s still powerful enough to run the game on medium settings smoothly now i m sad to see 76 get hit with such hostility and i d encourage you to give this game a go it s now in a state i think it should have been released in and it s a great laugh with friends if you team up and play events together bethesda are also working on free future content so i d say it s well worth the price it s definitely hooked me back in after a rocky start
