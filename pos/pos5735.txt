2020 early access review finally after waiting for a very long time bannerlord is here getting the full attention from everyone who played the previous titles and the ones who are willing to dive in the world of mount and blade at start bannerlord is set before the events of mount and blade warband showing a more torn apart calradia this time with an interesting plot and opportunities to begin with and a more detailed beginning than warband whats the biggest changes combat is now much more better the world feels alive now seasons changes weather conditions lords and kings always lurking around recruiting troops and managing caravans and stuff and too many looters and this game makes you a tournament addict they are better now with great value prizes and more atmospheric fights no more wooden toys pal you will have to fight against steel and death bit too much but aight trading party clans companions and needs to survive like food money and morale are now subjected to a new form of management personally i found it much more better i am not going to go full detail because most of the players already did in their reviews is it worth buying now thats what i really wanted to talk about and the true answer is no don t get me wrong bannerlord is great and its not about being bad at all but i want you to know that this game will change in a huge way in the future and i have the highest hopes that if this project was carried out with care and hard work bannerlord will be the goat so if you want a truly amazing experience i advise you to wait for the right moment to buy it because as every ea game is has alot of flaws and performance issues and when the game is finally well optimized the devs will move to the next step that is adding more content to the game the best thing about buying bannerlord now is to feel in the future the good impact that the new content did on it and thats why i bought it in the first place at the endhigh hopes for this game and the devs in general they are doing great and i am sure that they will keep going in the right wayam not going to talk about the cons nor rate it because it is too late to do so now and yeah can you add its almost harvesting season again please p
