2021 from my very first experience of this title over at a friend s house to all those long hours behind the wheel ets2 has lost none of its charm when i initially heard about it and listened to what people who truly adored it had to say about it i really didn t know how it could be possible that something seemingly so mundane could have the appeal they claimed it did it didn t take me long to realise how right they were obviously sims like this aren t everyone s cup of tea but for the people who are drawn to these types of titles you know who you are ets2 is in my opinion one of the best its current review status of overwhelmingly positive speaks for itself and the number of vtcs virtual trucking companies that exist via the truckersmp mod adds another dimension and potential for interaction the sheer scope for customisation in terms of the trucks in the game is vast and the available dlc opens up even more for you to play with and let s not forget how damn relaxing it is to just jump into the cab and wind your way through a simulated europe shipping things where they need to go it might not be a hack n slash an fps or an action rpg but the kind of fun to be had from games like these does seem to scratch a certain itch
