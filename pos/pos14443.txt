2021 early access review bought this right at launch for the most part it s alright it does require a little bit of guess work on some stuff and does move slow in certain areas mass production of components for example obviously since it was launched around a couple of hours ago at the time of this review it ll have its stumbles here and there i feel like this has a lot of potential just need to have some patience
