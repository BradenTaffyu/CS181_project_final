oh my gosh what a ride this game had me on the edge of my seat the entire time it took a few failings to get through the first scenario but man that ending what a rush such an emotional ride i think a lot of people won t get it but man ugh surviving that i haven t felt like i lived an epic adventure like this since the last of us in 2013 and this wasn t even up close and personal it s a management game wow hats off the devs who made this artists pure art the music the sound the atmosphere the compatibility the optimization i played this on a 2014 laptop with a gtx870m in 1600x900 i can t imagine how this game must look in max settings this was amazing i recommend everyone try this just to see if they can handle it the adrenaline reward is worth it
