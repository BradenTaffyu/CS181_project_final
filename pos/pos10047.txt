2016 early access review i rarely write reviews and most of them are just for fun but this is probably the best sandbox game i ve ever played so far if you played banished timber and stone factorio dwarf forest prison architect you re gonna like it what s inside it lots of replayability scenario system and difficulty settings makes every colony or tribe different from each other thus providing the player with ability to customize the game as you want to you can even create and download scenarios from other players in workshop tons of content and i mean it game will never get boring even in the mid and late game especially if you ll choose challenging difficulty to spice up the gameplay with some action if you want to have more content workshop has it all alongside with that you have interactive world which will be harsh just like the real world but that what makes this game even more interesting so don t let the early access scare you even if the devs will stop releasing updates it s already in a very good shape and the community makes it even better tl dr just buy it already you won t regret it
