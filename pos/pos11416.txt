early access review i don t normally like zombie survival games 7 days earned an exception first it s a tough for the starting survival getting food and water that will not kill you is a challenge especially with the zombies out there but then you have to be ready for day 7 when the horde comes if you aren t ready you die you gain in skills power and defense ability but so does that horde the game scales with you so while you may do better so will the zombies and you get harder zombies as you skill level up you have to build and craft defenses to beat the ever strengthening hordes and while this is a fun challenge solo it s even better with friends
