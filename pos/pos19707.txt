2015 fallout new vegas puts aaa titles to shame incredible game for ludicrously low price if you are going to mod new vegas after playing for a while i strongly recommend the following mods from nexus communityproject nevadamakes the game even more interesting than it already is you can have optional fps shooter elements with project nevada dynamic crosshair bullet time peripheral vision etc fully customizable you can enable or disable them at any time also to mention cybernetic implants which give the player extra perks true leaning by xilandoessential if you are going to install project nevada or stealth a very simple mod which allows you to peek from corners thats about it nmc texture packthe game is a little old but nmctp revitilazes the game giving more realistic and detailed textures will consume extra space on your hd but worth it definetely bottle that waterit s odd that obsidian devs missed such feature by default you don t have the possibility to refill water from lakes pumps or fountains but thanks to the modding community now you can the mods i recommend going on and on there are definetely more essential mods but i wrote the most important look from my personall mods installed here bought fallout new vegas on autumn sale 2014 invested many hours playing even after finishing the game i feel like playing it all over again i upgraded it to ultimate edition on winter sale 2014 to get all the dlc s to increase the playability of the game it s basically enormous game and the time you can spend on it let s also mention the ridicilous modding potential if it happens to beat the game with all 4 factions and finishing the dlc you can either turn the game into a complete sandbox give it some bounty hunting mode or user created quests
