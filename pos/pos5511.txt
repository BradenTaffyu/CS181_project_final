2023 early access review you re given 24 different classes and lots of different abilities so you have a lot of room to create a personalized character my two favorite characters are a frail little guy who explodes heads with his mind and a dumb multi armed indestructible barbarian monster that eats his victims and regrows limbs the game has a checkpoint system as an alternative for permadeath the thrill of danger is still there but instead of the risk of a save wipe you lose a bit of progress for people solely interested in exploration there s a pacifist mode where you only get xp from exploring and communing with npc s i prefer the checkpoint system because if i play permadeath i ll inevitably look up high tier builds for my survival instead of making my own personal character the tile based graphics means imagination fills in the gaps certain effects like fire smoke and the little sparkles when you level up look really nice without breaking the spell music and sound design is amazing craig hamilton incorporates sound effects into the music to great effect the overworld theme is my favorite over droning synth and flute there s distant calls and breaths of various animals in the distance most of them likely sentient there s the rhythmic rustling of fabric and beads it all comes together to create an amazing atmosphere for your journey through this world of mutants coexisting with the remains of long dead high tech every location has its own soundscape that elevates the entire experience controls can be a bit daunting at first but after a while it becomes second nature at a certain point you don t even think about it and there s a sense of oneness with your character that s not present in most games instead of thinking press this button to grab or press this to move there you just do the game feels great on keypad
