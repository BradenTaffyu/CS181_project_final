for someone who thought the game would suck i did enjoy playing it the good things 1 unit variety although it needs more i was under the impression that the base game would be like shogun 2 where factions would just have same units with different colored jerseys so i was quite happy there is actually different units available 2 great map designs i love seeing the details of the houses large battle maps and different elevations the settlements are truly wonderful the designs are so beautiful to look at 3 court system legacies local deities traditions all adds to a layer of play style in the campaign you can do politics be a merchant build ancient wonders plan an attack for a siege and more 4 fully customization of campaign rules this one really made me appreciate the game allowing you to do change rules at the start of every campaign and not relying on mods like 0 morale 100 replenishment upkeep cost and so much more you can even adjust some of the settings while playing the campaign like morale upkeep etc 5 removal of victory point timer i hated that an army can capture your city center and win by standing there for 2 mins now it is gone 6 more graphic options they added live preview of changes you make on the graphics settings which makes it easier for you to tweak the options even now allowing you to change arrow trail lengths the settings now is more detailed and comprehensive 7 dynamic weather having 2 weathers in 1 battle is amazing one moment the enemy is dominating you with a large number of archers and a sandstorm or a thunderstorm comes in the middle of the battle and the tide suddenly change to your favor it adds opportunities for strategies 8 new unit commands i have been waiting since empire for them to add more unit actions in battles and though it is not much they added advance formation retreat and other stances which made battles more interesting 9 outposts gives more area in the map to attack and defend and gives bonuses it also makes the map populated instead of seeing a large area of no structures 10 photo mode changing weather this new feature is amazing allowing you to change the weather lighting and time of day is so much fun there were times i wanted to just play on a bright sunny noon to see all details and others when i change it to night so the vibe would be different or changing it to rain to feel the struggle of the men fighting 11 more battle map area type effects being in the trees really help you counter mounted units or arrow fires mud slows down and hinders fighting abilities of heavier units and much more 12 useful victory point bonuses armor repair stamina recovery hit point replenishment the bad things 1 same old ai now with the advent of ai and chatgpt i hope they can improve the battle ai so it acts like a human with actual strategies on the map 2 not a popular time period or faction3 no naval battles4 no cavalry which was saved by mods 5 faction unit variety is more than expected but not enough yet due to the location and scale of the campaign map we only get similar culture of people a theme weakness what i want to see in the future 1 more unit commands sadly because of the same game engine being used we are trapped with no new features in battles when the new engine comes out i want to see more unit commands that do something else like the advance and retreat features in pharaoh and more of that moving forward and more formations 2 more dynamic siege battles like archers resupplying in battle they could add a victory point in siege battles that resupply ammos return the oil in the gates or throwing rocks to climbers make the siege battles more organic with how the units interact with the walls and not look like robots on the battlements or in ladders 2 level siege battles also are fun where you could retreat to a second defense 3 street house battles they should add the feature in empire where soldiers could go into houses and apply it to future games there should be new animation and commands to fight in houses around them and in the narrow paths 4 no more unit blobbing unit blobbing kills the vibe it is so unnatural soldiers should have spaces between them especially those waiting at the back and make them react to whats happening around them archers flanks a unit and the unit stays looking the other way while being shot at 5 more battle and kill animations6 cavalry fights when cavalry fights they should be constantly moving and not stand around like melee units do it s like a series of jousting where cavalry would circle and run before hitting another person in a horse atleast 50 of the units should do that 7 2 turn 2 level siege battles imagine having 2 turn siege battles when you breach the first wall and the enemy routes the 1st battle will end and you need to wait another turn to attack the inner walls this will add another layer to major city battles and also give enemy or yourself another turn to send in reinforcements i m a rome i total war fan and stopped playing after warhammer i i was waiting for the return of historical titles but when britannia came out there was a lot of bad reviews that i did not even bother playing it next news for me was troy total war and also came with a bad review it did come out free so i was able to get my hands on it but did not actually play it until a month ago and finished it it was a decent game especially after the mods saved it now with pharaoh it is the same again nobody was happy since fans are waiting for a medieval iii or empire ii release after the fantasy genre but after troy i needed a new game so i tried it it might not be ground breaking but i like the game it s new features of course the mods have to save it again and although it might not be historically accurate but the cavalry mod is a must on pharaoh it adds cavalry units to the game and you get to enjoy it like medieval
