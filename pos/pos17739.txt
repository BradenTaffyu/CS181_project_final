overall i think the game is a fun title i think that there could be some improvements to it but it s a solid title however i only purchased the game after it dropped down to 40 usd and i think that is the appropriate price point for this game it feels like a saga title not a full 60 usd title fun to play but not a 60 usd game in my opinion i love the total war series i ve been playing since rome total war thanks for another good product ca and please keep being reasonable when it comes to dlc content and price points we long time supporters of the community want you to succeed not fall apart we just have been disappointed lately with what is likely executive level decisions on price points and content delivered i hope you continue to listen to your community and meet our expectations so that this game franchise doesn t die i don t want to see ca fail i want to see you succeed and create a positive environment that benefits both the game creators and the community
