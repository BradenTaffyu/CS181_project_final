2017 this is the story of the united nations of earth star empire and how they conquered the galaxy my empire begun life in a small section of the galaxy named sol after a few years of scanning the stars and exploring neighbouring systems i meet a new friendly race we trade minerals and energy credits and all is well shortly after a fallen empire emerges and demands that we both stop expanding our territories we form a pact against this new menace however even with our combined strength their power is still 100x that of ours a lesson we painfully learned when the fallen empire declared war on us and decimated our systems this pattern goes on for several decades every few years declaring war on us and slapping us around to make sure we knew our place all the while a new power comprised of some very ugly looking aliens is emerging on the far side of the galaxy gaining systems planets and resources and is not close enough to the fallen empire to be deemed a threat which will be their undoing several decades go by new races pop up and greet or insult us we trade we form pacts we break pacts until the emerging power on the far side of the galaxy is now getting close to the fallen empire this causes border friction and they begin trading insults until eventually war breaks out between them they trade blows off and on for several decades this gives me and my friend time to colonise some planets and gain some power eventually the ugly aliens crush the fallen empire down to just two planets at which point their war ends this is where it gets interesting for whatever reason the fallen empire contats me and tells me that i m ugly and one of the great accidents of the universe again he was probably still bitter about the border friction i ve deicded i ve had enough and i send my fleet into his space i destroy what s left of his infrastructure and land a dozen armies on his planet to capture it i win the war and effectively wipe him off the map although their territory was immediately taken by the ugly aliens who now control 1 3 of the galaxy getting worried i decide to keep away from them and build up my own forces expanding away from them for a few decades during this time they are getting closer to my border and they decide to intergrate my neighbour into their empire my neighbour is no more i am alone no sooner than i realise this do i get a transmission a race not too far away from me let s call them the very ugly aliens they contact me and accuse me of being the ugly one despite them having more than 1 nose and sounding like a warthog they don t like me getting close to their borders either every few years they randomly throw insults at me reminding me that my race is doomed how ugly i am or that i should never have existed they aren t a threat though as their fleet power is inferior to mine so i let him get on with it for decades i research the best in weapons and shields technology that i can slowly building up my forces i have a sizable fleet when suddenly a vast amount of large objects enter the outer rim of the galaxy it takes a few weeks for reports to start coming in and it appears it s an invasion force some to purge all life from the galaxy they enter the space of the very ugly aliens and begin their purge being the nice neighbour that i am i decide to help out and my fleet gets crushed in the process the invasion force make the mistake of scattering their fleet across several empires this makes each force easier to deal with and as a galaxy we manage to fend them off the united nations of earth get the final blow and we save the galaxy although this victory impresses the galaxy and carries some weight with them it doesn t stop them insinuating that humans wear clothes to hide their ugly bodies the usual trade of insults continue two new planets emerge from the very ugly aliens and immediately ask for my protection which i gave i now have two small allies several years go by with little activity other than me building my huge fleet since my fleet is getting so large i m running out of power so i decide to build a dyson sphere around a star this takes decades but gives me enough power to run any sized fleet i want i also decide to build the largest sensor array ever seen which gives me complete coverage of the entire galaxy i know where every fleet is at every time at this point the original ugly aliens now control 50 of the galaxy space they are getting too big and must be stopped they used to be my friends but have now started trading insults with me due to border friction and have closed their borders we declare each other as rivals ugly two nosed warthog aliens are still throwing insults at me and i decide it s time to shut them up i declare war although i made the mistake of not checking who they were allied with it was ugly alien 1 who own 50 of the galaxy and i onwn about 20 their fleet power is overwhelming compared to mine i don t stand a chance using my new sensor array i could track their fleets anywhere they went a direction confrontation would be fatal to me so i fall back on good tactics i play the cat and mouse game hitting their space ports destroying their mining stations then moving onto the next sector they decide instead of chasing me to bomb earth back to the stone age they take control of earth and alpha centuri and move on as they move off i swoop back in and regain control of them i hit their landing parties and small fleets while their larger fleets are attacking other targets i bomb several of his planets and land my armies on there i now controll several of his planets and my fleets hide in wait he comes back to try and regain control of his planet again by this point his fleets are scattered between attacking my sectors and reclaiming his own my fleet jumps back into his sector and picks off his smaller fleet then jumps back out during this time all my shipyards and churning out destroyers which immediately come to join my travelling fleet which just keeps getting bigger and bigger after several years of hit and run attacks his fleets and dwindling and i receive a transmission come now human let us end this war before it gets out of control hmmm nope i don t think so he didnt even offer a consession screen off i continue my assault for a few more years he keeps begging for mercy and offering me planets in the hope i ll stop but i refuse eventually he surrenders and gives me several planets that i originally wanted his fleet is now mostly destroy warthog aliens are mostly destroyed and i have taken control of at least 10 of their territory they have no way to come back from this and no one else is strong enough to take on my empire it is only a matter of time before the whole galaxy is mine
