2020 early access review normally i would refrain from making any reviews especially early access but this is a special one other reviews have mentioned the pros and cons but none of them have mentioned that for the last 10 days by the time i am writing this the game have updated 10 times even on the weekends as i remember which i am very much surprised which means this is much much better than any early access out there while this means that mods are not stable just yet this does mean that the devs are actually really paying attention to their game and not making plans for other endeavors such as microtransactions or obscure dlcs don t buy if you want minimal bugs buy if you want to support the game and the devs
