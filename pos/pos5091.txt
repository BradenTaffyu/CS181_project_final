2015 took me 150 hours to complete the story the rest doing side missions and exploring the world my favorite game of 2015 without a doubt i could give this game a thumbs down because of the new dialoge system and a few other flaws however this game improves on almost everything else from the previous games while also adding new things like the base building system that i really enjoy can t wait for the dlc s and g e c k a must buy imo 9 10
