2016 i have been looking forward to this game for about 3 years because i ve been dying for a harvest moon type game on the pc and stardew valley has absolutely met my expectations i rarely ever buy a game on full price on steam and this is one of the few i have bought on release stardew valley is essentially a really addicting farm simulator game on building and expanding your farm that you inherited from your grandfather it also offers a very fun and challenging fishing minigame that takes a while to get used to a fun mining and combat system of trying to reach all the way to the bottom of the mine for loot and treasure while fighting a good variety of monsters along the way the social aspects are also great you can become friends with the people in the town and may even marry someone and have children this game will provide hours and hours of fun and will keep you saying just one more day
