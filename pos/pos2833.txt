2017 an adventure if i had to describe divinity original sin 2 in a word that would be it an adventure without a doubt it s the best modern crpg game up to date and as an oldschool gamer i can understand when someone is saying that nothing can stand in one line with games like planescape torment or baldur s gate well it couldn t until now times changing and so gaming industry is changing and we have just received the best most polished crpg game ever made it has to be said even if we are sentimental the world of divinity original sin 2 is full of content and what s the best we can interact with almost everything and everyone there are no boring npc s with exactly the same dialogue lines in this game everyone is unique and has something to say also we are talking here about huge crpg game that is fully voice acted and it s not oblivion like voice acting with 5 actors the main narrator who is with us most of the time and all the other voice actors did an outstanding job here every character sounds special if you have played first original sin you know what to expect from fights they can be approached in many different ways even in tough fights one properly used scroll or skill can change everything of course in both ways because we can easily lose the fights are hard made to think in strategic ways and what s the most important they are very satisfying comparing to other crpg games it s one of the best parts of divinity it took me roughly 105 hours to finish the game once so it can be said that divinity original sin 2 is one of the biggest crpg games what s more this game has high replayability value every character has its own personality and its own origin story by playing with different characters we have new quests and we can approach many situations in totally different way origin characters have their own interactions across whole game the main story is interesting and i have never lost my interest i don t want to spoil anything but it s just really good piece of writing side quests are keeping high level as well same as in first original sin we also receive minimal amount of help in all the quests we have to think search and read just like in real crpg game i have completed this game few days ago and to be honest i can t wait to play it again i am thinking about new characters and about making different decisions in several points of the game it s something amazing there are many huge games like the witcher 3 or fallout 4 that can give you 100 hours of actual playtime but those are mostly single experience games you are not playing them again there is something different in divinity that make you want to play it again more and more in civilization series we are saying about one more turn syndrome here we have one more hour one more evening and one more day syndrome there are no perfect 10 10 games and there is no difference here the game is quite fresh so there are still bugs i haven t experienced any gamebreaking bug though but there are many small things that for sure will be fixed in the future what s more the final act and final battle are both the weakest parts of the game you can feel that devs were in hurry here but on the other side whole game is so good that this rushed ending won t outshine beautiful interesting and so carefully designed game it simply can t divinity original sin 2 is in my humble opinion the best game of year 2017 let s just hope we will see more crpg s like this in the future obsidian we are looking at you do yourself a favour and buy this game it will be the best 100 hours you can have as a gamer and for this price that is not even close to the other aaa titles with unhealthy dlc policy it s a steal whoop we ve got quite a long review here enjoy the game 9 10edit found typo
