the review from the casual dad i did 1 play through i will go from good to bad because that s how i want to do this so deal with it the good immersion so 40k is older then most of your parents safeguarded and has more stories then your vietnam veteran grandfather some previous titles give you drops into the lore but it spans many titles looking at you dawn of war this i would argue gives you a wide brush stroke of most things in play in 40k universe not named space marines also a lot of the lore comes in naturally flowing aspects so its learned in a smooth manner ive known a middling amount of 40k but after this i know a little about a lot highly recommend this game to anyone wanting an all inclusive rapid fire involvement of most things 40k also left out the nid s story manipulation this game i think shines because you can manipulate the story alot from murdering allies killing random plot characters you are not bound to 3 story choices that all lead to the same destination i cut a few quest lines off because they weren t in his image there is a lot that can change whether you stay in his image or you decide to be a filthy heretic combat combat feels very simple to understand its not a game where 90 of the combat happens on a calculator with complex things the game lays out where all the numbers come from things are pretty straight foward with bullets effect flesh energy effects metals and bonk bonks leveling this happens very often in this game theres quite a bit of choices in early game it seems to matter towards the end your almost just collecting skills you balked on but each class had its own playstyle and it was distinctive which i enjoyed a lot where it turns and what you read reviews for the quintessential drip is very limited as wearable things goes weapons is a slightly different story when a 200 lb heavy bolter is on your back regardless of the clothing or armor it defaults to class esk things level design some of these felt really hollow or extremely laden with traps theres a few levels where its move 2 feet spot 2 4 traps rinse and repeat 5 10 times and some of them you can t really get to so you eat the hit a few levels had some fun layouts while others felt re used all in all its not bad it was just left wanting more with most of them being rather small bit of a disappointment choices there is a lot of choices with impacts at various points of the game which i did enjoy the game also makes it apparent when these things occur which is nice yet some of the effects if not most of them feel very minor only when you hit the end of a chapter do you get a summary of your decisions with big outcomes gameplay the game starts off very smooth and crisp honestly loved it at the beginning however before the end of chapter 2 which is where a bulk of your gameplay is it deteriorates at first it is subtle slightly longer load times camera errors things of that sort towards middle of chapter 3 every enemy killed sent my camera across the expanse or killing an enemy caused a weird 1 5 minute pause that i was unable to do anything and then the game caught up at first it was very negligible but after awhile it started to really rear its head and was very distracting from gameplay camera from my perspective it is atrocious in this game tall structures block views in nooks and crannies your unable to view whats there when holding tab lets you know something is there very frustrating at times could have been much better story this is kind of a dig for me because the story felt like 3 4 dnd campaigns meshed into one well rogue trader is a table top dnd esk game right but its not clear what were really doing in the game and chapter 5 is basically a standalone story its nice because there isn t a predictability to it i suppose but spending the whole game trying to understand whats our big mission or goal and finishing it going huh for me it was across the board covering a lot but not really giving any part a lot of time it felt like a guided tour into a lot of different things not really spending a lot of time in any particular spot good for immersion a hit on story development for me like how the game begins has zero endgame translation conclusion rogue trader is a b 6 5 10 3 5 stars pick your metric its simple in its systems gives a smattering of 40k lore and such its polished up front and gets progressively rougher a great value pickup if your seeking to learn about the brand not a full value purchase as some parts are underdeveloped or a bit to simplistic the later leveling stages being just a collect lower tier abilities you didn t pick up also a knock future dlc could be interesting but not a pickup i m interested in buy it on 25 sale and you wont be disappointed
