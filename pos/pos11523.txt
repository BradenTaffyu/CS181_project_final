2017 early access review i wish i could say oh yeah i ve played this game for 500 hrs and i m a pro or whatever but that s not what this review is here are my thoughts after binging this game for some hours with my friend 1 what a world so many challenges so many things to learn so much planning to be had if you re not thinking about day 7 on day 1 then you re wrong there s an underlying sense of humor to the world but a gritty realism as well you ll have to forge iron like an ancient celt and you ll also kill morbidly obese tourists in hawaiian shirts you ll enter a genuninely unsettling scorched earth biome akin to silent hill with burning zombies and you ll encounter undead lumberjacks in the snow you ll build a small gas powered bike from scratch and the book to build it is called minibikes for what a game 2 play with friends it s a great exercise in teamwork and it s a huge challenge during hordes especially if you ve changed the difficulty and added more zombies per person build your base together specialize in different skill sets make the best defenses try not to die as stated previously tutorials are key to getting better at this game learn as much as you can 3 the combat feels pretty good to me and it s really satisfying to smash zombies with spiked clubs getting a foot away from a zombie and making their head explode is deliciously enjoyable conversely enemies are always a threat and getting attacked by one with your pants down is potentially damning be careful use a belt aiming is lacking particularly with the bow you ll miss headshots half the time which really blows because it s such a fundamentally important weapon the guns are fun and it carries a special sense of accomplishment to create bullets and maintain your weapons i wish there were more though specifically more variety and more attachments it s really cool though that i can stick my flashlight on my gun it should probably require duct tape but it doesn t 4 as for bugs there aren t too many to make me stay away if you drop items sometimes they fall though the ground sometimes a zombie can glitch through iron bars sometimes zombies spawn in places you ve recently been loot a building kill zombies inside come back boom there are more weather can be finnicky esp in random gen levels and sometimes the terrain does insane things like spawn traders on personal plateaus or create highways that look more like the great wall but it s cool because it s still in development graphics aren t stellar but it doesn t bother me and they definitely aren t bad you like minecraft right this is the zombie mod minecraft never had the music and sound effects are excellent and i wish there were more the next update is on the way and holy crap there s a zombie that s as big as a house good luck buy it buy it for your friends in bulk it s cheaper give it some space let it grow believe in it this game is going to be something even more impressive than it already is many many lubs are had thumbs up
