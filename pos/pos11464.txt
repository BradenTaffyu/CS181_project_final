2017 early access review after playing about 400 hours since the beginning of a15 i think this is a good time for me to finally write a review of this game the game is incredibly interesting and introduced a whole new style of survival game base building crafting scavenging and zombies the game has it draws for me it was the idea of base building introduced with zombies but i can now appreciate all the other assets this game has in it the beginning is pretty standard they give you preloaded quests that help you navigate the basics of the game to figure out what is important tools weapons bedroll armor etc and shows you where the nearest trader is to your current position sell items in return for coins that can be used to buy better items or items exclusive to traders after completing these starting quests the game lets go of your hand and you re not on your own or with a few friends as i prefer the posibilities are endless to what you can do from here if you want to be a hunter go out and hunter for animals to find better food and increase your survivability if you want to be a scavenger go out and raid nearby towns of the goodies people have left behind in the zombie outbreak if you want to be a base builder harvest wood and stone to fortify your defenses to protect you and your friends from the zombies that happen to be passing by if you want to be a farmer find seeds and crops all around the world to build your farm if you want to harvest materials grab a stone axe shovel and chop down trees dig into the dirt harvest stone iron lead etc if you just want to eliminate the zombies take a trusty knife and crossbow and go out into the world to kill them all if you want to be a jack of all trades do everything listed above be careful though because the game does progress quickly in terms of difficulty by the time the night of day 7 and every multiple of 7 arrives you better be ready to fight your heart out to protect your base and the many treasures you have collected from the horde of zombies coming right for you if this all appeals to you i highly suggest playing this game if you re still a little uneasy about it being in ea and want to see what the next patch brings wait however i recommend this game to everyone and anyone who enjoys survival zombie crafting games the community is top notch in helping people out and banding together on small dedicated servers or huge pvp servers good luck happy hunting and most of all survive
