2018 rome total war 2 is it a good game yes yes it is i ve been a fan of the total war series since medieval total war came out and its wonderful to see how far the games have come please work on the ai the gameplay is better the graphics are night and day different the diplomacy is not as broken and useless the battles are bigger and better than ever however we arent upset with creative assembly because women are in the game they were in the game since march and if the reviews are anything to go off of we were fine with it then we became upset when ca community manager ella attacked your customers and consumers the game is fine its good its playable while female generals from my recollection in history were here and there so to be frank yes women in ancient warfare is historically accurate but the issue is when a business executes poor customer service to its paying customers that is when the paying customers take issue and thats with any business with that being said should you buy this game on sale sure is it worth your time i ve sunk over 175 hours in it so yes i d say so would it be nice to get an appology from ca absolutely defending your actions is fine if you use historical facts and logic to back up the decisions you have made for your game finding that wiki article on ancient women in combat took all of 5 seconds but to flat out tell your customers mod it out or dont play that is unacceptable customer service be apart of the solution by having an actual dialogue with your points and be respectful to the other person instead of flat out insulting them don t abuse your power and position just because you have it to shut down something you disagree with dialogue solves problems before they start and blow up resulting in damaged customer relations and possible decline in future sales
