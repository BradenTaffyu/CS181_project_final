2017 hearts of iron 4 where to start well i guess so apparently something like 40 of players roll the german reich now i m all about some thousand year reich every now and then but i can t help but wonder what that says about the player base anyway i freakin love this game if you want a really good game dont take the bait you dont need the military might of the reich to have fun although it is pretty satisfying to watch your panzer divsions roll through belgium and france in less than six weeks personally the best time i ve had here is taking australia wrecking up the japanese in china then making safe north africa from the predations of the faulty italians and the ever efficacious germans or be the japanese roll over the us navy and make good your plans of invading mainland us equally i ve had a damn fine time invading the usa maybe there s a theme emerging here and subsequently mainland britain as fascist canada which is entirely possible by the by i m a big alternate history nut so going fascist as the russian empire going democratic as the republic of germany etc really gets me going and all of that is possible too look basically if you have any slight interest in world war two or any of the politcal implcations relating to such this is the game for you there s a lot of talk about ai etc but damn it i ve had a lot of fun with this game and i ve lost a lot of hours to it where i should probably have been doing something constructive with my life all i can say to you is this dopn t play this game just before bed because one of two things will happen 1 you ll still be awake fighting the ussr at 0300 in the morning or 2 you ll go to bed and roll around planning your next tactical maneouvres until 0300 i really want to have an input on the mods for this game too let me say with a quick shout out to these two mods and no i m not endorsed kaiserreich and the great war mods are flippen ace there s just so much talent out there working to make every new game of hoi4 a fun and different experience not to mention the dedication of the develpoers paradox themselves who tirelessly and lovingly update and release new content to keep the game fresh and exciting going back to some of my favourite times on this game rolling austria hungary and being a competent ally to the german empire in the great war is awesome fun i really need to mention the multiplayer as well ever though that you could have done better than the allies or the axis or thought the balkan states could have been bigger players in the era ever thought that brazil argentinia and venezuela should have had an impact on the world stage well holy moly get your bestest buds together and make that happen tl dr this game is good really good as long as you have an interest in the war itself or any passing interest in alternate history yes its has issues but doesn t every game at least paradox are well reknowned for staying with thier titles and expanding imprivng them can t go far wrong with this as far as i m concerned the modding community alone is utterly ace and well done to all of them damn fine effort what are you waiting for end your foolish appeasment and get your war on
