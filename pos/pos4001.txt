2019 i am generally not a big fan of card games because luck is most often the deciding factor in them and so it is also here but there are many solid mechanics that lessen the randomness and make it enjoyable you can plan builds and be tactical with your card purchases so you get a strong deck that can beat the boss of course it is also a rougelike you will die but that s part of it you can have a strategy and get better with every run it is also addicting in a good way there are no in game purchases or other such garbage that is common in so many other card games this is one of the best games that went through early access and the developers made good updates introducing two new characters with new cards and gameplay mechanics and also further balancing the game they are currently working on a fourth character they also interact really well with the players featuring artwork and being active in the discussions there is much to love with this game i saw myself coming back time and time again i recommend it for everyone
