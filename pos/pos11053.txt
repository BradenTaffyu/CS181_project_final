2023 i feel like i am doing you all a disservice by not rating this yet so here we go my personal thoughts why did i wait so long to get this since my review i have played an additional 100 hours and i m just as obsessed with this game as i was 50 hours in still very recommended i won t lie i put off buying this since it came out because i hate management games when you get to a certain point you re constantly restocking in this game you actually have many upgrade opinions for a lot of the operation buildings which makes life so much easier because i want to build my dream park and take care of my dinos we will get to the dinos in a second pause pause your game i mean it you are paying your scientists every minute are you building an enclosure pause placing roads and buildings pause are you adding tasks to your rangers medical or capture teams pause example the t rex broke out of his enclosure pause the game immediately capture team to the dino to make him go to bed the rangers to the fence to fix it hit play wait until the fence is fixed before transporting the t rex back inside it s enclosure the t rex will be down for at least 8 minutes before you need to start panicking i am not a fan of the amenities but only because you may have to constantly don t quote me exactly on this configure the drinks food shopping to what your guests what which appears to change throughout playing when i say configure there are four areas guests are into general adventure nature and luxury the areas i mentioned above are also available in other ways like hotels dinosaur count variety comfort infamy multiple tours viewing galleries and more it will make more sense when you get into the game and look at your park rating building is pretty great there are tools that help you see where the overcrowded paths are and areas that need the various amenity shops bathroom or a shelter the fences are multiple clicks you can t just click where you want it to start and where you want it to end but measuring by full fence length is a great way to measure the size of your enclosures a few guides even do this apparently haha aviaries flying dinos and lagoons water dinos ahh are dome shaped and attach to each other so if you want to make the most of your space think ahead i ve spent a lot of time moving them around building is not immediate buildings and fences take time to actually build like 3 mins or less nothing big but big when you are replacing fences for enclosures so make those dinos go to bed or you are screwed learn from my mistake research building upgrades dinosaur dna colors dinosaur enclosure upgrades operate your vehicles fly that helicopter and shoot a dart at that dinosaur drive the ranger explorer and perform status checks drive the medical van and perform scans and dart the dinos with medicine just operate them for the sake of fun watch the people on the paths jump out of the way or possibly get run over take pictures of dinos and get paid dinos guys they are so real so frightening so cool i am in equal parts awe and fear i get excited when i see my pals from long before time but you better believe i get the absolute tremors when those t rexs and the like break out of their enclosures bravo on the graphics animations and sounds dinos you can hatch your own dinos in the various hatcheries here you can alter their dna you can give them traits for good or bad and change how they look the colors are pretty amazing if i do say so i set it on random and enjoy if you release them into the hatchery you will get a cool cutscene closeup of their release don t miss out on this amazing feature dinos they have other dinos they like dislike you use that information as you will create massive enclosures with multiple dinos living together in peace or not so there are multiple ways to start playing right off the main menu without buying dlcs think of the main menu as multiple launch boxes there are two different story options and two modes the first story is the campaign and the second is chaos theory you visit the beloved parks of the jurassic universe so enjoy yourself you can restart at any point too if you want to in the campaign i think they gave me money when i ran out haha but in chaos theory i had to restart rip the modes are sandbox and challenge i have not played challenge yet at this point but i ll get there don t judge me there s a massive dino fish for the icon pic and i am scared haha now sandbox oh my dinosaurs the setting opinions available for this mode are insane first pick your map to build on these are unlocked by completing the stories and the challenge mode then you are brought to the settings menu there are the basic settings along with dinosaurs gameplay park and environment you can truly create the jurassic environment of your dreams want it ridiculously easy and peaceful no problem want it ridiculously hard and a dinosaur war zone challenge accepted there is a data base that keeps track of everything you ve unlocked dinosaurs paleontology buildings jurassic universe aliments and paleobotany lots of information and interesting reads the creators were amazing enough to include a species viewer once you ve unlocked a dinosaur you can come here and view them in 3d you can see them in the various colors and patterns you can see their six different animations it s pretty cool being able to see them so up close and in great detail a lot of time and effort went into this amazing feature and i highly recommend checking it out this is my review of jurassic world evolution 2 i hope it gave you some insight into the actual game itself and helped you decide if this game is for you i wish i had not waited so long to get this game it s still enjoyable even if you don t like management games
