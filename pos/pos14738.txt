2019 so i have not played any of the civilization games before i got this game some time ago and ever since i have had quite alot of fun i love the interface the map graphics are quite nice to look at when all of your cities are close together and well developed the games mechanics work well i have not run into many bugs i love the customization options available and the different leaders the only qualm i have is the ai its pretty bad it does not have the intelligence or development to stand toe to toe with a player and most are just pushovers the devs decision was to simply give them cheats and not make them any smarter overall id give the game an 8 5 10
