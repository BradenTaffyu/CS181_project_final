2019 i will be honest with you i don t know why i like this game and i like it a lot it s a sandbox with a lot of repetitive tasks i thought i would get bored of them quite soon i didn t i just wanted to keep playing and playing must be something about building your own empire your own way making your own loose story because as repetitive as some of the things seem it s not like skyrim s repetitive quests which are basically meaningless you get some little money out of them but there is basically no point to them here with every battle won with every city taken you move along your plan you are one step closer to being the emperor or being whatever you want really it doesn t happen often a game gives me this many hours of enjoyment highly recommend
