2017 update this is by far the best souls game compared to any ohter such games that fromsoft has made my ranking goes as follows dark souls 3 bloodborne dark souls 1 sekiro elden ring demon souls dark souls 2i recently finished bloodborne and it comes very close to dark souls but it is not euql to it because of just one thing non replenishable health regen items i mean i want to enjoy the boss battle not take a detour to farm for blood vials to heal myself the only drawback of dark souls 3 is the run up to the boss which is somewhat tedious and time taking i love the game so much that despite having completed the game on pc sometime in 2017 i bought the game again for my newly purchased ps5 review as on 2017 this was my first ever souls game on killing the first enemy not the boss i kind of felt is this the game that seemed to be so difficult upon encountering the first boss this game was not meant for me now having beaten this game i wanna play the entire series p s game content intended for matured players not for weak hearted and patientless people if you are reading this then dont forget to praise the sun
