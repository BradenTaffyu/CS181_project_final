2021 when i was younger back in 2016 i think i had seen videos of people playing the original tabs and i instantly loved it i had always wanted to get the game but i had never known how so when this new version of tabs came out early alpha i was old enough to figure out how to finally get the game i remember that i had gone to target and bought a steam gift card it was the only way i knew how to buy the game at the time and downloaded steam for the single purpose of getting tabs now over a year and four months later i have gotten some other games on steam but tabs has always been my absolute favorite and is the single most played game which i own with that time being over 300 hours what can i say i just really like the game to anyone who reads this and doesn t own the game i recommend that you at least watch some youtubers play tabs first and see whether or not the game is your cup of tea if it is then i sincerely hope you enjoy the game as much as i do and have fun
