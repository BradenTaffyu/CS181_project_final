2019 great historical game i don t care for the pricing system either i feel as though paradox has thrown away a lot of good will by it i say that you should make the decision to buy it yourself i personally think that there are a lot of valid criticisms but they allow vitriol into otherwise reasonable complaints and let their emotions and just bad attitude color their logic in their reviews in short there is much which could be improved it would be nice for instance to have the number and factors affecting gameplay to be more available and accessible but if you like grand strategy games and studying history i think that it s fair to say you ll still have a great time best wishes
