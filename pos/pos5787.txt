big thanks to taleworlds because nobody else is making the digital crack called mount blade one of the most addicting game series ever strategy games are cool and all but why play pure rts when you can combine it with 1st or 3rd person action and command your troops in person while ploughing through a line of archers on your heavily armored steed or being among the first up the ladders when conquering a variety of picturesque castles and cities bannerlord is what the fans know and love with classic m b vanilla warband but simply puts it in a modern coat of paint and polishes the rough edges a bit there are still issues like diplomacy being basic some of which can be remedied with modding the modding selection isn t as amazing yet as it is for warband especially when it comes to gigantic overhaul mods but once taleworlds puts the final stamp on the game hopefully the modding scene will flourish as it once did but even unmodded you can have hundreds of hours of fun with bannerlord i d recommend playing vanilla first anyway to get a sense of what you d want to modify to begin with
