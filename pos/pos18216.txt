early access review there are a lot of early access city builders out there many with a unique idea but not much else is fleshed out or replayable this is different it s a solid foundation which can grow into an amazing game personally i hope the dev can add engaging sieges with town walls etc the current manor castle system is rather bare bones you will also find a surprisingly big amount of empty ui options still under development and the ai opponent is off map without building his own cities also no campaign not sure there ever will be it took 4 years to get here it will surely take several more years to finish at the moment we have a very pretty relaxing city town builder with optional raids in a few years we may have a vastly improved stronghold replacement time will tell feedback give us proper town walls higher city levels and a way to salvage a 50 rep town with no population left let the bandits take over or something instead of permanent wasteland good luck greg
