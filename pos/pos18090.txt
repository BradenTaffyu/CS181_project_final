2018 don t expect this game to be as good as the first rome total war it s not the politics army recruting city management technological research and pretty much everything else are simplistic the battles fought on the battlefield are quite realistic the blood the fight animations and the corpses on the ground are quite good if you re running the game with highest graphics of course there re some controversies about the presence of female generals in some factions because it was only implemented in the latest updade of the game in 2018 and suspiciously this update seems to have been made for the sake of left politics such as feminism instead of historical accuracy if it s the case then it s a very stupid update to make for a game that has nothing to do with modern days plus any attempt to rewrite history is wrong so obviously those game s history lessons aren t to be taken seriously but despite all that it s a fun game
