2014 early access review had it a while before it came on steam one of the best game s i have ever played so much fun 98 100 if it were a potato it would be a smashed up awesome potato dserious review edit as of today 29 05 2015 a huge leap in beamng drive launch of early access on steam a huge update adding tons of fixes new modes and much more there is very little reason for me not to rate this up and for you not to buy the game the graphics may not be project cars but like i have said before graphics do not make a good game that aside they still look visually stunning the physics of this game are great for both the casual racer and the enthusiast works with most wheels i use a g25 and some days i boot this up go for a drive along some coast and take some screenshot listening to some music other times im rallying down or up a mountain in a sports car hours of fun smashing a car up or racing so much to do for a car game i truely can t recommened this enough there is so many reasons to buy this game you will enjoy 10 10 worth every penny
