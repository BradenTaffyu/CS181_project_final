despite having the worst launch of a game i ve ever been there to see the game is actually getting better now i d wait about another year if you were thinking of buying but as the game creates more build identities and slowly returns to its roots this will be a good successor to the masterpiece that is payday 2 edit turns out that all the problems got fixed far quicker than i was expecting this game is awesome and the new skill lines and weapons constantly deliver fun new buildcrafting opportunities can highly recommend
