2018 i ve been playing civilization since the first one came out in the early 90 s each and every one of them had their pros and cons but the one thing that civilization has always maintained is that one more turn mentality i ve put hundreds of hours into each one i ve read that a lot of people trash this one due to its cartoonish graphics and lack of realism civ v brought most people forgot that civ v was a broken mess when it first came out too it took two expansions for the game to finally feel complete and become the series standard civ vi certainly has had some growing pains the rise and fall expansion did a lot to fix some issues and yeah the ai especially in the diplomacy area still needs some work but is the game playable absolutely i typically don t play online so i can t honestly judge how this game holds up in the multiplayer arena but after putting nearly 200 hours into the single player campaign i can tell you i still enjoy that classic civ gameplay and the city planning system civ vi brings to the table is a great addition it allows for the specialization of cities some being industrial some being scientific some being religious and some being financial it makes sense and the adjacency bonuses make sense too aka building an industrial zone next to a harbor for more production etc the one area where i have to give super high marks for this game is the soundtrack as a music fan i think what they did here with the music is clever every civ has a theme and as you progress thru the eras that theme gets built upon until in the information era you are blessed with completely evolved theme song for your civ my personal favorites are the themes for greece america scotland japan and england the soundtrack is phenomenal is it as good as civ v i think they both have their merits but vi is still a very entertaining game to play and i wouldn t be surprised to see another expansion come out soon that will address other concerns such as the ai diplomacy just one more turn
