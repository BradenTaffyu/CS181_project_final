2022 early access review the first time i played was with a friend we started out starving depressed without a car i got bit i picked the resilient trait i could not find bleach so instead i popped pills and drank alcohol i took my bandages off and ran around naked trying to die it took far too long that was just the beginning of the story multiple playthroughs later some with a few panicked scream sessions at one another we re going on suicide missions to kill hundreds of zombies at a time our characters with the same positive and negative kinds of traits as us cough self destructive cough this has been my absolute favourite game the past few months ever get bored this game has a very active modding community to give you any kind of challenge you don t want but most importantly the developers are actively working on the game i have faith that i will see this game finished one day unlike many other early access games
