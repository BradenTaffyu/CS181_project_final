2017 early access review an amazing game i have had a lot of fun while playing it with my friend the story is intriguing i love the narrative it s very beautiful and eloquent and it will be officially out soon i m so excited and can t wait for it though unfortunately since i m not a native english speaker and i m not good at english enough yet i still have to look up the definition of every word which i don t know with my phone in hand always i have to say it s a great way for me to study english probably but only when i play it alone it s still kind annoying when i want to play this game with friends since looking up the words would waste a lot of time and i don t want my friend to wait for me always plus there are many other chinese players who are very interested in this game but most of them are lack of english it s impossible for them to enjoy this game without chinese because of this i can t recommend it to my chinese friends even though i love it so much so sincerely wish you can add chinese language one day as soon as possible if you do so i m sure there will be so many chinese players want to buy this game at the end thanks for providing such an amazing game again really love it
