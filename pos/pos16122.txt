2015 early access review i m glad there is a game like this it crams all board games into one very well delivered package what is great is it allows the user to interact with the game as they just about almost would in real life the integration of steam workshop really is icing on the cake as you can just go on and download a huge range of board games people have reworked into the game like magic the gathering takenoko carcassone forbidden island the game however is more of a sandbox where you can tamper with anyone s cards destroy someone s tokens steal someone s dice and flipping the god forsaken table in a fit of uncontrollable rage when a little whiney kid puts you in checkmate it starts you off with checkers cards chinese checkers and all the bog standard tabletop necessities before you soon migrate to the workshop it includes singleplayer for literally just solitaire and the multiplayer which surprisingly doesnt require having to port forward you can just slap a name on your new server slam some assets down on a table and await the arrival of some players hopefully ones of which won t exploit the table flipping mechanic constantly which is the reason 80 of servers are password locked p and just have some fun it also lets you use voice chat and normal text chat to talk to victims of your newly thought up next level plays as a conclusion it saves you a helluva lot of money on board games in one big digital package which is a huge win in itself
