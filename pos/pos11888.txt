2023 early access review brief overview i wish there was a neutral option to select i love ark and i love that they are attempting to remaster it the ui is a lot better the building is better and i am enjoying all of that however my computer is a beast and i experience issues running this game even with everything on its lowest setting the trees and bushes have physics that tank me when i am running around in the woods that i have turned off i chug a lot when i am flying i am lucky that i can 80 play this game in this state because i have a lot of friends who can t gameplay the gameplay itself graphics issues aside is a lot easier now than it was in survival evolved things are easier to find and navigate when i first started playing evolved i didn t even want to because i felt like everything was so difficult to navigate i felt intimidated to even try however i did and eventually things became second nature to me if i was a beginner starting out with this ui i think i would have felt a lot less intimidated when i finally moved to playing ark on pc and was convinced to try out mods from friends all i ever really wanted to add in was s i don t feel like i am having as stressful of a time building in this version and trying to line things up in a way that pleases my organization desires bugs and technical issues this game is so unoptimized right now and i know that they will probably figure it out in time but as of right now it s going to be a huge barrier to people playing on low end computers even with turning your settings all the way down it is still a nightmare my game will be running fine for a little while and then all of a sudden i will hit a wall where i am frozen in the air or in the middle of a compromising situation that i fear for my life in which is not something i want to have to worry about if i am trying to transport a dinosaur all the way across the map or something also i know this isn t a gameplay issue but the way nitrado servers are set up right now is a nightmare user interface and accessibility the ui is 100 the most pleasing change about this game right now textures and visual changes could be up there if they didn t tank your whole system but the ui is a huge improvement that i am happy with ease of access and using visuals to help navigate the ui make it more accessible the thing i am facing the most accessibility issues with right now is server setup there aren t as many options laid out for you to tick and untick things i ve learned a lot about tweaking the game ini on nitrado myself in these past few days but if i hadn t been doing this for over a decade i would probably want to rip my hair out replayability i can play this game fine even with the chugging here and there and i will because i am an ark nerd i ll be playing through all the game s issues i ll be playing through the entire story let s go personal impressions i love ark i ve been playing this game for over a decade with different groups of friends and it s always a good time with lots of laughs and memories i m looking forward to doing it again i d like to experience it with more of my friends though so having it be more optimized would be cool i m hoping in time it will get better i am having my moments though last night i tried to transport 80 crystal halfway across the map on the back of a raptor and i was chugging so much that by the time i got back i was just done for the night i m only putting up with it right now because i can t imagine that it s going to stay that way forever and it s not always that bad conclusion right now i d give it a 6 10 only because i can play it i am having fun and i enjoy how everything looks i m getting back in there learning more and i always love the experience of developing silly little attachments to my dinos but there is definitely a lot that needs to be worked on and i have some friends who can not run multiplayer at all right now so that makes me sad because i want to share the experience with them i am going to give a thumbs up because i think if you can run it and afford it it s worth it to dive in right now and dip your toes into watching as all of this develops however if you know that you will not be able to run this on your system do not try wait it out it s a struggle
