i m currently obsessed with this game obsessed joined the kings army serve as solder mod we marched and marched through the snowy winter realistic weather mod and when our feet were sore we marched some more i hadn t yet realised we were actually marching to war we were heading north to take our lands back from sturgin kingdom the damn sturgians who mercilessly slaughtered our women and children the heathens we started with 200 foot soldiers and about 50 mounted knights when the entire realms army had fully amassed we numbered 1600 souls it was at this moment i knew something was happening the king was keeping this offensive tight lipped at dawn we marched straight into our old lands and besieged the very castle that had been ours only days before the siege was brutal we lost 200 souls to attrition and desertion alone but they weren t keeping us out the defenders numbered only 450 but i wasn t sure of our victory for those walls were tall and it was a long way under a hail of arrows and fire from the catapults it was a slaughter we lost a further 400 men taking that castle i was climbing over the bodies of my fallen comrades this was my first battle i wasn t prepared for the screams some men were burning and some were being thrown from atop the walls the bitter sweet victory was short lived for a massive 2000 strong sturgian army had arrived what did our brazen king order us to do he ordered us to meet them head on in the field this battle was where i took my first life i ll never forget how i drove my spear into his face it felt good but i went down soon after a sturgian warrior with an axe swung it straight into my chest taking me out with one hit the battle raged on but in the end all was lost 800 men died on that field the rest scattered to the wind i survived captured but quickly let go our king however was not so lucky he was taken away and the castle was retaken i returned quickly to the realms capital and enlisted into the kings eldest sons army he would be the next in line after all and we slowly but surely amassed another 1000 strong force with the remaining lords to retake the castle we just lost and hopefully rescue the king we took the castle putting down those sturgian dogs after reclaiming those lands and fighting a few skirmishes here and there we sued for peace and our king was released that war ended on a high note a lot of lives for lines on a map but i know this was only the beginning
