2022 if you re looking for an online sim racing experience where your opponents take the racing seriously then there isn t a single game out there that measures up to iracing sure you can do leagues in other sims but that requires finding one and dedicating a specific time window every single week to participate but in iracing there s always races going on and as you move up in your license classes there s a ton of options to race on a weekly basis the game isn t the most impressive graphically but for me this isn t a bad thing it looks just fine and it being relatively undemanding compared to something like assetto corsa competizione means more people can play there are some things about this game that you should know don t bother playing with a controller if you don t have a wheel and pedals this game is likely not what you re looking for some people will tell you it s doable on a controller and i m sure it is but you are putting yourself at a massive disadvantage by doing so cars in this game do not handle like they do in forza horizon for example you don t need anything crazy i use a logitech g29 clamped to my desk and have no problems with it yes it is subscription based yes even the subscription itself is expensive 13 month at full price with discounts if you renew for longer periods of time up to two years however you can get good discounts as a new player and there are black friday deals on extending your membership and that s pretty much it this sounds like a lot but if this is a game you ll end up playing obsessively like i have for the price of roughly a streaming service subscription it s reasonable yes there s lots of dlc i hesitate to call it dlc necessarily because it isn t really dlc in the traditional sense all cars and tracks in the official rookie license series more on licenses below are included in the subscription everything beyond that is extra usually 15 per track and 12 per car at full price i won t sugarcoat it this is easily the hardest pill to swallow about iracing especially as you re first entering in new series without much extra content it gets expensive fast however it can be mitigated a bit always buy in bulk if you buy six pieces of content at once you get a 15 discount once you ve purchased 40 pieces of content you get a permanent 20 discount on everything you buy after also when you start a new series if you re on a budget i highly recommend focusing on one series for the 12 week season and buying everything you need to complete that series at once it s still pricey but not really more expensive than buying a couple new aaa games at full price you can t just hop in to any old race right away one of the reasons iracing works so well is because you have to prove you can drive safely to advance to faster more difficult series you have a safety rating which is improved by well driving safe and drops when you get into accidents spin out exceed track limits etc more advanced series are locked behind a certain license class and improving your safety rating is how you obtain new licenses and there s a different license for each discipline oval road dirt oval and dirt road this may sound like a bummer at first but it forces people to learn proper racecraft before jumping into really fast cars and ruining a bunch of races still it does take some time to advance to the upper licenses but the racing in the lower license classes is just as good sometimes even better to be honest iracing enforces its rules rather strictly it has a sporting code and if you deliberately violate the sporting code by doing things like intentionally wrecking other drivers you might be protested by others in the race if that protest is upheld you will receive a range of punishments starting from somebody from iracing explaining what you did wrong and how to do it better in the future usually for innocent mistakes like an unsafe rejoin especially in lower classes all the way up to account suspensions be warned if you are coming here to deliberately wreck others you will eventually be banned it sounds harsh but this is how iracing enforces a community where drivers take the races seriously and try to keep it clean that said i have never had a protest upheld against me don t drive like an idiot and this likely never effects you iracing is meant to be a virtual alternative to real life racing professional racecar drivers are known to regularly play such as max verstappen while it is a game at the end of the day and you should have fun it s also meant to be taken at least semi seriously if that s not what you want iracing is likely not the game for you but if you re looking for realistic online racing against drivers roughly your own skill where clean racing is enforced and dirty racing punished iracing is simply unrivaled
