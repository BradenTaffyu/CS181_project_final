2023 i have 336 hours in this game as of writing this review most of the time i spent playing it was a year ago and it s honestly been hard to get back into it however i do have some appreciation of this game now don t get me wrong fallout 76 was a bad game on launch and it still needs a lot of help bugs are still abundant five years after launch although they aren t really game breaking they are immersion breaking also my pc should be able to handle this game but in some locations on the map i can get frame rate drops which tells me that the game still has many optimization problems however through all these problems beneath is a game with potential that bethesda has left untapped i love the setting i ve been to the state of west virginia many times and seeing this virtual version of it is so cool the game world is beautiful and expansive with so much to explore if you can stand the bugs there are npcs quests story questlines and lore it does have most you ve come to expect from a modern fallout game you ll spend a lot of time building your character attacking enemy encampments building your own camp hacking and lockpicking your way into abandoned buildings for 25 year old dog food some questlines even let you decide the fate of appalachia especially the questlines that involve the wastelanders and broken steel dlc when you first jump into the game it really doesn t feel like a fallout game but after you learn the basics and see the story telling and factions you might even start to feel that it s more faithful to the original than even it s predecessor fallout 4 everyone knows that fallout 76 s main draw was always the mmo aspects it s the first fallout game that you can play with you friends and enjoy the world with most of my time playing this game i was not alone the multiplayer is where fallout 76 shines the most it is a fun game to drop in and play with your buddies or even significant other after playing this game with someone for so long it is hard whenever i try to play it alone as it just doesn t feel right and the game can become so boring when you play it alone after 300 hours in the game you ve probably done everything the game has to offer for one character sure there s a few other quests and dailys but i never play for the dailys i enjoy the questlines that end with me questioning my morality fallout 76 has at least 2 of these moments at most all the dailys are mundane and boring even the limited events don t interest me i play for the stories this game is trying to tell me restarting a ghoul infested power plant for a eighth time in a single day is boring and logically makes no sense within an apocalyptic setting in which the powergrid hasn t been even a thought for 25 years what i want out of fallout 76 is more questlines of moral ambiguity i want to think long and hard about the decisions i m about to make instead for the past couple years bethesda has been giving us shooting gallery after shooting gallery and limited event after limited event even the limited events aren t any more interesting i m hoping the next expedition gives some of those classic fallout questlines but i will not hold my breathe on it seeing what they did to the pitt my next gripe is how grindy the game is it s an mmo i get it everything is just naturally supposed to be harder that being said every non human enemy in this game is a bullet sponge by level 20 you got to learn how to make ammunition fast because that s where things really start getting hard by the end of the game if you really want to be effective you have to stick to a very specific character build making it feel even less freeing than some fallouts of game s passed if you don t follow one of these strict builds then the end game becomes overly grindy like having to put 70 rounds into a supermutant to take them down or 40 rounds into a ghoul that those are both with a powerful rifle that has a chance to do 4x the damage when hitting i know another one of people s complains about the game is fallout 1st i ll be honest about this one i don t care i just ignore it s existence and pretend that i got the full game i asked for and todd isn t asking for more of my money all of the actual important stuff in the game is available to you without fallout 1st so to me it s always been easy to just forget about it now for my final verdict of the game i think fallout 76 is still much better now than it was at launch that s no doubt the bugs here are not game breaking but annoying if you can put up with those though and the grinding this game does have a lot to do and enjoy especially in the presence of friends however after the 300 hour mark i found it to become very boring with not much more questlines for me to do i enjoy this game despite how much i complain about it i really do like it however i cannot recommend it for everyone especially not at 40 dollars get it on sale as fun as the game can be especially with friends it is still unfinished i give fallout 76 a 6 10 for it s great open world worldbuilding and storytelling yet lacking questlines boring dailys bugs and intense grindiness
