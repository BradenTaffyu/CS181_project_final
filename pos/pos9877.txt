2020 i have very little experience with basebuilding colony sim type games the closest thing i ve played to this is probably the extraordinarily popular stardew valley which i loved but which features some big differences from rimworld one of the things i loved about stardew was the added focus on the characters and their interactions versus simply the cold calculating efficiency of building a base a farm in stardew of course and a colony in rimworld the characters injected a welcome human aspect to the game and rimworld takes this approach one step further and that s what makes it great and what makes it stand out rimworld eschews a more developer handcrafted approach for a random emergent system which guides its characters the interactions between colonists and the game s encounters aren t scripted but rather randomly generated and while this typically feels far more artificial and less compelling in most games it somehow works beautifully in rimworld and really gives your colony the feel of an actual social ecosystem rather than a bunch of video game systems mechanically and robotically at work this is due to how deep and interweaved the systems of backstory traits and skills are and how varied the social interactions between colonists can get i don t think i ve ever played a game which facilitated my own headcanon so strongly as rimworld this game s pseudo random characters feel anything but random for example my prison warden recruited a young native woman who was passing by eventually fell in love with her and married her she s now one of my best shocktroopers and as a great shooter has an ongoing rivalry with my melee berserker linda who wears heavy armor and beats people with a mace then there s my colony s surgeon and doctor red a medic with superior skills in medical and plants but who is also a nudist and is very unhappy unless he s treating his patients and tending his crops completely naked save for a steel helmet in case of bandit raids he switches to a winter hat when it s cold but still prefers to be otherwise naked even at temperatures of 5 celsius red is also a self styled ladies man though i ve only ever seen him strike out when attempting to woo the lasses perhaps this has something to do with him you know always being naked or how about my father and son duo dunc and kaito kaito is in his 60s and dunc is in his 40s but dunc is actually kaito s father despite being younger than his son this is due to some cryptosleep shenanigans in which dunc was kept in suspended animation as his son grew older than him they re two of my best colonists they have some of the highest skills in cooking construction crafting etc and are the most reliable workers in the entire colony but despite being father and son they have a pretty strong rivalry and are basically estranged they got into a fight in the workshop once during which time dunc bit off his 20 years older son s ring finger this was such an event in the colony that dunc later built a wooden dresser with beautiful artwork depicting this fight and the climactic finger biting or the colony labrador retriever saffron who i mistakenly walled off from her kibble supply which meant that she was forced to eat drugs to survive eventually she developed an addiction and then got pregnant with puppies so now we have a drug addicted pregnant dog roaming the premises constantly high and vegging out in the middle of the hayfields we grow for the horses they aren t all comical or absurd though there s real tragedy to be found here too after spending so many hours with these colonists this place your pets you begin to grow fond of their quirkiness and get to know them so when a raid catches you with your pants down and you experience some casualties they hit you harder than they do in most other games i noticed myself in a very real funk for an entire day after a tribal raid killed several of my warg puppies and bear cubs when they were caught outside the walls hunting the random events which are variable in how frequently they occur can be challenging and sometimes impossible they add another layer to the lived in feel of the world i captured a promising native woman with a great skillset and successfully recruited her only to have her brother and his friends come and attempt to raid me later on as retaliation the fact that they were related and that i was given time to get to know the woman before her brother appeared made this such a more compelling episode than if i had simply been randomly raided by warlike natives these kinds of emergent stories are what make rimworld so special they somehow feel real and handcrafted despite their randomness which is a really incredible accomplishment you get a different story with each colony and the options allow you to craft them to be as chill or as brutal as you like via the bevy of difficulty settings provided you can turn off nearly all the challenge and just relax and build a nice colony or you can crank them up and wallow in misery as your colonists experience firsthand the futility and hopelessness of building a colony on a rimworld full of deadly dangers such as death robots cannibalistic raiders and monstrous insects eager to consume their flesh and of course it goes without saying that the systems at work with the basebuilding are exceptional the tech tree is very in depth the economy guiding your progress is stout and gives you a sense of earning it and the supplies you must keep stocked are extensive enough to be challenging but not so overwrought as to be overwhelming the caravan system which i didn t even dig into until after 50 hours of playing time also adds a mid game system which is surprisingly deep and well crafted itself the priorities system is incredibly addictive and probably where i spend most of my actual gameplay time there s something so compelling about endlessly tweaking my colonists activities to try and gain the most efficiency possible if i did have a knock against this game it s perhaps that it s got a steep learning curve if you ve played a game like this before you re probably already halfway to learning its systems i however had not so i had to grind out the first 8 hours or so before i had a grasp of what i was doing and i was often frustrated as i learned how things work by making drastic mistakes my first colony starved to death due to my inexperience so is it worth a purchase well rimworld is notorious for never going on sale but that s not a huge deal in my opinion because it s such a compelling deep satisfying experience that it s worth the purchase at full price in my opinion if you feel overwhelmed at the beginning just push through soon it ll start clicking for you or you know don t and stay far away from this damned game because it s unbelievably addictive seriously it s swallowing my life some people have heroin i have rimworld feel free to follow my curator page if you
