2018 early access review it s really an awesome game i played 3 days non stop when i first played it with my friends until midnight however i noticed some lack of contents since it s still an early access but still shows promising updates in the future since it s just an early access i wanna comment some ideas and improvent as a fan 1 more weapons such as harpoons to kill shark or cannons with black powder as a craftable resource 2 more enemies aside from shark such as bandits with a small boat like us players with 1 or 2 enemy bandits and we can either kill them or negotiate for our life if we think we can t win and give what they ask for like 1 scrap and 4 plastic and so on later the bandits can increase in number as the game progress i mean i really wanna shoot these bows and arrows to an enemy asside from the one in the water and make use of the binocular for some pirates incoming 3 since this game is about lootings we can t forget about treasure maps i hope there are hidden maps in the loot crates on the island and use that map to find treasure using the satelite 4 boss battles please of course since there might be some other players who doesn t want to fight so there can be a choice to either sail away or look for the map that shows where the boss is hidden such as the legendary kraken or other mythical epic creatures since it is a boss right i am really not asking much but wanting for a more awesome game from an awesome game thanksps i think some people wants this game to be peacful so when making a new game they can either choose to have bandits or not like survival mode or peacful mode etc
