2022 my opinion on fallout 76 i ve been playing fallout 76 since launch day and even before that when it was in beta i know this game was widely despised by hundreds of people but i ve loved it since the beginning a lot of people didn t like fallout 76 because the world lacked humans and was only filled with robots and holotapes of past explorers of appalachia there were also a lot of bugs but let s be real we ve been experiencing bugs in every bethesda game so what s different they ve been actively working on the game since launch and have released so much content since they ve added so many qol fixes that i didn t realize i wanted until they were added in the game is so damn fun with friends if you enjoyed fallout 4 i feel like you d enjoy this it s legitimately the same as fallout 4 but with a different setting and a new story the only difference is being able to fight enemies and complete quests with your friends i thought i wouldn t like it at first because i was so used to being a lone wanderer in previous games but i surprisingly loved the multiplayer feature i thought they wouldn t get it to work in a way that wouldn t be annoying e g 40 players on each server people constantly killing you and destroying your bases etc but they worked the multiplayer in in such a perfect way that you can still feel like a lone wanderer if you prefer to play solo but still be able to enjoy playing with your friends and not get overwhelmed by encountering too many real players you ll rarely encounter people trying to kill you with malicious intent i ve found this to have the best player base in any game i ve ever played people are so nice to one another giving new players items to help them out and give them a little head start helping others with quests events etc as a streamer this has also been one of the most wholesome communities and i ve enjoyed streaming this game an incredible amount bugs and glitches there are still bugs and glitches to this day but that s to be expected from a bethesda game i haven t encountered anything game breaking i ve experienced optimization issues since day 1 but it s only gotten better as time has gone on through updates some bugs i ve experienced sometimes when you re using a workbench you won t be able to get out of it and you have to reload the game to fix this when aiming down your sights with a weapon sometimes you won t be able to get out of ads this can be fixed by restarting your game or i think you can get hit by a throwable weapon and it ll unstick you conclusion all in all i ve had an insurmountable amount of fun in fallout 76 and it s really hard to tell someone it s worth the buy because of all the negative things that were said about the game on day 1 by people who haven t even come back to the game in the present and they still continue to talk about it i would recommend watching gameplay of how the game is currently and deciding for yourself whether you think you d have fun with it rating 8 5 10 while you re here why don t you follow me on my steam curator page
