2022 i m long overdue to review this game i started this game like 2 or 3 times before i ended up playing through it all the way it wasn t bad just overwhelming with options at the very beginning of the game you re taken prisoner a small part of the first act is to escape from the the large prison complex you re placed in with other captives in my times playing i found a unique way to escape this prison each time i knew this game was something special after that i continued my first playthrough with what i ve realized is now the most awful builds i could ve made i struggled so much just in my first playthrough on normal difficulty since then i ve started playing co op with a friend on a slightly higher difficulty and suddenly the game is much easier to understand and has nearly been a breeze the game does a great job teaching you its mechanics even on your first time through not knowing what you re doing the game is gorgeous it has a lovely art style with a great amount of fidelity every aspect of the game works in tandem with the art style and every little detail just pops the music is fantastically composed and suits the game very well the turn based combat system is the most flexible i ve seen in a turn based game and heavily rewards improvisation there s a video online you can find of a person who used the in game telekinesis to beat a boss to death with a painting of himself a game that lets you do that can t be bad pretty much every line is voice acted and for that fact performed very well the origin characters are all well written with unique stories and responses to encounters you have in the game ifan will open up dialogue choices that were not available to me on my first playthrough since i primarily played sebille on my first full time through the origin characters have their own unique stories that have satisfying conclusions i speculate i haven t seen all of them yet but the 3 i saw were all great if you wanna kill a fool do it your story will likely alter or you could outright fail a sidequest larian made this game as freeing as possible original sin 2 isn t perfect literally no game is the main story itself is interesting enough to keep me going but isn t as fascinating as the tons of sidequests you can do it seems to be a very rpg quirk to make the side stories more interesting than the main one sometimes the ai seems to break and perform the worst possible solutions for itself other encounters are awful there s one in act 2 that i feel is the most infamous case as it s very tedious luckily there are workarounds for this and you don t have to have the encounter but it requires a lot of experimentation and if you want to play as it s meant to be played you re gonna have some bad fights now and then finally the game could really use an undo last move button there are times where the enemies idle animation will actually make you miss your attack prompt and instead move next to them costing precious action points possible getting an attack of opportunity on you and messing up your encounter strategy i don t think it s too much to ask for an undo option on your very last move not your whole turn that s just a weird quirk i ve run into a few times and it s never not frustrating i think i ve ranted enough about the game really the negatives are most nitpicks and stuff that would largely be easy to fix or as i mentioned completely avoidable when it comes to most of the bad encounters this is easily one of my favorite games ever probably in my top 10 ever larian is such a treasured studio to me now their work on this really shows their attentiveness to detail their passion for storytelling and you can tell they had a blast making this game from top to bottom baldur s gate 3 has shown enormous promise in it s early access state as of this writing and i cannot wait to see that through to the end either my only hope at this point is that after completion of that game larian does another unique unlicensed game i want to see what other ideas they have i almost don t even want an original sin 3 because i d like to see if they have any other crazy ideas make a sci fi game cyberpunk game space western no matter what they make next i m on board incredible work larian
