2018 so after spending over 400h in this game and many more in the demo and before i activated it on steam i think i should write a review first off short answer yes i definitely recommend it the thing that should be addressed first is probably the developers you re doing amazing work six years after the game came out there are still regular update and dlc and for example with the germany rework you can definitely see that they have improved things like the trailer ownership also added replayablity the game might seem like it get s boring after a while but with the above mentioned regular updates mod support defiantly give tmp a shot and amazing community like vtc s for example there s always something new to tryalso you can choose how hard and or immersive the game is for example you could go all out and spend additional money on a wheel eye tracker shifter etc but you can also just play with mouse and keyboard ran it with everything from keyboard over a x box 360 controller to a g29 had no problems with anything you can have your mirrors and navigation as hud elements but you can also look around yourself and follow the road signsin conclusion i really don t have anything negative to say about this definitely give it a try
