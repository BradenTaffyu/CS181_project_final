2016 simply put divinity original sin 2 expands on the best ideas from the first game while taking a complete 180 in tone to deliver a much darker and adult experience compared to the first one of the most notable changes is immediately realized as character creation begins with races tags origin stories and a complete stat revamp giving a new level of depth to character creation the origin story presets while not customizable deliver a unique experience for each all of the notable origin story characters have interactions with each other and even if you choose not to create them yourself they can be found and interacted with around the world not only this but you can recruit these important figures of the lore origin stories on the surface level seem gimmicky but allow for a whole new level of replayability in combination with the tag system the tag system allows you to acquire new tags that effect quests and dialogue as you progress through the game or assign them to your custom character in character creation origin story characters will have these tags preset as well as a brief synopsis of their lore however the changes aren t just to the character creation as soon as you get into combat you ll quickly notice how much has changed while divinity original sin 2 keeps the basics of the first game intact action points have recieved a complete overhaul streamlining the process of choosing actions while the new system 6 action points total 4 action points at the start of encounter most skills cost 1 2 action points may seem to cater to a more casual audience at first the new skills that accompany this revamp allow for a level of complexity in combat never before seen in the divinity series new skills introduced in the second game are more ambitious creative and innovative than any in the first game even from the start of the game you ll acquire interesting abilities that you can use to control the battlefield the new targeting system provided in d os2 gives a sense of clarity lacking in the first game height advantages and disadvantages means that positioning matters now more than ever before in addition to the surfaces system of the first game fire poison poison clouds static clouds electrified water etc most of these surfaces can now be blessed and cursed for interesting variations and choice in combat for example while fire is harmful to your team if you bless it it ll apply a heal every turn and prevent the members within from being frozen the campaign here is of absolutely astounding quality and length my first full playthrough of the game took roughly 80 hours even without dozens of sidequests no matter your choice of origin character or custom you ll find the campaign to be deeply satisfying however as noted by the developers you are meant to play with the origin story characters and it shows each origin character has at least half a dozen unique encounters while the game is still engaging if you re playing as a custom character the origin stories really do allow for a better capacity for role playing and it s interaction in the game world for the steam awards of 2016 this is my pick for the most astounding game the staggering amount of interactions in the game even in alpha can be overwhelming divinity original sin 2 could very well shape up to be game of the year 2017 for me
