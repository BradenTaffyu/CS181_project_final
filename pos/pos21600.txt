2023 cars go vroom chapter 5 never change a winning team after tons of hours on fh4 i found the trip to mexico quite familiar not a bad thing but personally i hoped for more innovation ok new location new cars and a few changes to the gameplay it s still a massive game under every aspect graphically impressive with an arcade but satisfying driving system but liveries and tuning system has been the same the photo mode never changes when real garages for 6 10 cars to store favourite cars and take pics of them just to say it s still a satisfying game that s for sure but take the full package when discounted
