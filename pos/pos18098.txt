2018 now after years of patches and changes finally rome 2 is a worthy succesor of the first one latest patches bring us a family tree at least with a good dose of intrigue and political manouvers and a reworked political system were you must manage the other political parties or risk a secession both systems works pretty well together and add another layer to the game another change from the latest patches are the agents now are reworked and long gone are the days of lone people stoppin and decimating armies now you have more options to buff yourself or bother your enemies the campaing and battles are your usual total war ones good stuff pick a faction several ones are dlc ones but even without them you have plenty of variety and try to forge an empire you move your armies and agents in the map and the battles are fought in glorious real time with pause the game looks great and the battles are really enjoyable the cons because is not perfect some people prefer some system for the first one like the armies not tied to generals and the build everything in every place instead of the actual sloted settlements but ymmv and there are bugs some are patched some not yet the ai still does silly things sometimes or get stuck in siegues sometimes some people also do not like having female generals rome the greeks carthage and i think some more can t have them they are uncommon but that can vary pray to the rng i once killed several generals trying to get a female politician and no dice but nothing major it s a great game
