2019 i adore this game i hate this game i adore this game because it s a masterpiece it s absolutely immersive the modding community makes it an incredible experience the game makes you feel like you re literally making something of nothing it really is good at making you feel like it s really after a global thermonuclear war event it s a hopeless toxic mutated world and you re stuck in it i hate this game because it s a masterpiece it s absolutely immersive the modding community makes it so i get so lost in modding that i forget there is a game with a story and quest lines i hate this game because i am literally scared every moment i exist in it it s a lonely lonely world out there and i feel hopeless when i play it i thought fallout 76 would have been the answer to my loneliness out in the wasteland it didn t but that s another story
