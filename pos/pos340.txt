2019 a small dip into this game makes you aware that this is more than what it says on the tin almost every aspect of this game seems to have been given serious and careful thought down from the sounds of the environment to the visuals and character stories yes they exist here very well rounded crafting farming and selling system revolving around the seasons and player levels you gain a significant sense of community if you choose to interact with the villagers and help them out with all those positive said lets look at what could possibly be improved these mostly refer to end game as this game s pace is judged by how you play and therefore you don t miss out on events as they will pop up when you start working towards them map size possible the bus service takes you to more than just calico desert farm size possibly allowing the player to expand the farm as things can get cluttered the rng achievements these should not be as grindy as they are for people who want to have a perfect farm collection friendship points should be allowed to without having to fish for days on end or hoe ing at the artifact worms like a madman until all sanity is lost and praire king should just be left alone and treated as a separate game altogether otherwise there is not much else that can be improved upon there are bottle necks with resources if playing with friends but i find these are necessary as you should have to work hard to get a big profitable farm going an easy 10 10 would recommend for single and multiplayer gg concernedape who single handedly made the game over years edit after more hours added loads of mods of which there are plenty well made one by the community would highly recommend as it bring loads of new hours and even objectives in the game i have ye to try the stardew expanded version which looks amazing very easy to mod as well all you need is vortex from nexus mods and just install through the application very easy to make a backup of your save files and very easy to edit them yourself if there are any bugs
