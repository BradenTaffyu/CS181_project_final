2021 overall a great masterpiece that is worth playing first off it is very addicting early on and you will lose count of time the slow but worthy progression through the timeline is so good at what it does which keeps you coming back for more contrary to popular belief the social mechanic is not garbage it is often compared to the wonderful animal crossing which is a first party game made by many people so you have to cut some slack for the one guy behind this game excluding the fact that it was made by one guy and you will think so differently of the game and pretend as if it was made by a full team the amount of content put into characters is insane although they may have repetitive actions and phrases the contrast and detail put into each character is mind blowing they all differentiate from one another which give more to your imagination they have tons of personality cut scenes and interactions with the player i wouldn t say it is the best or the worst i just think it gets a bad reputation and that it needs to be cleared up although a bit grindy at sometimes it is definitely worth your time the place where this game lacks is endgame content this is not even my first time playing as i already have 200 hours on another platform it simply just has little to no rewards or satisfaction when completing the game it is one of those that once you beat it you have no incentive to 100 percent it i have indeed done both and yet the begging and end was fun going any further than that just results in wasting time on top of it being very annoying while very negative there is a good side in that we will hopefully see a new stardew valley sequel as the updates are more just random time wasters to those that have already completed it updates are good especially the ginger island one but the small nit picky things just aren t worth it in the end overall this game gets a 9 10 for me way worth the price especially because of the main storyline just fare warning the base game is more of what you are buying it for i would recommend to people who enjoy a casual and relaxing farming game with outstanding and some of the best game music i have ever heard p s cloud country is the best song enjoy
