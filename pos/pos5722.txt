2021 early access review well afther playing this game from the first launch with a break of 1 year i must say the gameplay got better but it seems to be in a sort of stalemate like the devs are out of inspiration no offence the things i would see in this game and would make it a goty more diplomacy options like truces alliances and a more balanced matter of kingdoms declaring war more kingdoms and more land landplots the option to start villagas continents schips and naval battles like mnb warband faster maturing of children better ai commanding options like placing generals for your inf archers and cav and be able to put them on ai command more crafting options like armour breeding horses training soldiers a ban on recruiting soldiers of different factions so the armys dont look like ragtag warmongering bands growing settlements deceases like plague etc snow rain etc regional weather more units better ai gameplay at the worldmap ai kingdoms acting accordingly to their leaders trait evil neutral good insane invading forces to the realm giving the ai the chance to make peace to confront the common enemy victory improves loyalty and betters relations with allies friends vassals while lossing wars decreases thesethe chance to destroy a city or rebuild it from ashes more build options like some citys need types of buildings first to construct or produce certain items units pirates beginning of big 1000 battles commander giving a war speech ala braveheartthings i would like to see improved option to clear rebel camps with a army more enemies in rebel camps largercamps better economy stronger cavalry better shieldwallforgive me for my english i like this game i will uninstall it again and play it in 7 months i hope the devs read my message pthis game has alot of potential very good game it needs the final touches to make it excellent
