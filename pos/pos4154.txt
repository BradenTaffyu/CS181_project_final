2020 i love this game i just love it it s immensely recompensating and offers an amazing challenge you can create some really devastating decks but it takes some time and experimentation to really understand how each deck character plays but once it clicks and you understand how to sinergyze your hand oh boy the satisfaction will blow you away i urge you to give it a try 10 10 edit after i completed all the achievements 200hrs after the first review i did it a couple of months ago and to my surprise i still can t get enough of it at this point i can confidently say that this is one of my favorite games of all time and it s stunning how it still feel fresh even 300hrs down the line three years have passed since i started playing it and yep i can confirm this is true love 3
