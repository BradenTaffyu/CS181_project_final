2020 where do i begin ultimately do i recommend this game of course but there are some issues that i have but let s start on a positive note iracing in my opinion is the greatest racing simulator available and nothing compares to it the amount of series to race the cars the tracks the consistent updates the lively community it s all amazing for me i race nascar i absolutely love it because of iracing it allowed me and a childhood best friend to bond over a sport that we both love despite now living in separate states the laser scanned tracks the realistic feel of getting caught in dirty air trying to draft an opponent in order to make a run for the win the adrenaline of fighting for first place or trying to fend off second and third place coming to the checkered flag it s heart pumping adrenaline that is so fun yet also so frustrating if you can t pull off the win or get wrecked out early or wrecked at the end whether intentionally or by some idiot who doesn t care what he causes there are so many moments that i can reflect on in my measly 156 hours of racing that i will always reflect on with a smile because of how awesome they were moving onto a slight positive which ultimately turns into the negatives going up in class rookie to a class now you might be wondering how on earth is a license system of starting from the bottom and grinding your way to the top become a negative what becomes negative isn t the actual progression of your classes it s the consumer practice of what you have to pay for but we ll get into that i think the licensing feature is awesome you choose what series you want to start in for me it was oval and then the better you race the more safe you are the easier it is to progress you either get your safety rating up to a 4 0 for an automatic promotion into the next class mid season or you must obtain a 3 0 and at the end of the season if you have a 3 0 or higher you ll progress into the next class it also works the opposite way if you drop below a 2 0 at the end of the season you ll be demoted and go down a license or if you drop below 1 0 mid season it s an instant demotion in the middle of the season i think it s a fair system as it encourages racing safely and deters for the most part people from coming in and simply wrecking everybody on purpose because they ll keep going down in licenses or can get banned from constant reports on them but this is where we take a shift into the negative the money required to consistently play this game is at times ridiculous well capncrunch17 it s a simulator they have laser scanned tracks realistic physics blah blah blah those can t be cheap i get that and i get that a business wants to profit and continually make money first you purchase the game okay it s what 9 not breaking the bank no problem it s an mmo okay so there s a subscription no problem with the features they have it deters trolls and cheaters i enjoy it enough i ll pay 12 a month but then it doesn t stop there so in every class road oval dirt etc they give you a few free vehicles to start with including free tracks most of which are legacy tracks that are the old versions i d say that s generous it gives you the ability to get started in the game test out what you like and then to determine if it s right for you personally and financially but after that it can get a bit ridiculous you have to buy the tracks for your series you have to buy the car for the class that you re in and this really adds up especially if you enjoy racing multiple series for me i love nascar and race oval and that s what i stick to so i had to purchase a vehicle from i believe it was c class b class and a class i can t remember if the d class arca cars were free so tracks and cars are typically like 14 a pop before tax that stuff adds up quickly i haven t sat down to add up how much money i ve spent on this game that s not including the racing wheel and pedals that are essential to have to play this but it s definitely a pretty penny or two like i mentioned before i understand business are here to make money and with what they provide here i am totally fine with paying for the game paying for a subscription and maybe having to purchase a couple things here and there but if you want to race other series that s just burning a hole in anybody s wallet and it s like a game with a gazillion microtransactions that comes across as incredibly anti consumer but what bugs me the most if you cancel your subscription or whatever you cannot access anything you have bought you re telling me i ve spent probably over 1k for this game and let s say i forget to renew my subscription one day i can t even race offline to practice while i wait for my subscription to process and renew again i don t know to me that s annoying ultimately the game the simulator or whatever you decide to call it is absolutely amazing it s adrenaline pumping fun where people with similar interests can come together to race without having to drop thousands of dollars to race in real life there s no serious repercussions for wrecking it s simply back out and find another race to join i ve met a lot of cool people and i ve met a lot of people i hope to never see or hear their voice ever again but at the end of the day with the money required for the game nothing compares to the feeling of getting your first win in a tightly contested race i ll be playing iracing for years to come and will keep sinking money into it because i m a sucker who can t get away from it if you have the money and passion for auto racing get this game you won t regret it
