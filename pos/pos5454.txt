2018 early access review start a new gamedecide to create a character with beguiling charm and dominate control person mutationslooks for a snapjaw gnoll warlord to make my friendfinds one and gets a new best frienddominate it to equip items and level upfast forward to first caveat the last levelget caught by a jilted loverquickly realize i ll die in a few turnsmore snapjaws coming from down the caveonly one thing left to dodominate my warlord friend i get killed by the jilted loveris now a mutated hyena manthis is my life nowi have no idea if this is a bug or not i m hoping not because i ve never had such a more hilarious turn of eventscaves of qud is not any other rougelike that i ve ever played it s strange world story and overall feel has left me enamored visually it is not the most appealing but it has its charm that old crt grainy feel harkens back to my early childhood the audio is somewhat lacking but when i first left the safety of joppa the starting town i was hit with the cacophony that was the chrome jungles of qud i love how this game plays it was strange to get the hang of it initially not too many games use the numpad as input for navigation it took sometime to get used to but it felt pretty natural after a few hours the amount of mutations you can take as a mutated human is quite subtantial and i m constantly trying to find new synergies with them while the normal humans get some great cybernetics and diplomatic immunity from roving bands of mutant hunting templars i feel that both playstyles work really well the difficulty of this game is also nothing to sneeze at you will die a lot it is inevitable one moment you ll be cleaving through hordes of snapjaws when suddenly some templars arrive and quickly disembowl you via carbide longsword or vaporize you with a werid artifact as any other good rougelike there is plenty of risk management and every step is a gamble overall i d give this game a 9 10 for just being what it currently is there s still much more the devs plan to put into their magnum opus i look forward for what else the chrome jungles of qud yet withhold from my greedy eyes what wonderous ancient artifacts the shifting sands hide but until then i ll be slaughtering more glowing fish and snapjaws in the meantime live and drink my friends
