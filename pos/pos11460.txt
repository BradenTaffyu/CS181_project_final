2020 early access review this game has more positive points than negative for me i enjoy the idea of survival in an apocalypse by making a base developing a defense and standing your ground as an ever growing stronger horde comes shambling for you to take you down need to be flexible and adaptable in scavenging for food weapons tools and materials to continue growing and becoming more self sufficient the bad points would be the graphics are pretty basic for some of the environment trees plants but the zombies are decent looking the other issue is the game is not the best optimized game making some weaker systems have a harder time to run the game smoothly
