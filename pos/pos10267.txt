2019 when steam first recommended me this game i thought hey steam this game looks likes sh t i m not gonna play that a friend told me about the multiplayer mod a few days ago and strongly suggested me to try it out since i had a bit of money to spare i decided to purchase it the game still looks sh tty just like two years ago when i first discovered it but i can t put it down now i bought it for 3 days and i played for 24 hours already and still counting fortunately the college exams finished right before i bought it i already had 2 failed colonies due to not knowing mechanics but my third colony is looking strong right now have solid food supplies every one is happy and well armed and i just recently got turrets my defenses are looking solid as well though i wouldn t be surprised if cassandra decides to throw a random event and wipe out my entire colony but i don t mind a bit this is one of the charms i can t wait to see what more rimworld has to offer
