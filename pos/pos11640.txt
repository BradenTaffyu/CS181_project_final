2015 early access review if you want a good zombie suvival game this is literally the best game out there to come of that genre and to be the best for a long long time even if you want no zombies and to get used to playing the game you can turn them off and play yourself to get familiar with it or better yet like myself play on hard difficulties and make looting percentages rather low to give yourself a 7dtd fallout 3 feel world ending
