2022 this review is a warning do not buy this game if you want to do anything other than play this game nonstop for months on end this game though satisfying and rewarding at first is an endless climb up a beyond vertical cliff which has no real summit i have played this game a fair amount enough to make an honest opinion on this and i can safely say that unless you have the determination and focus of a pro gamer then do not push yourself while playing this game as there is nothing to earn from it understand that everyone has their limits and just because someone on r deadcells had 5bc and seems as good at the game as you are doesn t mean that you should spend hours of every day just to try to get past 2bc sometimes there is a point where you shouldn t push yourself further than you are already pushing please understand that this is not a de motivational message but simply a reminder that this is just a game and don t beat yourself up about getting to thotk twice on 3bc only to die and have to do it all over again this message is not telling you to give up but more to tell you to know your limits other than that this game is great 10 10
