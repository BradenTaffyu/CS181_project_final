2018 early access review edit 102 hours in two weeks filthy casual just a bit of advice from my second playthrough get the game my soldiers are basically immortal cyborgs capable of feeling no pain they barely sleep barely eat never break down and they seem to know nothing but death and destruction as i type this my super soldiers are enroute to destroy the final two strongholds held by the rebel scum star wars the enemy has fought valiantly and managed to take out one of our infamous lightsaber wielding super soldiers a move which resulted in the nuclear decimation of three of their cities but just as the other factions who dared to defy me their time on this planet is coming to an abrupt and violent end instead a new age is rising over this desolate rimworld an age of order and strength of technology and intellect of peace and prosperity a new age of nic as your supreme and total commander i managed to put 102 hours into this game in two weeks seriously what the you look at the time and its a bit before midnight look again and its 10am two days later with 15 missed calls from the real world and you ve somehow quit your job during that time i mean i have never had as much fun losing and restarting a game as i have with rimworld like in my first game where i built a base that couldn t properly defend my crop fields of course such a vulnerability promoted the ai to send raiders to burn my crops and destroy my freezer okay i thought i can still recover from this no problem that is until the horde of manhunter racoons closed in during harvest time slowly one by one my colony starved to death that winter fine well i ll just build into a mountain and have my crops in the valley that ll stop them an infestation has appeared in your base a what wait you mean bugs not just little cockroaches or anything but arachnids arachnids straight out of starship troopers how about no by the way there is an excellent starship troopers mod now on game number whatever the i m on i ve become a small time drug cartel exporter looking for smokeleaf hash i got it edibles got it hell you want some yayo i got you man just stop by sire nic s drug and wonder emporium for all your addictions and vices and remember if your colonists aren t addicted to at least a couple different substances then you re doing it wrong seriously just get this game even with the 30 tag the base game alone is great but the mods are truly what make it shine mod it with a skyrim mindset so in other words mod it til it crashes or takes an hour to load
