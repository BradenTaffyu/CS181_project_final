2017 total war warhammer ii is the direct sequel to warhammer i and along with it brings in a multitude of improvements from the previous title the game takes place across four continents ulthwan naggaroth the southlands and lustria each having it s own host of varied climates unique building chains and factions furthermore each of these continents bring along an individual unique faction the four playable factions being the high elves dark elves lizardmen and skaven coming from a total war perspectivewarhammer ii similarly to warhammer i reminds me of the classic rome i and medieval ii games removing the one to one combat held in previous titles and replacing it with what we saw in the older titles leading to a more varied and exciting combat cavalry charges are incredible and really do show off what more powerful cavalry units such can do ripping through lines of enemies potentially changing the outcome of the battle contentthis is probably the most asked question regarding newer total war games and with confidence i can say that this game definitely offers a large amount of content the great vortex campaign is a large change from the standard domination type victories from previous total war games and the introduction of newer races such as the lizardmen provide a breath of fresh air from the standard spearmen archers and cavalry with each race providing a unique way to fight each battle and make their way through the campaign one example would be how the high elves rely on more expensive units whereas the skaven relies on hordes and numbers improvements from the first gamewarhammer ii definitely takes a step in the right direction in regards to improvements from the first game feedback has been taken in from the community with inspiration taken from popular mods such as heroes in higher end garrisons and the ability to colonise anywhere instead adding penalties such as negative public order when occupying climates that are not suitable for the race bridge battles have been added back and the campaign map has been extended to add treasure hunts rites to buff your faction and specific abilities to each faction high elves using influence to increase or decrease relations between factions leading to yourself gaining the upper hand in diplomacy furthermore minor settlement battles while still fought on the open field have been improved with new models that have been added to make it look as if it is outside a settlement leading to a more aesthetically pleasing battle graphics soundtrack user interfacethe graphics have been improved from the first game in regards to lighting effects and textures though nothing too dramatic that i can notice the campaign map has especially been improved with different regions looking exceptional reminding me of some the improvements some of the mods made to warhammer i s campaign lighting the soundtrack is memorable unique to different races and can really provide an epic feeling to the campaign and battles credit must definitely be given to the artists such as richard beddow a massive improvement from previous titles such as rome ii lastly the user interface while it of course retains may of the features from the previous titles ca has gone out of their way to add improvements that were not especially needed though definitely great to have most notably the ability to change camera settings designating different speeds for neutral warring and allied factions events are no longer required to be opened up to be seen though hovering over them in the panel leading to the information being shown and the ability the zoom in directly from the campaign map to an overview are all welcome improvements from the first game futurei am especially excited for the future of this game with newer factions units and improvements being added in time no content has been locked behind a paywall such as chaos for warhammer i and i personally am excited for new content releasing in dlc to prolonge the life and my playthrough of this game moreover the well anticipated mortal empires expansion free to users of both games will combine both maps introducing new mechanics such as rogue armies ranged breath attacks for all dragons treasure hunting encounters at sea storms shallows and reefs a whacking great number of ui refinements and improvements 8 and 10 slot cities chokepoint maps and of course universal territory capture and climate suitability mechanics and increasing the amount of settlements from 142 from the first game to 295 in both games leading to an extremely large campaign map to conquer room for improvementsdiplomacy while improved still requires some tweaking with factions on the edge of destruction still refusing peace trade agreements for both parties offering great positives still being turned down being two of the most frustrating i have also come across one settlement factions fielding 4 armies at once with no units thus were running away and raising more whenever i destroyed one the ai while great in battle could also use some improving on the campaign map the introduction of the ability to not retreat while in forced march and instantly destroying the army similarly in a garrison is great though the ai seems to use force march to stand right in front of your armies therefore giving you the ability to wipe it out in one fell swoop another criticism are the siege battles they are similar to the first game and thus are similarly quite boring and sometimes infuriating towers still have unlimited range and thus are able to destroy your most valuable units before reaching the walls one side to attack leads to less strategy involved and overall makes sieges more of an autoresolve than actually leading playing the game some more i have decided to update this slightly with the fact that siege battles both in mortal empires and in the vortex campaign are very easily exploitable this is performed in one main way in which you stick your lord or heroes in front of any artillery infantry etc you have available and the towers thus prioritise your lord heroes taking minimal damage while your artillery break down the towers thus giving any ranged units you have a chance to pick off the enemies eventually leading to a mass rout when they lose enough this is most prevalent when playing as the high elves dark elves but also works with the empire dwarves and any army that has capable ranged units though i try to avoid using this strategy it still shows the tw warhammer siege battles need some work conclusionwhile total war warhammer ii does definitely require some improvements in regards to diplomacy sieges and the ai for example it is still an extremely fun and interesting game adding in new improvements and leading to an overall worth buy in my opinion i will hopefully be extending adding into this review as the game develops
