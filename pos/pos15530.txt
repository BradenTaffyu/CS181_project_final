2021 the game is enjoyable and immersive after a few hours it gets more intuitive but seems to start to get a little repetitive there are many car models to choose but lack of real brands is depressing we easily identify some cars like the toyota supra but we miss the real brand logo there is also electric car dlc we can also buy more interesting cars in showrooms and public sale as well as find some rusty classics in the barn starting out we mainly deal with the most basic things brakes fluid changes and timing control which require disassembling almost the entire car and screwing it back together after purchased the newly components we will also be able to unlock installations and new tools for restore some of components the diagnostic station where we will check the position of the lights and the alignment of the wheels the paint shop car wash and the test track car mechanic simulator 2021 has a nice soundtrack and has been greatly improved in graphics compared to previous edition of cms 2018
