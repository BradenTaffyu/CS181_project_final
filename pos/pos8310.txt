2018 honestly this has to be the best game i ve bought this year graphics are amazing great story line events actualy make sense and draw you right into whats happening you honestly feel like your in charge of a city trying hard not to freeze and or starve to death hard decisions not because its hard to figure out what to do but like the real hard decisions life would throw at you in such a situation then they go and keep adding to the game it was great day one but they didnt stop there and they didnt put their hands out again and say oh look cool game right we had some more ideas but didnt have time to get them into the game before we released it but you know for some extra cash we will let you have the rest of what we ve come up with nope these guys just put it out there and say hey look what else ya got great game great company okay looks like steam is passing out awards again so just a shout out to you guys i nominated this game for best fun with a machine and best developer you guys rock
