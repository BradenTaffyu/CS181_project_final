2017 early access review so i hated this game at first it was janky had graphics and terrible performance i bought it a long time ago put it down after playing it for a bit and didn t touch it again for over a year one of my friends got me into it this was because we were playing project zomboid and she loves 7 apprehensively i tried it i booted up a dedicated server for it and as far as servers go installing it with steamcmd opening a couple of ports and changing 2 files and you re fully customised launch it from the bat and you re good to go one thing i did find that was odd when setting your steam url for your website you have to 1 the port for the link to work now as far as starting on this game goes you re gunna have a bad time everything is covered by skills from your damage to the loot you find you ll need to figure the skill tree out pretty fast if you want to be able to at least survive with something that isn t like hitting the zombies with a 10 rubber dildo the tutorial covers the basics but it only has 8 parts to it and as far as i ve seen in the option menu you cannot turn it off so if you re starting a game after a couple of playthroughs it may end up bugging you so the weapons come in your standard colour grades with each tier doing more damage and lasting longer than the previous i can t really see why you d want too many melee weapons on here because the zombies are numerous and hit like a brick to the face ranged as far as i ve seen it where its at for survivability you can find a nice range of weapons in towns and military camps however if you pass a bookstore in game make sure you go in plenty of schematics for weapons and tools within after finding these schematics you ll need to find weapon parts to assemble a weapon each weapon part has its own wear and grade which will give you a combined level and wear on your finished weapon i felt this is a very pleasing aspect because it will allow you to upgrade your weapon as you go but ammunition this took me a little longer than i d like to admit to craft ammunition instead of reading a book like we did with the gun you select and purchase it from your skill tree i don t get it either building woo it s like a more intense gory minecraft no building became a bit tedious and long after i d built just a very small shack make your stone axe go farm some wood then you need to craft wood frames build the start of your base go and farm some more wood then use your axe to build the blocks up this felt quite long compared to most games which isn t always a bad thing it makes you take care in what you do however time is of the essence in 7d2d at night zombies run which means they re a lot more dangerous at night so building a house and trying to defend it on your own isn t always the most enjoyable thing in early game i feel they made up with the length it takes you to build with the variety of what you can do with the blocks available to you now location we played on random gen ended up with a nice seed the map feels huge like it takes ages to go between cities which is awesome but on my first spawn i spawned on a tiny island now this wouldn t have been the worst thing to happen to me but you swim so slowly o o it was painful my first half hour was spent struggling to get to land but following the roads on the way to the nearest city is nice enjoyable doesn t feel too repetitive over all after my initial distaste for the game and its graphics the improvements and tweaks the developers have put into this game have made it a worthwhile purchase the fact i ve done 25 hours in 3 days speaks for itself i d happily recommend it to any group of friends who want to play it along with any solo masochists i would happily pay 18 99 for it again if any of you new players are looking for a server to play with us on visit our website www godsofsalt com or just add me on steam
