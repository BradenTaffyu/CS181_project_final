2020 early access review even in early stage is great fun i like to come and play it a few hours every month or so so i can see the progress so in my opinion is like a better mount blade i just want them to keep adding stuff in it we all know that the first was not perfect but still played it to death so more is better here but please add more quality of life stuff we are in 2020 not 2002
