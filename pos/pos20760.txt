2023 leviosaaa ravioli potatohogwarts legacy is an open world action adventure game set in harry potter universe i never was a fan of harry potter i ve seen some movies but that s it but i always loved fantasy and of course i had to play it so is it good yes of course the game begins with character creation which is very good and more games should follow in its steps you can modify the looks hair style etc but the best part is that nothing is tied to gender so you re free to use any set of clothing and appearance on your character and another great thing is that there are garments which give stats and copsmetics each piece of clothing you collect can be applied as cosmetic only which means you can have highest stats and look how you prefer you are new in school and arrive to hogwarts to study after some time you start making friends and meet ranrok the evil goblin and that s what the main story revolves around you also have side stories and side quests not a lot of them but they offer you pretty good stories which continue throughout the game few characters have long quest chains some dialogues and heartwarming or sad outcomes i really enjoyed the side quests they were well designed and didn t feel cheap they also let me connect with side characters and care for them hogwarts castle is a piece of art it s huge and you can explore it all it hides some secrets and is full of tiny details sometimes the attention to detail in this game is stunning something you don t usually expect from aaa games for the fans of hp it will leave even a bigger impression various easter eggs lore small details everywhere you go then there s hogsmead a small town where you usually go to shop it s highly detailed with things scattered all around the town and there s world map which isn t very big but it s filled with lots of stuff to do gameplay is pretty simple yet extremely fun and satifying don t expect it to be hard though it s family friendly game and is pretty relaxing nevertheless the combat is extremely fun you learn spells on the way and add them to your quick spell action slots to use them in combat it makes combat diverse and you need to combine different spells together and often use specific spell to break the shields of the enemies combat never gets old it feels good it looks awesome oh wait almost forgot you have your own room where you can make potions grow plants and take care of the beasts you catch yes you can catch beasts in the wilds you can even make them have sex so they could make cute baby beasts you can feed them brush them and they drop materials for you which you can use to upgrade your gear everything is customizable you can put cosmetics in your room and beast gardens pick the style of your room put rugs paintings tables there are a lot of options oh and the game also has seasons and it just keeps giving even after 30 40h the game will offer you something new and exciting the map has a lot of points of interest caves usually hold a chest and sometimes you need to solve a simple puzzle to get it merlin trials are usually simple puzzles hedge maze is what it sounds astronomy tables is where you must align the stars locked doors is where you must use alohomora spell there s also enemy camps infamous foes beast spots and baloons to pop while it seems repetitive and too much somehow it doesn t feel like it probably because it s not just go there and click x oh yeah there also are mini games like broom racing and that other one i forgot the name no quidditch sadly but even that is incorporated into the story and explained why it s not there of course real reason is different but it s a nice touch you have some choices in dialogues but they have no consequences well it s not an rpg game but it could ve been a decent rpg game if choices would matter some relationship point system would ve nice too but it seems it never supposed to be an rpg graphics are good the game is very pretty and extremely detailed everything looks very pleasant to the eye while hogwarts and hogsmead have their own details the world itself also looks great characters look very good too along with pretty well made animations i n general graphics are very good performance on the other hand well it s unreal engine 4 open world game you know what that means poor optimisation and stutters no matter the hardware you have it will stutter and you ll experience framerate drops especially in hogsmead and some in hogwarts when traversing from one room to another ray tracing absolutely cripples performance but is playable although it doesn t affect graphics that much played on 5800x rtx 4080 32gb 3440x1440 even with dlss on and rt on fps dropped to 50 s in hogsmead without rt it s all good except for unavoidable stutters but what matters is that combat is always smooth stutter only happen when you move around frame generation of course helps and with it on i was hitting my 100fps cap anywhere in the game no native ultrawide support in cut scenes but there s an easy fix which works perfectly sound design is marvelous it feels like like a holywood movie voice acting is amazing every single character sounds great and soundtrack is what you d expect from hp movie hogwarts legacy is en excellent open world adventure game everyone who enjoys the genre should play after finishing it it leaves you with a feelling of wanting more it s great looking game which offers fun gameplay good story interesting characters and fun to get collectibles the downsides being only mediocre performance and no quidditch worth
