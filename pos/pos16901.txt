2021 freedom of strategy easy to start and relatively short games on highest difficulty the game becomes a solid puzzle devs are very involved with community lots of scenarios educational repetitive plague inc evolved is the game i probably have installed the most times on my computer and removed it makes me feel a bit bored if i play it for too long but every now and then i feel the urge to destroy the world i purchased this about seven years ago when this was still in early access the game is under continuous development along the years it received many scenarios of all kinds want to destroy the world with fake news or play planet of the apes and try to have monkeys to dominate earth i know they hate the word monkey d lots of options my personal favourite is the neurax worm besides new sources and scenarios the game also received a multiplayer mode and now even a new dlc that simulates our present world trying to fend off a pandemic for free until covid 19 is under control the game is great for understanding how different factors influence the spread of diseases and their lethality ofcourse this is a game it only paints a picture of what can happen this game received a great uplift in sales during the start of covid it was banned in china probably still is the devs donated 250000 to the who that s very kind 74 100i learnt two things from this game 1 i should definitely move to greenland 2 as long as we aren t burning bodies in the streets we re fiiiine my review of the dlc the cure
