2019 reading the reviews of this game remind me of my father as well he also used to be play this game so much before and after i was born my mother once complained to me that he was so keen on the game that she had to take care of me alone when i was still a baby when i grew a little older i always spent the afternoon sitting next to him and watch him play this game and brag about his brilliant strategies he delved into the game so much just like any gamer today playing with friends in lan or online reading the lengthy documents analyzing each civilization s traits challenging the hardest ais in 1v8s he likes to crash enemies using the french cavaliers and i probably watched him doing so hundreds of times more than a decade have passed now he is now busy working and supporting the whole family in another city most of the time and hardly had any time for home and certainly for any games on very rare occasions he comes back from work walking into my room and asks what i am playing it is impossible for him to learn something new now so i bought the 2013 version for both of us he still picks france every time using the same strategies and brags about his skills whenever he wins a small battle knowing that his play is actually quite outdated and slow i somehow still loves to watch him play for a few more hours it is lucky for me we can still play together i do cherish the moments we are together and can t wait to tell him the upgraded graphics version of this classic game for the game i believe a lot of people has so many memories stored in it fathers and sons brothers and cousins childhoods and youths for me it is part of my happy childhood for my father it is part of his wonderful youth
