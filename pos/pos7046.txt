2019 as a rl truck driver i think they done an amazing job with this game regarding physics graphics and basically everything else especially how you can float the gears like in real life if you have a steering wheel and shifter i really enjoy this game things i don t like they need to add a bigger variety of trucks they really need to add freightliners and a few more models of each one like the classic freightliner and pete some cabovers and some more of the newer models as well i guess the one thing that bothers me the most are the truck stop gas stations i don t know about in other countries but in the u s they don t have 2 pumps in one row like a car gas station they have 1 pump in each row and the one on the driver side is where you swipe your card and put in your info and the passenger side is just a pump so you can fill both tanks so at ever truck stop there is a pump on both sides of the truck in every row if scs reads my review i hope you all will do some research into us truck stops and hopefully even though i m sure it would be a little bit of work would redo the truck stops to be more realistic and maybe even get the licenses to re name them i would love to see a pilot or petro in the game other than that i do highly recommend this game to anyone that likes simulated driving games
