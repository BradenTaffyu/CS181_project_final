2019 early access review reviewed as of build 40 weather this is essentially a complete game in its current state don t let the early access tag dissuade you project zomboid is a highly realistic isometric zombie survival rogue lite with a steep learning curve permadeath and highly unforgiving gameplay and it does an excellent job at that there are no objectives set for the player other then to survive as long as you can before beginning a game you have a selection of difficulty options one week later survival or six months later or a series of scenarios it is recommended to play on the first difficulty for a bit just to get used to the basic mechanics then play survival six months later is for masochists experts only you have to option to customize just about any setting you can think of zombie spawn speed population distribution loot spawn etc there is also character customization at the start of the game with traits that you can give to your character to make them stronger or weaker i e better sneaking stronger weaker with weapons poor vision this allows you to create the game you want to play multiplayer exists but it is essentially dead setting up a server with friends is still a good and fun way to experience the game however there is tension in the game however it s unique in that you as the player create the tension by assessing the risk reward in looting certain high density areas it s a type of thrill that you get which is different from other generic linear games where high stress tense areas are just thrown at you randomly now the negatives steep learning curve as a new player the game can be frustrating to play and some things may seem completely impossible rest assured with time you will improve at the game and make better decisions looting checking corners etc some people may not consider this a negative minimal end game content you can build a base fortify it etc but eventually you will be in a situation where you are self sustaining having a farm and can t really die unless you go looting cities at this point there s not a whole lot else to do in the game other than create a new save file overall if you want a realistic unforgiving zombie survival simulation that isn t a traditional rogue like cataclysm dda this is it these are the end times there was no hope of survival this is how you died
