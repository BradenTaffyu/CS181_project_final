2014 fallout new vegas is simply one of the greatest games i have ever played i m not going to pretend i m not a fanboy as i write this because i am i have always been deeply in love with the fallout series since the first game and i am happy to say it s one series that seems to have only gotten better i ll start by saying i own this game both on console and on pc and i ve completed the game on both though with fallout completed the game is a very loose term i use it to mean finished the main story mission line fallout is one of those games that allows you to play how you want and punishes you accordingly if you want to be evil then you can but don t expect to find allies amongst those who want to protect and if you want to be good then the same applies but don t expect the legion to want to help you my favourite thing about this game is the freedom to play it at your own pace there is the main story mission which you can follow and most likely complete the game in a few hours but there are also hundreds of sidequests areas to explore people to help and companions to find my steam shows that i ve played 79 hours and i m nowhere close to having completed every side quest or exploring every location and in those 79 hours i don t think i ve ever felt bored the morality in this game is another standout feature that i loved many games have a good bad element to it but i felt in fallout new vegas your actions and choices really do have an impact i find that there are so many games now that give you choices but they never really affect your gameplay fallout new vegas isn t one of those maybe like me you ll start to question if what seemed to be 100 right at the start really is the right thing fallout does have it flaws though like most bethesda games and they don t intend to fix them you will most likely find quests glitching out here and there and the game crashing as and when it feels like it saving often can massively help and keeping a fallout wiki open in the background to check if the quest you re on has any known glitches is something i d recommend there s also the massive issue of killing someone by mistake or purposely for whatever reason and finding out 20 hours in they were part of a quest and that quest is either failed or you have to select an ending you wouldn t have wanted the frustration of losing an hours worth of gameplay because i forgot to save it has been the reason many times that i ve stopped playing but i always pick it up and play again sooner or later you can t really go wrong with an open world rpg survival style game with leveling perks companions and over 50 hours gameplay the game is worth every penny and more in my opinion and even if you don t have the 14 99 to spend now when it goes on offer grab it you won t regret it
