2016 i played warcraft 2 when it came out on a 56k modem this is the best fantasy battle rts i ve played since i love the warhammer fantasy ip and i ve played it since the late 80 s this game absolutely nails the feel of waging massive battles with fantastical troops and creatures gorgeous models top notch voice acting sound effects and an epic score i hum when not playing warhammer to the bone in atmosphere endless fun tweaking with army composition and experimenting with different tactics free dlc released regularly pay dlc unquestionably worth the money10 10 would raise altdorf again
