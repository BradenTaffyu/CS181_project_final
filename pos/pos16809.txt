2021 i am loving playing this game you are the jack of all trades you renovate decorate demolish re model and build it is a great game if you love interior design and decorating there is lots of dlc some bought and some free it supports ultra wide screens and i have experienced no crashes in my game there is the odd bug here or there but nothing game breaking update after pet dlc still loving it and many many more hours poured into this game do yourself a favour and check out the workshop for this game too lots of items and great content and do not limit yourself to houses try out cafe s restaurants and retail the templates for the most part do cater to houses apartments but with the workshop you can think outside the box
