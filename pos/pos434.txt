2016 i definitely recommend this game the things that make the game excellent is you can do whatever you want at your own pace its a very relaxing game in my opinion but if you want a more combative game you can head into the forest or the mines another thing i liked about the game is you can fit yourself into the town you can chat and gain relationship points every day and end up settling down and having kids everybody has there own story with this game you can choose from many characters to marry or become friends with you can explore the mysteries of the town hall and the mines or you can have a peaceful life planning out your farm s layout upgrading your house and buying animals to take care of also the game is a lot like harvest moon but at the same time not i would play this game over harvest moon any day but it still has the shipping box the foraging mechanic and relationship bar another thing i liked is the customization you can pick from 100 shirts hair accessories and more you can choose your preference of dogs or cats if you play the game you know why they do that and more btw the creator makes many updates improving the game also would still recommend after beta release play with friends a lot my rating 10 10
