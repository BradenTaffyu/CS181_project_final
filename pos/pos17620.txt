2018 i ve never played any of the total war games until warhammer when i first bought it i was so terrible at to the point to where i uninstalled the game i recently reinstalled it and started watching guides because i wanted to give the game another shot i m still playing on easy because i m still understanding the game but none the less i love the fantasy aspect of this series that s why i bought it i do think the game is great overall great factions to play a huge variety of units between those factions the detail in this game is just amazing my only downside to this is the price for the dlc s i bought the beastmen dlc because that faction interested me however i don t believe that it was worth 20 dollars the beastmen faction dlc alone is 1 3 of the price of the entire game for one faction ca should reduce the amount of the dlcs other then that great game definitely worth buying
