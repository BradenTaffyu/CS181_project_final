2015 fallout 4 is a game that excels at creating the wanderlust of exploring a ruined patch of land making all the random in the wasteland finally mean something finding really cool weapons and then tricking them out with really cool mods and at shooting at the greasy horrible things that inhabit that patch of land with your tricked out super gun at everything else it s pretty subpar if fallout 4 were a person it would be a man with one really muscular arm and four other shriveled limbs i was hoping for an actual roleplaying game experience after bethesda royally the rpg part of the game with the elder scrolls v skyrim and no i don t count elder scrolls online as a sequel because i refuse to acknowledge the existence of games that cost 60 and have microtransactions and i am sad to say that fallout 4 has pared the rpg stuff back further gone are skill checks and stat requirements to accomplish tasks now the closest thing to convincing or intimidating other people is if you beat the random number generator or if you have the perk that gives you a chance to intimidate them by pointing your gun at them traits are gone now you have a perk tree that s really only rewarding if you don t min max all of your points into one tree because almost everything beyond six points in any attribute is a one way ticket to i up rolling my character ville also forget having a outside the lines character now you get the choice of being a male wastelander with a lost baby a robot butler and an adorable dog or the choice of being a female wastelander with a lost baby a robot butler and an adorable dog instead of being an interesting character such as a wastelander with an int set to 1 who runs around with a giant off axe dosed up to the gills with psychotats seriously the greatest idea by the loremasters at bethesda was to combine mentats and psycho while i m at it the whole main storyline in fallout 4 is a prime example as to why i always ignore the main plotline in bethesda games because they re uniformly boring bethesda games are wide enough to around in i don t need to concern myself with some stupid little baby i don t want in the process of finding my baby to be roped into some epic quest to save the wasteland from whatever villain of the week is hiding around i don t want to be strictly good as the game figures i want to be i want to be the silver shroud and machinegun the out of wiseguys who came up with the idea to make bubblegum flavored jet i want to fight my way up the tower of trinity plaza to meet a dude who teaches super mutants about shakespeare i want to be the person who kills the raiders of libertalia and then becomes an attractive target that invites bullets from up and comers i don t want the four main factions of the wasteland to treat me like i m the second coming of jesus i want to start my own raider gang and jump those brotherhood of steel dopes for their armor and while we re at it what with the brotherhood of steel sliding downward into maniacal space marine territory i want to get drunk start fights and pull out the tiny 44 revolver from nowhere when i realize i can t finish those fights bethesda sure love to add a bunch of background detail to their games but when it comes to writing something in the present tense or creating a compelling storyline they just cannot pull it off beating the game is more of a tedious chore than running around finding aluminum cans in some abandoned cat food factory i gladly recommend the first two thirds of fallout 4 where the wanderlust is high the possibilities of finding a man to shoot and discovering what s around the next corner are unknown because when it tries to rope you into a story fallout 4 is at its most dreadful anything beyond the first two thirds don t bother it s a very good shooter with roleplaying game mechanics but as a fallout game it s sticking to bad habits
