2015 mission control asks me to put a craft into orbit third attempt looks like jeb s gonna be just a little short on fuel again burns all his fuel because he s not gonna make orbit anyway realizes that he did in fact achieve orbit mission control informs him that they didn t tell the recovery team jeb was staying in space so they are still looking for him jeb is about to resign himself to being stuck in space when he has a bright idea climbs out of pod and uses monopropellent jetpack to attempt to push his pod into a decaying orbit succeeds on pushing pod into decaying orbit mission control i m coming home few minutes later jeb and his pod burn up on re entry r i p jeb great game i ve had lots of fun with it so far and reaching the mun s orbit is the farthest i ve made it there are some really cool mods for it too i my personal favorite so far has been the scansat mod also the whole presentation of the game is well done too imo a lot of little details that really make it feel like the kerbals are running the most incompetant space program ever the incompetant space program feeling usually makes accidents more comical than frustrating at least for me it can be difficult to learn but if you have the patience to learn it it s totally worth it at the 40 asking price it s worth more than 99 of aaa 60 games imho
