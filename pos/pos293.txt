2019 i m 31 years old grew up with a nintendo controller in hand harvest moon for me was one of the greatest games for snes my heart always broke when year 3 ended and it was over until continous play came out for the n64 i ve played every harvest moon ever made for every console this is my first review for a steam game i should write more for the long list of great games i ve purchased from steam but this game here i hesitated for months i didn t even know it was multiplayer when i bought it but wow glad i did the programming is clearly far above average here this game has exceeded harvest moon for me in every way i m coming up on buying my 4th copy for friends i ve dreamed of a multiplayer harvest moon and this game is the mirror image of that dream 11 10 programming 11 10 gameplay 1000 worth amazing job concernedape truly my review is an understatement for me as a creator myself hope others notice the sincerity of the effort that went into making this game
