2020 early access review this is a recommendation only for the die hard toddlers and fiddlers out there because remember the 90s and the infamous tamagochis because that is what this game is a tamagochi for car nerds and those in the making with an inkling for late70s technology in a game built for modern high ipc pcs because old unity engine and optimization rarely connect in the same sentence upside your graphics card is irrelevant your cpu s instructions per clock is not so laptop users and sane people please stay away graphics do not even think about touching this this is a grindfest par excellence that lets you experience the joys of carburetted engines that you have to build and finance by running all sorts of time consuming errands loaded with blatant and sometimes black humour presented in a language only the finnish natives and their baltic tribesmen can really comprehend and it is glorious for all the wrong reasons that just work oh so right in this one but maybe just what you are looking for if you are bored out of your guts after weeks upon weeks of self isolation you have been warned
