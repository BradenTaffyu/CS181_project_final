2016 ets2 is one of the most relaxing games i ve ever played there s something so chilled and relaxing about trucking long distances where it s just the truck the road and for me the music i love sitting back with the in game radio on and just driving the in game radio is an internet radio of sorts and you can connect to real radio stations there even has been radio stations made and maintained specifically by and for truck simmers it is a fairly grindy game but usually for me a grindy game is an issue when the gameplay gets super repetitive and boring which it has not for me in ets2 though keep in mind i do only have around 40 hours logged personally i didn t know if i d enjoy it too much i ve never really been into trucking or anything like that but i was very pleasantly suprised by how much fun i ve had with this if you re doubting your interest at least give it a go there is a big map from the get go and coupled with the dlc s it makes for a huge map there are still some portions of the maps which i feel are not very accurate and fairly bland that being the uk being from england i get frustrated at driving in the uk in this game because it doesn t feel as authentic as i feel it could the main concern with the uk driving is the on off ramps of the motorways in the uk the motorways are three lanes and have an additional lane created for the on off ramps in ets2 the three lanes split and one of them is used for the on off ramp this might be a bit nit picky but it just really annoys me of the lack of authenticity presented in the uk side of the map something about the merging from the on ramps would feel pretty enjoyable in my opinion it is very clear from the newest dlc that scs has improved greatly at making the map and i d love to see them do some more revisiting of older sections the developers do indeed still update the game which is very nice to see this is still getting supported even though they ve released american truck simulator there is also a very nice modding scene mods such as promods add even more life into the game adding more countries and improving on some already existing ones it really makes the game feel a lot better to play various mods to add real companies and different trailers are also a must for me i ve seen a lot of people who don t want to play because they don t have a good wheel or whatnot but i ve had absolutely no problems with keyboard and mouse the menus are really well done to allow enough tweaking to make the controls feel comfortable for you overall it s a very relaxing and fun game the trucks feel fun to drive and it s a simulator done right with a pretty decent management system too pros relaxing good modding scene game still supported and updatedcons some parts of the map need some work to bring it up to the standard of some other parts of the map final score 8 10 a must play for anyone
