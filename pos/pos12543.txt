2017 it s super fun to play and great for generally anything making video s creating game modes etc it s generally just the ultimate source game however not that i ve been able to play the previous version but from what i understand from some youtubers who often did gmod videos garrysmod 9 feels like a step backward and although i have no experience to compare it to i do see what they mean some of the settings have been changed to be weird and other features were just outright removed however do i still recommend it hell yes even if the downgrade dumbed the experience down before i even got to experience it it is still hella fun to play
