2017 my rebview coz my names rebus such clever right theres a link for a video version of the review here youtube video total war warhammer a one minute ish review views 817 thanks for watching you enjoy warhammer or previous total war games have you ever played a paradox game and thought geee i wish i could spend even more money on dlc are you are an awful person kept awake at night wishing all games felt like they had quarterly subscription services and thinks dwarves should be easy mode all the time every time then this might be the game for you total war warhammer all the hammers and total war is a total turn based strategy war game with real time tactical battles set in the warhammer total hammer much war fantasy world for the uninitiated might i recommend backing away now before it s too late otherwise welcome to the first stage in the softcore version of games workshops massive up sell scam for those determined to proceed this is a world populated by humans elves orks and various other fantasy tropes and clich s borrowed and made grimdark by people from nottingham the main campaign mode is the star of the show and where i spend most of my time aside from the main campaign there are race specific mini campaigns quest battles custom battles and online battles too with global ranking if thats your cup of tea the main single player experience can be taken online in either co op or standard but only vs 1 friend which in my experience leads to bitterness painful recriminations and a lot of tense silence in the voice chat but utterly still worth a go there is a lot of variety provided by the various factions and start locations with many of the main races and factions represented with more to come fingers crossed for chaos dwarves but y know expect to pay for them this is any other total war game but with smaller scale seige maps more diversity in the factions more diversity in the playstyles nonsense war machines giants and more mythical flying creatures than you can shake a wyvrn at the game has a reasonable narrative in the main campaign but can feel underwhelming if the main antagonists get curb stomped by the first ai they meet becoming little more than a series of irrelevant pop ups id always dreamed about a crossover between total war and warhammer ever since playing the first total war game this comes pretty close to that dream if the idea of a more focussed total war game dressed up in fantasy cosplay appeals to you this game is a must buy if you are a long time fan of total war but appriciate the larger scale of more recent total war games maybe wait for a sale if you watch the video from here lemme know in the comment section if you enjoyed my review check my other reviews either here or on steam
