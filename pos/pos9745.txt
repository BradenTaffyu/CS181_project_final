2018 early access review my first rimworld story went a little something like this justin diva and grim crash down on a small peninsula on the far northeast side of the continent justin was the shy quiet guy who just wanted to mind his own business and not get into any trouble diva well lived up to her name grim was the badass space marine who whipped the two younger fellas into shape the trio built their starting hut it was quite spacious which diva enjoyed they had a little farm going almost unlimited food things were going great then the first attack happened we fended off the first tribal raid pretty effectively we only had minor casualties the only major one being with ole grim getting himself stabbed in the leg it was all downhill from there we went into a food crisis which grim unfortunately never came out of alive pandy our golden retriever didn t take this too lightly and fell into a downward spiral of depression and sadness diva and justin never got over this either one day an evangelist christian was getting chased by some tribals and we decided to let him stay his name was owen and he ended up being a very helpful member of our team he was quite skilled as a doctor and he was friendly too which made him a great addition during all of this justin had taken a liking to diva diva wouldn t have any of it and poor ole justin got himself rejected on 5 occasions it was only til after a month had gone by that diva and justin started a relationship they were quite happy together and they did lots of things with eachother unfortunately they never really lived long enough to get married though an escape pod crashed nearby and we decided to help owen was sent out to rescue fugly yes that was his real name and he brought him back to the colony fugly was the hunter though he was a terrible shot it took him 10 shots on average to hit a boar once though when you put a knife in his hands during a fight he was a beast the thing was that fugly was a well interesting character he apparently took a liking to diva and was interested in sharing her with her boyfriend justin all was going well and the three way relationship was going great then the second food crisis hit the second food crisis started when i wasn t paying attention to how many potatoes we had left for some reason owen didn t feel like replanting the potatoes so we had to resort to hunting in order to barely get enough food to survive which was kind of like rolling the dice because nobody ever knew if fugly would actually do his job some nights were without food and the colonists starved for days on end then james came along he was a motivated farmer and replenished our potato farm he was a great help to the colony and he brought a sense of rejuvination to the depleted depressed and dejected colonists where the only thing they could do for fun was have sex and play horseshoes one day owen s tummy got upset and he went on a fire starting rampage to fill the void inside of him which probably was his empty stomach he started fires all over the colony and he unfortunately decided to light a fire in the room where we were storing high explosive shells the shells detonated and blew out a good third of the colony though we were able to repair the damage to the colony the damage to owen s mind stayed irrepairable meanwhile fugly was dealing with his own starvation induced insanity one morning he picked up a bolt action rifle walked over to our dog pandy and blasted her at point blank range he then proceeded to chop up the golden retriever into steaks in which the colonists all took part in eating during a communal meal a group of pirates raided us again and diva justin and fugly were all injured in their lazy ass attempt at defending the colony several days later diva developed 3 extreme infections and she died shortly afterwards justin being her lover didn t really like that all too much he missed his dead girlfriend and wanted to give her a proper burial but you re not you when you re hungry justin picked up diva from her blood soaked bed and moved her to the dining room floor not even having the decency to put her on the table he started chowing down on his dead girlfriend fugly wandering around the colony strolled into the dining room to find justin eating his dead girlfriend raw on the dining room floor fugly thought it looked yummy and they both started eating her dead corpse sharing it with each other justin felt guilty after eating his girlfriend and his mood points went down however fugly seemed to have enjoyed it he gained positive mood points poor fugly didn t make it too far afterwards he ended up getting food poisoning from diva s infected corpse and he too died a miserable death in a blood soaked bed caused by 5 severe infections and extreme food poisoning justin s life got no better after the diva incident 1 day later a group of pirates broke into the colony smashed his skull with a steel club and took him away to their base in the south that left owen and james alone in what was left of the colony by this point the colony was cold dark blackened and charred by fires the walls were blown out and happiness was nowhere to be found none of them would grow and none of them would hunt in a last ditch attempt at survival i sent them on a mission to the nearest friendly town the two depressed colonists ended up killing themselves half way into the trip the end10 10
