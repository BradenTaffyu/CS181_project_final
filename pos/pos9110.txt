2021 very deep game i was immediately reminded of a favorite 4x space game from 25 years ago ascendancy when i heard the mellow space music so that was a plus already the tutorial is very helpful informative which is needed as there is a lot to learn and do ok after thinking it over i went ahead and bought it to casually enjoy it does seem to be a quality game and i love space opera after reading some reviews about expansions ruining the experience i ll stick with the base game very cool game and very deep each restart i can go further into the story until i realize oops i need to improve focus in order to survive new challenges and game mechanics open up wow i have just the core game and i think that will keep me busy for a long time don t hesitate to try this out ok 4th and final review played a long game had a great time it goes on and on haha the way they progress the game is cool and keeps it relevant interesting there are a lot of options on how to proceed i lernt a key strategy once i had my resources hummin make lotsa star bases for ship building and pump em out baby then ya play wack a mole on the enemy systems and beatem down after that not sure what else there is to do plenty of replayability trying other races i guess but i m done 119 hours not bad
