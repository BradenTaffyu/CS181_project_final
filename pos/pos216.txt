2022 the village has a satanic cult kinda vibe i can feel their malicious intent with each line of dialogue there s something wrong with them they are not like normal people do not trust them the signs are everywhere the god they pray to is nothing like the one we know its something darker evil and corrupt please do not trust the mayor he s trying to deceive you he knows why you are there he knows who you are he might look like a nice old man but he s no longer human once you arrive you cannot leave once you take the bus its a one way trip ever wonder why villagers always casually find you and drop you at the clinic every time you don t go sleep by 2am because they didnt they are always watching you they hide in the woods waiting for you waiting for you to make a mistake or perhaps waiting for the moment you go to sleep so they can perform their satanic rituals without your knowledge nothing is what it seems please remember that you have no allies and no one you can trust they deem you an outsider a danger to their unnerving secret agenda to the terrifying truth about them when the community center is completed there will be a sacrifice and it will be you if anyone else knows about this game s evil secret please leave a comment in this review the more we are the more we can spread the truth
