oh i haven t left a review for this yet enough has been said about sts yes it s that good it s honestly very rare for a game to inspire an entire genre and remain the best game in that genre for half a decade and counting the magical thing about sts is it s a rare kind of video game you can revisit after a few years and nothing in it has changed but somehow it feels completely different you see the game with new eyes and suddenly all of your previous assumptions are a jumbled mess again your old reliable strategies suddenly stopped working what changed cards you never looked twice at are suddenly crushing a run for you a character you never fully understood clicks a character you thought you d mastered is completely eluding you slay the spire is a really good roguelike deckbuilder but the thing it has that many of its would be successors do not is mystique can this or that thing be made to work is it good how do you know when you can take it was that a fluke or did you just invent a playstyle you hadn t considered until its pieces materialized for you you won a run impressive can you do it again but cleaner this time without coming so close to dying at this or that point that deck was fun could you have built it better what was its core what did you think was necessary but wasn t everything answer you arrive to in slay the spire is met with more questions the game doesn t ask you them it just presents problems and pieces of solutions it teaches you to be curious open minded and creative beckons you to try and then try again it isn t just special for the obvious reasons that it is well designed balanced a fun interplay of little challenges and exciting rewards it is special because it infects you with a mental itch that nothing else really seems to scratch you begin by trying to overcome a run and end up trying to overcome an ocean how incredibly appropriate that at the beginning of the game we are greeted by a monstrous whale
