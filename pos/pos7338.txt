2016 scs software has done it again after the surprise massive hit that was euro truck simulator 2 the developers decided to try their hand at expanding the trucking simulation game over to the good ol us of a i bought euro truck simulator 2 on sale for 4 99 quite some time ago and have spent over 100 hours in it as many have it is one of those games i feel immensely guilty for buying on sale because of the quality of content and the massive enjoyment i get out of it it is one of my top played games on steam and i currently own over 1 000 of them it is also the only game i ve ever bought dlc for that wasn t part of the original package in saying that i own thousands of digital games not just through steam or even pc and american truck simulator is the first digital game i ve ever bought at full price or at launch for that matter american truck simulator is one of the few games that lives up to the simulator title it is a top notch simulation game where you must work your way up from an employee that drives trucks for other companies to a trucking business owner with dozens or more of drivers that report directly to you and make you income it is a game that will scratch your simulation business management love of driving relaxation itch all at once this is not a stressful game quite the opposite in fact this is one of those games that you can zone out while playing and relax your mind after a stressful day everything about it has been meant to be relaxing and it succeeds tremendously even missing a loan payment earns you a politely worded letter from the bank telling you they ll extend the extra credit toward you free for a few days until you can pay them back the game works with various controllers from a 360 gamepad which i use to wheels and such if you re interested it also looks beautiful on higher end pcs though i prefer running it on my old non gaming laptop for a small sacrifice in graphics quality and it runs just fine it launched at a 19 99 full price which shocked me i would have gladly paid 59 99 for this i go by the 1 00 per hour of gameplay rule and as you can see i ve already gotten more than my money s worth within the first week of launch the game at launch includes two trucks more to be added for free later on as they sort out licensing for those truck brands who doubted the game s viability and two states california and nevada in over 20 hours of gameplay i have not discovered all cities yet and have covered about 50 of the map there are some concerns over the amount of content the game was launched with or the idea that american truck simulator should have been launched as dlc for ets2 i disagree with this idea ets2 was released in 2012 and is still being actively updated with dlc and free updates including new trucks paint jobs etc i personally like having the two separate and the fact that ats was released for so cheap makes it almost comparable to the price of dlc to begin with i have followed the game s development since it was announced a long while ago i know the work scs software has put in to put loving detail into this game i ve read the updates where they ve written how they ve travelled out to record the audio of engines and carefully map the dimensions of the interiors and exteriors of various trucks for one example this is one developer that has built up trust with me and this comes in a time of corruption from aaa publishers and the media that covers them alike finally what are some of my complaints i only have two and one isn t really a complaint for one thing while the environments are already vast and varied compared to ets2 you now have deserts farmland oceanside big cities like los angeles and las vegas and even what i assume is a redwood forest i do wish there was a way to have a taste of everything america has to offer in this we have so many various landscapes here mountains forests deserts grasslands swamps beaches that it s a little sad that we ll have to wait as the game is expanded over the years to reach them my last complaint and only real one is that the speeding system in this is overbearing compared to ets2 i see more cop cars in an hour of playing this game than i usually see in weeks of real life driving and they can insta ticket you for going 31 in a 30 speed zone for example it happens so frequently particularly starting out when you re getting used to the roads and the system that the resulting fees can cripple a newfound business owner the only fix for this that i ve found is driving at night versus the day time when traffic overall is lower and thus fewer cop cars are roaming about overall i highly recommend that everyone try this game out they released a demo today it won t be everyone s cup of tea but for people who like simulation games driving games or even just let loose and relax games american truck simulator can t really be beat this was my most looked forward to game of 2016 and i m not disappointed i look forward to playing the game as it grows and expands for years to come edit 4 29 2016 i ve noticed that an abnormal percentage of people have marked this review as unhelpful as i always try my best to cover all aspects of a game in a review to be helpful to potential consumers i would appreciate any comments on my review letting me know the information i ve left out or any questions you have about the game which my review left unanswered i will update the review as applicable thank you
