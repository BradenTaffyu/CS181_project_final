2016 early access review feeling sad that there is no zombie apocalypse in real life ever wanted to build awesome fortresses and dig secret tunnels if only it didn t involve physical activity or going outside wish you could shoot people in the face take their stuff and then blow up their house then 7 days to die might be right for you please consult your priorities before playing side effects may include laziness weight gain insomnia muscle atrophy desire to loot toilets and throw poo at people
