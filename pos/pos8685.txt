2022 to be honest the first hours i just walked around impressed be the wonderful nature of hirschfelden it s a contemplative game until you start hunting then it could be quite stressful if you want to complete all the missions that pop up or find diamonds you will probably buy things like the atv or the mobile tent because the area ist so huge glitches i dont like 1 if you follow the tracks of animals you will eventually see them but it seems to be a programmers joke that you allways get a gimpse of their rear end which is just disappearing behind a slope a rock or a bush not funny not realistic so dont follow tracks wait in the need zones 2 if you don t hit the lungs or heart be prepared for a long tracking session that often ends with the animal magically healing disappearing even if they only have 25 percent live graphic overall great but you might soon be aware that you are living in a ring of circles the inner circle show the full 3d word up to 330 meters gras might disappear earlier in the middle circle only sprites 2d versions of trees where shown they get thinned out the further you are away from them the outer circle is the skybox terrain starts around 1000 meters it s modeled in the shape of the terrain of the playable world but unfortunately that didn t work that well that is the reason why the few remaining tree sprites in the far distance often floating in the air that all is okay so far but not if you use your binoculars you than stare in a world of sprites and terrain without gras ugly if possible this should be changed cause this is an immersion breaker other terrain glitches rocks and gras that hover above the ground tells me that the devolopers didnt care about the fine tuning of the world but they should i even found a floting water area a big no no conclusion great game if you are not the type of human that get stressed when new mission pops up immediately after you finish one chilling if you dont hunt for money but relaxed for the perfect hit no no and no twilight sky in layton a screenshot of thehunter call of the wild by
