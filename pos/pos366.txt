2018 stardew valley is probably one of my favorite games to sit down and spend 3 hours completely ignoring my responsibilities and depression it s so relaxing and the characters are lovable and all have interesting stories and personalities stardew valley will continue to be one of the few positive things in my life and i highly recommend this game to everyone and anyone
