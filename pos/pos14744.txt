2018 score 8 10 recommended while sid meier s civilization vi has travelled a rocky road since release with respect to bug fixes missing features and questionable design decisions the game is still an enjoyable and worthwhile addition to the civilization series the game takes risks in introducing us to a whole bunch of new leaders simcity style districts a culture tech tree a beautiful soundtrack that evolves through the ages and eureka moments as sean bean says one does not simply take one more turn when you re playing civilization and this still rings true for civilization vi
