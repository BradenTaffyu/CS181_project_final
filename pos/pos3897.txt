2022 a game that combines two of my most favorite things ever jrpg s xcom so with these materials and our polymerization spell card is the final result something worth summoning the answer is an unquestionable absolutely troubleshooter does an excellent job utilizing the enjoyable turned based strategy system similar to xcom while also incorporating many original ideas to allow character growth build potential to create an enjoyable experience altogether pros interesting world building and characters this aspect might not be for everyone which could make it go into con territory depending on what your thing is although i definitely played through worse narratives troubleshooter kept me engaged so far gameplay loop is fantastic a lot of strategy can be made during a battle itself if you liked xcom then this is an automatic recommend but if you aren t a fan of that type of game play then this may not be for you it also uses a turn order ribbon similar to final fantasy 10 where actions can also manipulate the turn order for an additional layer of strategic value many possible options for character builds there are these things called masteries that act as equippable passive abilities think of something similar to materia from final fantasy except every single one is the purple materia that gives some sort of passive buff that can be utilized and synergized in many creative ways now think about there being 700 of them available in the game wowzers on top of this there is also equipment bonds and other mechanics that help develop your characters further even though you are forced to use premade characters which their own unique skills gimmicks there is still an incredible amount of depth in the system where you can fabricate those characters in unique directions the gameplay and progressions systems is undoubtedly this games strong suit music is pretty solid too i don t feel my ears bleeding at the very least and occasionally find myself nodding my head to a good jam or two during a mission longevity is not an issue you can dump many hours into this game especially considering the price tag if you are a budgeted gamer that needs a game to last them awhile then i think you can get your moneys worth out of this unless you really despise jrpg s xcom or to an extent anime speaking of price tag this is pretty affordable even before a discount so far my impressions are good enough where i would happily still buy it at full price many difficulty options to cater to the type of player you are grinding is also possible so hard content isn t exactly a wall of getting gud its nice to have a game that provide a choice to the player as of the date of this review the game is still getting updates and support since it isn t a dedicated service game eventually that will stop but even if it did at this very moment what we currently have is enough to be satisfied with cons like with xcom sometimes your hit chance rng can screw you over this is inherently something that is always going to exist with these types of games and i don t see a major issue with it although while 95 of the game feels strategic based on your decisions there is always still that 5 of rng that will make you shed tears no character creation will be an immediate turn away for some players nothing wrong with being a gamer that wants to customize their squad in a way they can relate to again i don t think this is a major issue the core foundation of this game probably wouldn t work with character creation there is a lot of customization for combat and build potential although customization settings for aesthetics are lacking i am just listing this here because a lot of players may look at it then think hey anime xcom clone coooooool then dive in expecting a character creation not a big deal to me but can understandably be a deal breaker for some beginning is a tad slow because it spoon feeds the player new tutorials mechanics instead of giving them everything all at once it can feel tedious for players that already understand the fundamentals from other games in the genre the amount of menus options can be intimidating it may take a small amount of time to understand what each thing does and how to use the options the game gives you with that being said it isn t necessarily a grand strategy game so the learning curve isn t as bad as you might think if just looking at screenshots or videos in conclusion i do recommend troubleshooter abandoned children to jrpg xcom fans alike it does a great job taking the best from both then creating something original worth investing your time into while it is a perfect game for a player like myself that is heavily into those genres it may not be perfect for players that aren t a fan of them which is completely ok for those of you that are on the fence then i still recommend giving it a look edit massive respect to any developer that gives direct feedback on reviews they are 100 correct that many of the cons i listed are in fact an inherent effect that comes with the genre even if there are challenges going on with trying to optimize the merging of the two genres from a consumer perspective they still done an incredible job considering the scale of what the devs were trying to create i find myself often saying i can t wait to get a new character i can t wait to see more masteries i can t wait to play more missions while rarely ever saying well i wish this was different so the enthusiasm to see more through progression acts as a testament to an enjoyable experience
