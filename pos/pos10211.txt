2016 early access review i own this game since mid 2014 and been playing it for hundreds of hours again and again overall impression is it s such a great sim game per se these are the core mechanics i particularly like in rimworld task management observation combat and survivalearly game you will want to survive and experience many of the things proposed by the story teller new colonists joining opportunistic events to help you start or that might kill you straight ps starting difficulty must match with what you are looking for and able to do pick and choose carefully mid game the day 2 day job is to maintain a sane environment for your colonists to train and survive many events are there to make you fail at that so make sure to plan observe research and develop skills to compete in your arsh worldlate game the possibility is given to you to build a spaceship to evade from your colony but this is nowhere mandatory you might feel a bit bored after quite a while and many runs but nothing forbids you to try again with a different setup in a different biome with other challenges at one point you might want to consider getting some mods as well to enrich your experience in game conclusion and notes the development process which has not stopped during the while made it so that i played numerous restarts trying to get my brain around new mechanics items and stories i could play with many mods have also been developed around it and it s accessibility in that regard made me love it more and want to participate i found a great community of modders and persons loving the thing too which in return gave me some more great moments to experience with discovering new technics or facts i did not know about for these reasons and even if only for playing i would recommend this great piece of entertainment to anyone who likes simulation tactical games
