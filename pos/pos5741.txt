2021 early access review this game reminds me a lot of crusader kings 3 both m b bannerlord and ck3 are sequels to highly successful games milestones in their respective genres with this huge shoes to fill both bannerlord and ck3 choose to improve graphics and user experience over reworking the complex mechanics of their predecessors there s reason why both m b warband and crusader kings 2 are arguably better games still i have high hopes both for ck3 and m b bannerlord i believe that a graphical update was needed and that both long time players and newcomers can enjoy the new games we old timers can always go back to the old school if we really want to i still play ck2 and warband other aspect that brings both games together is the huge and dedicated modding scene that the prequels have i have high hopes for the bannerlord modding scene but i ve read that taleworlds updating of the game has broken many mods hopefully the game ll reach a more stable state that ll allow the modders to work i m really looking forward to some mods like kingdom come or paris commune to anyone interested the single player game is playable in linux via proton wine but the multiplayer doesn t on account of battl eye anti cheat being incompatible with the linux kernel how i wish that tw dropped battl eye and changed their anti cheat approach since from what i ve read battl eye hasn t been successful in preventing cheating but that s a far shot keeping my fingers crossed for a native linux version but that seems unlikely any time soon
