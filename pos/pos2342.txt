2023 this game is overwhelming in the beginning and then underwhelming in the end if you ve played fallout 4 and enjoyed it then you should play this and build something to remember how great of a game this series is overall this games is trash but its worth it if you love the series like i do its definitely a game you waste 100 hours on and then move onto another game so i recommend you buy this on a massive discount otherwise you re just burning money
