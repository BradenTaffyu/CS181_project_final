2017 wow i honestly don t even know where to start with this review i have not been blown away by a game on this level in such a long time and i feel somewhere in my heart i won t find another game to match this feeling at all i had high expectations for nier autotmata but it surpassed it in every single way the story was told beautifully and was very complex and deep the music for the game was absolutely stunning and easily one of the best ost i have heard in a game i don t believe there was a single piece of music from this game that i didn t like i m going to try and keep this review fair with my pros and cons with it as well as avoid any major spoilers as much as possible storyi can t delve too far into the story without spoiling anything but i can give a little insight on it nier automata is a sequel from the original nier game but it s not connected where you have to play the original nier to understand this game from what i ve read as i did not play the original nier this game takes place thousands of years after the original there are a few tidbits that will make reference to the original and a few characters from the original do make a return but nothing that will hamper you from playing the game the story starts off about a war between androids and machines who were created by aliens humanity had to escape to the moon in order to survive and sent androids to rid the machines and aliens so life on earth can resume once again as you progress through the game you will see how deep it really begins to hit how little things that seemed insignificant at first actually play a deeper role in the meaning of the story taro yoko did a fantastic job at a story that really toys with the what does it mean to be human aspect and that made the story that much stronger and hold a bigger connection with it graphicsthe graphics for this game were absolutely beautiful from the crisp feel of the grassland to how clear the water looks excellent lens flair from the sun and overall textures of your surroundings i will admit which i will touch more in the cons there are some areas that look lackluster graphic wise however the overall world of nier has beautiful graphics that really set the mood for what is happening at that moment soundtrackthis soundtrack was phenomenal as i said before i can t think of a single piece of music from this game that i didn t like i am honestly one of the people who hate vocals in game music except for maybe credits or a cutscene but then i played this game and the vocals with the music blew me away i really love the idea they did with the music where it will change based on the mood of the game whether it s a scripted event or just completing a quest a quest or scripted event will change based on the mood of that moment it s fantastic and it makes the game have a stronger connection as during those moments you see how music can quickly change your overall mood within the game and what s going to happen next gameplayvery interesting with how this game has played out it s a hack and slash game but also carries aspects of bullet hell open world exploration and of course an rpg jrpg a few of my friends have compared aspects with the game having a feel of dark souls and metal gear rising revengeance which i won t argue their points with that one thing i really liked is the network system that was added in basically if you choose to connect to that any player who has died in a certain spot in the world you will find their body which you can choose to retrieve and in turn will give you a certain amount of gold and a temporary boost to 3 stats you can also choose to revive them and have them as a temporary ally to help you fight until they either die or blow up from being alive for too long or you leaving them behind by dashing faster than they can hope to keep up with you consonto the cons which i know can either break a deal for people but i want to be fair with this review the game had a bumpy launch i won t even try to deny that it was bumpy as it there were some users who couldn t play the game on a 960m 960 970 rx 480 and even the pascal gpus people were mentioning either really low fps white screens or flat out crashes this had me worried as i was planning to play the game on 4k while most of these people were on 1080p and having these issues thankfully this was not an issue for me and 4k ran without any issues some people in the community have made their own little fixes for now that can help you play the game or get the desired fps if you re playing on a lower end system the devs are working on their own patches on this game to get everything up and running for everyone cut scenes are capped to 30 fps capped fps is a word that will turn a lot of people off and i don t blame you the cut scenes would look absolutely stellar if they were uncapped even with the cap i love how the graphics look for cut scenes i can only wait until they re uncapped some users have mentioned the audio isn t fully correct in the cut scenes and that fps can also tank i have not had any of those happen to me but i want to mention it just as a small heads up apparently the game was locked at 900 resolution for users even if you had a monitor with a much higher resolution this wasn t the case for me but others have to use 3rd party programs such as borderless window in order to have the max resolution of their monitor earlier i mentioned there were some parts of the game that had poor graphic spots most of the time i noticed this by windows where the sun was showing in where the glare from the sun would look a little blurry and or pixelated the castle in the forest is the best example i can think of with this issue other than that i ve only really seen it a few times when near water and at a weird camera angle this personally isn t a con for me but i know it will be a con to others this game can be tedious at the start you will be doing a lot of back tracking until you progress far enough into the story where you can freely transport between places you have discovered quests will have you running back and forth item collection will require you to grind enemies to further increase your level and give you items to survive at the later levels if you re someone who enjoys this stuff it won t be a con at all for you but i know some people prefer to play games as quickly as possible without having to grind or backtrack a lot summary fantastic story that has a deep meaning behind it and really sucks you into the world of nier a very serious touching and at times has it s funny moments music that keeps the mood and setting of the game which further delivers the experience to you and makes the moment feel more alive that it would be without the music beautiful graphics that really shine no matter where you re at in the world giving you a whole new outlook on what is around you at those times and scenery you won t forget gameplay was a perfect mix of adventure attacking and of course story telling enemies scale with your level and the world around you changes as time goes on 2b s thighs thoconclusion nier was the perfect game for me honestly it messed me up after finishing what routes i ve finished already because i feel in my heart i won t find a game to match this story i have never felt connected to a story at all especially on an emotional level but nier honestly went above and beyond my exceptions with everything that came with it it has easily become one of if not my favourite game it s a game i will always cherish to own and be a part of the story gameplay music 10 10 i honestly cannot recommend a game more than nier automata and i hope taro yoko gets the recognition he deserves from this masterpiece
