2016 april 2021edited to reflect new overall sentiment and improve readability fallout 4 is the next in the series after new vegas though obsidian is not involved anymore presentation it s very atmospheric it grabbed me in way that no fallout game had done previously at the time of originally writing there was something deeply unnerving about having to scavenge for supplies while gunfire and explosions rang through empty streets fallout has always held some form of humor of the mostly ironic variety regarding what is colloquially known as the end of the world it is not lost here mechanically it does not stray far from its predecessors v a t s is still here however unlike its predecessors i found myself not using v a t s much stay for a stubborn bloatfly that just wouldn t stay still long enough the actual gunplay itself is much improved the gunplay feels much more feasible for actual use than previous titles and because of this now much more fiendish and unfriendly more fast paced world i felt on edge almost all the time especially when in a new location i ve yet to explore of course once you ve leveled into oblivion that feeling goes away once you become established it becomes a more traditional bethesda open world experience wherein you start as basically nothing and end up leading multiple groups and basically are known throughout the land though the game will eventually force you into taking sides the commonwealth has no real structure and you re going to need to supply that structure the settlements are where your establishment will take place a place to return to to keep precious items materials for crafting as well as produce your own products to use and sell back into the world and create an economy the settlements also took hold of me although i must say i find it a bit of a cheap tactic to create more gameplay albeit an effective one and i don t see it going anywhere soon i found myself spending hours clearing out everything within the active area of a workshop and placing things required to make them more functional it was almost cathartic the depth of customization in settlements especially the time spent on my own home getting lost in that customization in hanging signs placing rugs in front of bar stools setting up the lighting and wiring to generators in practice you can build an actual small city or perhaps town more accurately the dramatic aspect of this is should you decide to you can ignore this completely i even set up my own water purifying ring for a business as well as wired up a circuit to open traps and tame wild animals to increase security at my base i often just used it as a stock pile for my settlers to gather resources for me to use to repair my power armor i know it s tough but please be as detailed as you can who stole your sweet roll d a screenshot of fallout 4 by spacecouncil what s maybe more important settlements are completely optional stay for having to build a few items at certain point in the narrative which still does not require you to actually build a settlement the construction just takes place on one it s essentially a really big workbench small complaints and grievances the role playing is rather limited in character builds generally resulting selecting the same perks it s more of an action game with rpg elements dialogue is reduced to yes no sarcastic and some approximation of tell me more with minor variations based on situation such as more important story decisions the leveling in this is also less then stellar however it indeed has pros and cons the cons being no longer do you have separate skills from your overall level earned by doing the actions such as lock picking instead you are greeted with a large visually informed sheet in where you can obtain perks hindered only by your character base stats example 7 endurance will only allow you to to obtain perks that require that or less becoming ghoulish the ability for rads to heal you requires end 9 the radiant quests are another issue these do not end and they are great at first often sending you to new unexplored locations but eventually that ends and they start sending you to kill all the things or find the thing and bring it back in locations you ve already discovered which in its own right isn t a bad thing but ultimately becomes a double edged sword it can bring gameplay that ostensibly lasts forever the downside of this is that it s gameplay that will last forever so if you re someone that needs a sense of completion to feel resolved you won t find it in those quests you may in fact feel irked by them still being in your in quest log when you finally decide to stop playing even well after the main quest the game has some really good side content as well namely the jack cabot and silver shroud questlines i found these two questlines to be quite interesting both with different outcomes depending on different choices the gistfallout 4 is understandably polarizing the settlement aspect can be needlessly petty and require excessive amounts of micro management but it can also be very satisfying if you take the time the dialogue reduction is not great but that s the decision they went with there s always mods i had an overall mixed reaction this game when it first came out i had heard so many bad things before even giving it a chance however upon playing it the first time took me about 80 hours i found many of those things forgivable or simply untrue the optimization is still weird random frame drops occur all the time loading times are still bad even on an ssd or m 2 apparently load times are tied to framerate untested but turning off v sync seems to be the resolution this does make the physics slightly unpredictable though the same thing that makes fallout 4 tedious and annoying is what also makes it great it doesn t really end and replayability is high due to the narrative forcing you into taking sides this also occurs in the far harbor and nuka world dlcs which are both separate maps from the commonwealth far harbor could have been its own game in my opinion i d put it up in the same echelon as blood and wine for witcher 3 as far as dlc expansions go nuka world is most assuredly not as great but it s not bad either i do find it odd that you can t access it until you re level 30 though would make more sense if it scaled to your level i ve honestly fallen in love with fallout over my time playing fallout 4 and i would be remiss that suggest someone not play because it s not exactly the best sequel to fallout 3 or new vegas i d love to see a remaster for those games as well as the isometric fallout games when i first played this in 2016 i did in 1600x900 low settings i had to change some ini files to get 21 9 to work but here we are a screenshot of fallout 4 by spacecouncil if you ve read this far consider following my curation station argusthe wasteland series actually pre dates fallout but it simply lacks the reverence that many including myself hold for fallout another settlement needs your help or doing the brotherhood questline this time ad victoriam a screenshot of fallout 4 by
