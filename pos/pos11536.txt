2015 early access review this game is coming along nicely more content is being added all the time the bugs are what bugs seriously very minimal bugs the dev s are keeping this nicely polished the game even though in alpha stage has alot going for it atmosphere great feeling game that really changes moods not for the faint of heart or easily creeped out this game has feeling by the bucketload at times you will be hiding in a corner sometimes you will be sprinting for your life while your heart tries to beat out of your chest and other times you may completely lose your mind and go on a rampage throwing all caution to the wind as you exact your wrathfull vengence upon the undead for daring touch your beloved minibike playability this is a game you can really spend alot of time on without realising that its 2am and you need to start work at 8am there is countless things to do in 7 days by yourself or in a group you will have no trouble finding things to do explore build repair renovate create be mischievous compete and survive interface the feel of this game is great and it has really been done well the menu s are simple but indepth you can couple click start or you can spend time adjusting how you want the game to be difficulty levels can be rather casual up to insanely messed my pants scary hard controlling the character is very smooth easy and just feels so good the ingame crafting is fantastic the best i have seen graphics very pretty graphics are up to scratch and have all the nice bits that one would expect from a modern game with great lighting effects and smoothness of images the landscapes and buildings look fantastic and make it easy to sink into the feel of the game conclusion there are alot of crafting games that have followed and ridden on the success of minecraft and now there is literally a vast sea of minecraft zombie survival type games available now most of them in alpha beta stages some are ok and some are absolute rubbish 7 days clearly stands above the horde with top marks in all the right places you will not find a better game in this genre
