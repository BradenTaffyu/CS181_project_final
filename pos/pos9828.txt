2017 early access review if you are a fan of sim building micro managing games do not look further there is no game i repeat no game better than this one this game is satisfying heart warming brutal and ice cold at the same time everthing can go pretty well your crops are growing animals are being trained and hauling all resources you need art is being crafted meals are being prepared and then a cold snap followed by toxic fallout followed by a raid followed by man hunters and you are left without food all animals and plants in the region killed by the toxic build up and a colonist who got his eye shot out one who s leg got bitten of a colonist who s so depressed he starts to set fire to everything and on top of that some of your animals got killed by a bear and you will love every minute of it
