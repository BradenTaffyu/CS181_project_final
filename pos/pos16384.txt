2016 early access review i was born in 1986 so i didn t have my own car in the 1990s yet but i remember those times quite well my grandpa used to have a yellow datsun 100a and my cousin had a brown one which we used to drive on an icy lake and pull a stiga sled behind it i live in a small town in eastern finland so i feel right at home in this game i m almost expecting to find a commodore 64 or amiga or a 486 pc in the player character s room or a lego space police set as a memento of his childhood in the eighties i remember when we were told to take the telephone cord off the wall socket when a thunderstorm came i remember that blue camo pattern being used everywhere i remember my aunt owning a shop that was just like teimon kauppa so this game has got the world just right there aren t even all that many bugs for an early access game a lot of stuff that people think happen because of bugs are actually due to them not understanding how to do things a good general advice for this game would be this if you know how to do something in real life you should know how to do it in this game don t expect anything to happen with just one push of a button except for peeing and swearing for example refueling the van doesn t just happen magically when you park next to the fuel pump and maybe press the use button but instead you will have to open the fuel filler door unscrew the cap take the pump handle in your hand and put it in the fuel filling hole then you go to the counter at the shop and pay just like real life only real problem with that is that it s not always immediately obvious how exactly to do the actual details of something like for example the precise place to position the oil canister at when pouring oil into the engine but when you have done something once it turns out to work in a logical way and your subsequent tries at doing that thing will become easier until it s second nature to someone who doesn t know a whole lot about cars assembling the satsuma car will be like a memory game you will probably watch a video of someone else doing it first then try to remember the order of parts and the right wrench size at first you will make mistakes and have your car leaking oil or just not running because you forgot some small detail then you will try again and remember a bit more then you will die of thirst because you forgot to drink then you will remember most of how to assemble the car and guesstimate the rest and have a car that s at least somewhat drivable then you suddenly realize that now you know about cars at least that one specific make and model the audiovisual presentation is actually not bad for something like this while the few npcs found around the map and the tree models look like something from 2001 the main car in particular is nicely modelled and the lighting in the game looks quite nice the sound effects are just right and although the voice acting could certainly be better it does elicit a few laughs at least the radio plays a variety of music and speech programs that contain a lot of quality finnish humor sadly they are lost on foreign players my favorite radio program is marko kahjo a parody and spot on impression of markus kajo overall the game is a fun and weird experience for an early access game made by just a couple of people the few problems it has mean nothing
