2014 early access review plays like a finished game definitely worth buying in my opinion better then dayz and rust because of the intensive crafting system and the hordes of zombies the pictures dont do the game justice the graphics are actually pretty good as good as rust graphics but less realistic then dayzthis game is basically minecraft and dayz combined
