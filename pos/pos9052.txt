2021 stellaris is a science fiction strategy game which judging by the random events was probably made by the nerdiest sociologists to exist although the endgame kinda collapses without mods figuring the early to midgame out is entertaining and the game has that just one more month appeal the base game price is a lie though you will want or maybe need the utopia dlc for a properly fleshed out midgame and compatibility with many of the mods that fix it none of the other dlcs matter as much
