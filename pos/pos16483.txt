early access review lots of fun but a lot of dead air between jobs sometimes you can wait for days before you get any jobs they usually come in waves no shops are open during the weekend meaning that all you can do is to watch the rally on tv or drive there since the rally is on the road that you need to drive on to get to any other place in the game you are risking destroying your car if you don t have time to move out of the way of rally contestants no money no new parts to install nothing to doand since most new parts only take a few hours out of the in game day to install you re often left to go on the wiki and try to tune your car or what not most of the game is cryptic and not everything is intuitive building and starting the car for the first time is what s most fun doing the jobs feels rewarding but when there are no jobs to do at all and no work to do on the car you re just left standing around checking fluid levels and alt tabbing the game wasting time in your preferred way another issue is that if you get stranded it will take you over an hour just to walk home from some places and in the beginning you don t have the van at all times meaning you will most likely not be able to repair the car stuffing the moped in your trunk of the satsuma is not an option it will lag out your car you have your drunk cousin which you can use to hitchhike home or to town but i have never been able to do that because he never shows up when i actually needed him he also doesn t brake when you re driving into a head on collision which will kill you both or one of you meaning it s perma death or you re sent back to town depending on if you are on mortal mode or not with no good mode of transport unless you have two vehicles and left one in the town in case you died and i think that you get jail time if you collide with your cousin and going to jail is literally just a waiting game sometimes you do things that you don t even know are illegal or some guy runs out into the road and gets run over before you can hit the brakes there is a cheat mod that allows you to skip time and teleport but i don t want to have to do that all of this is very frustrating but this game is still very fun it has incredible highs and terrible lows
