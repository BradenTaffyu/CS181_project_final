2018 assetto corsa s history assetto corsa as we know it today doesn t have any predicessors or follow up games although many believe ac is netkar pro s follow up you can kind of compare this to half life and counter strike two completely different games but built off of the same engine and made by the same guys over at kunos simulazoini netkar pro was an underrated game in the sim racing community that released in 2007 and was way ahead of it s time netkar pro featured some of the most advanced driving physics sompared to any other racing simulator at the time and featured elements such as dynamic visual tire wear and rain models however there wasn t a big community that supported it enough to have the game stick around for a bit longer then it did ac released in december 2012 and had a lot of features netkar pro did not have such as singleplayer mode this time with ai an open ended eco system to support modding and also aquiring official licensed content netkar pro only had 3 out of it s 15 pieces of content that were officially licensed after the sim racing community got hold of this information about the game sim racers were very eager to get their hands on it and it delivered there was a test demo that released before the actual release of the game and it was amazing the physics were spot on and the game performed well my experience now my experience playing assetto corsa which i will sometimes refer to ac has been one major blast ac is definetely one of the best and most fun games i have ever played ac is basically the best that you can get from a cheap simulator for only 25 or even 15 on sale you really can t go wrong if you re a true automotive enthousiast if you are a hardcore sim racer ac should be a no brainer and has to be part of your sim racing arsenal of games i have spent a huge amount of time playing this game and i am not even close to have done it all this is because of the ac modding community in ac like in call of duty world at war you can download modded content completely for free from external websites this means you can never really run out of content because there is always new content being created uploaded and thought of as you re not playing the game doing something else however i think there are couple of points that you may have to consider before you get your hands on assetto corsa considerable flaws in terms of driving and physics ac is really as good as it gets as of now in 2018 however there are a couple bugs with the high aerodynamic cars in the game they tend to struggle a bit in low speed corners but that might be fixxes since this review will be dated some time in the future as of now david daminges who is a physics ac modder who is namely known for designing formula rss2 and the formula hybride and he stated that the physics engine in assetto corsa has some issues when it some to stiff cars and body roll i do not notice it too much but others have complained about it so be aware of that also i come from console racing games and have mostly played sim cades such as the gran turismo and forza series in those games mostly gran turismo you have a story line that i am really missing in assetto corsa the challenges just really aren t good enough for me and story mode or as it was called gran turismo mode is what i miss most about my old console games when i just bought the game and kind of got used to the physics i tried playing online however i didn t expect it to be quite this difficult i didn t get why i could or couldn t join some servers i had to look up a tutorial on youtube for me to understand this should never be the case i mean come on playing some online gran turismo or forza was waaay easier than this to me it is a serious let down the user interface really doesn t cut it for me after recently having downloaded assetto corsa content manager it s not that big of a deal anymore but good god how can you mess up a ui this bad assetto corsa doens t have a very good replay system it s laggy probably because of optimisation issues and the angles are lacking if you are a replay kind of guy like me this could be an issue for you although i play assetto corsa a lot i have never played on the controller i have played other racing games with a controller however i think since assetto corsa is a real simulation game i think playing with a controller is going to drastically change your experience and performance i really do recommend buying a force feedback wheel for these kinds of games final words after pointing out these flaws of assetto corsa i still believe it s a game worth buying i say this because assetto corsa s perfection in lots of ways makes these flaws not hurt the game assetto corsa has more than half of it s tracks laser scanned plenty of content great physics online mode is great and the ai just does it s job these are the things you ask from a sim it s very straight forward it does the job i recommend to anyone who has a history of playing racing games if you are starting out however you might have to look into simcades like gran turismo or forza first
