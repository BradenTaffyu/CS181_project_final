2019 many have already stated what makes this game so great so i ll just list the two cons i ve found 1 barebones inventory management hope you don t mind opening sorting and closing boxes a million times 2 intentionally misplaced save point the game doesn t let you save at any time it only autosaves and only when a new day starts as you ll see this is the point when you least feel like stop playing for those of us who are easily hooked by games we enjoy this can be really harmful as it easily leads to playing just one more day again and again until you ruined your sleep hours
