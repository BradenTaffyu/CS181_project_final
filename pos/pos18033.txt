2017 rome 2 had a rocky start for about a year after release the game was in horrible shape ca sega released the game as finished when there was still 18 months of game breaking bugs to fix in patches rough edges to smooth over and a large amount of dlc that should have been included in the base game however now that its over rome 2 is perhaps one of the best total war games to date even now in 2017 i absolutely recommend you buy this amazing game it takes a little while to figure out what you re doing and why certain units tactics are more effective than others but once you do its an extremely immersive experience that really throws you into ancient times what i like so much about this game is how many great balancing features this game has which attila and warhammer got rid of i believe the total war franchise is getting increasingly easier and therefore a lot less fun from rome 2 onwards so rome 2 is an interesting balance of the difficulty and immersion of older total wars with the features and graphics of the newer ones buy this game and all the dlc cuz its worth it
