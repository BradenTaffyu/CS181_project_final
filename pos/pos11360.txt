right now the price is pretty damn steep to suggest a buy i would not buy it until bigger updates get released personally it s only fun with friends and a large group too the game has good progression but eventually you will stop playing and restart that s fine though getting a restart every 6 12 months is fun for the game and keeps it alive you ll get more info every single time you do but it was like 12 last time i checked 45 for this game right now no even worse if you want a group to drop that amount i still recommend but please buy only when they drop the major updates npcs storyline
