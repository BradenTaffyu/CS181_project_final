2020 i know there are a lot of meme reviews for this and haha you can flip the table but this is honestly one of the best things you can buy on steam if you have someone to play with you during the lockdown we played gloomhaven on this and when we tried it irl again it felt worse scripted boardgames are something you never knew you wanted in your life but it cuts down on setup time on management time and helps you just enjoy the game there are quite a few games i own irl i d rather play on here than in real life just because it is so much more convienient and enjoyable it s also just so easy to try a game and decide if you wanna invest all that money overall 20 is a steal for the amount of time you are going to spend with this
