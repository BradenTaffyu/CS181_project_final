2021 spoiler free review with a short and a longer version buy this game if you re interested in farming even though you re allowed to make that it isn t 100 of the core gameplay you were looking for a long yet various and easy to be resumed game you re fond of pixelated indie games you can bear resource hunting and you have some patience as there are some rpg and crafting gameplay you love games that are supported by modders and regularly updayed by the developer himself update 1 5 see longer review part down below don t buy the game if those above points aren t significant for you verdict 9 an indie masterpiece which now includes also the december update called 1 5 update time required to get to the grown up part of the game 50 hours depending on player s choices skill and luck time required to get all the achievements around 100 hours just the achievements i mean i haven t completed the whole new update as this is my third gameplay longer version let s see now the most important points including the dlc described in the 6th bullet point 1 the simple yet deep premise your grandpa who lived the last part of his life is stardew valley has passed away and you as his nephew niece have inherited a plot of land in stardew valley itself bored and saddened by the repetitive and dull life that you re spending working in a big firm feel free to imagine it as amazon nestl you decide to accept the inheritance and embark in this new life and adventure 2 the core gameplay is based on farming but you can drop it or leave it aside after a while you re free to design your gameplay even though clearing debris pruning weeds killing evil monsters and cutting trees is fun and necessary up to a certain point you re not forced to keep farming 24 7 as the game is full of side activities who can be remunerative and of course fun such as tending to animals mining foraging fishing more 3 the customization has a external and a deeper side this means that besides customizing your own home buildings and clothes there is a skill system which can shape and improve the way on how you ve decided to play the game 4 stardew valley is a living community its people are likable and your activities make a difference the npcs are actually interesting and they re worth your time socializing with them helping them and confronting them on events quests is always a good distraction and worth your time as they ll be quite rewarding in terms of money items and story progression in general even though you re not forced to follow any particular path your actions have consequences that will also change the landscape and the city 5 there s a strong and thriving mod community and the game allows multiplayer gameplay i personally recommend stardew valley expanded as a mod to be installed feel free to check it on nexusmods6 the 1 5 update is extremely good and needed my biggest gripe with sv before this free massive update from december 2020 was that there wasn t enough end gameplay elements or goals to be reached this update addressed completely these issues by adding a new whole area distant from stardew valley by adding new minerals animals crops quests weekly quests npcs and much more including many quality of life changes which make the gameplay much smoother and fluid thanks for reading and for bearing up with me leave a comment below if you have any questions or observations have an amazing day night feel free to follow my other reviews at
