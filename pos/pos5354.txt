2017 early access review i ve played over a 200 hours of this game played on two accounts i evangelize it to friends family and strangers alike but idk what to say in a review should i approach the review from the angle of this game has the most active devs imaginable and new stuff is added every friday with development streams on twitch every thursday or holy f cking sh tballs you can play a psychic turtle gunslinger who has four arms and is bros with fungi and is not welcome in the holy places of cats i mean the first option seems most appealing on paper as it is the most measured and most rationally persuasive but i know that it has usually been the weird reviews that get me to buy games so i m going to do both in the last two months a major feature arc was added to the game the water ritual fresh drinkable water is scarce in qud so much so that the standard unit of currency in the game is about an ounce of water to gift your life preserving water to someone is a show of great respect and brotherhood doing so is so culturally important in qud that it happens in a form of ceremony that is acknowledged and respected by all of the 40 factions of qud commencing this ritual boosts your reputation with the faction whose leader you gifted the water but it also decreases it with the enemies of that person each named npc in qud has a generated history and reputation with every faction in the game which is different each time you play this means depending on who you encounter in a given game you can make friends with even the most initially hostile of factions now lets talk crazy you know how most games when they do something unbalanced that breaks the game they usually nerf that power by making it less powerful caves of mud had that problem with its psychic class of mutant so did the debs make the psychics less powerful no they created an in game multiverse and sent extra dimensional enemy psychics to hunt you down if your psychic power grew to such prominence that it threatened the stability of the universe that was a nerf adding a multiverse was a nerf they did that three weeks ago i have bought this game for friends and family just so i could be able to talk to them about it i have offered to buy this game for complete strangers who were on the fence about it if you aren t already playing it you owe it to yourself to give it a try don t let early access tag fool you this game has more polish and devotion poured into it than chrome on the towering spindle that pierces the skies to the far east descend into the caves of qud claim their secrets tempt fate and survive live and drink wayfarer
