2022 rimworld herald of many memes taker of things we did not want to lose jester of that fist fight with a rabbit destroying someones eyeballs rimworld rides a fine line that is between an experiment and game between a fully fleshed out world and an open ended interpretation you have to fill in with imagination rimworld never truly has enough graphical fidelity to be clear about what you are looking at but you will fill in the blanks i have format i try to adhere to when reviewing games rimworld does not conform to what i would describe as an average game so instead allow me to do what rimworld does best tell a story my game started with the crash landed three survivors under an extremely hot sun they toiled taking shifts to survive the extreme desert they found themselves in they were desperate to get a roof over their heads and create a sanctuary against the heat in the distance a drop pod came crashing down the most qualified doctor was sent to retrieve the survivor if there was one upon inspection of the unfortunate soul he discovered it was his wife knowing that death was only hours away he began frantically treating her bloody wounds afterwards he began the excruciating task of carrying her back to base he even gave up his bed to speed up her healing and ensure her the best chance of survival the following day it was discovered that she had an infection a disastrous side effect from immediate treatment in the desert and not a cleaner room days passed her husband stayed with her every day when his tasks were over he fed her by hand bite by bite he cheered her up while she attempted to fight off the fever she reminisced with him about times and events the others were not privy to nor invited to learn about eventually the fever broke and she recovered well enough to walk what words were shared between those two none know i can only imagine her bittersweet smile towards her husband when she left all we know is she headed north back to the group she was currently helping with perhaps her people need her just as badly as we need our doctor i will never know that was about 40 minutes of my game this experience leads my recommendation and it will stay with me far longer than any triple a game on the market because it was organic and emergent you just do not get this in other games that have structured stories rimworld is a story generator as well as a game the event chosen was a normal rng event of a crash landed survivor mechanically the game is trying to give you another colonist for task balancing however through the random assignments it also chose to make her the wife of one of my current colonists who happened to be my doctor her recruitment was also not guaranteed maybe one day in the future i would have seen his wife again other games do not do this they never provide you with enough bread crumbs for you to fill in the rest of the gaps if you are willing to get through a rather steep learning curve you can experience these scenarios as well fill in the gaps the way you want to create your own stories edits spelling grammar i am also reviewing each expansion read on if you want
