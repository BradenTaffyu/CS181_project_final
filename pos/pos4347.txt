2016 potential for endless fun warband can be extremely unforgiving for the inexperienced the game holds your hand for only the very beginning and full freedom to pillage or protect empires is available at a very early stage something that is appreciated when starting new campaigns after having learned the game but can be tricky in the very beginning with the potential to build massive armies and conquer castles and cities alike i feel like even those that are not too familiar with videogames can be fascinated by it s possibilities historical accuracy and mechanics overall it s an great game that stood the test of time and can provide hours of fun providing you look past the old graphics and somewhat clunky mechanics by today s standards
