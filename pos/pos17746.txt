this game is not as terrible as the others make it sound it is kinda good but not that good the good unit variety huge maps blood and sand dlc is epic great artwork and graphics i love how the politics for plotting gossiping etc works in this game probably one of its best changes in the total war series in terms of political family tree interactions religion is better this time around much more effects and interactivethe bad gets stale pretty fast ai gets overwhelmed to fast no water battles not a fan of it in the first place but still the ugly not really the era most people would think about when you talk about total war sea people should have been included in vanilla release free dlc though animations and locations maps are repetitive
