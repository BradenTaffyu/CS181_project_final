2014 of all the games i play during my life mount and blade warband is a really amesome game that i would seriously recommend i play 100 hours on this game when i got the non steam verison but i change computers and i lost the discs to reinstall it so i decide to buy it on steam anyway back to the review wait i m being very serious in this review wow what this game is about you ask well its little hard to explain it so i will try my best its a medievel sim with rpg elements and set in a fictional world know as calradia i can t proannouce the name either what really sets it apart from all other games is that it so fun to lead your own army which i will explain that later now i know what your asking are the graphics any good bro well in a way no i know what your saying next ewwww the graphics suck no buy well if you love to judge a game by graphics then by all means do sure it not the best but hey the graphics are better then what you get in infestation survivor stories right now what about the gameplay you ask well i can tell you that its really fun you start your jounery by filling out your skills basicly it would look like this then your off to createing your character which look like this then your done now let talk about what this game is about there are six factions in this game swadia rhodok vaegirs khergit khanate nords and the sarranid sultanate note you don t join one of the factions when you start the game you only join them when you are a merc or a vassal which i will explain later now it will be basicly hard to explain these factions so i will let this page explain it for you now there is alot to talk about so try to stay with me you start out in some area of your choice the faction areas the map is pretty big here this pic to give you a idea what it look like you start out you will be fighting bandits doing quests from towns and doing small tasks from the lords vassals the game goverment system is based on feudalism it basicly means that the king shall give you fiefs land in exchange for service basicly fighting for your king now in order to become a lord vassal to a faction you must do tasks for the lords bulid up some rep etc when you become a vassal the king of a faction will give you the poorest village in the faction s territory because he a when you get a fief villages castles citys you will get taxes from that fief and you can bulid improvements in that village castle or city but they will cost you alot and they take a long time to finish and also you will get a castle or city in late game now let talk about your personal army you will raise a army for yourself note you will not make a huge army the size of 1000 keep dreaming you can raise a army by hireing men from villages saveing prisoners or just hire mercs they will cost you however you will have to take care of your army you must keep there morale high buy food for your army get them heal up if some of your men are wounded pay their wages etc now in order to make some money you would have to1 loot and sell2 taxes3 get pay from a questnow let talk about how being a lord is like basicly you serve your faction to fight aganist other factions that your faction is at war at get a alot of fiefs to earn more money get the other lords to be your friends or if get lucky get to be elect for marshall basicly a marshall is someone who can summon the lords to fight for him like capture a very strong castle citys etc this is what it would look like note the marshall in that pic is not a human player oh i forgot to explain the rpg elments in this game you can buy armor weapons and a horse for yourself to protect yourselves when you fight in a battle basicly this is what your inventory would look like note the person in this pic have just start a new game now let talk about combat the way you swing your sword axe etc depends on where you swing your mouse for example if you move your mouse to the right the weapon will swing right and so on the battles in this game really depends on 3 things1 how many soliders2 how strong is your army3 the most important one tactics and strategythis is just a example of what your company army page would look like note the person in this pic had capture a castle and is now takeing prisoners now what about what the battles well the battles are the fun part this is what a battle would look like or this the land or environment you would be playing on depends on where are you fighting at for example if you are fighting on a snowy place then you be fighting on a snowy battlefield and etc but be warn you must be careful or elas you would end up like this poor soul what about castle and citys are there sieges the answer yes when you siege a castle you would have to bulid siege weapons siege tower or ladders but they will take time to bulid so you got to be careful if the other lord are coming to save the castle or city you can also defend a castle of your own or a city or castle own by a other lord and yes you will be able to fight in these siege battles like this this this and you can create your own faction but that would be in late game becuase it going to be diffcult but there alot to talk about haveing a kingdom so i will give you this link to give you more details about makeing your own kingdom and btw this game have a great mod support if you are looking to get some mods moddb
