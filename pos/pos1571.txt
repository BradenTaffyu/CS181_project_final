2017 a miracle of a game don t know why square enix even greenlit this game it s a sequel to a game nobody plays original nier to put charitably is a niche title with poor sales that never got the love it deserved anyway against all odds nier automata got greenlit developed and released and sold 2 million copies across all platforms gematsu com and was praised by critics and players opencritic com and saved platinumgames from near financial crisis www polygon com after cancellation of scalebound and some major flops and rejuvenated square enix business division 6 www usgamer net and it s an amazing beautiful one of a kind game that plays unlike anything i ve ever played before plus keiichi okabe soundtrack is god tier like dammm son i listen to its soundtrack even when playing other games and yes better read other reviews for detailed gameplay description or something i m just singing praises for this masterpiece here play this miracle of a game for the glory of mankind a note for potential buyers if you re going to buy it keep in mind despite numerous problems of the game there s been exactly zero technical fix by square enix given the ps4 version still left with dropping framerates and other hitches i doubt the pc version would get better treatment as sad as it sounds but the most likely scenario is that there won t be official patch anytime soon or at all this isn t me defending square enix but noticing the pattern of their steam releases there s big chance of that being the case anyway there s always the excellent far mod though
