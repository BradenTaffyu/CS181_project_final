2022 early access review caves of qud is my first traditional roguelike i actually bought the game a few years ago and refunded the ui too old i don t know what anything is i don t want to use keyboard shortcuts i don t want to learn by trial and error i simply don t want to play caves of qud however the silly stories of this game always kept my interest and recently i jumped back in here s the gist the game is great and you should buy it literally give yourself 30 min to mess around and learn controls roll a few characters die to baboons get ready to refund but wait before you throw in the towel take a second and check out the character creation screen if you re like me you probably choose the truekin genotype they have cybernetics cybernetics are cool but alas water brother truekin are not not when there are mutants and you don t yet know what s going on so start a new mutant character ditch the sword and shield who needs them when you can be a flying turtle man with psychic powers use these powers to beguile every npc shopkeeper in the desert monk bazaar into giving you their entire inventory for free now we have unlimited money high tier equipment and an army we re only level 5 and we did it we beat the game mind blast the entire baboon species into a spacial vortex they ll never hurt us again now we re level 15 mutations have made a god among mortals we can see into the future teleport anywhere in the world and turn anyone s mind into soup with the slightest intention what s that i died an interdimensional hit squad of psychic dog squids crossed realities to stun lock my character into oblivion from a point on the map i couldn t even see epic caves of qud is a strange game its one that actively encourages you to abuse every system possible by ensuring that every turn regardless of your characters strengths could be your last however it works really well while system abuse in other games usually highlights its flaws it does the opposite here instead breaking the game is plain fun leads to crazy characters and gives you a chance of survival in a strange and unforgiving world not to mention it encourages you to experiment take risks and delve into all the wacky stuff this game has to offer protip don t sleep on the cooking and tinkering skills trust me ultimately the stories this games leads you into and the tools you have to shape those stories are stellar and you quickly learn that the game is not so daunting if you can muster some initial patience give this game a chance it is truly worth your time also mods
