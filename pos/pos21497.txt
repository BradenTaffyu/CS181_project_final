2022 i definitely wasn t expecting anything from this game yet i pre ordered the premium version just because of forza horizon 4 which i absolutely love more than any other racing game amazing graphics and environment bigger map compared to 4th a lot more content too main menu music is delightful and as good as the 4th main menu music had performance issue in the beginning just like any new game nowadays but it s a lot better now easily playable at 2k resseries 5 added more content yet can t wait for the expansions pvp and pve is fun you just need a fine tune to play but same can t be said for the eliminator just when you re on a winning streak there s some cheater teleporting to finish line heck one even flew to finish line in less than 5 secs loldevs don t give a shi t about cheaters on the leaderboard with ridiculous and impossible score it s still fun and great experience
