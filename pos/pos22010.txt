ds3 is a playground for a very special breed of people it s freaking brutal sometimes but it gives you a few chill areas you can walk kinda casually through and take in the nice gothic and archaic scenerie anyone considering buying it these days knows about the infamous difficulty of fromsoft games and the dark souls series so i m not going to get into that i ll just add that it s the fromsoft game with the most replay value for me personally and i love siegward of catarina i just want to cuddle up with him get cozy you know share a bowl of estus soup together just being happy for a little while before reality hits you again ruthlessly
