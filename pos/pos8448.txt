2019 this game hates me and i love it edit as for the quote many idiots have been repeating that goes something along the lines of all future dlc will be free or something to that effect it is completely fictitious it does not exist a quote you can find in an article by eurogamer goes as follows frostpunk dlc roadmap for 2018 revealed and it s all free link for reference dlc listed for the 2018 roadmap was promised to release for free it did they then state that alongside bug fixes tweaks and general maintenance is it for 2018 but we have more ideas and we bet you have some too to implement in upcoming year 2019 you will not find a quote from anyone at 11bit studios that sounds anything like all future dlc will be free it is a lie
