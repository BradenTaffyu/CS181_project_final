2022 this is a turn based tactical game that uses a squad system slightly reminiscent of the squads of ogre battle or bahamut lagoon the game is structured like a fire emblem game that means plot combat post combat plot managment pre combat plot combat repeat it is a tried and true formula and works very well i won t go into much detail but i found the game very very entertaining it has flaws yes and some of those might be more important to some people others might not be it really depends on tastes the plot is functional standard fire emblem fare to be honest i do not much care about the plot in this kind of games as long as it doesn t get in the way of gameplay and here it does not it is not the game s strongest suit but who cares the gameplay is where the meat of the game is and it revolves around the squad mechanic here s how things go you have leaders of three kinds main story characters mercenery characters or you could just appoint any unit as a leader the leader s leadership stat determines the squad capacity and each unit you add to the squad requires and takes up a certain capacity depending on its loyalty a stat that improves the more a unit takes part in combat different units have different leadership stats but story units have almost always higher leadership than randoms the units you add to the squads then belong to a certain class ranging from healers and basic footsoldiers to mages dragons cannons archers or horsemen there are a lot of classes there are three tiers of class and promotion is not linear you can pick from a wide veriety of classes to promote to with differing stats and abilities each squad also has slots for artifacts of which a maximum of 3 can be equiped at any time which grant anything from stats to unique abilities to increases in squad capacity they are very interesting to play around with and optimising each squad for a role is very fun artifacts also interact with capacity they can be either neutral 0 cap cost some capacity or even give you some capacity there is also a tech tree that you progress through the game unlocking new classes abilities material discounts for upgrading classes and various interesting things and finally as i just mentioned there is a basic economy consisting of money and resources like horses iron magic gems etc in most battle maps besides the terrain features and the enemy there are capturable locations that give you either money resources the ability to raise dead units if the squad is not completely wiped out and even a bazaar you can buy stuff that is usually carrying better stock than the intermission marketplace these things all combine in to a very interesting game with a lot of interesting options throughout the roughly 35 stage story setting up squads and managing your troops is so much fun i found myself spending a lot of time fiddling around with combinations of units artifacts and leaders there is an optional permadeath feature for fe purists but be warned that normal difficulty is too easy finally the graphics this game sports are really great imho and ooze character and the game while working fine with mouse and keyboard really works best with a gamepad all in all this game was a delightful surprise for me doubly so because of the surprise full release with not much delay since the demo hit earlier the year the devs are awesome friendly and have poured tons of effort into this game and continue to do so with 2 patches already out at the time this review is posted i think they deserve the buzz this game is getting and if you like tactics games srpgs fire emblem etc you should definitely try it out so far this has been game of the year for me super exited for symphony of war 2 which is probably happening given how good this game seems to be doing
