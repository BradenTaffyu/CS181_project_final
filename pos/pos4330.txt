2015 first i was some nobody raiding villages then i was a tournament champion from there i became a vassal of king harlaus the fat he gave me a starving village which i nursed back to heatlh from there he gave me more villages and a few castles i was his best friend then i betrayed him i seceded from his kingdom created my own kingdom and managed to piss off every other kingdom on the map we bravely held out and casted the false king of the vaegirs into exile king harlaus is now my sworn enemy when he was my friendthis is the type of experience only this game can give you buy it now 10 10 edit by the way i seceded my territories from his kingdom by going to one of his constant feasts and telling him that i m leaving his kingdom with my territories right in front of his friends it was great context i forgot to mention that harlaus rules over the kingdom of swadia not the kingdom of the vaegirs though i still wiped the veagirs out sorry about that for anyone new to this game
