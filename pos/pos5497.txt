2022 early access review good game but kind of hard to explain its appeal so here goes in my latest game i was playing as a hulking mutated abomination 4 arms 2 heads 2 feet between my 4 arms and 3 tentacles courtesy of an ubernostrum injector i had up to 7 simultaneous melee attacks not counting horn attacks i could mince anything i wanted in melee combat and with a masterwork rifle i was no slouch in ranged combat either on a trip to some nearby ruins however i found my mortal enemy cyclopean gibbons the holographic gibbon has several annoying abilities the most concerning of which is the ability to summon 7 exact copies of itself i was usually able to kill one copy in a single round of attacks but they would never be alone and my armour had not kept up with my offence even if i could kill them in one or two attacks they would always get at least one hit in before they died they didn t do much damage but there were cyclopean gibbons everywhere so getting worn down was inevitable and my heal skill had a very long cooldown i could wait for my health to heal between encounters but doing that would make the dungeon run extremely tedious but then i remembered something a few days beforehand i had found a recipe for a meal which allowed to heal 7 15 hp every time i went down to 20 hp i cooked it up and suddenly i was immortal the gibbons could only ever do up to 6 hp worth of damage and there was no limit to the amount of times the healing could occur i could wade into an 8 gibbon ambush and take them down one at a time completely unable to die i carved a bloody and triumphant path through the rest of the dungeon confident in my newfound invincibility before i turned the corner and was instantly killed by a missile turret anyway don t ever let your guard down in the caves of qud
