2021 i love this game if you like fighting strategy and difficulty it s made for you if you like story relaxing and exploring it s made for you if you like playing with friends having fun and doing dumb things it s made for you it is simply amazing the main storyline is incredibly rich and entertaining character customization is extremely diverse and offer endless possibilities mods and homebrew campaigns allow tremendous replayability if you are hesitant to purchase the game i highly recommend that you do so the only reason not to do this is if you want to buy it for gm mode this mode is a bit wobbly poorly done and little used
