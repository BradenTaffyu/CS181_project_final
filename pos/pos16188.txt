2018 actually a very good engine for different wargames havent met any of those widely known annoying physics bugs and glitches so far we managed to play a lot of flames of war x wing warmachine and infinity and it worked out very well for us so far not to mention a lot of common boardgames which are usually even scripted here and ccg s like mtg and netrunner im quite surprised with this one being this good considering what ive heard about it before updooted me recommends
