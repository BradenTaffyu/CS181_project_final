2023 early access review at first i was lost i was confused as to how to defend myself how to feed myself how to stop myself from bleeding out and i died multiple times but then i figured out i could clean a dirty rag in order to prevent infections if i needed to bandage a wound and if i had a needle and thread i could repair my clothes and so on the level of detail in how items can be used and their multiple functions is quite vast secure a place to sleep take advantage of electricity and water sources while they last barricade the doors and windows sleep to replenish your strength cut down some trees saw them into planks build a fence around your shelter whatever your imagination can dream up project zomboid pretty much allows you to do just remember to watch your back and if you die you can always pick up where you left off albeit with a new character but hey your predecessor would have wanted you to loot his corpse and eat his food remember to stay hydrated both in game and out it s easy to lose track of time with this game 5 5
