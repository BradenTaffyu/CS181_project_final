2017 so is it good that s what you come down to the review section to find out right simple answer i got this game on preorder and played it the moment it came out and i installed it it s a week later and i ve got this many hours edit with the mods on the workshop and the modding kits out boy is the game improved i knew it d be a game that a lot of issues i have with it would be fixed with sequential mods now with unit mods out to plug gaps in rosters it s much better i guess it s okay so what s better most everything graphics oh boy are they improved it s far better optimized my 960 runs this game twice as well as it did and still does tw1 sound it s amazing the music when you re in these epic pitched battles is rather lord of the rings esque not to mention everythign sound good races i can play a race of giant lizard people where i can have a giant toad with god like magic powers or a giant dinosaur riding an even bigger dinosaur or i can play two evlen factions which are extremely similar but still very different mechanics the quests side and main the little missions issued to gain power the final battle for the vortex the entire theme of the vortex it s amazing the world feels alive there are challenges to expanding too fast there are more races not everyone will instantly confederate the ai acts like a real empire although sometimes they send three armies of four units instead of one army with twelve gameplay the game is smooth it stuttered for me a few times i ve had a few crashes but nothing to take me out of my experience i ve loved every minute and the crashes have mroe foten than not simply broken up my time played and done me well to be honest what s worse that s probably something you d think of when you see someone praising the outta a game it s not perfect not at all but that comes with the turf it s a total war game expect a few dlc some will be bad some good there s not much variation in some armies there s no real low mid high tier for units most factions have only high or low tier units and others like the lizardmen just have a few types of units all mid tier but differentiating between spears and clubs and calling them without shields low tier the same issue in different forms shows up for every faction ultimately though i love this game it most of what the devs originally screwed up on with the first game but siege battles still feel like too that needs to be fixed tbh otherwise hell yeah play the game
