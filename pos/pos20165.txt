this is a weird one like all owlcat games it s overly ambitious and doesn t quite meet its potential as a result the majority of bugs that you may have heard about have been fixed and the game is easily playable to the end with only the most minor of inconveniences owlcat is a master of environmental storytelling and this game much like the pathfinder games does a world class job of immersing you in the world that it presents the scale of the warhammer universe is felt through the narrative but less so in the gameplay maps are small and condensed and rarely does it feel like you re actually exploring planets so much as exploring rooms and corridors this is in part due to the limitations and constraints that a video game tackling such a large universe has to grapple with but there is still a disconnect between reading about the vastness of the world yet only really seeing such a small portion of it the combat and class system is fine it s not as deep as pathfinder s but presents enough options for me you can easily put enough varied builds together for multiple playthroughs and like all owlcat games it starts off strong gets very strong and then something happens that thing could be the costs of development an overly ambitious design plan disruption due to geopolitics anything really but the fact remains that owlcat is now 3 3 on not being able to keep the highs from the beginning of the game throughout the entire game there is a strong sense of what could have been in the later half and i would even say that this game is the worst offender of theirs in this regard from act 4 until the end of the game there is a severe lack of cohesiveness even between back to back scenes to me it feels like at some point in development they had to start going down the list of story beats they had planned to include and shoehorned them in just to rush the game out and yet despite all of the problems of which there are many this is a positive review why because i still spent over 100 hours on a game i got for 30 and i will likely spend well over 100 more on it the game is fun it s a shame that owlcat has so many problems getting a complete project out the door and that they struggle to seal the deal with the later acts in this game but there are much worse games at this price point and on sale i m not sure if there are any better ones if you are only planning to play this game once in your life wait a couple of years for all of the dlc buy it at a 70 discount and you re going to have a great time if you re the kind of person who plays rpgs like this multiple times catch this one on sale whenever you can and you will likely not be disappointed i look forward to the day i can play a game from owlcat that manages to keep its scope within their means because that game will truly be a masterpiece unfortunately however rogue trader is not that game
