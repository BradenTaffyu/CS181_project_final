2016 entered a tournament for the first time because why not doing well my character wasn t very good and i was still new to the combat but still could win a one on one pretty easily against the ai my ranged attacks were terribly innacurate at the time had to get right next to anyone to hit anything especially on horseback manage to trap a guy against the wall others join in attacking me or him soon half the tournament participants packed into one corner shooting each other and swinging wildly with swords chaos ensues manage to survive and be the last man standing tournament not over yet final round me vs some random guy both on horseback with lances i had never used a lance before ihavenoideawhati mdoing ai doesn t really know how to use it either doesn t realize it does 0 1 damage from point blank range chasing each other around the arena trying to hit each other even if we do line up for a jousting situation it either gets blocked by a shield misses or gets messed up and does little or no damage cue benny hill theme 10 minutes of chasing each other around until i finally figure out how to use it kill him in two hits after that10 10 would chase a dude around in circles for 10 minutes againseriously though it s a great game don t be turned off by the older graphics it s a ridiculous amount of fun and there s so many different ways to play between the dlc mods and the base game itself
