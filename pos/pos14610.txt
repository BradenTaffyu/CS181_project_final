2019 i bought this game at launch and honestly i ve been enjoying this game again and again i play it mainly with my dad or alone and with an active modding community the game never gets boring also the recent dlc have been really good they each improve the game drastically i would personally recommend this game to anyone who likes strategy and 4x games though i d wait for a steam sale so you can get all the dlc with the game for a better price since 160 euros is a bit too much for that i give the game itself a 9 10 at the time of writing this review graphics 8 10 there is a mod for civ v visuals presentation 9 10mechanics 9 10content 10 10 gameplay 9 10music 9 10 there is a spotify list with all the songs if you want to check that out bugs some crashes if you have a ton of units and cities but this is only if you run like 40 civs which is honestly understandable other than that it s bug free and some mods i recommend you run real strategy ai r e d modpack steel thunder unique units note there is a special red mod pack for this one steel thunder unit expansion rule with faith any leader you think is fun just scroll through the steam workshop i have a ton of respect for the modders in this community and i want to personally try and make some mods myself there is one more mod i really recommend but i wouldn t use this in a regular game the mod is called anno domini it s an overhaul mod so it changes the whole game and if you want to try a new experience this is probably the best mod out there for that also for anyone looking to play a fun game of civ with me just dm me
