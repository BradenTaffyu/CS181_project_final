2023 game is good if you sell an organ to afford the 100 dlcs honestly paradox disgusting greedy rats who cant possibly ever deal with having to do their jobs and make new games and instead focus on making low quality overpriced dlc to overload a dying game running in an ancient aztec rune powered game engine that makes the game lag for a good 10 seconds every 2 seconds when ever portugal and spain go to war mid game like the fact that in two games now i have had to deal with a good 10 years of giant lag spikes like that is unbearable fix your brains please disgusting company its unimaginable to these rats to deliver a product that the communities would actually enjoy and not feel like they were being held at gun point to buy the dlcs that the game is unplayable without like get this the base game has like 5 countries with unique missions trees all of which are just half the mission trees you get from the dlcs mission trees are the biggest part of this game and if you have to play the base game you dont get un imaginable ok this game sucks if you are not some whale who is willing to buy every single dlc its even to the point where you have to buy different to access the full features of the dlc you just bought how in the is that even real who in their dog hq thought that was a fun interactive thing to send out to the community this whole dlc is so unbearable to think about anyhow i bought all the dlcs and honestly the game is fun the performance as i ranted about is obviously a problem but its not really that often that portugal and spain go to war so its ok the game itself apart from all the problems there is so much things to do when you have the dlcs that you can play for thousands of hours and have lots of fun and if you are a edgy history nerd who wishes he was a german soldier in the 1940s you can also play with your fellow losers in mp where you sit around for hours cringely roleplaying as some country where you also share sexist and every phobic thoughts with your disgusting basement dweller nerds get a grip on reality and go outside you losers idc about your top 10 meta idea groups and your roman empire wc disgusting nerds jesus christ anyhow in all reality if you are a sane normal human being who dabbles a little in history and feels like playing in late medieval history all the way to the french revolution and lets not forget the willingness to sell a kidney to afford the dlcs then eu4 is the game for you to learn every part of it and sink thousands of hours into it
