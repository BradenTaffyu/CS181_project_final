2022 i find myself quite favorably impressed with this title it s novel concept is both highly developed and well executed have invested but two hours into it but have yet to encounter anything untoward with respect to bugs and glitches in that short time frame so initially it would appear that stray has been well optimized albeit i do play on a high end gaming rig moreover i do regard stray to be an absolute must have for not only any cat fancier s library but i d also not take pause for a moment to emphatically recommend it to all
