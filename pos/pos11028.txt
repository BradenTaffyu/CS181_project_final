as my first city builder i m really enjoying this game and they provide a wide amount of tools to allow you to build the city you want pros keeps you busy as your city continues to scale challenges to maintain your city change over time provides nearly every building you can imagine to build your city except public libraries plenty of tutorials to support players that are new to cities skylines cons game slows significantly after reaching 150k population some parts of the game still feel like they re being worked on some of the building designs are uninspiring game crashes once in a while make sure you have autosave on lastly i bought the base edition and hoping that they offer a means to upgrade to the ultimate edition i m surprised they don t already offer the means to do so i m already enjoying this game but also looking forward to seeing the game further developed and more add ons and updates become available
