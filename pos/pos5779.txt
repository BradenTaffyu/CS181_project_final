2022 first off a psa real quick you will need to filter out which reviews you are paying attention to when looking through this section if you see anything related to promised features or warband was better you should probably ignore those there is quite a lot of rose tinting going on in this community right now so take that into account alright review for the full release a basic summary the game is an open world sandbox with both an overworld map and controls with a separate tactical layer for battles the game primarily focuses on group combat sometimes involving small parties of 10 20 other times it can involve armies of up to 500 vs 500 the player can be just a soldier but more often than not a commander in said battles though there is quite a lot of freedom in what the player can choose and do while there is a main storyline nothing is making you follow it and afaik it doesn t contribute meaningfully to endgame content either graphics not the best in the world but not potato either lots of graphical options to choose from though a lot of it is fairly technical performance abysmal this game needs serious optimizations as of right now even when well above the recommended specs the game can stutter and lag significantly cpu seems to be the main bottleneck but even with a good one its still subpar at present performance also seems to have very high variance from pc to pc gameplay still mount and blade still good though a little imperfect as always armor and combat physics have been expanded somewhat though there are still some bugs that need to be worked out with ai behavior the new formation system allows the player to deploy troops in formations with certain orders prior to the battle starting however it also takes away control to assigning specific unit types or companions to formations of your choosing its also a little buggy right now this issue has been addressed workshop seems to work fine and is fully supported for the game mods can be easily used from the launcher or through vortex mo2 if you wish while the modding scene does take some time to really expand there are still some pretty good mods both on the workshop and on nexus recommend nexus steam workshop has a tendency to be a bit buggy as usual immersion you should not be playing mount and blade for immersion first of all but with that being said there are lots of little details to appreciate in this game for those that stop to smell the roses occasionally taverns games all having their own rules per culture activity going on in towns and villages distinct music for different cultures seasons do happen and some requests change depending upon the current season some more character animations that didn t exist before player voicing orders characters from different cultures now have slightly different dialogue lines and accents etc not going to pretend this game is immersive but there is some effort put into the little details regardless its still better than any previous title which doesn t say much admittedly is it better than warband yes without a doubt i loved warband but native was a shallow shell compared to what bannerlord native has most of the people claiming otherwise are using mods with warband now a little common sense if we re going to compare two games they should only be compared in their base unmodded state because you can personally mod anything into any game in existence if you wish to tailor it to your personal tastes so its better with mods is not an argument closing love the game its fun to play but not without its faults clearly mostly optimization issues right now get the game at a 30 40 pricepoint would be my recommendation its not currently worth a 50 or more price
