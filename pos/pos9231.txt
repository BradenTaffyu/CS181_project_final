2018 stellaris is a game that has radically changed but almost entirely for the better as time has gone on when it first launched it was a very simple 4x you built ships you collected some very basic resources and you fought with other people the technology was fairly linears with pretty distinct best choices it could essentially be just compared to an even simpler version of civ some people really liked this most people were just content with it as time has gone on they ve revamped their combats travel and now economic system giving them layers of depth that the game desperately needed for those who wanted something more than just a simple collect minerals throw ships at literally everyone else simulator with the new economic system and markets you now have the room for empires to specialize and to engage in economic warefare with each other by causing disruptions to the market tall vs wide empires is now a very viable choice for either direction instead of tall empires being primarily just a gimmick build the new economic system can seem daunting at first i nearly wrecked my economy a few times in my first game after the patch but by the end of that game i really had a feel for how to build and your choice of buildings they actually felt meaningful for once rather than just a chore that had to be handled from time to time if you re just looking for a civ in space style game this probably isn t the game for you anymore however if you re willing to take the time this game is quickly becoming the blend of 4x grand strategy it sold itself as it s a perfect start for those who want to dip their toes into the grand strategy genre if you re only really familar with 4x or rts games
