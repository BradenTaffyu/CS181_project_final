2018 a lot of the people say they like the game but the dlc s are the thing they dont like about i played my first 100 hours without any dlc and i loved it if you you are debating to get this game do it when its on sale and buy art of war and commen senses dlcits about the same price as the base game and can give hours of intertamement the other dlc s are just bonus when you want something new to do
