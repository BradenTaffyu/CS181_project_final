2018 im gonna keep it simple this game is pretty slow but if you give it like 15 hours you are stuck i play games like quake and counter strike and i know how my adrenaline would skyrocket if it comes down to the last point i get the exact same feeling from those games only more relaxed and when you finally find that animal you have been tracking for like forever and drop it with your first bullet you ll get the most satisfaction you have ever got trust me when i say this give this game like 15 hours and you ll love it no need to thank me good luck hunting
