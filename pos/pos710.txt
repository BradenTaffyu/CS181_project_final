2016 i m not even sure where to start with all the positives about this game i have a lot of games but for a long time now i have had a problem figuring out what to play or when i did i haven t played for long this game changed all that it has been a long time since i ve actually had that just a few more minutes that then turns into an hour and another feeling i have 19 hours already and i ve only had the game a few days it s been said a thousand times but if you enjoy harvest moon or animal crossing do not hesitate to pick this up it is well worth the 15 and then some there is so much to do whether you want to walk around finding stuff fish farm tend to animals fight etc it s all here there is a storyline but frankly this game is more than the storyline and for the first time in a long time i don t even care about the storyline i m more interested in the process the graphics harken back to the days of snes not to say they re horrible they re perfect for the type of game this is the fact that this was done by a one man shop blows my mind it s a great game and if dlc is done i won t hesitate to pick it up i could talk about the game all day but really you need to do yourself a favor and try this game for yourself you won t regret it edit i have 129 hours in this game in less than 4 weeks i m not the kind of gamer to invest this much time in something unless it is really enjoyable there is so much to do it s the perfect blend of time management rpg and farming this is easily one of my favorite games of the last 10 years it s that good edit now that i m done with marvel heroes i need to get back to this game just adding this for the badge
