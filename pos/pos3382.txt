2017 it s difficult to give this game either a straight thumbs up or thumbs down since there s both good and bad about it i ended up giving it a thumbs up because i still think it s worth playing even if it has some problems note that i m a nerd when it comes to games so there s a few technical bullet points that probably won t matter at all to most people the good fantastic music strong story at least until the end turn based combat was usually enjoyable even if you re not the kind of person who usually enjoys it well optimized max settings 2560x1440 usually 2560x1440 60fps on ryzen 5 1600x gtx 970 16gb ram detailed graphical settings menu hardware mouse cursor ability to quicksave in the middle of dialogue letting you explore all possible optionsthe bad probably my biggest gripe with the game is that it s split up into 4 islands each with their own group of quests once you decide to progress to the next area there s no way to go back to the previous area if you wanted to complete some unfinished quests later besides loading up an older save of course you are very clearly warned that you won t be able to go back i just have an issue with the design choice itself quests can be pretty easily broken by doing them out of order without automatically skipping ahead or marking a quest as failed kill a guy for quest a before you progressed enough in quest b where you were supposed to talk to him there s no way to know the order to do quests in without looking on the wiki sometimes doing quests out of order resulted in the quest journal entry for them being completely blank almost all quests create markers on the map but they are usually left behind even after the quest is complete or don t update along with quest progress this leads to a world map that is full of markers most of which are meaningless compounding this issue there s no way to set an active quest unless you count marking all but one quest inactive kinda tedious a lot of quests 35 have non obvious solutions or locations to visit that required me to look on the wiki for help remember unhelpful quest markers a significant number of quests 10 20 don t actually get marked as complete when you finish them which means they ll just stay in your journal as active quests i m usually not a fan of strategy turn based games i admit to playing this game on the easiest difficulty and still finding it somewhat challenging with that said maybe i m just an idiot but i found some mechanics that were part of this game s combat to be extremely irritating most notably the turn skipping mechanics if you ever let your characters lose all their magic armor expect to have them focused hard by the ai you ll likely have at least 2 of your characters turns skipped per round one particular fight i had ended with me watching my characters getting repeatedly frozen for several rounds where all i could do was watch pretty frustrating in the same vein as the above bullet point don t try to control the battlefield or put out that fire you re standing in it s completely irrelevant just focus on killing everyone first then heal up your characters if you waste time and action points blessing that cursed surface the first thing an ai will do is curse it again meh ending subjectively perhaps not technically a problem with the game itself but steam cloud chokes hard on this game sometimes quicksaves are all right but other times it ll completely freeze the game for 30 seconds while steam is doing god knows what my fix was disabling steam cloud and just having saves back up to onedrive the game saves to your documents folder the irritating things that weren t really problems with the game just unpolished things that need a bit more love using the mouse to rotate the camera by holding mouse3 is extremely stuttery and is relative only so it will slip and won t rotate very far if you move your mouse quickly completed quests are marked as closed and are removed from the active quest list when you look at them one last time to read the i finished this quest flavor text however sometimes you will open the quest journal and the finished quest is already selected and it ll show the i finished this quest flavor text for 1 frame before moving it to the archived quests section i wanted to read that book page turning effects are significantly misalignedit s a solid game with an intriguing story that s definitely worth playing but it s a far cry from the best rpg ever skyrim did it better
