i finished my first bg3 playthrough and came back to play this again still plays great visually beautiful the areas and characters are fun still hate the red prince sorry buddy holds up well in comparison to current games in a similar vein what i appreciate is the ability to arrange my painting collection and item hoard and not have the items vanish from where they re placed thank you for letting me admire all the shiny assets that your people worked hard on creating it s one of my favourite random past times
