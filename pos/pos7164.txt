2022 about 600hrs into game play and i cannot put into words my love for this game most of my addiction comes from real life driving and operating construction machinery so that has a lot to do with this game hooking if you brake it down its amazing the mechanics and how the trucks run is as about as realistic as it can get the more hands on equipment you can get for this game the better experience this is an older game so dont focus on the graphics plus they can be improved be aware a big portion of the high quality detailed trucks motors trailers and graphics are behind the scenes payware mods that have to be sought out elsewhere dont let this stray you there are tons of quality mods within the games workshop on steam to drastically enhance your experience as an operator this game is 10 10 i believe anyone could enjoy this game from simple automatic driving to an h shifter with an eaton fuller head there is fun to be had driving down the roads you live next too
