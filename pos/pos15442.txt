2016 first off buy the game its 13 for 2 copies at the moment im 7 hours in 2 days in real life and its been a blast creating a random generated world thats completely different from the last screw up with my friends you explore and survive slowly and take it day by day by season nights get longer and colder then warmer you evolve yourself and base and explore further into the random generated map which at this point seems endless we havent even scraped the top of what there is to explore in the game but hands down seems to be one of the if not the best survival game to date imo its crafting its mining its hunting and the simplicity of the game from a 2d cartoon perspective is just mindblowingly fun i highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys exploring surviving and or wants to hang out with their buddies for what seems to be one hell of a challenge lets not forget you can play multiple characters and get different types of clothing to wear the game is smooth no bugs that i have found currently and is overwhelmingly exciting to run into the spooky darkness just to find something recap buy it 10 10 would recommend to all my friends again
