early access review i love the way this game is written it s cerebral and strange and super high concept that is to say the actual writing in this game is great not the ai writing generated to fill in the world for example books with white titles are nonsensical slop that are only good for trading away yellow titled books however are actually pretty great my favorite is aphorisms about birds which is exactly what it sounds like my personal favorite excerpt is if asked who s responsible for your misfortunes blame birds they neither care nor can they muster much of a defense that s not a great example of what makes this game s writing stand out so much but the description for the chrome pyramid is space and time rattle off their hinges and tear your perception apart through the new crosshatch of consciousness sound only comes through in waves the sheen of chrome explodes in supernova and you slowly become aware of the furrowed volume of air around the shape of a monstrous pyramid imo that totally rules the general worldbuilding is fantastic and always keeps me wanting to learn more please buy this game it needs to be more popular
