2019 the incredibly short review is if you love yourself you should at least try this game now for the longer one i believe when this first came out i got it as a gift from a friend and was assured that it was similar yet super different to a very beloved game of mine harvest moon honestly i didn t touch it for years viewing most indie games at the time as wastes of money especially when i was working and in school then i stopped working and found myself in an incredibly bad spot mentally my eating disorder kicked in i was diagnosed with suicidal depression with suddenly too much time on my hands and no energy to take up a new hobby it was my partner who asked if i d played he himself picking it up around this time and it was one soft encouragement of you already own it just try it that pushed me to start that first save file game play wise it s everything i wish harvest moon had been dynamic movements a simple ui clear goals and a sense of progression that doesn t ever feel forced or artificial farming is one part of it so if that s not your jive there are a magnitude of options to make money and grow what i fondly think of as my other life you never have to get married although to have adorably pixelated children a spouse is required and if you d like to live the lone wolf lifestyle it allows it you never have to make friends unless you like finishing quests which some of us don t the combat is smooth and clean most times as you level up weaker things get easier and the challenges posed to you grow ever more difficult this mechanic means that if you like the combat not me it doesn t seem to get boring even after level 10 rewards are abundant treasure and artifacts and minerals that are needed to get some of the better gear in the game however there is a luck system so be warned about trying to hunt for iridium on a bad luck day the fortune teller gives you no lies and it s not worth it trying to tempt their readings crops are simple if not a little tedious in the first year when you likely have no sprinklers or good fertilizer honestly i m the type to plan out the farm from day one but many others throw seeds into large clumps and hey whatever works for you just get used to the sound of running water every time you use the watering can many bathroom breaks in the beginning trust me crows won t be an issue after you figure out scarecrows and as soon as you can craft fertilizer start basic and put it under everything i mean it crops just die sometimes and when you re like me and want that community center done quickly and efficiently you ll need every one of them in the first year animals are cute way too cute and from personal experience in the first year or two they ll make you more money quicker than crops speaking of the community center or if you re a opportunistic capitalist who doesn t care about small town businesses joja mart warehouse finishing it will bring you joy for about ten minutes until you realize that it does literally nothing and no one uses it waste of so many resources and your actual hard earned gold fishing is a pain until suddenly you re good at it and your left click finger is trained on a hair trigger crab pots are useless and i hate them and there s something so satisfying about spending half an in game day foraging for berries in the summer that it s hard for me to describe it in words this is a game that is made for downtime and in my personal belief does it in a way that s in no way boring or overdone it s reinvented the farming sim game to the point where everything else feels lacking it requires little effort if you don t want to give it or will lend itself to meticulous planning of crops and other money making strategies it s a game that i can sit down with at work for a quick break or throw myself into for a weekend either way in the words of marie kondo it certainly does spark joy
