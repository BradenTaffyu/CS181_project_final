2016 early access review just buy the game already seriously so in my first experience with this game i played the game for almost 10 hours straight on permadeath mode decided to take the randy random storyteller as an option here s my story 3 crash landed survivors 2 brothers in a spaceship and then a meteor hit err yeah so they landed on the planet in the far northern reaches and built a sweet settlement had some visitor s quarters that could house like 10 people ty mods as our three adventurers went along they recruited another 7 wanderers to join their settlement in the first year s winter the old lady of the group lost her mind and decided to walk nude into the wilderness everyone was sad when she died and a few settlers visited her grave for months after many raiders attempted to steal what the settlers built and grew but through blood and kiting tactics they survived after the first full year there were now 11 people in the settlement traders were a common sight and the raiding had cooled off through the second winter there were squabbles here and there and the occasional rampant animal or man hunting pack of wild beasts overall it was quite peaceful the settlers were able to create a life on this wild planet they had gardens electrical systems defense grids and even a hydroponics farm being built and then it happened they came from the sky 3 of them these monstrosities in metal armor crashing through the roof of the home they started with the scientist gutted her right in front of the youngest one she lost it and ran into the woods then the settlers banded together they waited outside of the laboratory doors those steel encased doors that can hold back even the wildest of beast or raider 9 people fully loaded with every ounce of firepower they had to offer even some emp grenades they had scored off a few raiders who were unlucky enough to catch a few settlers hunting they didn t stand a chance the doors came down like butter the trade caravan that had been there fled as soon as the fire started there was nowhere to run the metal beasts shrugged off every round fired even the heavy machine gun couldn t penetrate their armor they barely scathed these monsters 7 people went down in the melee only two escaped to run to a safer place maybe the doors of the freezer would hold them out and they would leave with some goods and let them live that s when the beeping started has burned to death has burned to death it kept saying it over and over until they were gone all but two but the monsters weren t done they broke the freezer doors down knocked the final two unconscious and lit the rest of the encampment on fire they all died slowly first from stab wounds and power fist wounds and then they were burned to death that was it game over maybe someone else will find use of the ruins of this place seriously though i was stuck for 10 hours almost playing this i couldn t step away from this crazy story that was unfolding if you are even considering it buy it you can return it if you play it for less than 2 hours but i doubt you will be able to put it down
