2022 this is probably my second favourite game of all time i have sank so many hours and i love it so much but my god the dlc policy is as awful as others say get this game if you can buy most of the important dlc s check online for buying guides together on sale with the game you will have so much fun you will have so many times too but overall you will just get to sit back and play this game as you want i treat this game as a kind of therapy in a way i come home i put on an album or two and i play eu4 sometimes i will have a nice beer the learning curve of this game isn t as bad as it may seem you will never learn every mechanic unless you truly devote yourself i am most definietly still a bad player if i was to go multiplayer but you will make your country work you will start to map paint or becoming an economic powerhouse just interfering with countries that you want to help or hinder have fun if you aren t having fun whats the point in all of this anyway
