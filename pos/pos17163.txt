2019 this is the kind of game where you can spend half an hour just deliberating to yourself about which race you want to play as as each and every one of them is unique in design and gameplay the campaign is strategic with elements akin to the civilization franchise with an emphasis on war as the name might suggest grand scale rts combat that is easy to pick up and enjoy fantasy strategy at its finest truly the only complaint i have is how pricey the dlc are including the first total war warhammer game as you need it to play in the mortal empires campaign but if you find them all on sale they are very much worth the price to expand your game 9 10 most fun i have had in a game in a while
