2023 prefacehonestly the best game i ve played in 2023 so far and easy contender for goty when looking at exploration and progression it might even surpass elden ring and that says a lot about this game note as of writing this review i ve completed 54 of in game challenges 14 45 achievements still have many mechanics to unlock and enjoying every moment of it without being bored positivescombatwhoever designed the spell combat in this game deserves a raise this is harry potter done right and truth be told a game of this caliber should have been made when the harry potter hype was at its peak about a decade ago but better late than never while combat takes a backseat in this game as hard as that is to believe to be elaborated in the next section exploration hogwarts legacy took every well done combat system that exists in this day and age of action adventure games ie assassin s creed arkham series dark souls etc and mashed it into a solid system with its own identity that s difficult to get tired of my only gripe if i were to nitpick is the limitations caused by the spell pages it s hard to mix up many spells as i would like to and combat may be become clunky but perhaps a sequel if any will provide more options explorationas mentioned above even though combat was discussed first it takes a backseat in this game exploration is where this game truly shines and i found myself spending hours and hours just running around hogwarts hogsmeade and doing quests chores without fighting a single enemy the idea of unlocking different mechanics and spells in this game that can be creatively utilized not only in combat but in exploration combined with a progression system designed to help you take things gradually without being overwhelmed makes every quest and step enjoyable all in all here s the best way to put it i haven t even unlocked the endgame spells and i want to put it off so it feels like i m becoming a truly powerful wizard through every quest and step i take this game helps you to enjoy the process not just seek results appearance changeglamour transmog single player or mmos is such a simple yet delicate mechanic that can make or break a game and hogwarts legacy hit it out of the ballpark not much more to be said pick up a gear have that design unlocked equip it as your appearance at any time do the same for your wand and broom couldn t ask for any more than that puzzles room of requirementmerlin trials and such may become repetitive but not to the point of considering them tedious the room of requirement and its vast design potential really caught me off guard and is a welcome addition to the wizard experience after having experienced island sanctuary recently in ff14 the concept of taming animals for resources to upgrade gear and using conjuration stations to grow plants and brew potions was the icing on the cake to an already amazing game voice actingjust like watching a movie each quest had me engaged to the story and progression and had me waiting for what s coming next truly well written main story and side quests particularly for anyone like myself playing this game for the nostalgia alone negativesno quidditch yet haven t confirmed any sources for the quidditch dlc but it must be on its way right it ll be free right character customizationoptions are slightly lacking in the versatility department but not a major complaint considering the nature of the game for an adventure game of this caliber the options they provided were enough but not entirely plentiful as one might expect conclusionfinal verdict swith a solid combination of combat exploration side content the trifecta for hogwarts legacy is a complete enjoyable experience with replayability potential add nostalgia to the formula and it s the perfect game to play in 2023 nowadays that s a hard combination to master the first game in a while that i pre ordered for full price and zero regrets ps i don t support pre orders but this game was just too hype lol
