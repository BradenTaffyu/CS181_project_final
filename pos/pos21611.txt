2022 the good hundreds upon hundreds of licensed cars to choose fromthis game looks amazing very well optimized multiplayer is fun the music and sound is top notch lots of tuning options to make your racing experience more realistic and enjoyable lots of customization options huge map to drive around on and explore the bad cars don t feel like that have any real value because they are easily obtained steam achievements leave much to be desired the game is trying to appeal to too wide of an audience the story is not great and the acting a bit cheesy overall it s a quality game for sure but just leaves me wishing there was more grind and value to the cars like in the good ole racing game days rather than here s 100 cars to choose from and here s more play your way
