2019 product received for free the best total war game since shogun 2 maybe even medieval 2 is getting a lot of love from the devs including some of the best dlcs i ever bought tons of replayability i didn t even play half of the factions properly yet and have yet to actually finish a campaign lol as just like in warhammer 1 each faction feels and plays unique true some less than others it s not perfect but i just really recommend this game to any total war or strategy game fans fans of the tabletop and even new players all together
