2018 early access review this is by far the greatest car sim that has emerged from this planet it allows you to do simply everything from driving in a freeride mode to racing rallying beating challenges adjusting any car in your garage etc it has a workshop with plenty of noice content as well the car crash system needs no presentation it s a pure masterpiece this is what all car simulators should be seriously the physix is so good that all other car simulators look like a joke when compared to this pure gem if you love cars as much as your johnson then this is the deal of your life grab it hold it love it 10 10
