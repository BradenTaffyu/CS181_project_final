2020 love this game a bit of factorio or satisfactory or rimworld if you like any of those games i think you ll like this one a lot oxygen not included aka oni has a lot of its own features that are very cool watching and managing air flow heat flow and fluid flow is really satisfying once you get the hang of it you wouldn t think that having to install plumbing and functional septic systems to recycle water would be so fun but i really enjoy it then you start carrying over that knowledge to managing heat and oxygen functionally making an air conditioner system by piping cold water toward your home and hot water out and exchanging temperatures and you start managing your oxygen and air since every little dude you got is breathing in air and breathing out carbon monoxide you start seeing little pools of carbon monoxide at the bottom of your base it is heavier and you see it growing into a problem to deal with and generating oxygen itself is a task to deal with since there s not a lot of plant life underground the only thing it doesn t have is much combat but mere survival is a challenge on it s own you don t really need things out trying to kill you
