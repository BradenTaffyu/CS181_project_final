2023 whew lad you are not made out for racing and this game will make sure you know that nothing but great things to say about the game the only thing the developer really needs to put work into is the online play this game would be absolutely amazing if it had some sort of matchmaking system as is you have to really pre plan your races which makes the game more of a time commitment that i don t always want to get into there is also a safety rating which is meant to keep the opponents more friendly in races but the system doesn t work and toxic players will crash into you if they have a sufficiently high safety rating to get you out of the race since their punishment won t be drastic
