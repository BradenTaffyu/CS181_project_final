2017 i m not very much into fantasy or warhammer but i am into total war i also loved tw warhammer 1 however this game takes it up a big notch this is quite the ambitious production having a trilogy that builds one huge game at the end the improvements to something as elusive as battle pacing i feel is markedly improved the user interface is the best it has ever been from the camera settings in the top left allowing you to customize animation speeds for different factions in the campaign map to the end turn notifications button in the bottom right under the end turn button to the fact that the list of event messages don t have to be clicked to open up and instead pops out a box while your mouse is over it campaign mechanics and faction differentiation is also great traits and skill trees are a lot better graphics are very vividly colored and you can tell a lot of effort was put into every detail here animations also i can go on and on but yes if you like strategy games you should get this game
