2023 i see absolutely zero need for a battlepass or paid dlc for a chair but with that out of the way rt is an absolute masterpiece story lore characters environments and weapons are really well done melta plasma and bolter weapons finding their mark are satisfying than ever great to see tzeentch getting some attention too at present there are a couple builds that just make combat an absolute steamroll even against bosses but i would expect patches to come narrative elements and decision making also feels very consequential at times must have for bg3 40k ttrpg fans you will love it personally i have not encountered any bugs or performance issues 3080 mentioned by others highly recommend even at 70aud
