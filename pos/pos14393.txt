2022 early access review more than just chinese spyware you bet your sweet papiok so truth be told i m a bit newer to automation games grew up on rts turn based strat games tons of fpss rpgs and mmos but my love for automation games came about early on in my twenties a little less than a decade ago i love a lot of the simpler style games factorio that use a relatively simple graphics style to mask a deceptively complex and near infinite reach of possibilities in terms of just how far you can take it on the other end you have games with much more masterful and impressive graphics systems that use it to boost a slightly simpler assembly process which i feel is where dyson sphere program fits in this is not a bad thing one thing that always seemed difficult for me in games like factorio was the near infinite depth to the game at a certain point i just found myself almost at a loss for what to do after a certain point and in certain game modes where the mobs continue to grow evolve and multiply over time this could spell unavoidable disaster for any player that failed to seamlessly grow there assemblages and supply lines as before long your procrastination has resulted in a grand mob so far past you it s literally impossible to reload a save with the hopes of outbuilding the ai and managing to escape your fate dsp eliminates these issues while still making the game interestingfor me this is where the graphics system really comes in to play simply put the game is beautiful i would find myself relentlessly driven to reach the next tech level and further my production means not to keep a step ahead of some ever growing ai driven enemy but because i eargerly awaited exploring the next world the universe itself is scaled in such a way that every time you feel you ve finally started to master a given level of production you gain the ability to explore new worlds around your star before long you re exploring distant star systems finding new worlds with rare and useful resources colonizing these alien habitats with your automatons to begin ferrying these novelties back to your homeworld where they would find a place in your ever growing massive assembly line dyson sphere program may lack the limitless possibilities of games like factorio in their ability to allow more items to be produced than most players could ever dream of but it more than makes up for this by creating such a beautiful universe for you to explore the game does a wonderful job of pacing the advancements in such a way as to keep you engaged and working towards the next planet or star to explore instead of getting bogged down in depths with goals so far off in the distance that you end up putting the game down due to the sheer time it would have required for you to complete the resource types and numbers are expertly calibrated in such a way that as your assembly lines expand from entire planets to solar systems to star systems and eventually entire galaxies your time will have to be spent somewhere between colonizing new worlds and scaling up both the size and efficiency of your earlier systems so that the increasingly complex items continue to be pumped out in large enough numbers that these systems may feed not only planets but eventual star systems and then entire galaxies filled with your automated creations honestly this game does a lot of things right and the lack of any against the clock countdown mechanisms allows for an incredibly relaxing experience which when coupled with the amazing world it leaves you to explore filled with countless planet and star types leaves you with a supremely enjoyable gaming experience the only thing which prevents me from giving the game a full 10 10 is the fact that the game at the time of this writing is still in a early release state and while bugs very occasional crashes are to be expected and will hopefully be worked out by the time the game launches are still there and while again very rare are prevalent enough that i have to settle for a 9 10graphics are great u i is relatively simplecontrols are well thought outresource and techs are brilliantly pacedexperience is relaxing and engaging really can t think of a single reason not to suggest someone buy it other than the rumors that it s so addictive on purpose to spread chinese spyware whether or not that s a rumor i just made up myself completely notwithstanding
