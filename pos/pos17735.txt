i personally really love this game i think the devs fixed important aspects that made troy unplayable in my opinion e g ai spawning siege mechanics killing animations as someone who s been playing total war since rome it finally feels like the series is headed in the right direction probably for the first time since attila of course i m biased as a historical fan more on that later the good it s clear a lot of effort was put into researching new kingdom egypt as a classics major i m impressed canaan and the hittites get less attention as the game s title would suggest but still have their own unique characters religions and units the campaign map is beautifully rendered dynamic weather change is a wonderful addition other cool new features include outposts which elevate the campaign experience ancient legacy and dynamic fires in battle the bad and the ugly the game lacks ambition though the game takes more steps forward then backward pharaoh lacks the imagination we ve seen in past tw series it s hard to imagine this game living up to shogun 2 or attila base game should ve included more of the mediterranean mesopotamia bronze age world also the timing of the game is poor when i think the fan base is nostalgic for a return to medieval or empire waiting for blood as long as we did only to still pay for it as a 2 99 dlc is greedy on the part of ca you should lower the price to make a statement to your fan base finally if you re thinking of buying this game i think it comes down to a simple calculation if you re a fan of the ancient world and or a historical title lover this game is for you the fixes from troy make it worth it however if you are not a historical fan and aren t an egyptophile it s probably not worth it
