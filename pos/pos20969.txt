you are a menace to the environment said the bad guy all mech ed up with kilotons of explosive ordnance no u said dave while arming his trigger bombs sharpening his poison harpoon and loading his trusty tranquilizer mosin nagant sniper rifleenvironment was well protected that day and glowing sushi was served at bancho s later if i had to sum up dave the diver in one word after finishing all achievements recipes unlocked all staff max leveled and marinca in gold dlc fish included chu chu that word would be wholesome game is funny relaxing though stressful at times memeful even at one point i did get overwhelmed and even annoyed by the amount of mini games i had to keep track of but after realizing i m free to pace myself as i like i just rolled with it i can imagine that such game structure with multiple mini games could be a turn off for someone plus there is a good amount of grind involved towards mid late game which can be frustrating personally i wish there was a way to speed up certain things like turn off cutscenes and a buy all button though i also realize that options to cut corners would likely take away from the charm of the game so all in all i m happy with the game the way it is in short this game is guaranteed to make you smile crave sushi and yell get rotated idiot whenever you win a shark battle
