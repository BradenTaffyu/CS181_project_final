unfortunately writing a review for the game finally despite not wanting to because of the backlash for saying literally anything one way or the other from players who just feel like attacking people for saying what they think let me also state because this apparently matters to people a lot more than it should i have been playing the series since payday the hiest and went through 2 since it launched barley missing the pre order deadline by a couple days due to money at the time so my review i m not going to talk about launch or anything really before this current time for the most part i like the gameplay change quite a bit and how it handles overall even compared to 2 maybe my tastes have changed or its a per person deal i don t care i m here to tell you my thoughts and my thoughts only in this as it stands right now i much prefer how this plays compared to both titles before it also feeling more in line with the playstyle of the first game but a little more grounded the guns feel much more satisfying to me and the new gun sounds also really help this i cannot stress enough how much of a difference it makes sound alone even though there is much more to it than that given its an entirely new system and handling the difficulty i also feel has been fleshed out and done better than the prior ones as i definitely feel as time went on payday 2 specifically difficulties got comically both out of hand and from what i ve mostly observed cheese fests on both sides that might be fun for certain people but it definitely was not fun for me compared to how they handle the difference in this it feels much closer to 2 at launch did for me i also appreciate the lack of modifying the hp and damage values with the accuracy modifier really being the key difference in how much you get shredded for roaming so much one of the main things of payday the hiest specifically i was always told was to do better in higher difficulties you just have to shoot better enemies is going to be a short topic i really like the nader specifically for how large a threat they are if you ignore them while being easily handle able otherwise the back and forth being it forces you to play at a major disadvantage for turtling too much and playing too safe the bulldozer being much more of a threat while being only x1 of on the field i also really like as i wasn t much of a fan of how they gradually got invalidated for the most part over time in 2 the zapper is essentially the same if you aren t facing them when you get tagged because you didn t react or shoot fast enough that s probably the breaks for you not much to say other than it acts as usual the changes to the shield i really like having the window makes them more confront able in this style where you don t normally run around like a arcade chicken with your head cut off so you can break the line they hold which they normally do a very good job at assuming the 3 other people and yourself can t hit the broad side of a barn alll the time on a dime when summoned i also do like the shove they have being able to both bait it and punish the usual style of just simply running around them for the most part on chokes ads a certain level of challenge that requires you to actually properly shoot your way out of this already in and of itself while probably frustrating to some i find pretty rewarding the snipers are basically the exact same not much to say there the techie ohhhh the techie i personally feel they try to do the same job role as the nader while filling it a little too well i did not feel that they would be a very good addition to most maps when planned and now that they are out i can safely say i still feel the same way with the design premise of the techie itself hiding so far back and no real indicator as to what story of a building they re on other than the hud and noise that for any unexpirenced team of players or any non organized groups like most people with a job who hop on just to play to around i d assume this unit alone can and will make or break entire runs just by staying so far removed and safe while the drones themselves especially on higher difficulties absolutely destroy your resources left unchecked or stacked with already increasing odds i don t feel as strongly negative about the techie as i did the medic in 2 but we aren t here to talk about him the hiests these are very much simply put not as re playable asterisk as the launch list before in both games and even though its been remedied somewhat i still feel that some are more fun to replay than others but all are easy to burn out on especially road rage if you get dragged along to farm it for a good few hours if even i do feel however the selection of retro hiests already was a good call these two adding some unexpected variety and murky station benefiting a lot from the new stealth gameplay cook off seems to have made the transition well enough i actually enjoy long sessions of it given the time to do so and don t really feel it too unfair in the new system vs just having to play well or slightly better than average you would expect from less invested players syntax error itself i actually find the most fun though i cannot really alude much of why though i will admit the stealth was personally addicting for me and the loud might ve been more boring without the soundtrack which makes a world of difference at least to me if i was forced to have a gripe about it maybe the basement could have been a warehouse sized bigger now that i m personally used to it adding a bit more challenge navigating it the customization at this point in time there is starting to upturn not only new paint materials but more ways to obtain it i do find myself more a fan of the mix and match style of this game for gun painting specifically but i absolutely feel this is the area lacking the most between it and 2 the sheer difference in the amount of masks and mask variety let alone patterns of which there is very much too few of which by all means should not be the case by now is astounding to me i remember very well how up front and proud the original team for 2 was in the amount of mask customization variety there was as well as the large pool to draw from but i had feared this current state of it ever since the original trailer showcasing it a massive downgrade especially after how much that had been wanted after hiest first started introducing new masks outfits i do not have much to say on i personally feel theres too little variety besides colors out the gate and that they arent exactly the greatest color combinations to begin with but i can understand their reasoning in wanting to fit the comeback vibe as it stands though the default outfits feel outplace most of the current unlocked outfits even in that feel and category in short more outfit variety not just colors more suits and long duster trailed suit jackets moving into personal wants a bit here classic suits like dallas s plaid patterned iconic suit would be nice to have again as lil retro easter eggs along with the rest of the hiest masks or some styled 2 masks and outfits that og american dream mask i feel was too good of a capitalization on that front to stop at only just that as for the launch price of 40 dollars honestly i do not have much to complain about with what was offered considering most compared charge more for less and i remember 2 offering more for well more it feels the least egregious thing considering most of the content is just part of this base game and consequently most of whats being tuned and added upon for free as i can t really think of much more to say at the moment most of my impression is very solid i ve had usually good experiences with both randoms and friends and it usually feels rewarding and addicting at least now hopefully they keep improving
