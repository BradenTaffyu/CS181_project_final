early access review honestly its a wonderful game and doesn t actually require 16 gb of ram i play on a laptop with 8 gb of ram and it runs just fine just the bigger maps make it a bit laggy also all on normal graphics this game is very fun you can customize your cars a lot they sound very good the softbody physics are really good same with the graphics they re really great and for only 30 its even better than call of duty mwiii i would reccomend this game for anyone that has 8gb ram or better
