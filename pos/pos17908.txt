2023 coh3 is like any other coh game if someone likes core gameplay of previous games this game is for you maybe not now because price is too high in comparison to actually content asymmetrical armies are characteristic feature of every coh game so construction of the new armies brings some freshnes and they ve have unique feeling of gameplay balance could be better but this can be change in the future imo this game have less rng than previous game series for example artillery and mortars are not as mighty as in coh2 and rarely can wipe out the whole unit in one lucky shoot coh3 needs now more maps more content and generally polishnes it s not perfect game but personally i like it and brings me a lot of fun i play only mp matches so i can t recommend campaign of coh3 there aren t many great rts games on the market but coh3 has ambitious to be one of the greatest
