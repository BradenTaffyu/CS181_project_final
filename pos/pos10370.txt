hello everyone i have never written a review before but now i m trying to write one i have spent a total of about 1500 hours in acc 1000 hours on xbox500 hours on pci have always played with steering wheels first the g920 then the csl dd i would recommend the game to those who primarily play racing simulators rfactor iracing ac etc for people who want to relax it might not be the best choice getting into the game is easy there is only one tire compound for dry and one for wet weather due to the limited number of categories you don t have to constantly get used to different cars however there is a variety of cars within each category there are no track or car mods so it is truly plug and play creating a setup can be exhausting the presets are optimal for beginners but there are many people on youtube who provide free setups offline the game offers a career mode championships and special events here the game tries to represent the gt world championships the in game ranking system doesn t offer much in my opinion it has unfortunately been neglected however lfm simgrid and other platforms offer very good ranking systems these platforms are highly recommended the driving physics and force feedback are in my assessment very good the previous issues were fixed with update 1 10 there are still occasional issues with the dampers if you have any further questions you can contact me at any time
