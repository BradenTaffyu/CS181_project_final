2016 early access review i ve just played this game for 10 11 hours straight and it s still not boring how a game can do this in early access is beyond me and the fact you can literally keep going and going is wonderful really looking forward to updates i ve literally just got to a bit where i need the next bit of the game made got the second key but i ve made as much as i can got almost 10k cash probably can make that in about 10 minutes or under if i wanted to now it s a really good game looking forward to more would certainly suggest for others to get this game
