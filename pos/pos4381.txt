2014 note this will include my review of the first mount blade game and the stand alone expansion warband as they are basically the same game with added features introduction mount blade is the type of game you probably won t see being advertised on tv or on popular internet websites it s one of those titles who s popularity is mainly spread by word of mouth and by player recommendations based on the game s merits released back in 2008 developed by taleworlds game and published by paradox interactive known usually for grand strategy games mount blade is a very unique title who combines the freedom of sandbox rpgs the action of first and third person combat with the micromanagement of strategy and simulation games pros innovative combat mechanic first person third person medieval combat action this was the first game to introduce me on proper directional attack combat mouse directionality will dictate how effective your strikes will be and mastering it will require a lot of practice especially during mounted combat your own adventure the player is free to make his own adventure the world is as open as it can get from a lowly nameless adventurer fight to be a great lord a great general mercenary bandit merchant soldier king or any combination thereof your own army or warband this game provides the closest experience on the thrill of commanding an army in a game train your peasants to be the most elite of soldiers until every lord in the realm seeks your services companion system you can hire peasants and train them to deadly warriors but you also encounter additional companions during your self made adventure at first i thought these were just beefed up ai soldiers with special names but was pleasantly surprised that each character had their own personalities and their own traits they fight against each other over petty arguments and tend to either approve or disapprove of your decisions as the leader very active and dedicated modding community the modding community along with support from the developers vastly improves the game s overall quality not just in graphics but also in other aspects such as sounds music game mechanic world design or even a whole new theme lotr game of thrones etc installing a mod for this game is highly recommended cons art design graphics sounds etc lets be honest looking at the screenshots will say this is not the most graphically advanced game out there animation lighting sound music and character models are acceptable at best mods improves this a lot needs a bit more npc aside from enemies the friendly or neutral npcs that you encounter are not as extensive as i would have hoped the cities seem rather small with very minimal activity from the citizens which makes some of the towns and castles a bit empty would be nice to have more populated towns where you can get more side quest and requests for help no advance battle planning the game randomly chooses which troops you are deployed with this is without the benefit of pre deployment formations although the player can quickly rally his troops in a solid battle formation before the enemy closes in the inclusion of a pre battle strategy or deployment would have helped a lot siege battle is weak most of the castles or towns will only have one pre determined breach on the wall or a ladder that was already set up for you i would personally like it if i were able to deploy siege weapons on my own and deploy them where i want them instead of being forced down a bottleneck diplomacy and political intrigue is a bit shallow aside from the squabble of the lords and ladies in the courts there s not much going on around the political aspect of the game conclusion great game and highly recommended but for a niche market the word innovation has been constantly used lately that it almost lost its meaning but here we have mount blade a game which truly tried and succeeded in making a new fun immersive and enjoyable experience must buy for strategy gamers who also happen to like rpg games if you re the type of gamer who claims to value gameplay over graphics then here is a game that will test that assertion like my reviews follow my curator s page
