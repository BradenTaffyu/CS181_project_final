2022 early access review this game is great the best way i can describe is is the sims but its a zombie apocalypse it is incredibly difficult and you will die more times than you can count there is no real objective other than survive and they give you plenty of options for how you want to try and attempt that it is permadeath though so if permanently losing a character you get attached to is unacceptable in your mind you won t like this game however even though your character is dead you have the option for your new character to spawn somewhere in that same world so you can try to track down and use your nice fortified base or stash of good gear or whatever or you can opt to just re roll everything from the start the maps are massive and even with 100 hours in this game i have not explored everything there is by a longshot i haven t experienced the seasons change or the other decay that happens as the world crumbles its not uncommon now for me to survive about a week and half in game which is nothing but feels so much further than never living through the first day when i first started something about the whole explore scavenge while fortifying your base game loop hooks me in every time i am not someone who typically enjoys incredibly punishing or brutal games
