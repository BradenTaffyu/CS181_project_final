2018 has been said many times before fallout 4 is a good solid game but not a good fallout it is a very very good post apocalyptic shooter for those who are new to the series it pretty much plays like skyrim with guns unlike the previous installments of fallout you could just use the weapons without relying on the vats system as much which is a godsend in some cases i highly recommend this game to anyone who are fans of the post apocalyptic shooter genre
