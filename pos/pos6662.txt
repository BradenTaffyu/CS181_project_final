2016 so you want to know what it s like to drive a truck around europe this isn t it you don t get the discomfort you don t get the stench of sleeping in your cabin for days you don t get the jaded bored people in logistics handling your delivery you don t get the pressure of a superior at you for being late or slow or your cargo being damanged you don t get the challenge of interacting with people whose language you don t even speak and can t deliver a sentence in english if their grandmother s life depended on it you don t get to deal with police pulling you over for speeding or demolished cars from traffic collisions you get to have all the fun parts instead plus some rather irrelevant fines euro truck simulator gives you a taste of what it s like to drive cargo through europe without most of the frustrating parts sure you have to deal with local speed limits and tight lanes and traffic rules and intersections that is part of what it means to drive a truck the game is sandbox y enough to let you get away with a great deal of driving atrocities without letting you feel like a total traffic god but it comes close to letting you the result is that a lot of this game is touring through scenic environments dealing marginally with traffic rules with your favourite internet radio station blasting through your in game system and making in game money through your trucking company in the process it s not high paced action there s no great story involved yet the game is irrationally entertaining managing to somehow find this perfect balance between being engaging and being relaxing poignantly demonstrating that the goals we set in a game and engage with frequently find their origin in nothing but our own subjectivity rather than the actual game design i bought this game on a sale i never even expected to like it i was surprised when i did had i known i would have paid full price it s not always relaxing but it s definitely comfortable i can launch it up and continue my progress of my trucking empire any time i feel like it or delay when i don t i can t rightfully claim to be bored owning this game get out of my way dude i got a truck and i ain t afraid to pay a fine
