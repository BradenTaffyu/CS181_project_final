2021 fantastic game i m a long time player of war thunder but i can see how much love in presentation gameplay and ambient went into world of tanks too in fact in some aspects wot it s far superior give it a try to both they are excellent into what they do in their own way i was a bit in fan hardcore mode for war thunder but after finally got my hands on wot i can defenetly say that it s my new favourite sure the grinding it s there but the overall experiene feels far more rewarding in the end and wargaming it s a bit more loose in terms of giving stuff and you know making you feel having a good time while playing i did the tutorial and i got like 5 days of premium account and recently in world of tanks blitz they gave away a free dlc with some cool stuff in there but there s a catch to keep in mind the grinding in war thunder it s about same as in wot at some point you will need to drop money for sure except in there you really need to farm for the research points and while the same can be applied in here in wot you need to farm like crazy for in game cash to upgrade your vehicles with each tank tier the money gets really expensive and from there you really really need to keep tabs in what you invest your money what kind of ammunition addons and so on it s do able but it s quite frustrating at first if you stay at tiers 1 to v or even 6 you will be somewhat fine after that the problems start to stack up hint disable the option auto refill on consumables in a nutshell both games aim to be simulators maybe wof it s a bit more arcadeish but you wont survive 4 seconds if you rush or yolo away and also the simple fact that you join each battle with just one tank no reserves so 1 life it s all you get maybe in other modes you get more but so far this is what i saw so make the best out of it in wt you get like 3 or 4 lifes to keep going with different reserves of tanks planes etc and while this is better or worse depending on your playing style i truly belive it s a bit more hardcore experience in world of tanks also i loved the music garage and general mood of the tanks in the lobby the hud and navigation can feel a bit overwhelming at first but it s really good when you get the hang of it oh and the game looks fine and runs awesomely great optimization in here ps the game it s in a mixed review ratio because veterans players for now can t merge their old accounts to the steam version a totally and valid opinion but i think that wargaming would do something about that soon and if they don t well that s sucks but it has nothing to do with the quality of the game which it s great on a personal opinion i never liked when people review bombing to any game it s speaks more of the quality of the person you are than the publisher devs you try to look bad if you don t like it it s fine make a negative review just don t bring the pitch forks and try to brainwash the rest of the community lastly i would like to add that non steam client versions of the game share the same exact servers here present on steam so there s nothing holding back old players the only different thing or plus it s the exposure that steam gives to the game and maybe some payment tools otherwise it s all the same in a nutshell if you are a new player jump right in you will have a blast and there s a lot of content to discover and unlock i only wish wot devs lessen the amount of money requirements for almost everything like i said before in both games it s the same wt wot but after some point it gets heavier in here if you are like me and stay in tiers 1 to vi you ll will mostly fine specially with the high amount of nations to choose from but yeah lower the requirements devs i ll still recommend it tough but keep in mind all the above
