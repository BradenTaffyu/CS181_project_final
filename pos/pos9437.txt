2022 i have been using assetto corsa since i first got my pc in late 2020 since then i have put countless hours into the simracing and driving experience as it is the best you will get the physics are extremely realistic and with the right mods the graphics look better than any modern sim racer out there the base game can get a little boring without the dlc so i do recommend buying them as they are really cheap for what you get however a nice solution to buying dlc when bored is the modding community there are countless websites flooded with mods that go from nice road cars to formula 1 cars such as racesimstudio really high quality but paid mods and racedepartment mostly free mods quality differs but most are very good the only other game i would put above assetto for physics would be iracing for obvious reasons but in terms of content assetto is the best racing sim you could purchase and the best part of it is the game goes from 2 to 20 depending on when and where you buy it
