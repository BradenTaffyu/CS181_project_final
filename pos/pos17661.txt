2016 total war warhammer is the new entry to this series this time it is set in a historical period but the in wonderful world of warhammer it gives it a different vibe you can use flying mounts and magic which changes up the gameplay quite a bit i always wanted a fantasy total war game so i stepped on the hype train and i ve got to say this game is amazing in every aspect it has nice graphics even good fps on my little gtx 960 the gameplay is also really good watching 2 big army s clash is just amazing but there are some drawbacks such as the lack of races pre order dlc and the many overpriced dlc that ca sega is going to release but non the less that doesn t make it a bad game i think total war warhammer truly lived up to the hype and if your a fan of total war or the warhammer universe i fully recommend you to buy it this was my review of total war warhammer have a nice day
