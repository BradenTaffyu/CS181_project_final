2016 this is my first review i have ever done and i felt like doing it because this game gave me something extraordinary me 23 years old and my dad who s 52 have always liked games but for alot of the later years we simply did not play the same games probably because of taste we did however like strategy games both of us and have played alot of civilization together back in the times now i fell over this game and i actually brought the game for both me and my dad so we could give it a go for good old times sake little did i know what i got us into together we figured out how the game work step by step and getting stomped by the merciless ai s in every way possible for the first couple of hours please make a proper toturial for us casual people but nontheless we learned the basic of the game after 50 hours of insane amount of fun together with my father which included long discussions of strategies victories and defeats hell we have even been sitting at the dinner table talking about in what ways we could bring down the russian bear thank you for creating this amazing game and i would anytime recommend it for someone who got a friend og close relation to play it with there s nothing bringing people together like taking over europe 10 10 would have my father as hitler again update after quite some years this game is still a thing that we pick up and play many hours of good fun to get if you have someone to play with and we did eventually bring down russia quite a few times by now
