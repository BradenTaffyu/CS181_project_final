2019 a pitty a flawed gem was made in a forced rush fallout nv could ve been made in medium scale and had a perfectly immersive and well told story but only to be ruined by making it the scale of fallout 3 leaving the main story rather short and not emotionally connected and even some side quests unfinished but even then obsidian still managed to maintain its top notch rpg elements which is admirable when i thought i was gonna be disappointed by its mediocre close to poor immersion i then played all the dlcs and i was stunned in dead money then smiled in old world blues cried in honest hearts and then content in lonesome road all the npcs got rich personalities colourful voice actings and intriguing backstories together with great rpg mechanism and well written plots suddenly make nv so substantial even close to epic and that was exactly what i expect to experience in an rpg buy it if you are a true rpg fan also buy it if you are a fan of story driven games and sure don t forget the dlcs they are where this flawed gem really shines
