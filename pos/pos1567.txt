2017 so after 90 hours of gameplay i have completed 25 endings of 26 yes there are multiple endings most of which are funny jokes ofc but still you haven t played the game unless you ve seen a b c d endings those are core story parts you have to see when finishing the story first time it looked like the plot is weak and open world is too small when doing the second walkthrough new game mechanics are introduced and new characters rise this game to new level when continuing with third route it feels like that two previous were just a tutorial frankly and at the time you reach final credits you ll know it s finals i promise d oh let s say we all cry sometimes okay game s music is one of the best i ve heard so far plot feels like classic anime story at some points watch your jaw when starting route c optimization is okay for my phenom ii x4 7870 potato could have 40 fps most of the time awesome rpg like chip system bullet hell is on point cool mix of genres combat system is a step up comparing to mgr r previous platinum s game ballance feels a bit off sometimes i wish enemies were always constant stronger weaker depending on difficulty graphics is okay for a console port but still it s 2017 you wouldn t like playing without a gamepad it s definitely a goty for me p s i would also nominate it for the best ending credits might be even better then portal s hehe d
