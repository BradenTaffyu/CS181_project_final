2015 starting with collecting sticks and grass and then moving on to build your base you can pretty much find anything you would expect to see in a survival game in don t starve as it s very clear the main objective is not to starve you not only choose to cook what you want from the endless list of recipes but also try to survive from bunch of evil creatures make your own farm and collect your vegetables hunt down some animals and gather your meat and also create your own bee hives to gather some honey mix them all in a crock pot and voila you got yourself a delicious meal for dinner even if the graphics don t look like so the realistic ambient of the game is awesome if you get closer to the fire pit you will burn you can build a fire going through all the forest and they turn into ashes and coal if you get closer too much to the sea the items you drop will fall and disappear standing right next to a tree will cover you a little bit from the rain you know what that s not all i can tell you need to get the game and discover more actually survival in this realistic and somehow not realistic atmosphere is a lot fun surviving together with your friends is even more fun everyone takes their roles and you can build your base faster than ever if you die in this world it s not the end of the world as long as anyone of your friends could stay alive but you need to pay the price for it it is harder to stay alive in this game if you have more friends a dead body in the map cause all the remaining players to lose their minds so it s a lot more fun and also a lot more challenge don t just sit and play some boring games in your beautiful chair try to don t starve
