2018 i definitely recommend this game if you like city builders love the steampunk setting with great artwork design and music the game uses a radial city layout which i found very unique and refreshing the main story scenario is engrossing and the climax had me at the edge of my seat exploration in this game was also very well done big issue with this game is replayability the game currently only has 4 scenarios you re not going to be looking at building an empire in this game with multiple cities nor is there is a random map generator the tech tree is very simple and limited for the price i definitely think its worth a couple of plays on the scenarios but i think the dev s could ve done so much more with this idea and expanded it to mimic the replayability of other games hope they re working on that
