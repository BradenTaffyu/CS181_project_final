2022 this game good2k launcher badseriously tho idk how come a human brain can even think that extra launcher on a video game that launch on a game portal such as steam is really good idea i get it its marketing move from the dev but come on i bet u 100 nobody wanna take extra step just to start their game people really want it simple click the button and the game start thats it otherwise as i say before this game is good got a infinite replayability values and also tons of mods get this game on sale if u can btw since its got a lot of dlc that really can improve the game
