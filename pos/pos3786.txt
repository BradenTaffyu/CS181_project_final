oh my gosh where do i even begin this is one of the best games i ve ever played one of the things i love most about this game is the attention to detail every little thing in this game is important and there for a reason it makes everything so much more enjoyable to explore the colours are vibrant and all colour palettes for each section perfectly match the pixel art style was adorable and made everything super cute the different areas having completely different vibes added amazing variety to the game with personal touches littered throughout there is so much content in this game which makes it so fun to play over and over again it s one of those games that is so much better the second third time around the world building in this game was truly amazing everything was connected and all connections made sense seeing portions of the real world make it in to headspace was super interesting to see the interpretations in sunny s dreams lore was released as the game progressed sometimes in riddles which kept you wanting more this also allowed the player to try to piece things together beforehand which i personally found very enjoyable i absolutely loved the contrast between cute and creepy and the ability to combine them this was done perfectly in the soundtrack when some happy songs had creepy undertones later on the soundtrack on its own works in harmony alongside the game it is just as detailed and extensive as the game itself with the ability to perfectly accompany any area in the game due to its breath of tracks it also works perfectly as a standalone and fits any vibe year round the constant battles got old quite fast and were definitely the most laborious part of the game so many fights oh my i also particularly loved the influences of undertale yume nikki and even pokemon throughout the game it added a sort of nostalgic feel to it this is truly a labour of love and a very fun game to play it is well rounded and consistent in aesthetics detail and story line which makes the experience satisfying there is something for everyone in this game due to its complexity and breadth of spaces the personalised in game lingo is cute and adds so much depth to the main character all characters are well written and multi faceted with us getting time to explore different aspects of them at its core the game is very dark which can be off putting and sad since the main character is a young boy still it is truly an outstanding game that i will always be at the top of my list
