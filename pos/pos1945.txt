2023 131 hours into the game and i ve just finished my first playthrough as a bounty hunter with no subscription as a f2p player this game is amazing and i am definitely going to try playing with a subscription for my next playthrough however it should be noted that this game is a bioware game first and a mmo second as a huge old school bioware fan i am loving this game every second of it but if you are looking for a fun mmo gameplay experience i don t think this is everyone s cup of tea
