all rts games especially if online pvp is their focus have their problems but out of each one i ve tried to get into this is the one that stuck there are a few reasons for this attention to detail i know some people don t care about this but for me it s one of the greatest appeals of aoeiv from each civ having their own version of the menu music that will fade in when you select them in the lobby of a match to the progression of the languages your units speak e g the chinese speak pre tang mandarin in the dark age but speak ming mandarin by the imperial age this game is full with little things that probably go unnoticed for the most part i love how the architecture and unit designs evolve and are wholly unique this was something that bothered me in aoe2 the vietnamese knight looks the same as every other civs knight unit which from what i can tell wears a barbute an italian helmet chainmail and a kite shield a norman shield design when i noticed that ottoman men at arms wear the distinctly ottoman design of mirror armor or that the hre maa wear 1400s german sallets the game hooked me in even if it might seem easy to get these little things right they go a long way to go more in depth about the architecture in aoe2 11 different architectural styles are shared by the 40 civilizations because of this the chinese japanese koreans mongols and vietnamese all share the same style east asian despite the immense differences between them in real life one thing to note about aoe4 is that buildings stick to a default shape and size but are altered to best suit the civ s architectural style this is for clarity so this could be seen as a pro and a con ultimately i do prefer that the byzantines have their distinct architecture rather than having to share the same style with the armenians georgians italians portuguese sicilians spanish and romans the way they do in aoe2 as far as the music goes in aoeiv each civ has its own unique soundtrack there are different tracks for when you re at peace and when you re in combat and on top of that the music is also unique to the age you are currently in the sound design in general in this game is incredible with distinct audio cues such as your scout s whistle when they see an enemy the thunderous blasts of bombards and the metallic clashing of blades on armor variety the civs in this game while fewer than those of aoe2 have much more to offer and have distinct architecture unit designs extensive voicework and music that help represent their real life counterparts on a greater scale this goes beyond aesthetics though as each civ in aoe4 s cast contains unique mechanics that change how you approach a match a good example would be the byzantine cisterns that increase the gathering rate of nearby villagers they do this inherently but there is an additional toggle able choice between increasing the military production speed and research speed or reducing the damage taken of nearby buildings again this means you ll need to micro your cisterns according to your needs and build your base efficiently to maximize their bonus landmarks in aoeiv you age up by building one of two landmarks unless you are playing the abbasid who instead upgrade their house of wisdom this is one of the biggest things the game has going for it gameplay wise in aoe advancing to the next age will unlock new buildings units upgrades etc so it s very important in aoe2 this was done by clicking advance to x age in your town center but landmarks make this decision significantly more interesting as you have to choose where you re going to age up each landmark is 4x4 when you re going to age up you can assign multiple villagers to construct buildings faster albeit with diminishing return and what aging up will actually give you as landmarks provide vastly different things so your choice is important overall matches are much more dynamic and interesting due to this system base design due to the influence mechanic civs will have to carefully plan their bases in unique ways for example the ottoman blacksmith increases the military production speed of all military buildings in the area the byzantine cisterns previously mentioned is another example and the chinese imperial academy landmark is an example of a landmark becoming much more useful when planned properly the fact of the matter is that this will cause the bases of each civ to look vastly different from one another not due to aesthetics but due to the different ways in which they are rewarded for placing buildings in a certain way combat i personally love the rock paper scissors approach to combat in this game each civ despite having unique appearances has the same with one main exception the malians cast of units and by that i mean they serve the same similar purposes i e a light anti cavalry infantry spearman a light ranged infantry archer and a light cavalry unit horseman these 3 units create a triangle with archers doing bonus damage to spearmen spearmen doing bonus damage to horsemen and horsemen doing bonus damage to archers this triangle is expanded upon with men at arms crossbowmen and knights aka heavy infantry anti heavy ranged and heavy cavalry maa do no bonus damage but are armored and have more hp while knights soft counter maa they just trade better while still being countered by spearmen and xbows do bonus damage to both maa and knights unique units shake it up a bit too i like this system and it s a lot more intuitive than most rts games unfortunately the combat does nosedive a bit in the super late game with siege battles which strip away the significance of the counter triangle and introduce a much more one dimensional anti siege siege unit springalds that you re almost forced to make if you don t want your army and or base to be obliterated by enemy siege weapons the biggest issue s in my opinion the biggest issues with aoe4 all have to do with the care put in by the developers when it comes to the competitive ladder there is a non zero number of maphackers and smurfs throughout the map hacking issue should in theory be easy for the developers to stamp out so its prevalence can be irritating although usually map hackers are not very good smurfs are common in every competitive game though and are hard to just outright remove so really it s just something to be aware of conclusion aoe4 is a great rts that does an impressive job at adhering to its chosen historical period for a game while remaining competitive balanced and most importantly fun
