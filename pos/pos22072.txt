2017 my first experience with dark souls iii as this was my first dark souls game of the series i haven t played well finished any of the other dark souls games and the reason is simply because dark souls ii s hitboxes are too broken for me to enjoy it and i don t have a controller to play dark souls i yes that means i finished dark souls iii with a mouse and keyboard but i will tell you this for all the people who are still unsure to buy this because they don t have a controller mouse and keyboard works perfectly fine a controller might be the best dark souls experience but as a pc gamer i wish to play games on a mouse and keyboard and not be expected to buy a controller to play a certain game one of the most beautiful things about dark souls iii is the music the music is simply stunning it fits perfectly in every area and it really gets you into the dark atmosphere that surrounds the kingdom of lothric the cutscenes are also very well made and really get you hyped to get into the game to learn more about its dark story the diologue voice acting is very well done and makes you actually want to listen to what the characters have to say as for the bad part of the game since no game is ever perfect the port from console to pc is kind of horrible first of all you have to navigate through the menu using e as enter and q to go back and all the controls are displayed as controller buttons which is very annoying when you are new to the dark souls series and first play through the game there are tutorial messages but ofcourse they all display the controls with controller buttons aswell thanks to this you have to open up the options and look at all the keybindings to see what button is the equivalent of the controller button displayed but becides all that once you learn the controls you should get the hang of it fairly quickly and you will get used to it in no time right now i m about halfway through new game plus which some of the borderlands players might recognize as true vault hunter mode you basicly play through the game again with your same character and you get to keep all your weapons and stats but everything is slightly more difficult and i am still enjoying every second of it i see now how some people have spent over 300 hours on this game because it simply never gets boring yes it will get frustrating at times but you just have to keep going and not give up it is perfectly fine to take a little break though when you are having trouble with a certain area boss as i have done this plenty of times aswell and that really allowed me to keep enjoying the game without getting mad at it too much if you keep having trouble beating an area or boss you can summon a friendly player to help you out as there are plenty of people out there willing to give you a hand i know not everyone will agree with my opinions and this certainly won t be the same for everyone if you are into rpgs like finding new items and gear and are up for a challenge i d say buy it and see for yourself don t let the fanboys discourage you or the fact that you might not have a controller but don t buy the game and then get mad that the controlls are because it is already very clear that dark souls games have console ports conclusion great game great atmosphere and an amazing dark story but keep in mind that it is a bad console port and if you are planning to play it with mouse and keyboard you will have to deal with the consequences i say it is worth a buy but not everyone can enjoy it like i did
