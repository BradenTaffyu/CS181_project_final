2019 i wasn t sure if i d like this game so i didn t know if i should buy it in the end i decided to give it a try i deeply regret that decision a few days and over 100 hours later here i am a thriving colony soon on its way of building a spaceship out of this planet of course some colonists have died i fondly remember sparkles who led a normal life up until the day i put her to handle animals an veritable army of furry friends always behind her defending her when she lost an arm trying to tame a beast but nothing they could do when that rhyno destroyed her chest instantly and who could forget those two guys who died in cave ins their sacrifice for my own further understanding of how caves work in this game will not be forgotten but enough about the dead the raiders left dying on the floor after their allies abandon them fleeing cowardly from my might those have been a permanent source of wonder wondering what to do with them i could treat their wounds and have them join me but some were truly detestable some factions are happy with me when i return their raiders safe and sound but eventually the only faction left that still hated me didn t care for that selling them as slaves was nice for a time too but then i found out about it organ harvesting i developed a perfect strategy is the prisoner a psychopath bring him to the vip cell a private cell with a state of the art medical bed and monitor to ensure survival spacious and furnished beautifully it even has a tv anything for my future recruit is the prisoner not a psychopath bring him to the meatbag barracks a dirty dark room barely kept at survivable temperatures where our guest gets to sleep on the floor upon arrival and once their condition is stable the prisoner is sent in for surgery the first step is the removal of the legs to avoid escape attempts the prisoner can now only lie there on the floor waiting for its demise they see their fellow prisoners every week or so they are sent in for surgery there s a huge scar on their torso for you see colonists get sad if you remove too many organs too fast but after one week they ve forgotten all about it eventually the prisoner s body has no more to give they die and they are sent to the other room it s a freezer and it s full of meat it s where their meals come from raw human meat yes i feed them the bodies of the other prisoners and of everyone who died during the raid anyone who wasn t on my side of course my colonists get a beautiful sarcophagus burial the bodies are chopped up by a psychopath who does not mind the task at all and i get to sell nice expensive human leather t shirts along with their lungs and kidneys tl dr this game turns you into an awful person and steals all of your time 10 10 don t buy it save yourself
