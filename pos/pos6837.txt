2017 euro truck simulator 2 it is a fantastic truck driving simulator with really good physics and many other aspects now with multiplayer it s just getting better although multiplayer should be implemented into the game without the use of external servers that are controlled by boring admins who want to drive like real truckers and bend the rules towards their imagination edit apparently multiplayer is slowly being implemented into the game i sure hope one day i will see free roaming euro truck simulator 2 servers without anyone controlling it
