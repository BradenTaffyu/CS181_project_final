2023 i have so many positive things to say about this game that i honestly don t know where to begin i guess i ll start with the difficulty the game is extremely difficult i mean it s dark souls i don t think anyone is surprised by that if you re not familiar with dark souls games all of them are very difficult but that s exactly the point and half the fun comes from overcoming the difficult challenges that the game presents to you i m a newcomer to the dark souls series and this is the first souls game that i ve played and finished i liked it so much that by the end of the game it became my favorite singleplayer game of all time if you re not up for the challenge and do not like trying to learn boss patterns i don t think this game will be your cup of tea even regular enemies are tough and some of them may make you want to scream and smash your controller against the wall there is no tutorial the game doesn t hold your hand at all and you re pretty much on your own from the beginning you have to figure out where to go what to do what items do which weapon is the best for you which armor to wear which stats to level up how to beat a boss etc i liked the ui in this game a lot it s very simple and doesn t have a bunch of obnoxious ui elements that cover up half of your screen it s small useful and simple and the menu is really easy to navigate boss and level design are so far above average games it s unreal every boss looks good and unique and has his own attack patterns every area in the game has its theme and is very fun to explore it s very rewarding to get an upgrade or a new item from just exploring the world everything has its purpose and a lot of things have interesting lore behind them unlike most other games in dark souls you have to work for it in order to get lore you have to look for npcs in areas of the game and talk to them to get bits and pieces of the lore which later you have to put together in your head if you want even more lore you can read the descriptions of various items the game uses environmental storytelling and doesn t just serve you everything on the plate in terms of replayability i d say that it s worth replaying the game multiple times to get different endings and fight your favorite bosses a few more times the game has a feature called ng which allows you to replay the game with the same character and not lose any items except specific ones like keys and keep your levels spells weapons etc there are a few optional areas and bosses in the game that you can easily miss if you re playing for the first time which is one more reason to replay the game gameplay is very fun there is rolling and attacking those will be 2 main things you re gonna use of course there is more to it like weapon arts spells parrying blocking and things like that but i found myself using mainly roll and attack buttons and i think that s how it is for the majority of players especially new ones there is a ton and i really mean a ton of different weapons that change how you play the game depending on which one you re using on the one side you have slow but hard hitting weapons such as greatswords which is my personal favorite and on the other side you have fast but lower damage weapons like katanas and daggers don t let anyone tell you you re using a bad weapon or your build is bad because you can beat the game with any weapon if you practice enough and if you re really good you can also beat it on level 1 naked and by using nothing but your fists the graphics are pretty decent considering it s an almost 7 year old game but that is not very important in my opinion and you should not expect much in that department dark souls 3 runs well on older systems and you shouldn t have problems running it even on higher settings if you have even a somewhat competent pc there is also pvp if you play in online mode but i haven t tried it yet so i cannot comment on that if you re really having trouble with some boss you can summon a friend in co op to help you out but i wouldn t recommend it since beating a boss alone and all by yourself feels infinitely more rewarding at least to me there are only 2 cons about dark souls 3 in my opinion 1 keyboard and mouse controls are awful i strongly recommend not using them to play this game a controller is pretty much a must have if you want to have a good time 2 camera in some boss fights like 1st phase nameless king when he s riding that dragon you re fighting the camera more than you re fighting the boss these cons are easily forgivable since there are so many good things about dark souls 3 and everything else about the game is epic i have so much more things to say about the game but this review is already too long so to summarize 1 extremely challenging game 2 no tutorial or hand holding you re on your own from the start 3 very simple and minimalistic ui 4 godly boss and level design 5 fun exploring 6 interesting story 7 environmental storytelling 8 good replayability 9 enjoyable gameplay 10 big variety of weapons and armor 11 good optimization even almost 7 years after its release dark souls 3 is still worth buying for the full price of 60 euros the best singleplayer game i ve played 10 10
