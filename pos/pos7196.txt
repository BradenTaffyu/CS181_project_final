2018 early access review very good funny and chill game to play with friend s to explore the whole ocean and build up your own raft to be honest one of the funniest co op game i ve ever played i definitely won t recommend you to play this game alone it would be ultra boring so bring some friends and chill with the ocean 3 only negative thing about the game is lack of content you can t do much things other than searching islands on the ocean it s pretty much the same after some time but still it s really fun
