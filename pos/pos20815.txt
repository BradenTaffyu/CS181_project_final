2023 enchanting mesmerizing captivating bewitching whimsical fantastic these are all magical words and they re some of the few words i d use to describe hogwarts legacy so make of that what you will or read the rest of my thoughts on this incredible game hogwarts legacy has been to me at least a magical journey in the full meaning of the word it has taken me back to my childhood where my obsession with harry potter was a bittersweet escape from reality does it actually hold up to the fantasy it is a hard thing to pull off to centralize this kind of fantasy and it has been a thing millions of people always dreamed of for decades it s understandably hard for any game developer to satisfy the immense scope of the expectations for a game that promises more or less an adventure as a student in hogwarts i had always been highly skeptical of this game as a result point of fact when i saw the first gameplay showcases late last year i wrote this game off i was like yep this is trash suffice to say that i have swallowed my words since then and i have been proven thoroughly wrong and now count the game as one of my most treasured experiences in video games no this doesn t mean the game is perfect it has glaring issues here and there but rarely anything is perfect the good in this game greatly eclipses the bad hogwarts castleone word huge 120 hours later i still don t have its layout mapped in my head and i m still now discovering new secret locations even after combing so many parts of the castle many times it has so much of the iconic locations from the films and books the great hall the iconic courtyard in front of it the creaky wooden bridge the grand staircase and much more hogwarts legacy a screenshot of hogwarts legacy by sul the schoolthroughout my engaging playthrough of the game the school itself was for the most part consigned to the background while the story of the game unfolded or while i explored the beautiful world at the end hogwarts felt exactly just that a backdrop most classes what few there are are just a cool introductory cutscene from then on the teachers will give you assignments to learn more spells the classes are more or less presented as missions rather than a routine activity or part of the school and as i went more and more through the game and performed some cursory retrospect of my playthrough i quickly realized that the time i spent in the school itself was but a minority of my entire playthrough open world my experience with hogwarts legacy s massive open world is hard to sum up it every time i thought i discovered most of the map i m immediately surprised to know that there s a whole new uncharted realm that i haven t been to idyllic glades and creeks giving way to the most charming of villages mountains and ridges crowned with the ruins of long lost castles cliffsides pockmarked by mines tunnels and caverns astride them dense forests concealing ancient barrows all consecrated in a whimsical atmosphere meant that i lost track of time when i was going through this beautiful world it s so full of amazing things to do or discover that i never felt a moment of tedium even after spending 110 hours into the game most of which were spent combing this huge world there are also 3 seasons each isn t just a dressing it adds some cool interaction to the world like snowmen who fight you in winter the open world features many of the famous locations from the books films the hogwarts express hogsmeade the forbidden forest etc and it s mindboggling how much detail and care was put into presenting all of these every iconic location is in of itself a world combatthere are 27 spells in the game including the famous unforgiveable curses and some consumable items like mandrakes aoe stun or chinese chomping cabbages ferocious critters that attack enemies and the thunderbrew potion which calls a miniature thunderstorm over enemies the spells offer a pretty wide variety of combo possibilities you can juggle small enemies in the air tossing them back and forth up and down freezing them transforming them into crates or even explosive barrels which you can then toss at other enemies and outside of the spells your character also possesses a special affinity towards ancient magic that allows them to just ohko enemies either by calling thunder on them blowing them up into smithereens transforming them into chickens pick up objects around the world toss them at enemies etc storythe game pushes you into its story brusquely in the first cutscene framing the background of your character who is capable of seeing and crudely manipulating the ancient magic so off the start your pc already has the i m the chosen one badge this might sound unappealing but fortunately the game doesn t go ham with this theme and handles it really well beyond core narrative there is an adventure that awaits in hogwarts the pc will meet many students form close bonds with them and some of them are really really well written and compelling characters especially sebastian sallow these characters will oscillate between being parts of main story questlines and being secondary side characters if you will get this game make absolutely certain to play their questlines because the writing is really chef s kiss so good and i enjoyed their quests very much student npc sthe 3 main student friends you will meet in hogwarts are natsai onai gryffindor sebastian sallow slytherin and poppy sweeting hufflepuff unfortunately for some reason ravenclaw doesn t have a major story character though i enjoyed samantha dale s quest very much outside of major house reps there is a lot of other students you ll meet and do errands for throughout the school villainsthere are several compelling villains some the player will bring the fight to some will bring the fight to the player some can only be fought in side quests you will slowly discover more and more about them and some aspects of them seemed to have been red herrings which the narrative has a healthy amount soundtrackthe soundtrack is stellar and is mostly inspired by the music score from the first two hp movies composed by john williams but there are some tracks that feel more reminiscent of the 5th and 6th movies some tracks like soaring above hogwarts give me goosebumps 90 of the time i hear them endingsthere is unfortunately a dearth of player agency though the game presents a long list of dialogue choices most of them are for flavor but some will have story consequences such as deciding a character s fate there are 3 different endings but they don t have any requirements it s more like you decide what your witch or wizard will do with something they find at the end most side quests will have multiple options at the end sandboxone of the byproducts of the huge scope of this game is that they added a lot of sandbox stuff to the side mainly condensed in the room of requirement ror it s something you ll unlock about 1 4th into the game the game gives you a room and free reign to customize it however you please you can collect or purchase hundreds of items furniture d cor to put into this room and the amazing thing is that it also iteratively grows throughout the game adding several vivariums where you can keep magical beasts you collect across the world these vivariumae each unique and different are in turn customizable with a different pool of stuff verdict 9 10it was hard to write this when i finished writing my first draft of this it was really huge i d write way more if i could but review char limit yes you should get this wonderful game
