the most effective game if you re wanting to calm down after a long day or just enjoy shutting your brain off and satisfying the inner adhd gremlin unfortunately it s also very dangerous for your sleep schedule mine is now completely ruined also there s lore and a plot and it s not what you think it might be luckily there s nothing dark and gritty besides the dirt and it s actually kind of amusing some levels are actually pretty large for one person to handle so you can either buddy up with someone or if you have no friends do it a little at a time instead of trying to power through it all in one sitting unless you have that much free time then go for it there s some customization options though they really aren t too important unless you play multiplayer fortunately you can earn them without having to pay real money just leveling up in the game is enough the only irritating part besides how big some of the levels are is that it s not always immediately obvious where you may have missed spots i had parts that weren t clean despite the show dirt button not showing anything being there spraying along seams and edges seemed to fix that problem most of the time other times you could be about 3 4ths of the way done cleaning something and it ll consider it completely clean which might be a boon for others but irritated me for whatever reason of all the teeny tiny complaints i have i just really like this game i can zone out and my one functioning brain cell remains entertained by spraying objects with water for hours and hours i don t know what that says about me
