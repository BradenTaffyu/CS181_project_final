2021 really fun game addictive never got bored of it with 80 hours gameplay is challenging and strategically fun humorous atmosphere funny animations and treatments there is a lot of miscellaneous stuff if you enjoy design and details building was my favorite part just an enjoyable and easy going game only thing missing is covid dlc thanks to hannah for the game key
