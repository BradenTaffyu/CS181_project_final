2018 early access review it s close to 10 pm and we are sitting in our thought to be safe house eating and chatting until suddenly the screams begin what s going on another horde we rush up the ladder to reach the roof of the shop to scout out the surroundings and there they are coming form the east a massive pack of zombies running over the crest of the adjacent hill like riders of rohan rushing to clash with the uruk hai at helm s deep like l rien elves we tension our bows and start hailing arrows over the undead mass that is viciously pounding on the first row of wooden spikes they don t stop coming for every zombie we kill two more appear in the distance the first logs start to break and they appear to have found a weak spot the metal door it breaks almost instantly as if it was made out of cardboard and they start to pour in there s everything from decaying men and women some crippled by the traps from the perimeter rabid dogs and what seems to be like a super zombie it has a distinctive scream and is bigger and stronger than all the others they scatter around the yard some of them are hitting on the walls of the building we are sitting on some have entered the workshop right next to us and suddenly we hear a huge explosion we had two barrels of gasoline stored in there and some of the zombies attacked them and blew them up body parts flying the whole front of the shop is now gone we keep shooting at everything that moves the zombies are already piling up all over our yard and many are trapped outside in our defences dawn is upon us and it still hasn t gotten quiet all the zombies are dead with exception of three super zombies that still crawl around crippled from our barrage of arrows we decide to come down from the roof to finish them of it is done we survived half of the east wall is gone the work shop is destroyed and now only houses the crater those two gas barrels exploding left behind and our building has major damage at the front but we are still here 10 10 would buy again
