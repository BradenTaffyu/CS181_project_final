2015 fallout 4 is a really good game but fallout 4 is a mediocre fallout game fallout 4 builds on previous fallouts in numerous areas the weapon customisation is unbelievably in depth satisfying and fun as is the armour customisation the settlements are downright fabulous spent 20 hours building sanctuary alone into a metropolis the map is big and filled with cool stuff and very funny things super mutants orders for instance google it the story is great followers are helpful and if you re a person who hasn t played any other fallout titles this will be an amazing game but fallout 4 is a step back in the fallout franchise for a lot of reasons therefore it may not be as enjoyable to a devoted fallout hardcore gamer the perks system is watered down you get power armour from the start which is just wrong wheres the sense of excitement from using it now its just oh power armour thats a thing not like omfg i got power armour i ma going to go and wreck some the character also somewhat takes away from the rpg experience in previous fallouts your character was not pre defined you could play as the bad guy that was really fun you could play as the good guy but in fallout 4 you can only really play as the concerned parent which while bethesda really has done well they ve taken away something beloved to the franchise to put a new thing in take it as taking one step back and another step in a completely different direction fallout 4 is a really good game it deserves praise but fallout 3 and new vegas deserve more so i ll give this game 2 scores for gamers who have not played previous fallout titles 9 5 10for gamers who have played previous fallout titles 8 10edit 8 10 is a mediocre score for a fallout game
