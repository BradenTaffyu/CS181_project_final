2022 with this game now launching in 1 0 i have to give it the due respect it deserves and give it a big thumbs up when this game was first shown i just thought looks like a cool tech demo but that is all when it was then released in early access i thought this is a seriously impressive piece of software but i do not see it becoming an interesting game now in it s current state i will happily admit that i was completely wrong the destruction is so satisfying and all you wish for is more and more during the campaign you often spend a large amount of time trying to plan stuff out destroying things in a particular way setting up planks and vehicles creatively such that you can get all the objectives done in time when you then complete the level it is super satisfying furthermore the campaign itself is also pretty interesting with different types of level objectives available with a nice background story to it all as well the progression feels great too with more tools of destruction becoming available to you over time my utmost respect to the creators of teardown not only is it an amazing piece of software it is also a fantastically designed game i hope to see much more of this engine in the future and with 1 0 i am really glad to see that the campaign has been extended as well so that is already a good sign
