slay the spire feels like the most well crafted experience i ve ever had gaming each class feels unique and powerful in their own ways card choices feel very meaningful the game can be brutally challenging but rewards game knowledge and attention to detail and thoughtful deckbuilding this is by far my favorite game i have probably over 3 000 hours between this my phone and watching youtube and twitch content and don t see myself stopping any time soon
