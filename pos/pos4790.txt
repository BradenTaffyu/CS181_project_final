2017 i used this for the write in award i named it missed potential the game isn t as unplayable and unspeakably terrible as a lot of people would say but it s several big steps back from nv in many ways it has both bethesda s best and worst ideas best and worst writing and best and worst characters there are glaring faults but look past them or mod past them and you ll find a thoroughly enjoyable experience yeah creation club is pretty scummy but this last update should reduce the amount of times f4se gets broken significantly and just keep not spending money on the cc and eventually they ll have to cut their losses and nuke it since it s costing them more than it s bringing in
