2018 early access review this game is hard this game will test you this game will break you this game does not help you this game will not be fun you will hate this game but when you finish the car and get that baby running you will feel accomplished you will know your engine and your suspension inside and out you will probably know more about cars after playing this game then you did going in this game will find creative and odd ways to ruin your day first game day 1 got the engine almost complete filled out an order form for a part and threw it in the van drank 7 beers and ate my sausage day 2 finished the engine as best as i can before getting it in the satsuma finished the front suspension for the satsuma de stressed in the sauna drank 4 more beers nearly finished rear suspension for the satsuma realized i left the sauna on looked up at the house it was engulfed in roaring flame ran into the house after my beer case perished in the flames rescuing my beer end game but being serious i never leave a session of this game feeling good im almost always angry frustrated sad whatever it always without fail finds a way to make me hate it and i love it this game doesn t baby you it doesnt work to help you it doesn t teach you or show you it throws everything at you and says good luck it makes you teach yourself it makes you die over and over again to anything and everything possible until you learn how to stop it it s a rage game getting over it with bennett foddy doesn t hold a candle to this game this game is rage but it s fulfilling it s enlightening it s educational and oddly it s actually still entertaining i reccommend this game but with a disclaimer this game is not for you if you carry a short attention span or want the game to teach you this game doesnt do that doesn t explain how cars work how controls work how any of it works just throws it at you and makes you learn yourself if you have no patience or desire to teach yourself from square one this is not your game for everyone else if this game interests you get it if you don t mind teaching yourself everything go for it it s worth it even through the tears and the blood and the rage it s all worth it in the end
