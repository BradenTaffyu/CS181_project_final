2020 perfect game for a relaxing evening after a hard day of work or school it s enjoyable easy fun no one shoots at you the townies are interesting do not have kids though they are absolutely useless everything gets repetitive though after a few years in game which was to be expected really great work by eric barone who deserves all the praise and love he got over the years all the work and free content he still releases is greatly appreciated by the community
