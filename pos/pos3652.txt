2021 close your eyes you ll be here soon i ve been waiting for omori for almost 7 years while i regretfully was not a kickstarter backer i followed along with high hopes and great interest a few years into waiting my hopes began to fall and aside from an occasional checkup i wasn t nearly as invested come december 2020 imagine my shock when i hear that the game actually came out after all these years i waited a few days to buy it afraid that the years despite the past few not actively being as hyped of waiting would be met with disappointment i have never been so wrong in my life close your eyes and you ll leave this dream omori is quite easily one of my favorite games of all time already there s so much to love about it the art is absolutely adorable the battle system is really fun the music is phenomenal the writing is some of the best i ve read in any game sometimes it s heartwarming other times it s hilarious plenty of times it s depressing and so forth the story is incredibly gripping as someone who has had a hard time sitting down and playing single player games for months now i had to force myself to close omori once i finally got started i could barely stop until i completed it as of typing this i ve completed the good and bad endings and plan to start the hikikiomori route once this has been posted i just absolutely adore the story and everything else about the game i m going to cut off the review here to prevent myself from gushing for too long and potentially spoiling it but please play this game everything is going to be okay
