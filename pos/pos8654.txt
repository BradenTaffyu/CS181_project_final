2021 let me first start by saying i ve never played an fps before nor been able to i normally have pretty severe motion sickness and combined with the usually fast paced action and sudden camera movement the majority of fps or most first person games for that matter will have me nauseous and feeling sick in the matter of minutes the slow pacing of thehunter allows me to play this with very minimal problems for which i am very grateful now into the actual review and gameplay i was first a little skeptical about whether or not i d enjoy this game friend of mine was playing multiplayer games and it looked fun so i decided to give it a try i thought it would lose excitement and distraction when playing solo but i was wrong there s a surprising amount of tension and excitement slowly tracking your prey and trying to line up that shot then chasing it without knowing whether it was a kill or not i decided to stream the game for comparison i normally manage to play about 3 4 hours before i get exhausted and stop playing i very rarely manage more than that while playing thehunter first playing solo and then the last quarter or so with friends i played for 10 5 hours uninterrupted in a single session i was having so much fun and completely immersed in the game i didn t even feel any exhaustion the difficulty curve can be a little steep at first because there s a lot of realism but even me a player with no experience in shooters whatsoever got some pretty decent progress improvement in the span of 10 ish hours this should be even easier for you if you have some decent experience with realistic fps games i was worried the realism would make the game too difficult and i would forever end up missing all my shots combined with my lack of experience but that was not the case you very quickly adapt to how to try and get vital organ shots and how to approach prey and how to track the key element is patience to not rush and savor the hunt as well as the kill the pacing of this game is slow you can track prey for hours and not shoot nor kill a single one even the process of trying to get that shot is a slow and meticulous process which allows me to play with very little motion sickness that might be frustrating to some especially if you re used to more excitement and faster pacing in your games see it as a walking simulator while you enjoy the scenery and ambience while occasionally getting the chance to hunt prey also recommend playing this game with a surround sound headset if you have one as the immersion and soundscape of this game are nothing short of amazing if that does not deter you you should really check this game out because at 5 bucks on sale it s a no brainer the maps are massive and there s so much content that will take you dozens of hours to explore even without any dlc
