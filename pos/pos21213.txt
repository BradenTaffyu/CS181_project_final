2021 if i had this game when i was 11 there s no way i d ever have left the computerit is the game for everyone who liked to set up toy soldiers and create imaginary stories and battlesthere are many great things going for this game good unit designs with a lot of factions prehistoric to wild west hilarious vocal acting very funny physics friggin slo mo however the absolute greatest thing in the game imo is the unit creator when it first came out it was impossible to stop making unit after unit just so many possibilities there are a lot of props for unadded factions in the uc so you can create those factions too one criticism is that the campaign is often a campain to get through as some battles need a fluke or plain luck to win also there is a range of bugs and the unit creator is unpolished though it could be getting updates later however this is one game i don t get tired of one of the funniest games i ve ever played
