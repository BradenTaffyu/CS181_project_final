2014 early access review at this point i have dumped 445 hours into this game and i don t regret a single minute of it i absolutely love this game even though i can still be considered bad at it but that is exactly why this game is fun no matter how good you get someone else will show you something simple and it will just massively expand gameplay options for you i would recommend this game to anyone that has any interest in space travel as far as i m concerned this game does it the best
