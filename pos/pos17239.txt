2017 all in all so far a complete and utter improvement over the original which had a very shaky start but was evolved into something great this game managed to improve the graphics while also being quite possibly the most well optimized total war game on release the factions feel so well fleshed out compared to game one in the beginning and there s only more to come for a small rundown on my experience so far the skaven play similarly to the beastmen but far more swarm like and with way better monsters and warmachines the high elves play somewhat like the empire but with more monsters and more elite infantry and missiles that are in turn more expensive the dark elves essentially are the high elves but aggressive rather than defensive and with more interesting cavalry and finally the lizardmen are possibly the most unique with an aggressive playstyle and incredibly tanky monsters that act as anvils for your infantry in the frontlines magic has been reworked to be what it should be an enourmous threat on the battlefield that can easily change the course of things a good wizard is far more valuable than an artillery unit the ai is possibly the most stunning change ai generals will get their troops to dodge incoming spells if possible and ranged units will target the biggest threat in their sight enemy ai wizards are especially frightening as they will punish you if you condense your units too much i can t recommend this more it seems like ca was given a much larger budget due to the surprise success of game one i can t wait for the free content we ll be getting as well as the possibilities for paid content the hype stegadon ploughs on
