2016 early access review i started a colony in the tundra looking for a bit of an extra challenge well an early frost killed all my crops then a solar flare shut down the hydroponics all the animals died off during the deep freeze and by mid winter we were out of food well desperate times call for desperate measures i opened all the graves from the previous raids they were frozen and well preserved disaster averted 10 10 would eat pirate flesh again
