2020 this is a great game for anyone wanting a post apocalyptic open world that tells a story more than the main story itself is interested in crafting or settlement mechanics and is somewhat forgiving of the occasional bugs wavering on any of those 3 or expecting fnv or fo3 may not merit buying this game on sale here is what you need to know great music and decent audio plus tons of solid recorded dialog more songs and dj banter are revealed as main story progresses the story of the world is well fleshed out and so are verbal dialogs that evidently cover nearly every contingent including succeeding failing bypassing certain quests the main story is kind of weak and slightly cliche but wasnt terrible for me what did annoy me was that the story only gave me a binary choice to majorly harm a faction when i should ve been given a choice between one of 3 factions i consistently aligned with railroad settlements are optional unless joining the minutemen faction only possible exception is doing some crafting of a teleporting machine s couple of parts decent weapon mechanics weapon mod system and armor mod system hard difficulty is well balanced survival is a hardcore mode that i didn t try legendary equipment drop system is fine and varies greatly explosive shotgun of any kind is op as each of 8 pellets has its own explosion for damage purposes and is not included in calculated base damage settlement building is not without its bugs but its largely functional high physics fps and scene loading fps unlocker mods are both imperative and will not shut off achievements most mods will warn you that they ll disable achievements unofficial patch mod requires all dlc and may disable achievements autosave is okay but shouldnt be used exclusively for risk of losing progress if game crashes which it did for me perhaps once every 10 hours game will not warn you if a save was not successful for example if you have windows protrcted folders enabled and dont have the game added to the allowed programs it is easy to try to visit every location and do everything but i recommend balacing side quests exploration and main quest to prevent burnout on any one thing game performance sucks in the middle of dense cities and iirc can be cpu bound on my 3570k and gtx 1060 textures at 1440p suck unless you get high def pack from devs or theres mods with bits pieces
