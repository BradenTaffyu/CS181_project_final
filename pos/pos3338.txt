2017 this is a 230 hours review on tactician tldr this game is 10 10 and deserves a spot in the rpg hall of fame it is a must buy hands down pros story amazing introduction that ramps up to a very good confusing mid game meltdown and ends in emotional chaos gameplay top notch skills spells interactions ai everything feels smooth and fights never get boring length you dont know when the game is finally over it is soooo long and thats a good thing difficulty on tactician the game starts absolutely brutal towards the end it unfortunately becomes easier except a few exceptions who are crazy hard again cons merchants 1 hour waiting to get a chance of new piece of gear no gear leveling with you lots of unique armors or weapons capped at level 18 you can fix this though by using mods but then you get no achievements it s not noticeable until the very end but then you notice it very hardly to the point you go afk for 1 hour to get some new gear skills some skills felt lacking especially the source skills resolve into 2 3 being better then all the others which makes you feel pidgeon holed since the enemies on harder diffs are going to spam you with the good stuff some skills npc s use cant be learned also you cant make true new classes in the sdk currently which is a big downer story i understand that with so many choices it gets more complex to keep track of everything sometimes the game does not explain or give you a chance on understanding why a character in the story would do something one example would be gareth if you chose to destroy everyone but side with him always he still will be opposing you at the end while not explaining why so yeah thats unfortunately not the only story let downs thievery only 1 pickpocket per npc per character this is ridiculous by the astronomical prices you have to pay and the minimal gold you get for selling stuff
