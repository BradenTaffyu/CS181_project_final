game is amazingly beautiful with the different areas the combat is hard as one would expect in dark souls game i do love the enemy variety the bosses range from kind of easy to absolutely extremely horrific in difficulty but that is what makes it exciting you never know if you come across a boss that will devastate you or be not so bad i am working slowly through the game after restarting because i had forgotten the mechanics of the game having a good time and feeling very excited when i finally beat a very difficult boss the game runs well and has no issues in that area for me definitely a must play for souls players i will update once i have finished the game and dlcs so far i do suggest this highly to any souls or souls like players looking for a nice challenge
