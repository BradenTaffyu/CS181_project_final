2021 i started out on my home continent in ets2 and i absolutely loved it then i got a bit tired of dense traffic and the tight network of cities of europe well i finally crossed the pond and found the vast american countryside to help me escape endless roads and visible stars in the unlit desert nightsky make you forget you actually have to go somewhere ccr on the radio tumbleweed crossing perfectly straight roads while you scramble to the brakes to avoid running into daisy town passing the cops with 65 or whatsit in kph can t be that fast right i mean it only says 65 in my heavy hauling cascadia freightliner together with my playist of classic rock i now turn the roads of the western states into a nightmare for drivers the only con now is in my car in the real world i keep wondering why the hell we don t have traffic lights on the opposite side of the crossings my sore neck would really appreciate it but honestly love driving love listening to music while driving love trucks love america insert music and european clichee of american patriotism then buy this or ets2 or both they really did a great job with these games nice mod support by the way hope they dlc their way to the east coast in the future best of course to get the games and all of the dlcs while on sale sure there are a lot of dlcs but they are worth it and after all more space to drive and places to go is what you need anyway right after all there s this beautiful country to drive around and while environment graphics are of course not top of technology the game looks absolutely fantastic especially the modelling of the available customisable lorr ahem trucks can easily be played with mouse and keyboard i use pedals from flight simming for fun probably best with a steering wheel though
