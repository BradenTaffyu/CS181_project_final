2022 early access review this is not a game for everybody it doles out a lot of pain and frustration it has an extremely steep learning curve this game will push you over the edge at some point but there s an intoxicating charm to it all that no other game has and that moment when you finally do get that car to roar to life and drive it five feet down the drive way is euphoric even if it stalls or bursts into flames shortly after you will need to read the wiki for the jobs and survival stuff but i recommend attempting to assemble the car without a guide it s not as hard as it looks and building the car is easily the funnest part of the game i know very little about cars and i was still able to fit it all together with some mistakes of course the gotcha for me is that some bolts need to be loosened to fit other parts on namely the center bolt on the front wheels and the front starter bolt for the batt neg once you build it you ll want to read some guides on tuning because that does require some real car knowledge that the average person won t have the assembly itself is more like a puzzle the rest of the game is doing the summer jobs for money to survive and buy parts for the car or pay off your fines they re a little grindy but i do think they re fun most people coming here have probably already seen someone play the game and know what they entail negative reviews are complaining about the changes the developer has made over the years for the most part he s just fixing exploits in the game for the changes that aren t a fix it s still easy to see how they fit into the dev s vision for the game removing the blue van as a starting vehicle is meant to encourage the player to try building the car before they go wandering around the map and it works i know because i had initially intended on avoiding the build i just wanted to mess around i half heartedly threw some parts together out of boredom waiting for the van turned out building the car was a ton of fun and i ended up restarting the game several times just to build it again there s other ways to get into town at the start to get your tires supplies you can hitch a ride with the green car or take the boat if you re feeling extra patient you can drive the tractor some of the complaints are insane i saw one review complain that he couldn t kill the green car to clear the dirt roads anymore and moaned about harsh consequences for killing people the whole point of pena is to be an obstacle that adds challenge to driving on them what kind of game does he think he s playing this ain t gta v loser stop crying and git gud this game isn t even hard once you learn the ropes
