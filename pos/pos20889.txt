2021 usually i write my review for games when i immediately finish it that way my memory for the game is super fresh and i can express my feeling of that game at the peak moment this game is a very rare exception of the above statement i finished this game and got first ending around 11 50 last night let my emotion settle for 10 minutes then go check out the second ending even through it s mid of the night and my memory is super fresh i decided to go to bed have a good rest this morning i woke up refreshed and spent quite some time gathering my thought for this game i am now 40 year old guy and already experienced quite a bit in my life some good some bad some sweet some bitter and some dread painful i consider my life good and even through i am not religious i do thank the powers there is for every day that i lived on this earth this game somehow reached out connected to me greatly this is not the only story rich choice driven time warping consequence based adventure game i ever played but none of those games offer the same type of real life feeling as this one music voice acting scenery design and game plot are all done perfectly each episode is great paced with up and downs with quite a few surprise twists of event achievements are not important during first playthrough as there are collectable mode for you to go back to each different scene to find them later really nothing bad i can say about this game but i won t recommend this game to everybody even through it s a game based on teenager you do need to have gather quite a bit of wisdom of ages to truly understand what everyone is going through in this game yes there are darkness in the world with very bad people but most people are still good person none of them would be perfectly good but as we all straggle with what life throw at us and we are pushed with fate that we cannot control power to change time or not life is strange that you can only struggle to move on with your life always everything has consequence and one little miss step could ruin lives 10 10 play this game and appreciate your life if you don t like this game or don t understand it give it a few years get older live your life then come back to this game you do need wisdoms and experience in life to understand what strange life we all live in
