2014 don t starve is a game that really grew on me it seemed very unforgiving at first but when i learned my way around it it felt very rewarding then just then i realized how challenging this game really is i felt like i really had accomplished something it wasn t just delivered to me with flashy signs or arrows that indicated what i should do or when and this is without saying how beautiful the art and the music are in this game which is only a plus side to the amazing gameplay that was carefully crafted is it worth buying yeah i don t know can you handle being challenged to a frustration point because unless you took a look into the game s code getting around the situations you will be put in on the first attempt will be extremely hard and if you care so much about beating a game like i do you will get mad personally i feel like this game changed the way i see things that the weird and bitter sometimes can become your biggest passion
