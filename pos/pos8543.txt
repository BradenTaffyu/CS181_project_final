2017 in germany we have a saying der fisch f ngt am kopf an zu stinken which roughly translates to the fish rots from the head down you can feel that talented and passionate people are working on this game it s just a shame that someone decided that the game had to be released in a barely finished state overall the gameplay is great but there are quite a lot of litte things and glitches that add up and can be frustrating from stuck animal herds to crashes broken scopes and unresponsive menue buttons you ll see it all i really miss a better highscore system or trophy room of some sorts you have a list with your scores but it s really basic it s hard to recommend but i still enjoy the game the two beautiful maps are huge and the gameplay is for the most part quite solid the game just feels rough around the edges also it is good to see that the developer moved away from the awful free too play model of their previous release
