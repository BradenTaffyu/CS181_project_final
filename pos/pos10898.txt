2016 since hoi 4 has been out for a few months now i decided to change my original review because there have been some changes and my original review may not paint a accurate picture of the product the good ui is better than it has ever been plus it looks nice the battle plan system is a good addition there are a lot of great mods out that add to the games replay value sound design is good there deffinetly is fun to be had the airforce and navy management is less frustratign now the peace conferences are decent the nation with the most score takes what they want and if you dont wnat much you can give things to other nations makes it feel pretty realistic multiplayer is more stable than in older paradox games you no longer have to close the game if you want to go paly multiplayer with your friends or start a new game the bad drawing a battle plan and having the ai execute it is nice but the ai is bad at it your army will advance very slowly and attack points in the enemy deffence where they will take heavy losses also your men don t exploit the gaps in the enemy line but some how the enemy ai is able to do it so it seams very dumb if you put your men on a front the ai will shuffle them around in idiotic ways it will not put an equal number of troops on every province it doesn t even prioritize provinces with hard to deffend terrain it seams to just plop them on the line randomly and during battle it will shift men around the whole length of your line to create as many gaps as possible witch the enemy ai will step in to makes historic france really frustrating to play the airforce management is better then in hoi 3 but it is still a pain in the ass plus late game whne oyu have a lot of equipment taken from other nations good luck finding your new fighters from the list of crappy ww1 planes that you have to go through every time ai controlled nations still make stupid nonsense decisions even on historic ai focuses like a fascist revolution joining the commintern to fight against the people who made the revolution happen or the usa declaring war on finland who is holding off the ussr or the usa declaring war on germany when it hasn t threatend a democratic nation yet but instead chose to go attack italy the list goes on and on this just makes it very hard to get immersed in the game keeps throwing silly at you france is way too weak compared to other major powers theyr focus tree needs to be redone in my opinion to make them fun to paly post 1940 as a minor country in europe or south america your only option is to go fascist because the manpower you are given in the start is just a joke and only the faschist tree gives you a decent enoguh manpower to actually play the game if you are democratic germany will just take you out nothing you can really do about it the ussr may be hungry for your land but as a friendly fascist you can join the axis and you will also have the manpower you need to hold your ground against the red meness still its a joke that as finland you start out with a manpower of sth like 7 thousend and then you are supposed to fight the winter war but if you decide to go fascist you somehow have 100 thousend to work with without having to change your laws i get that a fascist nation would have more men availoble but still in a gamepaly sense it just favours one choice over the others and historically it makes no sense eather there is no way to get out of a war unless you get total victory for faction vs faction it sort of makes sense because both sides wanted a total victory but for example china vs japan you can play a good game as china push the out of mainland asia and after that well i guess yo ubetter sit around and do nothing since japan will not sue for peace they lsoe theyr army and theyr foothold making it allmost impossible to acomplish theyr goals but they can t end the war because the devs didn t think to put that in or as finland or one of the baltic nations you decide to hold your ground against the soviets and you do it well you hold them for years and nothing the soviets will just keep throwing men at you in one of my games they lost 11 million trying to take finland well some of the casualties were inflicted by germany but still they couldn t take a single province from me and the war would still last forever this sort of thing ruins the immersion of the game little veriety in generic portraits as a minor nation you can have 10 twins leading your miltiary the tutorials suck if you are new then its better to go to youtube for the tutorials some nations soldiers wear shorts ai likes that annoying guy on social media with its spam you may be in theyr war allready but they will invite you again every few months would seam like an novice programmer could fix that problem with a simple line of code but aparently not if is in gayasswar stop asking the game will feel shallow once you have about a hundred hours in spying or diplomacy don t really make an appearence even though both were big parts in the pre war years in peace conferences the ai will do random stuff like hungary making a puppet out of some random nation in south america makes no sense but there you go there is a mod to fix this issue and just to be clear the ai in this game is just bad for exmaple i attacked turkey from 2 sides but i forgot to put an army on the southern border and so when i started pushing in rapidly the turkish ai decided it would be a good idea to rush msot of theyr dudes to take territory in africa even though they got cut off from theyr own land pretty much right away and that made it even easyer to kill thme so the traditional paradox 1 division running around being annoying ai is still present naval invasio nalrets are misleading since some times it means there is an invasion and sometimes when you click on it there is nothing happening when fighting england you wil lhear the the alert so much that you have to turn the sound off and 99 percent of those alerts are false alarms and then at one point you look at the big picture and yousee your troops are surrounded and there is a massive red bloob in the area sicne ifyou put troops on garrison what they will do is jsut sit there and get beaten up not react to threats that are comign into the area maybe an alert for losign territory off screen would have been a good idea but then again i am not a game designer so what do i know the ai can not deffend against naval invasions there is an option to send equipment to other nations but the ai never uses it the game is stable for the most part but fun glitches still happen most recent one i had was when my infantry equipment melted i tryed to put a stop to it by dispanding all my divisions but still my best guns just kept melting or time the italians decided to do a fun dance on my border by movign men back and fourth and causing massive attrition to themselves but i suspect the ai doesnt take that much of a penalty since whenever i check how the ai is doing they have a massive defficit of everything they use and yet somehow they still make units in summary wait for a sale or go sail the seas of piracy alsothe man responsible for the ai needs to be fired out of a cannon into the sun
