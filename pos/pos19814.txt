2023 for those who have played older releases of this game and enjoyed it definitive edition is a definite yes it fixes a lot of quality of life issues that help age of empires ii hold up under modern standards while not changing anything too core to the game s feel for those new to age of empires ii this is definitely the version to get i ll warn you though that while it may be refurbished very well this is still an rts from the 90s so it has a lot of obscure mechanics and unintuitive jank long time players will be used to all that but it s probably uninviting for newcomers if you re just messing around with your friends or doing singleplayer that probably won t matter to you as much but if your eyes are on the ranked ladder it might feel unapproachable the decades worth of expansions while great only increase the overwhelming amount of unit interactions you need to be aware of however if you re into nerding out about technicalities and analyzing tracked statistics this game will offer a lot to sink your teeth into and there are whole communities dedicated to that if you like this game s premise but the thought of deep jank sounds unappealing you might enjoy age of empires iv instead a more modern take on this same series with a greater focus on being approachable whether you re new or old the fact that this game is still receiving a constant stream of free updates and paid expansions after 25 years is a testament to how much staying power it has a mediocre game does not stir that kind of dedication in people
