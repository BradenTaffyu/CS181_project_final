2018 the chillest game you can play there s no way to mess up in this game you see that farm you don t have to improve it if you don t want to maybe all you want is to fish and hang out with abigail or maybe you just want to fight slimes till you pass out hell maybe you just want to get drunk and bring the wizard presents you do you dog this game ain t gonna judge there s just so much to do in this game in the absence of a contemporary animal crossing it s easy to see why it s been such a massive success what it does is basically take all the heart and spirit of ac and place it within a more relaxed version of harvest moon s infrastructure that s just the basic setup though the real genius is in the way the gameplay is paced taking a cue from civilization s one more turn mantra this game is played over a succession of in game days for which you have a limited amount of stamina to carry out the many different little actions that you can take these days essentially bite sized segments of gameplay gradually add up to shape a deeply personal experience that feels very unique to the player that s the killer app here your farm your village your relationships and your trajectory along the seasons all feel tied up to the decisions you take and the activities you choose to do or not do day by day you can breeze through days if you want just picking up crops and sleeping before noon even hits or you can take it slow and optimize each day cramping in as many activities as you can with your limited stamina it s all up to you this game will also take you by surprise in the ways that it can engage you personally i was worried at first because farm building never really enthused me as a mechanic in fact the whole aspect of decorating improving your house in ac is something i never connected with either but this game has so much more than just keeping your farm it s got a good fishing system which i greatly appreciated it s got a mine to explore and engage in combat it has a museum for you to fill in with fossils and other tidbits it has a house full of mini challenges each with its own reward that will keep you busy for weeks and then there s the dating my god this game has some good writing the denizens of stardew valley are a family you ll come to know very well and each one of them has an interesting line you can follow as you strengthen your friendships with them as you can imagine the progression for these relationships is pretty straightforward you just gift them stuff but the real meat is in the little scenes that play when you hit the milestones in the relationships some of them will stay with me for a long time there s just so much value here it truly feels like an evolution in the genre with its more palpable and personal progression and the way it doesn t string you around or punish you for any way of using your time you ll play this game and wish you could have this simple tranquil life considering the game s intro and mission statement i call that a home run
