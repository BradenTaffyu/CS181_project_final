2019 ok i love this game it s my new favorite i will try to keep this review quick background i played a bit of the hunter classic years back and i thought it had so much potential but the ridiculous payments were just too much you had to buy literal in game licenses for each animal but when i first saw this one back in 2017 everything comes in a one time payment i was immediately interested time flew by and i forgot about the game my family got an xbox one and 2 months free of the game pass and i tried this game out on that loved it but wish i had it on pc long story short i finally got this when it went on sale this summer right after the yukon map came out what i think this is extremely immersive and very fun you can sink countless hours in with ease and there is an amazing community that is very helpful for getting started game has its bugs but they are minor distractions and the devs work hard at fixing them all the maps and stories i have played thus far layton lake hirshfelden and medved have unique animals and really cool and enjoyable stories seriously i am shocked at how good some of the stories are medved is just outstanding well i guess hirshfelden kinda sucks with its lack of large carnivores and low pop density and the story on that one is buggy and very annoying at times payed dlc a lot of people complain about all the payed dlc but i think they are whining for no good reason first off the game is cheap to start yet i easily get the same hours of enjoyment out that i get for a full 60 title then the dlc are dirt cheap they are all really affordable and make it easy for me to throw my money in support of the game and you get so much out of them you get entire new reserves for like 5 bucks each with their own unique story and new animals the only dlc i think should have come with the game is the trophy lodge i don t see much reward in landing big trophy animals if there is no way of displaying them that i will criticize recommendation buy it if you are even a little interested like i was you ll love this game even if your not a hunter and are in fact not really all that supportive of it in real life like myself you still will get sucked into the immersion and beauty but i do think its essential to have the trophy lodge so if you are trying to get the game take that dlc into account for your purchase
