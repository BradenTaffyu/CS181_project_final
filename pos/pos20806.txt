2023 excellent game not exactly the skills stats type of rpg for min maxers but for actual roleplaying it s up there the only problem is that it s strongly story driven there s not much reward for go it your own way free form exploration still as an action adveture it s a very solid and very enjoyable game with tons of stuff to do and plenty of meat to sink your teeth into i would not however expect to be able to get multiple play throughs out of hogwart s there s just not enough diversiity in character development or story to warrant a second go luckily there is enough here to get at least a couple hundred hours of gaming
