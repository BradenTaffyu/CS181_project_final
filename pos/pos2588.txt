2023 great story that is not afraid to get dark and part of a greater narrative of 2 other games that is not necessary for this game but improves the experience a lot combat is a bit tricky to learn but is simple once learned and has a lot of depth to accommodate the harder difficulties gacha is pretty generous and can be kept up with through the season pass dailies weeklies and events for all new releases for characters content is released at a decent pace with constant fixes through patches all in all a good game worth a shot if you want something long term to play cuz free isnt that bad of a price
