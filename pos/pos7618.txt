2022 im just going to say it this game hasnt been recieved quite as well as hospital though going to be real i think the reasons why will not affect the majority of peoples enjoyment as well as being stuff hospital got a pass on at launch first the difficulty yeah this is an easy game but so was tph until they added remix besides this game is significantly more focused on building than tph which was already the main aspect of that game youre not trying to process patients as quickly as possible but provide a good life for your students with a wide range of items second the downtime yeah i will admit campus could be better on this but lets not act like this wasnt also big in hospital taking time to train your staff decorate and waiting for the money to build up so you can build that new area still i do think campus should have had you do the enrollment thing every semester instead of every year besides hospital was always a chill game first and foremost actually thats a significant part of why some of its dlcs arent so favorably reveiwed on steam even if the larger community likes them lastly and the one i feel is the least valid that its a reskin really when you think about it almost every building management games are reskins build up areas to make money to build up more areas and i do think that campus sets itself apart in a way that shakes it down to the core even if it is similar to tph in many ways like i said earlier the goal is to build a nice college so your students pass their exams not process patients as fast as possible as well as campus giving you greater control over the environment instead of just challenging you to just jigsaw rooms together although i do think part of the less warm reception is that it is a different game from hospital in key areas and thus it wont be everybody s jam anyways this is still all subjective but yeah at least give it a shot steam is great about refunds anyways if you dont like it also not to mention its only been two weeks and youre seeing people who have 100 hours so yeah speaks to the replayability of this game which it is a lot more than tph
