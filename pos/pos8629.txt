2019 after reading a couple of negative reviews more than just not recommending i see myself forced to correct some statements and by that write my own review of this game introduction i do not have space for pastebin com addressing arguments pointed out by negative reviews many people complain about too much dlc and not enough bug fixing i was one of them a long time ago when i was still on 30 to 100 hours play time there are 2 issues with that statement 1 one being that certain game release models require you to release paid dlc regularly otherwise your studio will get broke in no time that s a fact not only shown in theory but i have experienced it myself many times and my heart is still broken over a couple of games i miss to this day after all these years yes that also applies to game with serious bugs and needs to fix there was for example a good explanation of how that is necessary in the documentary about warframe a similar model chosen is here as the developers are constantly improving this game for years instead of just dumping a sequel to silence the lambs 2 one being that people did not actually read the update announcement history of this game this is a matter of ignorance i admit i was part of it some time ago when i was still fresh to the game following this game s development cycle for so long reading up on each and every update since so many months regularly there is obvious evidence that the game is being worked on a lot especially under the hood where someone who played the game for maybe 50 hours wouldn t even notice at all you actually have to know what is broken and check it after the update that it has been fixed if the changelog says so saying that i can tell you from my experience that 80 of the bugs annoying me were fixed there were a lot of bugs like these about a year ago this game was compared to now a bugfest and a total buggy mess worst example constantly being the buggy animal ai other bug highlights include scoping problems achievements are impossible to unlock corrupted saves game crashes etc additionally a lot of minor bugs now guess what most of these mentioned bugs are actually fixed now go check it yourself i checked it and they are actually fixed the performance of the game is much better than before the animal ai has been obviously improved instead of seeing a bugged animal running in circles every hour you see that maybe once in 5 10 hours continuous playtime i unlocked the achievements i did not get before bisons call again are not silent anymore etc etc etc i could go on with the list if i could remember all the other bugs that had been fixed already considering these facts there is no way for me to claim this game is not being worked on that is plain wrong this dlc should be in the main game i will start with the most prominent example the atv quad bike dlc just until a month ago i was indeed of this same view i thought to myself they could ve added such small device to the main game itself instead of just milking the player with such a triviality but then recently i started to think about the purpose of dlc and what it is actually supposed to do it is supposed to add stuff to the game that does not quite fit into the core game or is merely an extension to the core game going by that definitions principle it wouldn t make a lot of sense to add this vehicle or pretty much any vehicle to the core game this game puts a lot of weight on perception from the animals side you are pretty much supposed to always be quiet and not be detected by potential prey driving a hellishly loud atv through the landscape is the opposite of what the game tries to teach you additionally you don t ever really need the atv guess what you will never walk more than 800m to get to a specific spot because there is always a closer outpost somewhere you can teleport to free of charge any time the atv is a pure convenience feature sometimes actually the opposite as you are scaring all animals off that come close to your atv path that is neither necessary nor super helpful or anything like that the only time the quad bike is actually a good helper is when i want to visit and claim all outposts lookouts in a new reserve that is pretty much the biggest purpose for this device there is not any other purpose the atv handles stuff way more efficiently than your feet do so now from this point of view why would this be expected to be in the base game this does not make sense similarly but not as harsh people judge the other dlc as being incomplete bad or buggy i will give you that new dlc are often buggy and cause problems that is true on the other side they are most of the time fixed pretty quickly after release not the best thing to do but still not as terrible as some people are claiming one of the biggest points against new reserves is the copy pasting of animals partially it is a point because some animal behaviours are very similar to other ones in a different reserve on the other hand though what do you expect from an animal do you expect to behave 2 animals from the same kind to have entirely different or even personalized behaviour this would be utterly unrealistic it kind of make sense that 2 cat type animals are pretty similar in terms of behaviour and sometimes looks that said i personally love the weapon packs and i think they are worth every penny they extend the play time by a lot too much too expensive dlc i don t buy this game adding all the non discount prices of all dlc base game into a single price for new players you don t need the dlc you can even buy just the base game and nothing is truly missing the dlc for this game are made to extend the game if you already have played it for several hundred hours then dlc comes into play before that there is no need for a single dlc that said even if you think you need some dlc like the atv which appaprently every new player assumes then there are already a lot of solutions provided by the developers they provided a 2019 edition of the game slightly more expensive but it has some of the basic dlc already bundled in that is a very good deal and i think this profits the player much more than the developers additionally the developers actually listen there is a huge bug in the game everyone complains about all these that made a big fuzz are pretty much fixed there is a new african reserve without lions people complained and now you get a free update providing you with an aggressive lion that is super fun to hunt they could ve added this as dlc and yet they decided to listen and follow what the people says so this was pretty much the main stuff i wanted to address as i was sad to see so many people deciding not to buy the game just because of a couple of sometimes a single negative reviews from players who did not even pass level 20 in the game read positive and negative reviews and always check the play time generally i would suggest that one should have at least 200 or 300 hours in the game to know enough to drop an opinion on it if you really love negative reviews read them from people who have 500 1000 hours play time they actually have a couple of valid points mostly had as many issues are fixed already small addendum i am a pretty casual player but this game consumed a lot of play time from my personal view this is also the first game where i actually spent money on single un bundled dlc before this game i pretty much never paid for a single dlc in any other game in this game i possess almost all dlc and will probably continue to buy them as this game is worth it
