2020 early access review it s mount and blade it doesn t look horrible and it plays better than ever everything is more polished and there s more life in the world and in the cities it doesn t feel quite as unforgiving as the first couple of games but i m only a couple of hours in and that s a blessing so far it plays pretty solidly for an early access game i haven t had any issues with crashes or anything like that and it doesn t feel like anything is missing so far if you re a fan of the series you re probably going to get the game anyway but it s also a lot more accessible for new players than the previous titles but it hasn t lost any of the depth as i said i m only a couple of hours in but i will update my review if i come across anything that changes my mind edit so i m 12 hours in or something now and have had a couple of crashes and one infinite loading screen my single siege battle had issues when most of my troops stopped fighting when there were just a few enemies left but that eventually resolved itself the game is in early access so these things should get fixed in time i m still recommending the game because it s worth it but i would also recommend holding off for a bit until the bugs are fixed if you re worried about your playthrough breaking
