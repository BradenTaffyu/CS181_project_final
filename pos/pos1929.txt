2020 before i start this review i want to make this clear that i have around 300 or even 500 hours of gameplay also that i am a huge star wars fan who hates the sequel trilogy and is totally obsessed with the extended universe old and new also i play the game as a singleplayer experience the game itself offers a lot of content from the get go with 8 different story lines and 2 story expansions if you want to unlock everything else all you need is to subscribe for a single month and voila you have every single bit of story content unlocked except for some companions the story of the game takes place approximately 3600 years before the skywalker saga and 400 years after knights of the old republic 2 in my honest opinion no prior knowledge is needed to play the game but it does help if you have played through both knights of the old republic games and at least read the revan book for me the only reason to play this game was because i wanted to find out what the hell happened to revan revanourlordandsaviorthe game engine itself is weird but it gets the job done there are some performance issues on some planets but mostly the game runs and looks great i am not totally sure about the huge open design of large interiors tho but i got used to it in the recent years the developers have added a lot of features that have made the game more accessible for singleplayer people now you can complete the story raids flashpoints solo with a companion droid that assists you in combat and heals you all the time if you select the story difficulty also a huge plus is that you can select any companion and make them a healer tank or a dps by a single click of a button which helps out a lot for different kinds of scenarios the cartel market is there and it does offer some benefits mostly cosmetic stuff that allows you to flex on your poor friends if you want free cartel coins each month just remember to link your account with the swtor security key app overall i consider this game to be worthy of the title kotor 3 it does tie up some loose ends it is the last old canon story that continues to expand and it hasn t yet been debunked by the new canon so pretty much it is canon until they create a new kotor game or heck maybe even a movie pleasemakekeanureevesrevanif you thought my review was helpful then consider using my referral link for some extra benefits in the game
