2016 i tried to take over the world i did it s just so hard because the game and the other countries don t want you to still i learned a lot of geography and a bit of history which has really made me seem more worldly to my friends like your friends probably don t know what mogadishu is the capital of or what countries border laos or whether or not bolivia is landlocked also you can play out all sorts of interesting nationalistic roleplaying because sometimes you just want to identify as the spanish inquisition
