2020 for this former mtg dork slay the spire scratches a slightly different but familiar itch lots of fun easy to play while you re doing other things and just want something to fill in the gaps biggest advantage or disadvantage if you like this is that other players aren t required or even possible sometimes that s nice and tcg games that are designed around multiplayer pvp are in my experience usually pretty terrible to play when no one else is around failure is guaranteed but its fun the game encourages you to find combos and break the game and punishes you for not being flexible enough to adapt when you bank on getting a certain build it s more about seeing how far you can get with what you have than actually succeeding most of the time though a successful spire slaying is always awesome the strategy can get really deep and that s cool in my book different classes to play and they all feel very different it s fun to experiment and try them all despite the rng never feels truly unfair somehow i m not smart enough or good enough at math to explain it maybe it is actually unfair sometimes tldr if you like tcg but don t have friends don t like playing against other people online this could be your new jam
