2020 i usually never write reviews but if i can get even one person to play through this game to the true ending ending e this will have been worth it before i begin let me say that while the pc version of nier automata has quite a number of flaws almost all of them can be fixed with the far mod by kaldaien it s very easy to install so i do not really see this as that much of an inconvenience you should really get this mod before you play this game far mod game made me realize what potential video games have as a medium story nier automata will have you constantly thinking and connecting the dots in your head to get the full story from the information they give you in addition to that you will have to play through this game multiple times to get to the true ending all playthroughs play out differently and add new perspectives of each of the amazing characters in this game aside from this it tackles many different philosophies in ways that i believe would make an actual philosopher proud topics like existentialism nihilism or finding the meaning of life are only some of the themes this game explores nier automata left me questioning the way i approach life as a whole and no other game has ever accomplished this before combat easy to get into but surprisingly deep and complex since it takes a long time to master all the moves you can pull of with different weapon combinations over the 46 hours i have by the time i m writing this i have never found myself getting bored from rushing into the next enemy and smashing them to pieces with the cinematic fighting moves this game lets you pull off very fun and engaging while also being quite beginner friendly gameplay also something unique about nier automata is the constant changing of genres while most of the game is a 3d open world environment many different sections of the map and story missions will transition into a 2d sidescroller experience a top down bullethell experience or more some might see this as annoying but the seamless transitions and the fact that your moveset and controls stay exactly the same makes this a very smooth experience and i found myself constantly curious of what awaits me around the next corner soundtrack absolute masterpiece and easily the best soundtrack of any game i have ever played not only are the individual soundtracks astonishingly beautiful but also the way they are used is truly innovative each soundtrack has 7 different versions there is quiet medium and dynamic with vocals as well as quiet medium and dynamic without vocals and also an 8 bit version the music is constantly changing through the different versions of the song to fit the atmoshpere of the environment and what is currently happening making you feel very immersed at all times on top of that each of the combat tracks could easily be the soundtrack of a final boss fight it is simply a true work of art all in all i see this game as a masterpiece and milestone in video game history jim sterling wrote in his review that if history forgets this game then f ck history and i could not agree more it made me realize what video games are capable of because it really made me feel something it sparked emotions withing me that no other game has ever achieved if you are still reading this review i would like to thank you for taking your time and tell you that if you appreciate video games i can wholeheartedly recommend you nier automata lastly thank you yoko taro for making this game and giving me an experience i will never forget
