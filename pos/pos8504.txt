2017 this is my first review of a game but i though this game deserved a review as it s been getting a lot of negative reviews that are unwarranted in my opinion i live in south africa and have been hunting a couple of times before and it s something i enjoy what i enjoy about hunting is that you go out into wide open spaces of beautiful nature you have to patiently stalk your prey following spoor tracks looking at their dung checking that you re not upwind it s not easy and some days you can go the whole day without even getting close to having a shot at your prey so in context of this game i never thought i d ever find or enjoy any hunting game that gives me the same thrill as i get in real life but i was wrong this game does really well in making you feel like you re in this beautiful nature reserve with some of the best graphics and sound design i ve seen in a game it really is stunning i often just stare at a beautiful sunrise or a strong gust of wind blowing leaves off the trees around me the beautiful world you get to play in alone is worth the asking price for this game the actual hunting part has been done extremely well in this game i ve felt like it really is quite close to hunting in real life patience is key checking wind direction following tracks listening for your prey s sounds looking at your prey s dung etc has been really well thought out and implemented it can take hours to find and hunt the prey you re looking for but it feels worth it i ve seen a lot of people complain about bugs in their reviews and i have seen a couple but none of them were game breaking in my opinion if that is what is holding you back from buying this game then let me assure you it s not that bad the bugs aren t that major and i have to say that it runs extremely well on my machine my settings are all cranked up and i m running a geforce 970 8gb ram intel i5 2500k processor and have experienced no lag or crashes if you want a game to get lost in that takes time and patience that is beautiful and realistic then give this a go i hope they bring out an african map in a future dlc
