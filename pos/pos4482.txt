2015 mount and blade warbanda reviewmount and blade warband is actually the second game in the series with mount and blade without the prefix having the honor of being the first one originally developed by 2 people it is now a full fledge game developement studio essentially mount and blade warband is a 3rd 1st person rpg scalable infantry squad empire management game that allows you to largely play as whatever you want to be which if i want to give an example includes things like burning down many villages as a brigand becoming a mercenary for hire becoming a trader or even start your own kingdom to compete with the big fishes in the pond alright onto the review i suppose optimization controlscontrols are excellent and everything can be remapped according to your wishes and whims well almost everything since the map controls are locked don t even try to play it with a controller it has way too much buttons for the poor thing and i would laugh at you if you even try this is an ancient game and it was released back in 2010 so it might surprise you to hear that it has an extensive option menu that is too numerous for me to list down but rest assure that even the weakest of ultrabook could reliably run this game at 60 fps graphicsis i m sorry but there is no other way to say this other than the fact that the graphic is completely fully a pile of terrible muddy and stiff textured with animations having few variations and npc lacking any either with lords and villagers rotating to see you if you engage them in conversation the overworld map lacks detail and well lets just say that graphics is not something this game has but the weapons are oh so very shiny and reflective if you turn it all the way up woo also it does not matter much for this game since the core gameplay is what carries it forward musicambient musics is just there to fill the void of silence rather than to enhance the mood with no form of dynamic music system in place at all but the battle music sometimes fit and sometimes doesn t meanwhile sound effects sounds like someone took a duffel bag and swing it repeatedly in front of the mic with no metallic noises at all except when steel clashes against shields hardly any variation when people are screaming bloody murder shuffling up towards you trying to cut you up with the results being 20 people all yelling the same noises over and over again like wheaaaaaaaaaaa it s funny gameplaylets start from the botton you have your player character a bunch of stats that you determined by choosing the option at start which you can add on when you level up your mount your blade and weapon and an overworld map to explore in the overworld map you can move around and find warband of lords and bandits moving around and affecting the world without your help in this mode you can just go around and find a city or town or engage a warband i don t know just approach something to do anything you can also access inventory party journal and etc etc in this mode in town villages and castle you can choose to go into 3rd person mode and explore although there s nothing really to find except the guild master who is not marked in the menu and is essential for your later career so go at least once to find him he s in every town or just browse for stuff to do using the option menu buy sell trade enter tournament go to see the annoying lords up to you really now for the fun part when you first enter a battle you will probably consist of less than 10 20 people and you will most likely die attacking blocking in the thick of it with sieges carrying a wonderful 90 mortality rate awful ladder but later on you can command hundreds of men doing sieges and assaulting other lords and that is the gist of warband you start from the lowliest of scrubs and work your way up the ladder recruiting companions training troops and starting your own kingdom or become a vassal to an existing one or play whatever way you want i don t care all in all incredibly in depth and you should probably give it a try at least once conclusion and mods i made a mod list which you can view which greatly enhances the base game with many stuff to do and improvement at the very least use the first mod because it changes the battle size amount in conclusion warband is an extremely fun to play with infantry and empire sim but only if it clicks with you it did for me and while it might sound bias i m going to go ahead and give it an excellent rating simply because i haven t seen another game like it is it worth your money yes it probably is mod list methology s rank excellent a rank very good b rank solid c rank satisfactory d rank inferiorverdict s rank wait no it is slightly buggy and the dialogues are terrible so b rankcredit thanks to meatking and smmoke for your help no drama just reviews
