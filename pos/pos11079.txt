2023 im not quite shure what to write on this one so ill just write one from my heart i didnt think id like it as much as i do its abit on the simpler side game but thats good you dont have to use a gazzilion hours to play it and have to sit down and educate yourself to set up a park its basicly just plug and play jurassic parkwith excelent wiews perspectives in there you can see your park from every angle and quite an impressive attention to details great animations great dinosaur details information lots of stats for you number nerds many more things i could add they even got some nice music in there also but in general overall its an good nice chill cozy fun experience and i like it and i would reccomend it if you like jurassic park dinosaurs ark survival evolved for example plain n simpleits a hit no doubt about it only minus i can think about right now is like some minor bugs some music is the same everytime id like some more rotation to the music so its not the same all the timebut i cant really complain about it either cuz they have done a great job with the music also overall it kinda takes you back to jurassic park nostalgia personally id give it 8 8 10 as of now i thinkits almost perfect tbhhope my review can help you make your choice welcome to jurassic parkcan you keep the dinosaurs enclosed
