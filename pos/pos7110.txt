2020 i submitted this game as the labor of love i feel like every state gets a lot of love from these developers and they even go back and update tweak older stuff too original review follows if you were to buy euro truck simulator 2 ets2 from here on you d have quite a lot of ground to cover and being a variety of countries it s also a variety of signs scenery and experiences american truck simulator ats from here on is still growing so until you buy the extra dlc you re limited to just a few states and since it s just one country all the signs are pretty much the same however the scenery varies just as much if not more due to the wide variety in the states themselves so it won t get boring just like ets2 you start out with no truck and you have to buy a truck and start making the real money alternately you can opt to just do nothing but open jobs where you basically use their equipment and you don t have to worry about anything but driving from point a to point b in fact it might be wise to do this anyway for a while until you ve got some money saved up for that truck but you can always take out a loan and buy one as soon as possible just like with ets2 you have to earn levels to be able to purchase everything and you have to have the proper licenses before you can deliver certain cargo you re awarded experience based on the distance traveled and the difficulty of the delivery so sometimes it might be worth it to do that difficult run i personally enjoy just cruising around and not worrying too much about difficulty but everyone plays these games for a different reason you get paid you pick a new job and if you re using your own rig you have to drive there otherwise the game transports you to the next location automatically keep it up and you can buy more trucks hire more drivers and start building a trucking empire or if that s not your style stay small keep to yourself and have fun the game doesn t really force you to do anything you don t want to do there s a ton of options for driving as well if you ve got your own wheel and pedals you can use that custom gearbox for that realistic 18 wheeler shifting use that or you can opt for a controller or mouse and keyboard or keyboard only if none of those options are realistic enough for you you can try it in vr as well though i think it s still experimental and they haven t really made it work well enough that i can recommend it to everyone my only real complaint here is that it defaults to keyboard and even when you tell it you have a controller it doesn t seem to set it up properly so you have to spend a few minutes making sure everything works as intended the steam controller i have works fine but even with their default bindings i still had to tell the game which was for steering and gas and brake the only thing the defaults covered were stuff like wipers cruise control etc while you re driving you can enjoy your favorite music or stream from your favorite internet radio station for a more authentic experience i feel like this was better on the ets2 side of things because a lot of the internet radio you pick up from the start is foreign and unless you re really into german technopop or whatever it s gonna seem a bit unrealistic but you don t have to drive in silence the game isn t 100 real time because who here has 10 hours to dedicate to an actual long haul it s long enough that a long trip will still feel long but you ll pass an entire day in just a couple of hours real time the graphics are great and with hdr the sunsets are actually impressive it ll probably run on a toaster but still scales up nicely for decent visuals the ai drivers on the road still act like robots and not actual drivers and when they do act like actual drivers it s because they re being just as annoying as real drivers are passing you on the left moving into your lane and then immediately slowing down for example i witnessed a car ram into the back of a semi so hard that the back wheels came off the ground and the reason for it was because the semi had to change lanes because of an obstacle which it waited till the last possible second to do and then did it quickly without much warning that s pretty much how all the ai works in this game do they need to turn left wait till the last possible second change lanes quickly and then turn quickly the only good thing about the ai is that if you signal to change lanes they ll actually wait for you to change lanes before trying to drive right up your ass at 80mph on the subject of driving obstacles there s a lot of them and they re way weirder than anything i ve seen in ets2 i saw one where it seemed like the cops had the road i needed to take blocked off for some reason but there was no penalty to me for going around the road block i saw another where two cops had a sports car pinned on the side of the road with their lights on but the back ends of the cop cars were still in the middle of the road this was the obstacle that caused the ai accident another was a car flipped over with a helicopter in the road doing a medivac these obstacles were neat and all but it seemed to me like they were too frequent to be realistic though for all i know a real trucker may see a major road blocking obstacle every hour as well i d prefer if it was scaled back a bit it s neat to see but after you see one or two then it s like ugh again usually because it s in your way to a delivery and it may mean you have to go to another exit and re route in real life another exit is just a mile or two down the road and you can just exit go under the overpass and turn around in this game missing your exit may mean adding 2 hours to your drive time unless you can just turn the whole thing around anyway this review is already too long so the final verdict would be if you liked ets2 you ll like ats if you haven t tried either you might want to get ets2 first and see how you like that it s fun and ets2 goes on sale for cheap so it won t be as bad if it turns out to bore you but if you like the thought of traveling and seeing your truck and driver level up then this will be worth it
