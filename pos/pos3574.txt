2016 i know what you re thinking is undertale really that good should i actually get this game so this is what all those people on tumblr won t shut up about well let me answer those questions with another question do you wanna have a good time because if you press that add to cart button you really are gonna like what happens next pi can t say much about the story or gameplay here sorry p if you ve somehow managed not to get this game spoiled for you at this point i consider you very lucky this game is all about subverting expectations so the less you know about the game going in the better what i can say is this game while the graphical style may be lackluster it more than makes up for it with its humor and characters if you re on the fence about getting it i would say at least try it out undertale has an interesting take on the rpg genre not just from a story standpoint but twists its core fundamental structure into something fun and in some ways even thought provoking now this is very important no matter what anyone says or what even the game may try to tell you play the game the way you want to during your first run and use your name for the character don t look up a guide or walkthrough anything kill the monsters you want to kill and if you don t want to kill a monster then don t after your first playthrough then you can do whatever type of run you wish barring you don t spoil the game for yourself also i recommend you do the quote on quote good ending before the bad ending as you will get a more emotional impact from the experience that and the bad ending is also ridiculously harder to achieve compared to the others all in all undertale is a great game and a great experience and definitely my indie game of 2015
