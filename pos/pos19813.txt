2023 just to get this out of the way i m only a casual player of this game as of this review i ve never tried playing online as i already know i ll get destroyed you have to play rts a certain way online and i know that i don t play it the right way if you are into the competitive scene for this game i can t really help you as i don t know how that is but single player is a nice experience and one i will continue to enjoy for many years that being said i do have fun with this one when playing against the computer though i should say the single player campaign is a bit tough as of this point i haven t managed to get past saladin s second mission i don t remember it being that tough in other versions and i m only playing on moderate difficulty some of the campaigns are harder than others though i am at least glad to see that they increased the population limit for the old age of kings campaigns that s the kind of improvement i like to see in a remake and there are more that help make this an amazing game for the most part this is a solid remake the improved graphics visuals and shortcuts help really make this the definitive version of aoe the civs have received some balance updates that i feel makes them fair though their are some i enjoy playing as more than others another great feature is that now farms can be set to replant automatically as long as you have enough wood making resource management a ton easier there s also a little update screen in the top left corner that will show you the progress of technologies you are currently researching so you have an idea of how long until they are finished all of these are great improvements to an overall great game it s helped further by workshop support allowing you and others to make custom maps and campaigns limited only by your imagination even if all you want is the single player i d still say this game is worth your time
