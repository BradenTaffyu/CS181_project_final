this game is so fun but extreamly hard its so cool its easily my favorite game i like how you have actual choices that change the game play which can make it harder more fun or easier i am curently doing the true pacifist route and i am currently at metteton x but if you do the genoside route he turns into metteton neo the song is so good my favorite boss has gotta be muffet her boss fight is pretty fun and plays my favorite song spider dance i am also exited for the algamates in the true lab id rate this an 11 10 i would recomend this to everyone i hope when someone first joins they are really excited and happy i hope i can beat undertale if you beat it loved it which i hope you did then you can play deltarune chapter 1 and chapter 2
