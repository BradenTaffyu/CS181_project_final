2023 i only briefly played this game when it originally launched i remember not being hooked like i had been with oblivion and their earlier games with the launch of starfield however i wanted to check it out again under the halo of that game playing both back to back i was struck by how many things they brought over from this game the common analogy people are using about starfield being fallout 4 in space was incredibly evident in the factions settlement base building companions etc etc i will say i enjoyed fallout 4 it is still rough around the edges and several times the game crashed on my high end rig it did make me see how far bethesda has come since they made fallout 4 and hopeful that with time they will make it even more polished i think fallout is definitely worth playing in 2023 particularly if you just discovered bethesda and want a game with many of the similar qualities of starfield but a very different plot etc
