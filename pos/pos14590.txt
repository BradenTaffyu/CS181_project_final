2019 what can i say i don t write reviews often but i think the negativity towards civ vi is entirely out of proportion civilization vi is definitely a worthy sequel it took some getting used to coming from civilization v and initially i was afraid i might not be able to go back once i did the truth is that i don t even want to go back now civilization vi isn t perfect but it improves many flaws from the previous games there s also lots of new quite interesting game mechanics that all give the game more depth and make it more interesting if you re like me and like enjoy diplomacy you ll love this game especially with the dlc the ai is incredibly reasonable and doesn t suddenly backstab unless there s a proper reason for it unlike civ v from my experience gameplay in general is very satisfying especially with a few mods here and there all the major civs in the game are interesting well balanced and quite fun to play my only real point of criticism would probably be the soundtrack this time around music consists of your civilization s national anthem along with certain melodies like in the ancient era i do not like this one bit while yes e g hearing the kalinka play and change style while playing as russia really sets the mood it also gets really old after so many eras and so do the occasional tribal drum lines i much prefer a random selection of classical music in various styles based on your civilization s nationality like in civilization v because the current system is hit and miss with it being more miss than hit aside from that if you re a fan of civilization and its diplomacy definitely give this one a try all those negative reviews are undeserved it s a far better game than some people make it out to be especially after all these year since release
