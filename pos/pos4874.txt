2015 this review is outdated i may be a new fallout fan but i m not a blind one this game has everything i need from a rpg game err let s say most of them i ll directly compare good neutral and bad things good character appearance if you played another bethesda game you know what i mean graphics better than i expected rpg elements like other fallout games this game is not all pewpew voice acting i don t know why but everytime i hear my character s voice i get excited better hud smooth simple enough animations i didn t see any moonwalking people story positive a new emotional main story and multiple endings immersive it is not your character it is you crafting fully customizable weapons armors and stuff building settlements positive you can build a settlement then you can govern it combat combat is really fun that s why every npc hates me sprinting positive a very useful addon neutral minor bugs stuck in a tree or in a rock building settlements neutral very enjoyable at first then annoying as hell critical strikes they are not random anymore i personally don t use v a t s so it is kinda useless for me bad slow rendering this happened me and some of my friends graphics don t load fast enough sometimes i only see plain untextured objects minor optimization problems random fps drops this happens rarely but can be annoying very few weapon armor models i kinda annoyed by the number of weapon armor models they are all customizable but you cannot change some parts dialogue you will have 4 choices in every dialogue that limits the rpg immersion unlike the old fallouts games story negative the main story seems rushed a bit and it has the worst prologue in the fallout series sprinting negative uses ap i cannot use v a t s because of that conclusion do not be scared by the bugs bad reviews and cons game is incredibly beautiful and fun to play if you are a fallout fan you already have this game or you are collecting money for it if you are not just talk with your friends who has this game or read some reviews beware of the spoilers oh and i would give 90 100 i will update this review whenever i find something to add
