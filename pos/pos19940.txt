2017 an immersive post apocalyptic neo western better than fallout 3 or 4 i should begin by saying that this is my favorite game of all time however i can t deny that there are several game breaking issues glitches that might ruin your experience the following isn t exactly a point in the game s favor but if you buy this game familiarize yourself with nexus mods and download the following mods new vegas anti crash nvac new vegas script extender nvse the 4gb memory extension and the yukichigai unofficial patch yup in order to ensure you don t get regular crashes or game breaking bugs having said that this is the most immersive and engaging game experience since mass effect 2 the entire game is building up to a final battle and your choices throughout the game effect the outcome of the battle in ways you won t forsee the side characters are some of the most compelling of any game especially the companion characters whose trust can be won or lost through actions you make throughout the game the story is extremely dark and atmospheric forcing you into uncomfortable moral dilemmas and making choices with hard hitting consequences the game maintains a dark gritty neo western tone that lends itself well to the post apocalyptic diesel punk of the fallout franchise the dlcs are the best of any game with a foray into four different subgenres each satisfying and unique in it s story tone and gameplay finally the modding community around this game is possibly the most prolific and has produced some stunning content much of which was implemented into fallout 4 by bethesda as regular game mechanics there is no reason to not buy this game and sink less than 100 hours into it but keep in mind it s diamond in the rough status
