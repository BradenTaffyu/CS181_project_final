2020 few thoughts about fallout 76 is it amazing aaa game i don t think so is it great game in fallout franchise surely not should you buy it for price of 40 hell no then why is this review positive because in my opinion fallout 76 is one of the greatest game to play with friends for the sale price which for me was around 10 it has already been good deal before this whole wastelander dlc and steam release i have never regretted buying it for that price further more i can easily say that there aren t many mmo multiplayer games which offer more content than fallout 76 for that price even on sales so do i recommend to buy it after all yes if the price is currently not higher than 15 usd and you have someone to play with
