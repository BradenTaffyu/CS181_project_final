i love owlcat games so i knew i would be playing rogue trader when it came out even though i know nothing about 40k as expected i enjoyed the game it has all the things i love about owlcat games coupled with the incredibly dense lore of the 40k universe at first it was a lot to learn but i really got into it and am now looking forward to the 40k movie cavill is reportedly working on pros really interesting companions representing diverse factions and interests whose endings you help shape complex battles with varied and interesting enemies with new mechanics and difficulties to keep you on your toes space ship battles are actually quite fun and i usually hate that sort of thing compared with the side puzzle content in km and wotr this is my favorite i looked forward to these battles romance stories have the drama level i love from owlcat every owlcat game brings some complexity to the characters that makes the romance have some hiccups and i really enjoy that layer of storytelling to add to the character arcs there are a lot of cool abilities weapons and effects for the various classes and builds the character barks are fun i always laugh when abalard gets a bullet to the head and says my ears are ringing there are 3 alignments in the game so you can play your rt with a few different personalities each offering diverse responses in most conversations that don t always but sometimes lead to the same outcome warp effects were cool and the risk of deamons showing up was a fun feature that made me have to temper my psykers some really interesting acts after act 1 i really enjoyed act 3 the most cons there may actually be too many choices when leveling up characters it s so much to keep track of and some are very hard to see the results at play making it more difficult due to the fact that some are known to be buggy i wanted so bad for the astartes character to be better but his limitations were too big to bring him along literally he s just too big and he has to be left near the entrance in so many places a lot of the scenery especially in cities looks too enclosed and as if everything is built in layers and i m just visiting the top layer it gives the impression i m always inside even when i m outside i didn t enjoy the buy sell mechanic that uses reputation there is only so much to sell and i couldn t achieve very high reputation with anyone but one merchant as a result there are a lot of repeats in classes so you end up with two people each who can do the same things that s great for some classes but redundant for others i had my favorite characters but should ve built their classes to be more complimentary
