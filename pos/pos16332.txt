2017 early access review to begin i ve never been much of a car nut i was happy enough to leave my car s needs to a trusted mechanic and while i still gawk and hoot at sweet wheels on the street i ve never felt the itch to really open up a car and feel around in its guts little did i know that a looking game stinking of sweat and engine oil would make me fall in love with the painstakingly maddening process of putting together a deathtrap in my garage listening to finnish rock and polishing off a twenty four pack of pisswater at first glance msc is a joke a playful jab at rural finnish life and the dangers of driving a bucket of rusty bolts on uneven country roads seven beers deep if you stoop down and look at the undercarriage though you ll find that not only is it the best finland simulator of all time it s also one of the most in depth car building games the industry has ever seen from the moment you walk into the garage and start plugging pistons into the engine block to when you re bolting your aftermarket muffler back on for the sixty seventh time you come away knowing a little more about what all of those bits and pieces under the hood do and why that whining sound is such a bad omen you ll learn what to do when you hear popping noises when to fill your radiator with piss and why it s a bad idea to race that techno blasting bastard in the green car my summer car is charming as it is intricate and the developer is constantly adding new things into the mix ranging from useful to downright absurd don t leave that sauna running for too long does it get annoying having to start from scratch when you die in a flaming wreck caused by a drunk driver absolutely is the rally insane even with all aftermarket parts you bet is there any game that captures the warmth and comfort of rolling into the shop tavern parking lot and enjoying a beer and sausage with the other drunks no way jose keep an eye on this one because there s much more coming this isn t your average early access game folks this one has heart get it now
