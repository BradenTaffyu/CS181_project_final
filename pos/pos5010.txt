2022 i mean what the heck the categories shown on steam are completely misleading let me rephrase that a main tag for this game should be simulation it completely snatched me away for a couple of months on end i would be unable to sleep thinking about the fact that i angered piper while doing that particular sidequest get out of bed at 3 00 a m to try to fix my relationship with a virtual character go me alright on to the review i ll start by the thing i found most appealing about the game the concept you play as a guy lady who start off by getting invited to a vault as a nuclear endtimes approaches the ground starts shaking beneath you and you find yourself packing your essentials and leaving for the vault with your wife husband and your child few things transpire and you are put into cryogenic sleep you re awoken after a few dozens of years by a mercenary who s come to claim your child for reasons i will not spoil your husband wife doesn t let go of the child and they re shot right in the head you watch it happen then are put back into cryogenic sleep finally radroaches accidentally switch off power for the vault and you find yourself awakening after 200 years has passed with only one vivid thought in mind find your missing son avenge your spouse you get out of the vault and are introduced directly into a huge wasteland with few survivors here and there they call themselves the commonwealth why did i say it was a simulation because you basically get lost in the commonwealth forgetting somewhat that you ve got a mission to accomplish you can travel as a raider and raid villages who d offer you protection money you can be a good honest citizen and travel the wastelands helping settlers you can become a cannibal and settle underground where nobody can know of your terrible deeds against humanity you can become a mindless ghoul out for human flesh or you can become a doctor that d advance nuclear weapons in the institute the options here are basically endless the other side of this simulation is that you get to build up castles fortresses raider underground fight clubs while still maintaining an rpg side to all of it not to mention that you can travel this barren world with different very inidividual companions and the cutest freaking doggo you ll ever have in a videogame you ll get so immersed in this universe that you d like me want more than it offers you and let me tell you the modding scene is huge i m running a dozen mods myself that make the game more like your life inside a video game in an apocalyptic setting than an actual videogame be ready to cut your real life family time short to be able to play fetch with your fallout 4 dog as this game will have your couch potato ass entangled in romances worthy of fantastic novels interactions that will leave a lasting impression on you and people that follow you satisfy your romantic partner as you build both of you a castle to call home while fending off raiders that keep wanting your food and supplies or heck take your romantic lover and be the raiders oh and did i mention that these voice actors must ve cost a fortune literally everything is perfect in this game even when you go pee in a toilet with let me piss mods you feel like you ve emptied your bladder in real life i mean what the hell bethesda s really actively trying to put our social lives in cryogenic sleep but hey we love it we live for it and once i finish every radiant quest every dlc every side quest every minuteman call every bring me radx task i ll still be wanting more of this it s a 10 10 game that should not go on sale but does anyway that s how hardworking bethesda is be warned though that when you start this game and fully immerse yourself and meet all these fantastic fictional individuals it will be quite hard going back to your hypocrite friends after war never changes also if you touch my preston i amma go into v a t s you ve been warned
