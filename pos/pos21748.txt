2020 yes indeed dark souls 3 is a game where you will soon learn you aren t as strong as that big scary creature over there but you can sure kick its ass if you try hard enough for those who have played and enjoyed any previous games within the souls franchise except for dark souls 3 i can easily recommend this game and you ll know exactly what you re in for for those who haven t played any souls games before well let us begin shall we not for the faint of heart because you will die a lot just get back up and try again you will even die when you do things correctly because dark souls don t give a f ck your veins and brain will be filled with adrenaline and dopamine upon a successful boss kill after dying as many times as you have you ll get invaded a form of pvp within dark souls and rekt accordingly increasing your urge to win next time or exact revenge by invading someone yourself you ll die some more but you ll learn new concepts and mechanics along the way ensuring you kick that much more ass the next time around on a more serious note ds3 offers gorgeous visuals a much more balanced pvp system than the previous two souls games very difficult enemy and boss encounters a some what complex fill in the blanks lore story telling which is fairly compelling under the surface9 10 i simply love all the souls games and would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a difficult rpg to play
