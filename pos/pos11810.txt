2017 early access review i haven t been very far past the first boss and have played 8 hours i suck as a gamer i know but for me to not get frustrated or upset it s probably because i feel myself getting better and there is geniune progress you can make with each and every playthrough even if you only have 20 minutes 10 10 would have my body descecrated again
