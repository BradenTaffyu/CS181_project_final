2020 product received for free early access review edit this was a while ago still recommend it but it s gotten pretty stagnant and you can definitely get more out of kovaak s which imo is its main competitor ultimately though they re comparable and though aimlab has a lot less tasks i end up using it more simply because of its faster startup time fantastic for flick training the ai training which adapts to weaknesses brings it above other solutions like kovaak s i feel as if i have dramatically improved the variety of shots i am able to take since having started the lack of customizability may put off some but in my opinion this isn t an issue for any of the flick based tasks tracking tasks leave a bit to be desired however and for this i feel it is best used in conjunction with other software nevertheless i find it s a great product with active and responsive devs it brings to the table qualities i haven t found in any other program and i would highly recommend it
