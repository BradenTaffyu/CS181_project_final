2021 early access review of course i am a chinese but why i use english to write this comment because i want to let more people to recognize the quality and the amazing thought of this game the dyson sphere idea was brought to us during the 1960s and this five person developing team somehow managed to transfer this deep scifi idea into a universe building game which is full of design as well as optimization drawbacks as the moment but the point is that the idea is fresh and the construction line is thorough according to my view although the local language is not available for a large quantity of players at the moment i am pretty sure that it will do better we already have excellent building games such as the factorio and satisfactory which also uses the idea of expanding our civilization in other planets but where is the end of the game this game has an ultimate goal which is not only finishes the research but also builds your own dyson sphere model everyone can be a designer and imaginable person to create yourself a dyson sphere at the moment this game is not included in the nvidia geforce experience or other graphic card adjusting platform so you can t adjust the game to fit your pc this game has not been optimized well so it really puts a large amount of burden on your graphic cards so do please prepare well for heat radiation and fan noise the whole game requires 80 100 hours to accomplish the goal and maybe even more when you are in your first saving just like me in a word this game is awesome and it will be better when it is fully developed wishing you a piece of unforgettable experience updated version in 25th nov 2021 the new content is below 2021 11 25 with the update process of the game there are a few new highlights which we should mention first the battle system is now building and will be released in q3 of 2022 then the building mode and the blueprint is much closer to our life and thought third your robot is able to be customized now looking forward to experience the battle system when it is out updated version in 15th oct 2022 the new content is below 2022 10 15 due to many reasons the battle system won t be online until 2023 but the best thing from my point of view is that the recipe for almost product in this game doesn t change through these updates unlike satisfactory which production lines have to be changed every time when a new update well if it still can be called as an update drops to the public and i have to say minor improvements such as delivery system between the player and the building system is just awesome and because of which the productivity of the robot can be maximized let s hope and wait for the battle system and i will update it when more news are released to the public thank you for reading
