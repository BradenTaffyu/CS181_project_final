2019 i recommend but just barely it s a fun game relatively bug free smooth and casual and that is it s big problem casual barely any challenge easy to make enough money and not to fail they should have at least made an option to choose difficulty so it s a casual game for those who like to design and chill much like cities skyline still got me hooked for a good amount of time
