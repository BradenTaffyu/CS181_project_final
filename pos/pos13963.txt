2020 my colonists are starving because my plants aren t growing because my greenhouse is getting too hot because my cooling system isn t running because i m running low on power because my oil power plant isn t running because i don t have enough oil because my oil well isn t running because it doesn t have enough water because the water pump is submerged in hot steam instead of water because i m not cooling the steam fast enough because my cooling system isn t running because my aquatuners are overheating because they aren t made out of steel because i cannot make steel because making it heats up my colony too much which would be fine if my cooling system was operational
