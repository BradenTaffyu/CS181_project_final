tldr i had this in my wishlist forever finally bought it and glad i did it is a repetitive game one you are supposed to just get better and better at the more you play if you re into that then you ll like it there is also randomness to it so in one game you might feel nearly invincible and another you just want to die if you re into that then you ll like it finally if you manage to make it to hard mode you ll get owned and owned and owned if you like to overcome that sort of thing then you ll like it expect to play this game a lot if you want to concur it
