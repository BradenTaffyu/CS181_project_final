early access review ark ascended is really nice but unfortunately unless you got a top computer the game will be either unplayable or look so bad that it won t even be enjoyable to play so there s a lot of money involved but if money isn t your concern then ark is definitely worth it i just wish that the game s optimisation improves over time
