2020 i love this game let me explain why this is a game where after some hours in you get lost in it s world you do all the quests explore all the hideouts vaults or whatever and it s rewarding af you find cool new stuff everywhere that you can improve with a huge amount of parts by crafting you found an new awsome legendary sword let s add fire to it and these things will show and change your appearance you find all these figures and magazines that not only are collectibles like in many other games but also give you permanent buffs this makes it so rewarding to explore every corner in this game also there is no level cap so you can get all the perks you want sure it will take forever to skill all the 275 perks but this still gives you a lot of freedom the storys are more hidden than for example in witcher 3 if you explored in wither you found more people talking to you telling you real storys and giving you exciting quests here you will have a huge amount of hideouts whith holotapes and storys hidden in the terminals the overall story isn t the best but this game has some of the best loot driven gameplay of any rpg i played you will need some time to fall in love with it i needed some hours to realy get into it but ever since i dig it all in all i would give this game 9 10 ps i know that all this creation club stuff made the rating drop and it indeed was a crappy move by bethesda but for me the game still is awsome as i never realy mod my games
