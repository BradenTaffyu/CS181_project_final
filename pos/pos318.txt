2019 truly impressed that a solo developer was able to create such an amazing game the style of the game brings back memories of when i was younger playing harvest moon 64 the modders for the game are impressive as well allowing us players to try out all sorts of new stuff added to the game anything from cosmetic changes that completely change the art of the game to quality of life stuff that helps automate some of the tedious things i must praise the casual pace of the game and cozy village life setting setting it apart from other action packed and fast reaction type games that i have sdv lets me relax peacefully without worrying too much about the challenges life throws at us while also drawing me in enough to want to keep playing just one more in game day over and over i also love that concernedape continues to update and add new things to the game making each new play through feel refreshing and enjoyable
