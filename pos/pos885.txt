2016 since many reviews from others have already mentioned quite a lot about the awesome gameplay i figured maybe i will have a slightly different focus in mine npcs in the game are kind to say sorry and thanks all the time unless you give them what they hate of coz the developer of the game is kind to address problems from players personally even the community is so kind to engage in pay it forward for those who can t offer to buy the game and to me such lovely positive energy itself is already priceless 10 10
