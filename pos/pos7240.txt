2018 american truck simulator is one of the best driving simulations out there if you like eurotruck simulator 2 then your sure to like it s american twin this installation does have a couple shortcomings such as the limited options as far as available trucks or currently explorable map that being said what it does have carries an amazing level of detail and quality unmatched by anyone other than scs and their dedication to realism as a resident of new mexico after seeing the new mexico dlc and touring the map i have to say it is the most detailed scaled map of the us ever created after driving around my home town in game i was completely blown away by the scense that i was actually there also in the landmarks i was able to find a church i lived by a s a kid and was completely blown away at the level of detail scs must actually have a team that goes everywhere they are mapping to photograph and get the atmosphere of the area i give it a 10 10 after viewing my hometown on the in game map
