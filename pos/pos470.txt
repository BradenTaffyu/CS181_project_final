2018 initially i really didn t care about this game when it came out i picked it up on the small hype it had around it when it first released and dipped my toes to see how the water felt i was dissapointed and could nt be bothered to stay for long and left the game sitting in my library for a long time much latter down the line they release a multiplayer update and this is where my opinion of the game changed it was my girlfriend who urged me to play with her and i decided that i should gave the game a second shot and i m glad i did my initial problems with the game was how slow the gameplay was i get the concept and what the idea is behind it but man playing alone in stardew vs playing with someone else just feels so much more lively we were putting together our farm rather efficently joining events in town putting together the community center and mining away for those rarer resources it was all very fun challenging and almost addictive honestly we would lose hours just doing what would normally be mundane tasks but had fun doing it i found that my hooking niche was collecting items for the museum i always get a little excited when it looks like i found a new artifact stardew valley is it s own entity in a tried genre of games i ve found new respect for this game and its genre and can now say i understand why people love these types of games so much though for me it did take multiplayer to really bring me in good game would strongly recommend with friends
