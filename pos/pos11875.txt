2022 this game somehow has randomly generated worlds but some how still feel like a hand crafted experience everytime its rewarding despite lossing everything every time you die and its difficult but never feels unfair its such a perfect metroidvania and is a love letter to the genre and with its constant stream of updates ive never been bored with dead cells
