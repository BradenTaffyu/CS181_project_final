2023 this is basically a 3d version of aoe2 with some small tweaks and changes i definitely prefer aoe2 over this because they seem to have a heavy focus on multiplayer with this game and all the other content gets kind of left behind a bit not meaning that it s bad just quite lacking in terms of updates and amount of content it gets i didn t like this game when i started but it s a great game and the longer i played the more i started enjoying it the devs also keep releasing updates events and all that good stuff on a regular basis so this is totally worth the money because you ll get a lot of hours of gameplay out of it especially if you re a multiplayer type of person
