2021 the hunter call of the wild is a really entertaining game that s recently given me nape of the neck hair raising spine tingling shivers plus adrenaline fuelled moments but it s not an action packed roller coaster ride of shooting like many of the fps games we play there s twelve reserves to explore hunt that should keep you entertained for a long time the base game includes two reserves hirshfelden hunting reserve layton lakes both massive reserves plus you can buy ten add on reserves separately if you ve only have the base game the 2019 bundle includes 2 extra reserves vurhonga savanna medved taiga which is the one i purchased bout four years ago the 2021 bundle includes 4 of the other 9 reserves that are not included in the base game both those bundles also include weapon packs other essential hunting equipment such as hides animal callers scents etc some community members give the game a thumbs down because of the dlc content much like many other aaa games released since the financial crisis of 2008 complain that the game is just a cash cow releasing extra content that should have been included in the original release i strongly disagree each one of the reserve dlc s are basically large add on s with lots of missions hunting experiences and in my opinion are well worth the money you pay for them they basically cost the equivalent of a few starbucks coffee s unless you live in new york where they charge even more you can buy the complete pack for less than 80 and much cheaper when on sale which is the going rate for most decent aaa games in 2021 when i played this game a few years ago i didn t bother to read any guides or watch any videos it took me over 45 hours of game play just to reach level 8 a friend who purchased the game in the recent 2021 summer sale watched some videos by a you tuber called jaxybeard these videos gave lots of useful advice for newbies to the game i watched some of those videos then created a new character following his advice enabled me to reach the same level as my previous character that took over 45 hours to reach in only eight hours so my advice is to watch some of jaxybeards beginner videos on you tube before you even start the game see links at the end of this review also check out some of the excellent guides that are accessible from the games steam library page before you even boot up the game there s a lot of walking involved as well as driving your trusty atv not included in the base game and often creeping or going prone to get the best shots because the noise you make can scare away your prey going prone creates the least noise and also gives you more cover to remain invisible you ll probably start off getting bronze or silver kills slowly work up to gold diamond if you check out jaxybeards hunter s tool kit he s added a map on the last page of the kit that labels a section of lake in the leyton lakes reserve as diamond alley may need updating you can find his tool kit here docs google com it has a page for 11 of the 12 reserves lists all the animals found in each reserve as well as feeding watering and resting area s called need zones where you ll often find herds of animals if you go there at the appropriate times the guide also tells you the types of ammo suitable for shooting what callers to use if applicable which scents are effective as well as the class of game the higher the class the more you earn to get the best kills especially ones suitable to place in your trophy lodge you need to know where to hit the animals for the quickest kills using only one bullet to take down a target place it ideally in the heart or in the lungs will get you higher experience more cash more importantly a better weapon score you can tell if you ve definitely got a good killing shot in the heart or lungs because the blood splashes you ll find on the ground next to where you made your shot are larger than less effective but still leading to the animal dying shots weapon scores are very important initially as they unlock better weapons scopes ammunition types there s a whole range of weapons from ancient 50 calibre ball shot muzzle loading rifles wwi 303 s to decent hunting rifles as well as pistols shotguns bows crossbows that should keep you entertained for ages to come i tried the muzzle loading 50 calibre was surprised at it s effectiveness i took down a moose with just one shot though i nearly lost where i d actually dropped him because of the copious amounts of smoke those old flintlocks create which hid the animal from few for several seconds basically when you first start the game do the missions that are included with each reserve most are not hard to complete but earn you lots of xp cash as well as weapon points if the missions involve hunting harvesting your kills xp earns perks skill points these are used to improve things such as tracking spotting distances more efficiently improving your aim via breathing wobble movements also the cash enables you to buy better weapons however to use better weapons as mentioned briefly above you have to earn weapon points which are earned by harvesting animals that you ve hunted the rarer the animal the cleaner the kill i e try to hit the heart then the lungs in that order earns you better weapon points but also the fewer shots you take i e get a kill with just one shot is the target you aim for any more than two shots will reduce your weapon score significantly plus the faster they drop post hit the better the weapon score there is a lot to learn but the game play is addictive and fun very rewarding once you ve sussed the basics the only way to do that is to get some game time in playing cooperatively does not allow for missions which are your big xp cash earners if you are joining someone else s reserve try to make sure you pick up your own kills because whoever harvests the animal can add the trophy to their lodge even if they didn t kill it also hunting structures are only visible to those who ve previously purchased the hide they generally cost between 1700 to 2500 in game money depending on which type of structure it is there are many scattered around each reserve usually near need zones building a raised hunting hide earns xp as does finding places of interest that usually give interesting facts about the reserve all the information you glean from the game as you find or earn it is kept in the codex and can be accessed at any time my advice before joining a cooperative game play solo on each reserve to get to know the lay of the land as well as some experience before you even consider playing cooperatively which is a totally different experience to the solo game setting up a multiplayer game is really easy and besides playing cooperatively there are almost 40 different competitive missions you can compete with the community because the reserves are so large it s worth investing in the atv dlc to get you around quickly it s included with the 2019 edition but not the 2021 edition especially when you first play the game as you progress you unlock outposts that enable you to restock with ammunition hunting equipment you ve unlocked change your weapons via the storage cabinets or buy more stores from the shop using your earned in game income they also act as spawn points enabling you to fast travel between each outpost in the reserve you are located in unfortunately you can t travel between reserves if you have the tent ground blinds dlc they are useful in cutting down hunting pressure continued in comments
