2021 this game s story world and characters outclass fallout 3 and fallout 4 by a wide margin it s the only fps fallout that is allowed to sit with fallout 1 and 2 at the cool kids table every choice you make matters and there are genuinely interesting moral challenges you will encounter there is no generic sarcastic jerk or good boy type of dialogue this game lets you be a genuine monster you can desecrate a war memorial and then tell a grieving soldier that his dead brother was a every single npc can be murdered except children there is no plot armor there are no heroes everyone sucks and that includes the player character and that s what i love about this game gunplay and graphics are definitely dated and there are a few bugs and crashes but most of that can be easily fixed with mods i highly recommend this game if you enjoy western rpgs and haven t already given it a try
