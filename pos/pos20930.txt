2015 life is strange is the best episodic adventure game i have ever played and i have played just about all of them dontnod entertainment a small developer based in paris france has taken the episodic genre to new levels of excellence in story character development art style music and soundtrack so let me discuss those topics story life is strange is about a girl age 18 max caulfield who wants to study to become a professional photographer she learns that a school in her hometown blackwell academy has hired one of her favorite professional photographers mark jefferson and she decides she needs to move back to her hometown to enroll in his classes that is the normal part about this story and nothing else in the story can be considered normal in any way shape or form each new episode takes the story in a surprising direction that the player will be astounded by and never able to predict which way the story will go this is practically unheard of in game stories because most of them are so predictable and cliche by the time you get to the end of the game you know exactly what will happen life is strange is 100 different in that category character development the main characters in this game are so well done that you will form emotional bonds to them and if something happens to these characters you will feel it as though it is happening to you be prepared because you will need a box of tissues for your tears close by in lis and that is a guarantee nearly every single person i have conversed with on the steam forum for lis has admitted to shedding tears and lots of them yes the characters and the story are that good rivaling even great best seller novels i have read and i have read thousands of novels art style the art style in life is strange is not photorealistic like many games now days attempt to achieve instead it is very stylish in the way the dontnod team has done it and it is perfect for a game like this along with the amazing camera work in lis i think it deserves awards in all three categories i have mentioned so far all the art in the game is hand drawn and hand painted and it really does show in the finished product in fact i have a folder on my pc with about 400 screenshots from lis that i run on a 5 minute timer for my desktop background i finished playing lis back in october of 2015 when the final episode released and i still have that folder running as my desktop background the art is amazing music soundtrack the music in life is strange is modern day artists and one of them syd matters the dontnod team worked closely with the lead person in that band jonathan morali and he adapted some of their songs specifically for lis because they use current artists is adds yet another level of realism to the game because you are hearing songs that young adults age 16 to 25 would be listening to in their every day lives the music selection also really sets the mood for the game and again it deserves an award for the excellence and quality about the only thing i would mention as a con to life is strange is that the lip sync quality is not very good however in interviews with the dontnod team they said they spent the games budget in areas they felt would better serve to make the game a work of quality and the story characters art style and soundtrack are so good that you will hardly notice the poor lip sync at least that was the case for me playing lis if you are a gamer and you don t have this title in your library you have missed out on the best game of 2015 without a doubt and likely one of the best games of all times yes it is that good edit i wrote this review when the game was only at three episodes released and though the 4th episode was as good as the previous three episode 5 the final was not as good as the rest of the game dontnod did not do the endings justice to the story in that there was more then one choice at the end and those choices were not equal in length and quality with one of them being much much better in length and quality then the other was both endings were good however one was shorter and not as good as the other this made for a lack luster ending for me because i preferred the choice of the shorter ending and i would have liked to have seen it show more then it did please note that though i thought the ending could have been better it in no way makes life is strange a failure or a bad game in fact it remains my favorite game for the last decade and likely my favorite game of all time
