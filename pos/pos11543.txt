2017 early access review i love this game starting off it may be a bit confusing coming into it from a minecraft mindset or other pre conceived notions can make it difficult i would highly suggest watching tutorial vids online first to help ease things i d also suggest looking up how to modify your entityclasses xml file to stop dropping items when you die why they took out drop nothing from your game settings is beyond me but you can easily comment out one line and do the dev s job for them once you get your bearings then you can go back in for a more challenging experience i d also highly recommend checking out some multiplayer games in fact click the modded tab and sort by of players and try out a public server best fun i ve had make sure to check the server settings in the right pane at the server selection screen drop on death 4 is drop nothing fyi find a server check out their website and learn their commands there s some awesome stuff you can do best of all the player community is great for a survival game i was expecting players like from rust dayz ark etc who are the lowest pieces of scum you can find outside of government however 7 days to die draws a lot of great people and the top servers are usually pve forced servers they will definitely elevate your experience participate in chat say hello ask questions the best comment i can make to encapsulate why this game is great is this do you remember the first couple nights in minecraft punching trees and trying to get some food and shelter to survive the night imagine that except now when you become super powerful with huge bases designing that epic fortress with a moat of death traps actually has a purpose instead of just being eye candy or to keep out the one skeleton trying to shoot you with arrows the weapons and combat are much more satisfying as well
