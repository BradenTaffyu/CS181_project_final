2019 11this is the game of the century positively 20th anniversary people might call it a relic of the past but that s not true it s a monument of human achievements and why a monument because it s still going strong and one of the biggest games ever if you re an rts fan you owe yourself to try this game and come to experience the game that defined a generation and is still a sight to behold wholeheartedly recommended edit after reading a few negative comments about the game being overpriced or it being a separate game to anyone who is skeptical of the price and why is it separate from the 2013 hd versionthey made it a separate game as the changes are so so many that people with and people without this update will not be able to play together at all they even discounted the owners of the previous game for 25 off aka people like me and maybe you as well it s not 60 not even 40 and it s a proper dlc too aoe2 dlcs were always traditionally 15 at launch for this one you get the dlcs and brace yourself for option 4 1 actual 4k graphics with everything rebuilt from the ground up 2 changed and updated campaigns i was in the beta test as well every campaign has been reworked it s units civs premise and by that i mean the story and stuff has changed a lot too it s very different from before 3 soundtrack updates it s nice to see it and with a good pair of headphones you will notice the differences and quality of life changes and ability to customize and rework the game even for players with eye problems 4 i repeat the best addition almost lag free experience with dedicated official microsoft servers 5 rebalances and many new fruitful additions the game s getting updates every week and the pro have already switched to aoe 2 de as it s just the next step for this game also b auto farm fish trap re seed button and mod support b there 5 key changed do justify a 5 extra on top for the 15 to make a nice 20 package and as a previous owner is just paid 15 due to my discount also the price also reduces a little bit for most regions it s justified
