2020 sure i could have gotten away clean i could have snuck out behind you while you were coming in and you wouldn t even know i was there i could have just left it all not burden myself with all that weight but i got it anyway just to show you that i could old man i stepped past the threshold and i looked back at you as the laserfield activated at your perplexed face as you realized you ve been had slowly making my way towards the elevator your muffled curses fading away in the distance you got what you wanted the vault is yours how fitting that it should be your prison and how fitting that she should be your warden and you know what i haven t spent any of it i keep it in a locker at the foot of my bed in the presidential suite of the lucky 38 as a trophy or perhaps a reminder of everything you ve done enjoy what s left of your miserable life old man i m off to save the world
