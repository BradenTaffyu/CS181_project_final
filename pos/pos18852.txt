2021 great game for history and strategy lovers recommend the only problem is the dlc policy of the developers they are releasing a lot of dlcs that are very expensive and recent dlcs are very bugged and unfinished but do get fixed overtime just wait until bugs get fixed before buying new dlcs an buy them on sale if possible
