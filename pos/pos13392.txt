2015 early access review kerbal space program is an excellent game if you like anything to do to aeronautics and space you start off with limited parts but as you progress and do missions and launches you get gradually better and reach out further and further into the cosmos the more you play the more possibilities are opened out to you and since i love doin sciency this game is just great for me and i recommend it completely
