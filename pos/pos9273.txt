2016 tl dr get the game you wouldn t even be here reading reviews if you don t like space 4x games and this is a great 4x gamegalaxy and factionsfirst of all you start in a galaxy of a maximum of 1000 stars there are mods to play even more stars planets asteroids etc are in orbit around stars which adds a nice immersion factions are randomly generated every game instead of the same old prebuilt factions that you have in other 4x games although you can build your own factions to spawn in the galaxy if you wish do to so and there s lots and lots of different variable options so that you basically will never meet the same faction twice huge number of government types ideas culture races ship types ftl types etc faction customization is great it s like every possible faction personality is available to create you can even customize the random names the factions give to their people ships fleets armies planets stars etc tons of events are happening in the galaxy as well giving it more personality and flavor sometimes the game gives you quest like missions where you have to study this wreckage then it will lead to another points of interests leading to new techs bonuses etc empire governmentempire management is awesome you can actually select your type of government and change it in game resulting in different types of bonuses and government systems you can have a democracy where there s an election every 5 years 50 years or a dictatorship empire religion based faction science lead faction etc etc each elected leader has different personalities as well with different aims platforms etc some ruler will want to bring back slavery to your empire when elected for example rulers are picked from a pool of leaders basically your admirals generals researchers and governors in your empire and they have different agendas if they get elected as leader support the one you like the most factions can also form up inside your empire if your population s culture and beliefs become more and more varied some people may like the current government some people may want changes or reforms the population system is also well made you can actually play as a non genocidal xenophilic type where every race or certain races only it s up to you is welcome to your empire again unlike other 4x games where it s you or them you can have an empire composing of many different races a pan species empire and they can have different privileges like giving them rights to vote to move freely etc you can be as racist as you like or as welcoming as you like or both welcome them and then exterminate them your choice you can even genetically manipulate your own species or other races or create robots androids or genetically enhanced soldiers some races might be better soldiers than others use them as such diplomacysome would say the diplomacy is lacking compared to other games but i beg to differ there s lots of things to do in the diplomacy side first of all federations you can actually form federations with different factions not just alliances but federations you elect a federation president every few years and rotate around the different members the federation also has their own shared federation fleet comprising of technology taken from all the members it s similar to galciv s united planets but you aren t forced to join and it s not automatically created for everyone even enemy factions lots of different treaties like star chart sharing non aggression treaties embassies research ventures and good ol resource trading there s no traditional trade lines trading like in galciv though you can make a faction your vassal and there are multiple types you can even play as vassal to another empire and eventually liberate yourself from it if you want to you can also integrate them into your empire one more awesome thing is you can actually see primitive civilizations in game and they all vary and you can see them in different states whether they are in the early space age bronze age industrial etc or you might even see a dead world where a past civilization blew themselves up due to nuclear war if you are playing as non humans you might even see our own solar system maybe we blew ourselves up maybe you just arrived in time before we do or you arrived during our cavemen days and chose to observe us instead you can observe them advance their technology abduct them for experiments or even uplift them or invade and exterminate them resourcesresources system is well made you mine minerals from planets asteroids either from orbit or if you have the planet colonized on the ground you need minerals basically for everything that you construct you can construct power plants in lots of different ways in order to get energy credits which is the main currency of the game you also have three research resources society engineering and physics and different celestial bodies give bonuses to them when an orbital station or facility is constructed you also gain influence points to use on diplomacy or actions related to your empire faction government research and technologyyou also can have three researches going on in parallel which is society engineering and physics which is much more immersive as well no more having to decide whether to research for your colony infrastructure first or for your military strength etc technology is smartly randomized every time you finish a research meaning there is no fixed research tree you get the immersion of really researching stuff as you won t know what technology lies far ahead warfarespace warfare is similar to your usual space rts games with the good addition of turn based like status reports where you can see statistics of the battle while it is going on there is also land warfare in which you can create and recruit armies and invade planets to finally colonize them you can also get air support from your ships in orbit and bombard the planet however way you want thoughts about the gamegreat game huge great potential to become one of the best space 4x games ever made after more content is made dlcs expansions i m not saying it s lacking content though it s got more than enough to keep you playing my expectations on this game was not that high considering all other recent 4x games have been meh for me and i haven t really played any paradox interactive games that much it s already better than most if not all other 4x games out there and it s only going to get better with time score 9 7 10as of writing this it s 94 positive right now on steam reviews worth the price
