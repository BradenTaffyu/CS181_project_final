2022 one of the better sims out there and still constantly getting updates and new dlc s although it is limited to gt cars of which you will most likely only be racing the gt3 ones since they re faster and who doesn t like faster there is a bit of a meta just like in real life car a will be best at track a and car b will be best at track b because that s how the cars are but ultimately if you re just racing solo or regular multiplayer it shouldn t really matter which car you re driving everyone will mostly be at the same level besides the occasional really bad player which is usually just a new player and the really good player which will just be someone with hundreds of hours there s really nothing to be ashamed of if you re a bit off pace as long as you re having fun just try not to have fun at other people s expense and remember if someone does crash into you it s most like by mistake trying to explain to someone why a certain move they pulled was just dumb rude and what they should do instead is better than calling them stupid and not telling them why because next race they ll do the exact same thing and it won t improve the races for anyone
