2017 early access review beamng combines the most true and accurate vehicle physics with proper interaction to the plethora of provided race environments aside from the horrible name beamng comes extremely close to the most sought after game i ve ever wanted this game is leaps above anything like it before you simply won t find a better open world racing sim overall to me this is my most favorite racing sim to date many claim beamng to simply be a soft body or crash sim royal bs this game is a full vehicle handling sim that happens to have the best most realistic damage physics to go with it drive it like you stole it and you ll most likely roll it with time trial and scenarios there is limitless hard core racing to be had outstanding mod support also bumps this game to a higher level with many amazing user created maps and true to life cars being related to rigs of rods mod creation will be endless is the game perfect no it lacks some things like environment physics trees breaking rocks moving building getting damaged shrubs folding etc but i m relatively certain these are omitted due to cpu gpu s just not being powerful enough to do it all yet after a bit of reading it seems pretty obvious the dev created this game to try and sell the tech since no one want the tech now they ve sort of been forced to actually make a game out of it it s not a full game yet but every patch is a great improvement for sim lovers at less than half a game s normal price this is a value like no other support the game definitely worth a buy
