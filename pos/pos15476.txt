2022 this game actually helped me learn the fundamentals of car mechanics and destygmatized the concepts by breaking it down to generic processes and parts i did a little work on cars as a kid occasionally turning a wrench or screw driver for my dad but never really grasped the concepts until i played this game now i do much of the basic work on my own vehicles after this game helped break the barrier and build the confidence to look under the hood my son is now studying to be a heavy duty mechanic and this helped him grasp a lot of the same basic concepts as well
