2016 i generally don t write reviews so i will try and keep this short and to the points the good you can play lots of games in it with your friends pretty easily it s fun there s lots of user content from the steam workshop to keep you entertained as well the bad the new ui update is aweful the ui is trash now however it s not any real reason to not buy the game hopefully the devs will undo it i generally just play magic the gathering on here as it has a lot of good plugins from the community for that i have not purchased the dlc as most of the dlc is also on the steam workshop because other players have made it better so in short this game is absolutely worth it just really hope the devs fix the ui
