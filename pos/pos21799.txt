2018 let me note a couple things first off this is my first ever actual review so please don t chew me up second an absurd amount of people are getting this from humble bumble this month which is good dont get me wrong but you should probably know what you re getting yourself into i also dont have much experience with the other souls game but thats subject to change in other words this is coming from a strictly dark souls 3 player no bias from the other games or any of that as for gameplay i believe this game excels once you get ahold of it i caught on pretty late didnt know what fat rolling was or why i was so slow up to yhorm before a friend explained it to me so yeah darn speakings of yhorm i didn t like the storm ruler gimmick at all same goes with wolnir s braclets i mean you dont technically have to do the yhorm thing but its your best bet i digress other then the little things that made the game that much easier the gameplay kept me on my toes and my controller s accross my roomsoundtrack wise it really stuck with me as well especially the main menu theme cause who can forget it lets talk about the story this is pretty difficult to pick up on for the most part you have to read vague item descriptions and do the little side quests to really get into it i m gonna summarize it for you guys though you are the ashen one given the task to hunt down and return the five lords of cinder to their thrones in the firelink shrine to link the flame once more in order to prevent the age of dark i think i m gonna bring up replayability lastly because thats usually pretty important which its there between ng and the achievements i ve sank a good 40 hours of my time into this game in 2 weeks according to steam which may not be super impressive but its been an everyday routine to hop on and progress on my favorite rpg to date my final verdict buy it and dont give up this game is hard to put it lightlygameplay 9 10ost 8 5 10story 8 10replay value 8 5 10total score 9 10
