2016 so the main question most people looking at buying this game would ask is whether or not it is better than civ 5 there really is no simple answer to that question but i think to a large extent the answer is yes here s why 1 the atmosphere is amazing at first i thought i would hate the graphics but since i ve been playing they ve grown on me not in a weird fungal way yes they do look less reallistic then civ 5 possibly even a little bit cartoonish but they build an atmosphere for the game in a way that is just as immersive as the realism of civ 5 the music is great definitely superior to that of civ 5 maybe not as great as baba yetu but then again what is i also love sean bean s voice no 2 the city building is far deeper than that of civ 5 and more strategic you actually have to plan out how you will use each tile and where you will build improvements you can t build every single building you want to in each city and that forces you to specialize each city 3 the combat is a lot more tactical than in civ 5 the new movement rules make a large impact on planning out your assaults as well as your defenses also bringing back stacking from civ 4 in a limited way makes you make decisions about where you want to focus your strength i also love the fact that it takes walls for a city to bombard it gives you a reason to actually build walls 4 each civilization is a lot more deep and it feels like each leader has a personality i know that agendas are getting a lot of flak right now but i actually really enjoy them for example i fought gorgo to a standstill early on in one game and after the war ended we actually became friends because she beleived i had fought honorably it actually felt like she was acting like the historical figure actually would now of course the agendas need some tweaking to make the ai behave normally but overall i like the agendas oh and as a side not civilizations don t have just one bonus now they actually have several which makes each civ a bit more detailed and unique 5 the early game can be challenging if you aren t prepared this especially applies to higher difficulty games where in the early game you will more than likely have to deal with a neighboring civ or barbarians you actually have to build units early game in order to protect yourself now admittely the ai does need to be fixed so it can attack effectively but i will talk more about that later 6 the eureka and inspiration boosts definitely take each game a different dirrection the choices you make in game actually effect how your civilization progresses for example if you have a very peaceful early game then chances are you won t be researching stuff like archery or bronze working for a while just because it is easier to go down other routes first it feels like your experiences in game are actually connected to your technology and culture 7 i also really like how the civics tree functions the whole card system feels a lot more fluid than the old social policy system that inevitably came down to going tradition and then rationalism again it feels like you are reacting to your game not the other way around i also really enjoy the government types and the bonuses each one gives the governments actually give you an interesting early and mid game in terms of culture and its bonuses 8 i know this is a small thing but i really like the fact that there are actually casus belli now and that warmongering penalties increase throughout the ages 9 housing should probably go with 2 but i m kind of lazy so i like the realism of being essentialy forced to settle around fresh water i m a history nerd so i absolutely love civilizations rising around major waterways like in the neolithic era and there being an emphasis on looking for water sources for new cities 10 the new and expanded victory types are defintiely a welcome addition it is good to see that there a bigger benefits for focusing on relgion than there were in civ 5 i m also grateful that city states now function differently which has also lead to the removal of the diplomatic victory type as it was just annoying to see other civs having infinite amounts of gold and overwhelming you with it in civ 5 also i feel like the science victory is more meaningful as it feels like you aren t just building parts for a spaceship but also trying to settle a new planet the list of great changes for civ 6 could go on and on but i think i got most of the major ones here are the few negative parts of this game that aren t an improvement over civ 5 1 the ai can be a bit wonky at times it has a very hard time attacking cities properly even with the overwhelming numbers it always has the ai can also have trouble upgrading it s units although often times this is due to a lack of resources for certain units however if you are planning on dominating the world in civ 6 it isn t actually that much easier than in civ 5 not that it was that hard on civ 5 as the ai will actually build updated units and it usually has a ton of units so it can be difficult and a bit of a meat grinder to get through them all the ai will probably be patched up to working condition within a month so it really isn t that big of a deal 2 the ui could use some amount of improvement mainly in the way lists are sorted and making it more clear how your amenities are being used this is relatively minor and will be a rather easy patch or will just require a mod or two to deal with if you are really that ocd so in conclusion while the game isn t perfect it is already just as if not more fun than civ 5 all while offering a completely different expereince from civ 5 i see no reason to wait to get the game as it is already very much a fun and enjoyable experience even without expansions which could not be said of civ 5 on release despite it now being one of the best strategy games of all time
