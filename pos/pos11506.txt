2019 early access review rust with lots of zombies is probably one of the shortest and yet most fitting reviews i can drop for 7 days to die technically 7 days to die is even better than rust if it wasn t for update 17 pretty much ruining most of the very awesomely balanced gameplay progression where it before the update was learn things by doing things it is now buy perks after killing lots of stuff to be able to do things it pretty much destroyed all the fun with the progression system all the same this game is still a blast with friends and i personally think it comes pretty close to ark added bonus not as dodgy on the engine side and less buggy seriously if you loved rust ark h1z1 dayz or any of the other multiplayer rampage survival in the apocalypse titles you re going to love 7 days to die it s a great game the only reason i ve played those other titles more than this one is the fact that by now i ve rally had enough of that kind of copy paste survival game mechanics don t let that stop anyone else though
