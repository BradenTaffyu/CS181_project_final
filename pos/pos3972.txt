2018 early access review this game is absolutely amazing i m generally not a fan of card based games but there s something about slay the spire that i can t let go the cards and relics have very unique synergies but it s also not overly convoluted the fact that the deck system is dynamic keeps me coming back for more runs the rush of getting that one card for your deck or getting another card to change your mental process and possibly have you think twice about your build as other reviews before me have said it is a great example of a game that is easy to pick up but hard to master the artwork is amazing and i adore the soundtrack pros wonderful artworkwonderful soundtrackcurrently two characters with very different play styleswide variety of cards between the two characters offering many deck variationsrelics offer multitudes of playstyles and adds variety to runsdungeons offer many different and unique paths including normal fights elite fights merchant shops and dnd styled story like encounters with possibilities of great rewards or your own demisecons if you even call these cons still early access as of this review but for an early access game you wouldn t think it wasyearning for more cardsyearning for more relicsyearning for the third characterwouldn t mind seeing an extra tower or two in a run currently only 51 floors conclusion seriously this game is outstanding i cannot wait to see what else megacrit decides to shell out with future updates and up to its full release for an early access game it seriously feels like it s a full title as it is and i cannot stop thinking about it well worth the 16 again as of this review and all throughout early access and will provide you with hours upon hours of entertainment thank you megacrit for providing an excellent game
