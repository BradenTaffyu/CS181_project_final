2020 what a masterpiece i wasn t into sim racing as i do car motorcycle racing irl so this was not very attractive to me due to the home lockdown and postponing of the racing season i thought to give it a try oh my god graphics aside everything that you can think of has been implemented properly i can only imagine playing with a vr a rig would very much replicate real driving it s extremely helpful to understand basic racing mechanics weight transfer brake bias suspension travel its effects tyres grip temperatures pressures overheating racing setup camber caster toe everything has been perfectly implemented with real effects just like you would tune a proper race car would i recommend this game to other players absolutely only if you are interested into sim racing if you are looking for an arcadish racing game this is not for you
