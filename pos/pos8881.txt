2017 let me start by saying that i enjoy 4x and strategy games in general but often lack the patience to actually take the time to learn all of their mechanics therefore in the end loving the idea of the game more than actually playing it often i ll get into a game such as this and either get frustrated with it in some way or feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of content to wade through in order to know if the first ship that i created was done so properly stellaris for me has been the exception to that my friend asked me to play this game with him and i told him sure but don t expect me to stick with it and as of this writing we are now planning weekly games sometimes lasting six hours per session so i ll start by saying that i love the mechanics of this game in almost every way this is a 4x game that runs in real time but you don t feel like you are micro managing every unit like a traditional rts it s a very good hybrid approach to elaborate on that point when you send a fleet of ships into combat you aren t controlling several squads of ships in real time you tell which fleets you want to fight to engage and then they all just jump in and fight it out unless you command them to retreat this simplfies the combat mechanic more than some typically enjoy but in general makes this game less about players ability to control lots of units and more about the strategy needed before combat begins combat in stellaris is important as is the design and power of your ships but it s not the key focus stellaris is a strategy game that s focus is truly strategy one cannot simply work towards researching the most powerul hardware and expect to win because you can t just declare war and steam roll through an empire war is a carefully planned process that requires demands to be set and met win or lose if i declare war on another nation then i have to openly state that i want planets to vasalize them demand liberation of a nation or other similar options after the war is declared and demands set the war begins and each side has a score value that must be met that score can be achieved in a number of different ways but once it reaches 100 then the victor earns their demands and the declaring party cannot declare war on that nation again for 10 game years and a lot can happen in that time the losing party could build up relations with other empires to prevent the next war for example another aspect that i really enjoy are the mechanics in the game that reduce a lot of the micro management tedium one example of this is the outliner that appears on the right hand side of the ui if not for this one ui element i m not sure i would enjoy the game nearly as much because it helps to expidite so many functions of the game it essentially provides a breakdown of the key units and areas you are actively managing and makes it very easy to quickly access them and see what they are doing if i have three science ships on three different tasks i can easily see their progress and can quickly navigate to their current location i can at a glance see each of my fleets planets sectors opposing factions etc the entire panel can also be customized to your needs or even hidden if you don t like it the creation of sectors is also of great importantance and goes a long way to eliminate the tedium of micro managing planets once you get more than five planets in vanilla you must start to create system sectors or you suffer penalties once the systems are in sectors you set the options for the sector and it has it s own resources and manages the planets building queues production and populations on it s own this is major because once you get to 7 8 planets it can become a real chore keeping up with everything they need sectors can set their production focus can have their own rulers their contributions can be defined and more for me this is what makes the game playable multiplayer is also amazing in this game a game can consist of up to 32 players and can run at normal or faster speeds players can join in pacts and federations as well as create trade agreements and contribute to others conflicts or of course can just play free for all and wreck each other be aware that there are still some bugs with multiplayer that require the host to reload the game from time to time but games can be saved to any of the players and someone else can host if need be other small details the achievements can only be earned in single player iron man mode so that s something to be aware of too if that s something you enjoy this isn t a game that is normally played in one to two hours if a game is that short then things went horribly wrong or right depending on which player you are this game will often last for days or possibly weeks depending on the game setup that fact alone might tell you if you do or don t want to play it so bear that in mind as well you can create your own custom races as with other games of this type but the creation system is very intuitive and adds a lot to the game for me players also need to manage their ships you can customize your ship s componets in great detail or leave it up to the ai to automatically manage them for you overall you have better builds if you manage them yourself but it isn t required to play the game players also are not assured a win by researching a specific tree research is randomized and you are given three choices initially to choose from each time you start to research a new project this is one of the great equalizers in the game because it forces the player to carefully balance their empire focus for some reading this that may sound like a negative but it actually adds a great mechanic to the game so in short if traditional strategy or rts games aren t your thing give stellaris a look watch some youtube videos live streams let s plays or something similar for a while and see the mechanics in action watching for 5 10 minutes might not give you enough of a feel for it so give it some time i wish they had a demo of this game out so anyone that s curious about it could actually try it out and see how great it is there is no shortage of 4x and strategy games on the market but stellaris stands out and creates a fresh new experience
