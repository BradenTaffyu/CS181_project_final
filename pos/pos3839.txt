2020 i confess i never knew what this game was before i bought it my friend and i joked around the steam store when we stumbled upon this at first it s title is weird i mean i thought it was probably your usual steam bloat but then when i look at the screenshots i was like this is basically x com but with anime ish feature since it was priced lower before than chimera squad dandylion please don t sue me and i was in a x com maniac mode i said sure why not suffice to say that after playing this from start to the end this is literally the better x com chimera squad xccs than x com chimera squad is there s a lot of things that the developer put in this game with a lot of depth and that is the greatest thing about troubleshooter the game is so so deep it s not like x com where your strength starts from basic to laser to plasma or psionics or advanced units like mecs or templar skirmisher reaper but let s put that away there s buildcrafting you see in this game the character strengths are defined by masteries that you can put think of it like mods or traits the best part there s a lot of masteries and i mean over 200 ish masteries but not just that combining certain masteries will give you a mastery set which means even more possibilities you want your tank to be a fireball slinger instead of punchy punchy sure want your healer to be a debuffer why not or you want to make your own templar from wotc complete with the op of the reaper and parry trait why the hell not the game lives and breathes through its depth and i can see how meticulous the devs are in this game another thing that it has is its story xccs is the first entry from x com that tries to focus its narrative and its results are okay i guess troubleshooter on the other hand is different i always love a story in which its whole cast is interconnected and boy there s a lot of twists in the game the story really surprises you sometimes that you don t expect that one particular thing can cause an impact i like how the story connects as time goes on and it shows how some plot holes are patched as the game progresses but are there bad things about this game hmm i wouldn t say bad but more of a depends stuff first i did say the game has depth but reaching that depth would take a long time it really takes time for things to start gearing up not just from gameplay but from the plot i d say about 25 to 30 ish it s okay for some but some people will be put off by this especially nowadays when there are a lot of aaa open world huge stuff yada yada yada like i said it s not bad but it s not good either it depends another mixed thing is that the start of the game is a bit overwhelming at least for me you can be anything in this game yes but freedom and effectiveness are two different things i wouldn t know how to exactly make my build stronger without some guide this is a mixed bag i know but i would ve preferred if the game does hand me at least a template for builds or advanced tutorials wow this is a long review i think that s because troubleshooter has a lot of things to say it doesn t copy it takes notes from xcom and fire emblem in some way but it manages to combine all that note and it becomes a thing of its own and a fantastic game it is all fans of xcom fire emblem srpg or strategies should really look into this as this is an underrated gem oh and i can t wait for episode 2 i really can t maybe i can if you put some kind of psi blades for irene or albus or leton pretty please
