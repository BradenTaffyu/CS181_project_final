2020 i have just played through the game and achieved its true ending ending e the amount of emotion that i felt in that moment when i saw the messages was something i have never felt from a video game at the end i chose to sacrifice what was asked of me and i am left with a sense of joy pain and accomplishment this game is now my all time favorite and i hope that more people out there will work and strive to reach ending e i am willing to help someone along on this journey as well the first person to message me on steam will receive a copy of the game that i will gift to you i understand that there is no guarantee that you will like the game or that you will play through to the true ending but if there is even a chance of you reaching that moment that i am willing to put the money on the line thank you for taking the time to read this glory to mankind
