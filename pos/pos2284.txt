2023 praise the lord and pass the ammunition the myth of the frontier depicted in a crude and ironic post apocalyptic world much has been said already about fallout 76 and the fallout world the gameplay is what you expect from a fallout game scavenging gathering building killing weird creatures and all the remains of an era that exists no more everything is there like a memory you can touch and the failure of humanity is always in plain sight as i said violence and survival are what we can see the most but i d like to stress this game is not full of children killing and robbing you every 5 min servers are limited to a few people and the general idea is to see others as fellow survivors that can help you every now and then but keep living their life being a bethesda game you can of course find bugs and characters looking like a 2010 game it s basically their trademark nowadays but it almost fits with the devastated world they live in like if it was too radioactive to actually have nice textures i advise you to play with friends as much as you can because it s true there are moments when you re modifying your shelter or scrapping what you found roaming that are even better in solitude but in the long run despite the possibility of companions living in your house this game can become kinda melanchonic if you wander too much alone nature and the environment are immersive and there is always something fun to do but at the same time there is that veil of sadness everywhere for this world that could be much more than it is now the queen of the wastelands a screenshot of fallout 76 by the dreamer s hidden daughter
