2023 simply divine after completing baldur s gate 3 i decided to replay both divinity original sin s 1 2 after 5 years of not touching them as they ve always been my favorite games of all time and with the success of bg3 i wanted to go back to their previous work to see how it holds up i m happy to report that after all these years all three of larian s games remain the best crpg s in the market and i can never put one over the other i believe they re all equal masterpieces for different reasons gameplay combat adventuring 10 10 just like divinity original sin 1 and baldur s gate 3 divinity original sin 2 has the best turn based combat a studio has ever created although i don t think it s fully appreciated unless you play it on tactician as i believe that normal is too easy halfway through the game unlike larian s other crpg s there s not as much reliance on percentages and luck thanks to the physical magic armor systems it has massive build potential and there are many many options divinity original sin 2 also manages to have the most brutal ai i ve ever seen in a crpg which again isn t fully appreciated unless played on tactician they re abnormally smart in comparison to their other games and have outplayed me in ways in such creative ways this amazing combat is complimented by the amazing exploration adventuring gameplay there s a lot to see and a lot to do and i highly recommend taking your time when exploring this game is an adventure through and through and nobody but larian has managed to capture that feel writing 8 10 larian s writing while still very very good compared to most games remains to be one of their weaker aspects if i had to rank larian s storylines bg3 is incredible d os1 is okay and d 0s2 is great it s overall plotline surrounding dallis and the godwoken isn t the most interesting thing but the adventure surrounding it makes it worthwhile the companions are easily the best written part but they still don t compare to some other crpg s i ve played like say pathfinder wrath of the righteous it also feels emphasized to be played in co op to fully appreciate and call me crazy but i don t think there are enough opportunities to be as evil as i d like to be at some moments graphics animations environments 10 10 gorgeous and varied out of all of larian s games i think that divinity original sin 2 takes the cake for the most varied environments although baldur s gate 3 has the best overall graphics technically but lacks that variation in locations that make divinity original sin 2 so special they also have a great variety of combat animations that just look so cool and they even change depending on your race music sound design 10 10 divinity original sin 2 is larian s magnum opus soundtrack in my personal opinion it s memorable dynamic and beautiful the personal instrument mechanic that changes how many of the songs play out really add to this game in a way no other has ever achieved along with this perfect soundtrack is an equally masterfully made soundscape combat just feels so heavy and dangerous thanks to it and i believe it s an underappreciated aspect of the game although it s always underappreciated in any game overall 11 10 another masterpiece in larian s god tier crpg lineup there s a reason why all of this studio s crpg games are my favorite games of all time they introduced me to my favorite genre of games and quite literally changed my life in ways i didn t expect play it
