2022 product received for free this game has mostly replaced minecraft for me as the game to play to just zone out and relax granted you can t completely stop paying attention you have to keep an eye on your hunger and thirst and that damn shark thinks rafts taste delicious for some reason but it s about as chill a game as you could ask for without going completely mind numbing like bejeweled or something the graphics aren t particularly awe inspiring but this isn t meant to be a aaa graphics kind of game it s a fun cartoony style that works well fair warning the game s storyline is not as cheerful as the graphics style i just started a new playthrough to unlock all the characters which have no mechanical benefit as far as i can tell just for aesthetics and finding all the notes and scraps left behind families and friends separated or more likely killed it can get pretty heavy for an otherwise chill game kudos to the writers end of the day this game is phenomenal i received it as a gift and it s maybe the best gifted game i own even if i d paid for it i d have happily spent it knowing what i know now worth every penny
