2023 its good i like it however it can be one giant time sink you have to be on the right wave length for it huge broad deep but one of the fussiest micromanagement heavy games i ve ever played its the kind of game you could spend an hour in and not feel like you moved an inch its crazy reactive spells abilities mix off each other can rob vendors blind rewards thinking outside of the box standard difficulty is balanced in a way that seems like you have to cheese rob steal fight dirty and have a stellar handle on status effects buffs nerfs combat bonuses etc get ready to get your teeth kicked in when act 2 starts if you don t have combat totally figured out big part of it is status effects and denying the enemy their turns they let you re spec your skills as much as u want for free at the start of act 2 and its tuned for that you can spend hours balancing your characters and get nuked by a status effect you never saw before then bam back to the drawing board again its extremely well made they knew exactly what they wanted to do and they did it but it can feel like brick wall after brick wall just be ready to sink a lot of time into it to get the most out of it im mostly done with act 2 but im gonna put it down for a bit im kinda worn down from it honestly i haven t played bg3 yet maybe some day good luck
