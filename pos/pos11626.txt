2016 early access review another lazy review of some random guy for sp first of all this game has crappiest graphics of all times tons of glitches some minor problems here and therebut this game also has immense depth countless possibilities and motherload of potential big updates often alpha 15 stable added 1gb just today extreme realism and player unfriendly hardness highest replay value and playabilityso screw you some jackass downvoters i ve found no falsity nor medicority in this game great game by any means but be prepared to die a few dozen times at the beginning a note from the future at the day of my review the game had an enormous update and graphics and drawing distance got better relatively but still needs a a lot of work especially combat
