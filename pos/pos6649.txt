2022 beginning the game welcomes you with a nice loading animation you choose your character avatar there are many of them but they are simple create your company and choose one of the few logos choose the truck that you like the most and take training on it at first you drive other people s trucks and as you earn experience new longer routes will open up for you for which more rewards rely you will not even notice how in a couple of hours you will make trips to neighboring countries instead of between cities gameplay the game has acquired a bunch of mechanics all the time air suspension which if you do not lower it you won t be able to hitch a trailer power windows wiper modes traffic accidents due to which your planned route will have to change changing the rigidity of the cabin and stabilizing the trailer also you can take a loan from the bank and buy yourself a new truck that you dreamed about and go to private orders or expand the company by buying 1 or even 2 cheap trucks and hiring drivers for them the game won t let you get bored with its radio which has more than 40 stations i think everyone will find a suitable wave for themselves and will enjoy the road the road in the game is too monotonous for me the same interchanges that meet one after another in the game you can adjust the amount of precipitation which is a very convenient feature if you are used to seeing rain more often than dry weather outside your window and vice versa then in the game you can customize everything for yourself when you are already stand firm and can afford the truck of your dreams the game will not deprive you many variations of the engine chassis standard hood amplifiers and beacons on them for more colorful skins wheels and accessories you will have to pay for the dlc absolutely the same with trailers game has almost all types of trailers in the world traffic the ai in the game is very well done they use turn signals they don t run through red lights and they know how to brake urgently if you have an emergency situation along the middle of the road then when the hazard lamps are turned on the traffic will not drive up close to you from behind but will leave room for maneuver i have noticed more than once that the ai is trying in every possible way to help the player when leaving the site of the nook companies by stopping and letting you go ahead the police are present in the game they do not have designated places where they could stand so you meet them on the road if you drive on the highway more than 90 km h and the police catch up with you they will fine you in 95 percent of cases if you violate and drive 120 km h and catch up with the police who goes 110 km h overtaking them you will be fined in 80 of cases but if you slow down and follow them at 110 km h then you won t be fined dlc the game has accumulated a lot of dlc most of them are coloring pages of different countries and are simply themed there are tuning packs that add many parts and accessories of a specific brand of truck dlc for expanding maps has been in the game for a long time and they have already accumulated considering the size of additional maps due to the huge number of dlcs it may seem that they are expensive if you want everything at once but individually they cost quite sane money therefore the developers are scs not ubisoft online the game has a partner truckers mp with which you can drive in multiplayer with friends and players from all over the world however this is just a mod and there is no traffic inside not so long ago the developers added their own internal multiplayer with traffic playing with a friend has become much more enjoyable when there is traffic you can create an open server and wait for new people and make new friendship or make a closed lobby and arrange a private convoy of up to 10 people and that s all with traffic conclusion if you are a fan of the auto industry auto simulators and want to safely drive around europe then the game is worth the money the developers were able to make a game where you can relax immerse yourself in your thoughts and watch a beautiful picture personally i liked the game for its simplicity which lies in a bunch of little things p s at the time of writing the review i have played more than 3k hours on the second account played with
