2017 early access review i highly reccomend this game for all types of people as it s calming and fun to take care of wiggling squishy slimes that are always smiling unless they are starving pros it s really easy to play it s not really laggy on my ok laptop it has cats it has a realistic market with supply and demand relative to your game the more you sell the less you get from selling it and vice versa it s cute it has some cool views it s colorful has lots of space to run around in many varieties of fruit vegetables meat slimes places and decoration has things like slimeball to play while you wait for slimes to eat food early access lots of opportunitiescons large map is hard to cross some places are hard to find tarrs suck cause they kill all your slimes if they get in
