2022 played the demo and now the full version i ve been chasing the ogrebattle motbq dragon for about 30 years now and nothing ever really hit that mark i never had a n64 so ogrebattle 64 so was something i played later in life and not the game of my spent hundreds of hours of my youth playing this is the first game that really has that same feel that ogrebattle does squad building customization and army organization are huge components of the ob series that no other game really seemed to get right this one is on point the unit by unit turn based movement is different than that series but adds a nice element of strategy and feels cohesive overall well done looking forward to spending some serious hours on this one
