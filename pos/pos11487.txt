2013 early access review just a quick review i first backed this game when all there was was a few screenshots and a concept video i was so excited about this game i pretty much did the digital equilivant of yelling shut up and take my money and threw my money at them fast forward to now and i m typing this out on steam if i ve ever had a problem the devs are quick with responding and best of all they re actually people not mindless automatons the gameplay is excellent challenging and most of all it s fun can t wait for future updates
