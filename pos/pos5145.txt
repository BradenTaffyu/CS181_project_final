2021 my first 3d fallout the one most recommended to me for ease of play compared to the other 2 3d classics i heard much about there were many fun times and few bad times the bugs in and out of game even after all this time the game is still fairly buggy so be warned and save often also backup saves often after playing for 5 months with many interruptions in between i finally finished one route and never want to go back its a long game with much to do and explore but its time for a change of scenery i enjoyed the nuka world dlc and recommend it the others were so and so
