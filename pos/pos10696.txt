2016 be me plays this game for many hours then convinces best friend to buy it friend wants to play as axis i let him play as germany i play as italy axis buddies for life i teach him how to play in the first hour during 1936 friend struggles to learn but he soon catches on friend then takes austria and realizes he has a inner need to spread facism across europe i tell him to be careful and not start world war 2 yet he listens for now soon we take most of europe and all of africa by 1941 i tell friend to hold off the brits while i take india i succefully land in india and begin to replace tech support with italians soon india is half way under my control when i go look at europe i see german troops lined up along the soviet boarder i ask friend what does he think he is doing he replies with i want oil has flash back of when i first invaded the soviet union it was a nice summer in 1941 as germany i took over all of europe including the uk i then looked at the oil fields at stalingrad licks my lips like george w bush oil i whisper it was going all too well but then winter came i advanced too quickly and my supply lines were streched too thin my men were tierd and needed rest from the fighting but i kept pressing forward then i remember hearing ooorrahhh from millions of soveits in the distance along with soviet anthem i mumble to myself what have i done snaps out of flash back i beg my friend to not piss of the soveit union he says he can take them i tell him we will both get shrekt he replies with too late i see germany declares war on the soviet union i feel my heart sink and hear a voice with a russain accent say it s all oger now comrad i shake my head and think no he can do it i have faith in him a few months pass and it is now november india is barely alive when i hear holy f from my friend i look over and see my friend has made the same mistake he advanced too far and now the soviets have him right where they want him i realize if i dont act fast we will both be gang banged by millions of men i quickly pull out of india leaving a decent force to hold what i have taken my friend is losing ground fast i tell him to build bunkers along the german polish boarder incase we get pushed back that far my armies arrive in germany poorly equipt i ask my friend to let me barrow some of his weapons because he has too many guns now we might stand a chance i sprint to the front lines and begin to reinforce we desprately try to hold onto the ground we have just taken but it is futile the soviets push us back out of russia and into poland i say to my friend this is why you dont invade during the winter he replies with but this is only one front i realized i forgot about inida i look back at india to see the rest of my army is cut off and is trying to survive they scream and beg for their commander to send aid and reinforcements i look back at the easternfront and see the soviets still slowly advancing there is nothing i can do i tell them they reply with w what i cut communications with them i look up at my casualties and see them rise by a few hundred thousand a single tear rolls down my face that was about a third of my army i say to my friend a few weeks later me and my friend are doing everything we can to hold and more men are dying by the minute i realize we cant stop the advance our men are too tierd i tell my friend to pull back to the make germany great again wall he says what about you i tell him i need to avenge those men i lost he pulls back and i despritly try to hold while he regroups i lose men like mad trying to cover the retreat eventually he digs in and i pull back the soviets are right on my heels when i make it to the wall this is it he says this is our last stand the soveits begin to attack the wall but they cant penetrate our defences morale 2 we then devise battle plans to take out the soviet union after many months of fighting along the boarder we make our grand offensive operation chicken butt the plan goes well at frist we took back all of poland and began to march into the soveit union we make it as far as leningrad and the outskirts of moscow when we hear america f yeah united states delcares war on the axis we both our pants soon hundreds of thousands of u s troops come out of the soviet union and begin to repel our forces we despratley try to defend again but it is no use the american war machine is too strong soon americans land in africa and france we train new soldiers but give them few guns to defend we both then apply everyone serves recuitment polices italian soldiers break down my door and take my grandmother saying she is needed at the front i m sorry i say as they take her soon the americans and soviets are on the german and italian boarders it s everyman for himself at this point i abandon the front and flee to madagascar leaving my friend behind he calls me a traitor to the reich i tell him i warned him i look over at italy and germany and see them burning to the ground my friend then sends forces to join my men on the island europe is now under american and soviet occupation with them standing off against one another we both sit there and watch the world burn with spagetti and sausages i look at him and say this is why you never invade during the winter we both laugh and then get hit my a nuclear bomb11 10 friend and me would get gangbanged again
