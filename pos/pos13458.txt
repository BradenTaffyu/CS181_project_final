2018 updated review eula and privacy policyso after actualy reading the privacy policy and the eula you learn that it is not actualy malware a few of the points people were freaking out about are the personal information collection billing info collection system info collection and location collecton including your ip address so first of all the personal information collected is voluntary you have to opt in for it to be collected and even if you opt in it appears as quoted below this is a direct quote from their website registration for online services websites jobs products contests and special events subscribing to newsletters or alerts posting in or commenting on our message boards forums news blogs chat rooms or other online services purchasing a product or services through our online stores purchasing downloadable content virtual items or virtual currency for use with our software and or online services using tell a friend email this page or other e card features requesting technical support downloading demos programs or other software so its not anything unusual second billing info they need to charge you somehow and whenever you bought the game you gave the billing info so you could be charged nothing unusual if you have ever entered your credit card number anywhere you gave your billing information third system information this is used for statistics and game optimization they look at things like the hardware in your system and the resolution that you run your game at so they can better optimize the game for certain hardware some games show you statistics about how other people are running their games one that comes to mind is universe sandbox2 when changing resolution it tells you what percentage of people are using the given resolution if you have looked at the steam hardware and software survey you can see what other people are using in their computers as of june 2018 just look it up the first result will show you eveything about what type of computers and rigs everyone has set up as i said before it is mainly used to optimize games the location and ip address is also simple the location is used for statistics and also used to determine what server to give you an update from and things like that and the ip address is just seen when it communicates with your computer through the internet when you first launch the game it also asks you if you are alright with it anonymously sending information that includes your ip address and you can say no and use ksp just the same as if you said yes so ksp is a great game and i really don t see what all the eula fuss is about to me it just seems like false information was spread and because it was bad news it reached everyones ears before the actual news you can play this game and be perfectly fine but if you are still unsure just go do your own research and make up your mind links to privacy policy and the legal notice belowlegal info policy you are a bit confused on why it says take2games its because ksp was accquired by them and when you go to the ksp website it will link you to those when you click on privacy policy also the steam statistics incase you were intrested
