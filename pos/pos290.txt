2017 definitely a game i would recomend to those who have a lot of free time on their hands and love simulator games between farming mining and getting to know the villagers one can rarely get bored considering the game is made by one person it is a pretty well rounded game that is witty and unpredictable love it so 10 10 do yourself a favor play it
