2016 i haven t been this addicted to a game since terraria first came out it s a harvest moon like where you move out of the city and into a cabin from almost nothing you can slowly build up a giant farm but that s not all there is to do you can also forage fish make friends in town or explore the monster infested mine i don t think i ve ever before seen an indie game where all of the sound art writing and gameplay elements work together so perfectly seriously it s that good
