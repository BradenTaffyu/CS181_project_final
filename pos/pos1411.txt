2015 early access review while searching a superstore i went upstairs and i fould a walker in a room i didnt think much of it i found a backpack and a note inside it saying take what you want you need it more then me now and its like moments that take that make this game awesome but i find there is ways of hosting your own server but there needs to be a easy way like a couple clicks of a mouse then your in other then that this game is a great game
