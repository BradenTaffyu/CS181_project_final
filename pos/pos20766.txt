2023 i have seen many games based on books movies and most of them were either disappointing oder outright horrible so honestly the first time i heard there would be a harry potter rpg i was not excited i assumed this would be just as disappointing as many other titles i was proven wrong the amount of detail in this game is asthonishing you can waste hours upon hours simply by exploring hogwarts talking to characters solving puzzles and so on i can t remember how many hours i had already played the game before i actually started to explore the world outside of hogwarts the map is huge and offers even more puzzles and side quests but also a lot of fights the fighting system is implemented in a creative way while it fits perfectly to the lore as a player you will probably need some time to get used to all the spells potions defence and so on especially at the beginning you will likely have to retry a lot of battles but that is part of the game in time the more spells you know the higher your level the easier it will get i have a friend who never really played anything else than mobile games and even they managed to fight really well over time the music ist really beautiful at no point did i have the feeling of getting bored or even annoyed by it quite the opposite overall it is a great game i have read some criticism here and there and i can see how some things might annoy people i just don t share their opinion i think it is a beautiful game i have played 100 hours i m still not finished still haven t explored the whole map and still having fun
