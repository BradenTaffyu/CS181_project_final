2020 fallout 76 is in my opinion one of the best co op and multiplayer online game i have ever seen now before you disagree with me or hating me for this p what i describe the best here is the in game community that you won t find in many other online games i know that fallout 76 is not perfect with both good and bad aspects that still having people upset over it but when it come to community fallout 76 community is one of the most friendly helpful and kind while can be funny sometime too d what i love is the in game community that like no other because fallout 76 doesn t encourage you to kill each other steal or take advantage to one and another instead fallout 76 encourage you to work and help each other this is what i love to see in multiplayer games players be friendly to each other and help each other something that you won t expect in these end of the world type of games or any multiplayer games in general p in fallout 76 you will find a dear hearts and gentle people who would help new players or low level players with basic survival items or even the loot ammo and items that would set them off for a very long time at literally everywhere while a strangers that came across you would greeting at you give a thump up to your outfit giving heart to your camp and so on it such a lovely sight to be see in video game not only we just here to have fun but also helping other to have fun as well it become a tradition that now even i would be happy to reach out and help the new player and other players it is the reason why i wrote the best here because i feel like most multiplayer game just encourage you to be the best to win instead of having fun with each other so please give it a try i assure you that you can enjoy the game with both strangers or a group of known friends here i recommend it the game itself when it come to the game itself despite people and fallout fans having the love hate relationship with this game i truly understand the reason yes some can be problematic it not perfect however from my point of view who never was a fallout fan nor like these type of games before i having an enjoyable time in this game with many other aspects that actually fun and wonderful a quick pro and con of what i love in fallout 76pro wonderful scenery of appalachia eventhough it setting in the wasteland world but you can always find a spot that would take your breath away also easy to use photo mode while you can own a little camera to take a picture along your journey as well fashion i just love oldie fashion here theme music cloths outfits and items are very stylish and lovely it also a cosplay heaven if you like to dress in different style and role folklore in west virginia done right mothman flatwood monster grafton monster monongah mine and so on fallout did a good job mixing the real folklore and legend in west virginia into the game perfectly spooky but fun to explore humor dark comedy that let you question your own sanity and simple joke or dialog that can put a smile on your face yes i enjoy the joke from those protectron bots p friendliest hilarious in game community did i mention the community yet p you can find other players trying to help each other and fight at each other to be the one that would drop the loot for some newbie touring each other camp like they never been to any camp before open every door that they can walk to every possible place that can be reach try to communicate with you by sit up wave their gun around and using 5 emotes in 30 second find a way to kill themselves use mini nuke on themselves and teleport to nuke zone when the nuke is about to drop just so their could use the mind blowing emote take a relax swim in high radiation toxic water let themselves burn in a fire so they could use help emote fall to dead from the mountain just so you can revive them to fall down again from another cliff with full intention show off by jumping around as high as possible with their jet pack wearing the fancy power armor and outfit to contest and make fun one and another using fancy emote in a circle like some sort of cult overall it delightful here p con bugs some can be game breaking but simple changing server would fix it some can also be working around in no time still it could troubling you server sometime it went bad and become not responding or unstable and disconnect you however you can try new server or wait it out resources from building to repair it resource junks demanding so you have to always manage your junks resources carefully ammo can be consuming fast as you level up you either have to buy from other or craft it yourself which require a resources as well in the first few 2 3 hours this game quickly catch my attention and became one of my favorite rpg and multiplayer game in just a few day thank to the lovely people who i came across and make it fun for me too d i have to say that shooting and a bit horror kind of game was never a kind of game that i would love but here i am loving it i recommend fallout 76 it a really fun multiplayer game
