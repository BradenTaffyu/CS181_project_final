2016 early access review i loved divinity original sin both in co op and single player the first time i played it was that same feeling in d d when you realise you can do nearly anything divinity original sin 2 carries on this legacy incredibly well already considering it s early state in the short time i ve played i met a host of weird and interesting characters stumbled upon various quests that aren t just in plain site this is the way i love my rpg s this game rewards you for exploring and taking risks just because the odds seem against you does not mean they are as long as you use the environment to your advantage blood puddles on the floor can become electrified to shock people on them you can contaminate them to poison people and use fire to cause poison to combust it s a wonderful game that i feel like will improve on the original in every way once it s finished the early version does contain bugs and is obviously missing many aspects but if you wanna just mess around with builds or the new pvp modes then now is as good a time to jump in as any as long as you realise its not fully fleshed out yet high recommendation from me for all rpg fans youtube video divinity original sin 2 lady vandus awakens 1 views 682 today we jump into divinity original sin 2 from larian studios this game just launched on early access and as a huge fan of the first one i had to jump right in and begin here s some gameplay if you wish to see more and i may consider making this a series with enough interest otherwise i check back every few updates
