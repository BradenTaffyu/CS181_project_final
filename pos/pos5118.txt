2020 this is pretty much my favorite fallout game and below i m gonna explain some of the reasons 1 you can build up your house from scratch and i mean its not like you dont have a limit of buildings per settlement but you can really customize your own settlements and shape them to your liking in most of them 2 graphics are good and there is a lot of details that has improved over the last series the main bashing is the story and the lacking of options to choose during a conversation and i know you wont be able to choose over more options like in the last fallout game but you still do have plenty of dialogue options and a lot of companions there are a reasonable variety of companions and nearly a different companion for every playstyle 3 the mods you can give to your weapon and armor andddd the customization you can give to your power armor 4 some of the dlc is really worth it get far harbor best dlc of this series 5 if you like exploring then this game has a lot to offer and a lot of playtime granted for you while there is some grinding you have to do for some of the major factions and it can get quite boring at times the game itself is really worth it because of the material and the inmmersive story
