i m not a harry potter fan but hogwarts legacy is hands down one of the best games i ve played in a long time the open world design is incredible reminding me of the sense of wonder and freedom i felt when skyrim first came out every corner of the world is filled with detail and the game offers a rich immersive experience that kept me hooked for hours one thing i kept thinking while playing is how amazing this game would be with a co op or multiplayer mode imagine exploring hogwarts with friends tackling challenges together breeding beasts grinding or just roaming the world side by side it would take an already great game and elevate it to a whole new level if you re on the fence because you re not into harry potter don t let that stop you hogwarts legacy is a mustplay for any fan of openworld games it captures that same thrill and excitement that made skyrim a legend and i can t recommend it enough
