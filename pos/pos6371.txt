2020 i recommend this game but understand that it is a very love hate relationship i have over 100 hrs playing and if you like your more serious ww2 cold war games the you ll enjoy it this one to start with the problem lies further into the game once you progress from the noob tier tanks and planes gaijins aggressive buisness model of constantly adding unbalanced premium vehicles to the game that stomp everyone else makes it almost a case of if i don t buy that new vehicle as well i m at a disadvantage and boy will it cost you the mechanics of a realistic and smart game is here but i can t help but feel gaijns greed and unwillingness to listen to what the community wants is the reason why i often find myself playing for a few days after a month away falling back in love with the historical feel of the vehicles a week later i am starting to hate my life again and another few days later i leave the game for another month playing something else oh and russian bias no armour is best armour
