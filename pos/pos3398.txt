2021 i hated undertale it was pretty clearly a game about sexy skeletons i did not care about sexy skeletons i refused to play a game about sexy skeletons then my friend made me listen to the soundtrack and i decided i could deal with a few hours of sexy skeletons if i got to listen to the best video game music i had ever heard while doing it i played undertale it s not a game about sexy skeletons it s a game about choices maybe or morality or curiosity it s a game about pushing the limits it s a game about experiences about what would happen if i did this about storytelling so intricate and complex and raw that it shouldn t be able to fit into seven hours of bullet hell and pixel graphics but somehow it does every choice you make has an impact every object you check has a story the soundtrack the witty yet profound writing the simple pixel graphics and even the menu screens and bullet patterns themselves all intertwine in order to tell a story that only you decide the ending of also the skeletons aren t even sexy my advice to you go in as blind as you can don t read walkthroughs don t watch playthroughs don t prepare yourself don t even look at overviews hell don t even read the steam page description just buy the game and give some well earned money to a little white dog and as it were climb the mountain yourself don t let anyone backseat don t listen to people who tell you there s a right way to play and when you think you ve reached the end just think what other choices could you have made so yes i hated undertale and then i played it
