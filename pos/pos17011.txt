2017 i have been a warhammer fan since i was 7 as a kid in the mid 90 s the amazing world of warhammer fantasy was simply out of my reach financially i had about 20 pewter models and they were not even painted but boy did i cherish them i would stare at the big games workshop catalog in awe dreaming of commanding armies in lush battlefields in total war warhammer i got to play out my childhood dreams of this the world map is massive and as a 40k fan at heart i admit to my ignorance of the new world locales the launch playable races are the lizardmen dark elves high elves and the skaven each of these four factions has two different leaders to choose from as of today on september 28 2017 the large amount of quests missions and side story content some of which is voice acted is very nice albit a little confusing at times currently only vortex mode is out but i believe a sandbox style map will be available in the future unit animations are clearly a step up from the previous title and is quite pleasant to look at during the chaos of battle my only gripe so far is the strange aa effect on the trees in the world map regardless of the setting which is fxaa msaa 2x 4x siege battles which were nortoriously laggy on warhammer 1 seem to be much improved and considerably better looking than the first i even saw some background pillars and arches fall down during the melee fighting underneath them in an elven city my gpu is a 1080 and my cpu is a mid range 4690k 4 6ghz and i pull around 100fps on the world map and about a solid 80 in battles of course this is with everything on ultra and 4x msaa 1080p i really enjoyed the first title and so far i m really enjoying this followup
