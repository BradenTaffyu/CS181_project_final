2016 i ve now around 33 hours in the game and i can proudly say that this game is a very good game i m doing a campaign with friends now and we re having loads of fun talking about the exploration anomalies and the things we do in general i recommend this game because pds did a good job with the sector management empire creator the galaxy shape size and how many ai empires are present a thing to note is that the events content changes regarding to what your ethics are which is a very nice addition so you don t have to read the same all the time when you play another campaign the trade and diplomacy needs some work however but it s not a big let down for the game itself as i m still enjoying it 100 since the first minute i played it
