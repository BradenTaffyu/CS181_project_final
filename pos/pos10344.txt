2020 oh dear under appreciated gem even by me for a long time it can have a terrible first impression but it really grows certainly a brute when it comes to software polishing this is a game that i ve hustled the most to get it going nicely in performance but damn the physics are spot on for what you can feel on real life gt3 races onboard broadcast and the sounds are magnificent in comparison to the digital overload of assetto corsa people say it is the best gt3 sim on the market you can see that brilliance in the game here and there all tracks seems to be laser scanned which is glorious maybe even the cars are laser scanned the level of detail is in line with assetto corsa the ue4 engine is where the weaknesses starts to appear in this make sure you have some graphics not on the lowest or the game will look really bad but in other hand this is the most graphically advanced racing sim out there what has marketed project cars games acc does better but no photomode afaik c f7 key does wonders though use middle mouse to show camera controls this is not for the impatient and if you plan to play with a pad you need to have a long sit through and tweak it out the different steering values if you re going with a wheel you will find an ocean of wheel support and pedals and configurations as the sim was made for this is not for the impatient again because you need to learn if you haven t already with ac to drive safely and respecting your competitors it is an endurance focused simulation and not a 3 lap stint blazing all four wheels and drifting every corner learn to drive smooth it out your aggression have a wonderful race with other people who also loves motorsports a better gt3 racer than assetto corsa would ever be i miss all those contents though edit now with the latest dlc featuring bathurst kyalami suzuka and laguna seca it is glorious
