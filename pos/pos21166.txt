2016 early access review slime ranchera game that full of joy peaceful and happiness once you have played this game all the negative feelings will go away slime rancher is a first person games that letting the player to explore the slime world and find all kinds of slimes and resources gameplaythis is an open world game that includes 4 areas biomes overgrowth dry reef grotto and ranch each realm have it s own special resources and slimes the player will first explore the dry reef until the player obtain a slime key to unlock the other areas there are no goals in slime rancher the player s job is simply upgrad gears rancher facilities plus to learn how to keep slimes from hungry or have an tarr outbreak it s really entertaining to play this game with a rather smooth background music the purpose of this game is just to enjoy and explore step by step pros conspros really cute slimes that drives you nuts excluding the tarr a rather large open world with 3 different sections that you can explore even if you explored the whole world you still want to open the game sometimes to play with your slimes a awesome developer are still working on the game and adding more and more stuff so don t worry about there s not to much element since it s still in early access the slime science update made this game even better and more balanced before that ranchers only need 1 or 2 types of slime to make money since their plorts are much valuable but now you will need all kinds of plorts as the ingredients for the slime science plus you can place your gadgets all over the place not just in your ranch but you ll have to collect some rare resources from drillers or pumps cons so far the only con i can find is about the crystal slime in the newest update sometimes the performance is not so well when you kept too many crystal slimes especially largos their crystals on the ground can often lag my computer i do hope the developer can make it better in the next update generali think slime rancher is suitable for everybody this game is still in early access but the content of this game is already worth the price so go ahead and buy one i promise that you won t regret that 10 10
