2019 early access review this is how i died i m unsure what made me hold off on purchasing this amazing game this is the zombie apocalypse game that i have been yearning for i just wish i knew sooner have you not purchased this game yet do you want to but are holding off until an official release don t let the early access fool you this game is well worth the asking price and then some best to start off with saying this game is not for everyone the simple inclusion of permadeath should make that evident that s what i want though if only more developers had the balls to force permadeath on its players is it hard to lose a character you built up over days or weeks or years of course it is although in my opinion it just makes all the accomplishments that your character achieved and the obstacles they ve overcome that much better perhaps you died of injuries or worst perhaps you succumbed to zombification whatever the case may be and while your character is dead they will forever live on in your memories memories of good times and bad times i don t have a lot of time in game as i write this review only 14 hours what a 14 hours though this game is deep not as deep as the cut i got on my hand from climbing through a broken window though that bled for days i apparently needed stitches after days of tending to my wound with sterile bandages the bleeding finally stopped unfortunately this wouldn t be the last time i cut my hand the next time i was lucky enough to have found a first aid kit by then wouldn t you know it i left it at my safe house that was a fun panicked fueled ride through zombie infested streets as i frantically speed my beat up car homeward disaster adverted phew i would raid nearby houses and stocked up on food water medical supplies and materials the occasional tool here and there you d be surprised how many uses a hammer has during a zombie apocalypse you know what s also useful knowledge you can find book and magazines everywhere some may teach you a crafting recipe some give you an exp bonus when learning a skill others help stave off boredom and unhappiness time to make my safehouse a home i clean up blood spatter with some bleach and towels and burn some zed corpses that have been littering the landscape i got a little braver each day and explored a bit more once i found an infested police station i thought it would be a good time to stock up on ammo and guns entering the building was pretty easy as the zombies already ripped the door off it s hinges unfortunately they never tripped the alarm i did zombies seemed to swarm to my location from blocks away i made a break for the front door phew another disaster adverted all i gotta do is kill a few stranglers near my car piece of cake one of those scratched me though i m prepared this time haha clean the wound and sterile bandages take that scratch i explore the nearby fire department now all the zombies inside went running over to the alarm still blaring at the police station yay i finally found a saw there now i can deconstruct things and improve my carpentry skill head back to my safehouse for some r r make something to eat get supplies put away today was a good day time to get some rest the power went out the water still seems to be working i am super stressed i take some of the meds i found for stress i don t think they are helping thankfully i found a generator and a gas station a few days ago and stocked up i hook everything up and get it going yay my house has power the next day i don t feel so well i m nauseous my scratch is healed though thankfully i get some food in me an do a few chores around the house i take some antibiotics and rest most the day i use this time to read some of the books i ve been collecting i have a fever i m in pain my health deplete a little bit more each day i will not give up not like this i make myself food and rest day 16 i am critically wounded but my body has no injuries i probably just need some meds and rest i can t sleep though because of the pain ah some sleeping pills and pain pills will help hopefully i ll shake off this fever in a few more days i survived for 17 days but ultimately succumbed to the zombie virus when i rose out of bed that day i was no longer human all it took was a simple scratch 10 10 would die from a scratch again
