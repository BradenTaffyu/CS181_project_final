2022 early access review i recommend it but only if you have the intention of modding it the base game is ok i guess my complaints with this game generally boil down to that there are too many types of crafting resources too little inventory space the stacks for items are too small leveling up takes a long time but doesn t feel very rewarding and some of the perks are just straight up not worth it or broken in the sucky way it appears that the health regen perks drain your hunger and thirst quicker while you re regenerating however if you have your max health reduced the game will perpetually attempt to regen your health constantly draining hunger and thirst all the while for some reason hunger goes down faster than thirst in this game even though it would be the opposite irl i recommend mods that increase inventory stack sizes perk points on level up and expand the perks available that should take care of most issues
