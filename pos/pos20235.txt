this is my first owlcat game so i didn t come into this with any huge expectations solid tabletop adaptation with a combat system that eventually does grow on you however you do tend to become very overpowered in the mid to late game traps are often too abundant and just feels like a brainless obstacle to add more content but i m told this is a common owlcat trope takes its wh40k setting seriously and the world feels believable and immersive a lot of people seem to dislike act 3 of the game a classic rpg prison act where you are spirited away without any of your gear and you re separated from your companions but on my second replay i took my time to take in the atmosphere and the storytelling and now i m thinking it s probably the best part of the game on that note the game benefits from one or two replays as if you re going to experience all the companions and story paths the game kind of pushes you into different moral alignments lots of bugs left in there but i didn t encounter anything game breaking or had to reload anything because of them just immersion breaking stuff like referencing or even appearances of characters that were no longer in my party or referencing decisions i didn t make animations in dialogue and cinematics are very lackluster perhaps i m spoiled from playing bg3 voice acting is sparse but good most of the dialogue is just text if anything it makes me interested to try out the table top rpg
