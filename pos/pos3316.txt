2020 absolutely beautiful aside from a couple of quest bugs it was a super smooth experience the game is topnotch when it comes to technical performance loading screens never lasted longer than 15 seconds loading into new areas happened instantly every time great characters great story and such a deep character building and roleplay system that you might as well just start a second playthrough right after the first the final fight was so well done when the music goes into focus and the combat sounds become blurred out i m sure there is a correct term for it that was amazing tbh easy recommendation even for full price i m also surprised the credits are rather short for such a gigantic game great work everyone larian
