2015 this is easily the most recommendable game in my library at the moment obviously if you aren t interested in tabletop games or are of the i rather play with real life friend s crowd it may not be for you but otherwise there is no reason not to be eyeballing this game as a simulator it s quite robust i ve found a few small issues here and there but these are minor and don t really make themselves felt until you ve played for a considerable amount of time 50 hours so far though there hasn t been a game i ve tried to play in tabletop simulator that i was unable to play due to limitations of the simulator and although there are a few games i can think of that would be harder to play in this simulator the vast majority of games play just fine that being said the workshop content of this game is what makes it so recommendable the basic package comes with classic games like chess and checkers but if you delve into the workshop you ll find tons of great games available at the click of a button some copyrighted favorites are regularly taken down due to dmca strikes but plenty are not and plenty of kickstarter backed games allow their games to be uploaded take a gander over to the workshop page for this game and search browse before buying it i m sure you ll find more than a few games you like there lastly this game is great with friends whether they are friends you know in real life or oversea buddies grab a mic and a few friends and start working through that workshop content if you re able to do this i guarantee you ll be happy with your purchase if that s not possible i ve made my way into a few public games and have had a pretty okay experience there many pubs tend to have mics and usually one person is willing to explain to everyone the rules of the current game i ve had my occasional issue with the griefer who comes in and messes with everything but for the most part it s been pretty good plenty of tabletop games have solitaire modes as well so even if playing with friends isn t an option all the time you can always try your hand with solo play i started playing tabletop simulator and i almost never played tabletop games now a half year later since buying it i have 250 non idle hours into this game and i ve tried close to 50 different games out and have had a blast playing them all it s even helped me find a few games that i d definitely like to buy in person for when i do get the chance to play with real life friends get this game it s worth it
