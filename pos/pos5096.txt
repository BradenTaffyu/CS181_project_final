2018 this game is exactly as the world it depicts raw full of problems and charming as the amount of things you can do is overwhelming even if i wish the building part was better designed potentially you can do anything you want but it s so tricky to create exactly what you want that in the end you leave many things started and undone the charging times are exhausting but i ve almost finished everything and i ve played and had fun for more than 230 hours overall it s definitely a yes but in my my i compare it with the witcher 3 and no game is as good as that one
