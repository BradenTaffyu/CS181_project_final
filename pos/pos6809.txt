2018 my 40 ish hours don t do it justice you see i got this game way back when it first released i didn t have a steam account i got the 1 0 version on a disk back then you couldn t remove the speed limiter so this game you could say kick started my love for vehicles of all kinds the sole idea of driving trucks around all day every day doesn t sound particulary fun i ll be honest neither did my 2012 self think so either but i was drawn to this game this was probably my second most played game in 2012 and 2013 overshadowed by minecraft it doesn t really matter what type of computer you played it on either my mother s all in one with a budget amd apu could run this game fine and besides who needs framerate when you re blasting around the european countryside with a heavy trailer so honestly give this game a go get a long distance job and get some of your favourite tunes in the background heck i paid 5 for this game but i would still pay the full 20 if i could oh and the multiplayer mod is 10 10 would try to haul cargo and have a russian completely total your truck again
