2014 early access review updated to 21 for me one of the best racing sims out there definitely recomendable i will make a list of pros and cons list for v0 94 so you can decide for yourself pros best driving simulation i ve ever tried the car is so predictable that you can even go sideways playing with a mouse dont get me wrong you really need a wheel to enjoy this game almost every car is easy to drive in your confort zone try to go above it to earn some tenths and it will become tricky before you lose the control of the car you get a bunch of cars a bit of everything and a few laser scanned circuits we are talking of the closest to reality models you can get on a game here more to come the green hell as dlc in october i think mods with dev tools soon already released mod apps displays corners performance mod sound mod tracks one of high quality already crappy ports too and mod cars soon already released good ones shelby cobra and gp2 small and friendly dev team they ask you answer they give list of wanted cars and traks and you ask they answer if you have some problem game modes im just here for the multiplayer but there is a lot of challenges time atack mode drift and drag mode too multiplayer is enjoyable already you have some jump in and drive servers and more serious onesnow the cons as early access everything works in single player the ai needs a bit of agresivity tuning now avoids you an doesnt defend its position the devs have said to v1 0 there will be 2 sliders for strenth and agresivity multiplayer have some lacks but it was released this friday so it will be better for sure you dont have a massive list of cars like lets say project cars as the time writing is not possible to have another light source than the sun so no night races yet you can race from sunrise to sunset with dynamic time and stuff not weather yet car damage visual and mechanic is not implemented yet seeing the perfection of the grip simulation i m sure it will be top notch tho you will find some idiots on the multiplayer from time to time in open servers but what multiplayer game doesnt have them btw i ve only seen one in 150h the rest is just lack of experience final thoughts if you are still reading this buy it you wont regret it
