2023 published 06 05 2023 00 50 edited 06 05 2023 00 55 my review due to its length will still be modified to remove errors because english is not my main language and it is polish but i tried to write it well i m not a fan of harry potter but the game itself is really good and the world presented is also good the game has a good combat system you can create different builds it is also possible to personalize your hideout you can change the style from gothic to more modern or vice versa you can redo your studios add furniture and carpets there are really a lot of options here for creative people in particular only the music is without soul to me but that s the only downside that i fixed with mods and there are a lot of them i really recommend this game it is maybe not cheap but really good and the plot is really great i really like the story it presents the story can be very dark at times and we have to deal with various morally questionable choices we also have a lot of interesting side missions that complement the whole story the game is really worth to finish it and it s not like the game is for children or a younger audience because we have some negative social phenomena here like slavery work of house elves extreme discrimination and dislike of other races goblins just like that we murder them en masse we kill more goblins than voldemort himself has killed in a lifetime at some moments i had the impression that the purpose of all this is to murder these poor creatures endlessly and the combat system is so well done that is why i was happy to hitting them to the ground burning them blow them up cut them with a cutting spell in a ruthlessly way tortured with a torture spell to inflict pain on them and also i threw them from a height down and so on and you know what i m going to tell you i really enjoyed it and it gave me a lot of sick satisfaction pleasure but after killing about 200 goblins i got used to it so much that it wasn t a big deal to me anymore but still it was fun i will also note that i didn t use the killing spell because its cooldown time was too long and that it was quite boring for me sometimes from time to time i used it just to see it but as a weapon it was weak for me i know exactly what you are thinking now my dear reader reading what i have written here you have the image of a monster a sadist a satanist and someone not entirely mentally sound and here i will surprise you because i am not a monster but a type of a calm man with a master of law degree yes i am something like a future lawyer prosecutor or judge that is a person who has a duty to uphold order law and rules and that s what i do in addition i m an atheist no god and demons only people and their evil the truth is i have my flaws and weaknesses and i won t say that i don t have them but i m rather normal however despite all this i still feel sorry for them because they did nothing wrong and were socially excluded and socially condemned and this gave rise to a flame of hatred in them i really feel sorry for them because unfortunately but nowadays there is so much evil and their case shows what leads to exclusion and condemnation by society i e flames of hatred which can be born in a person or group and this already leads to chaos and even worse things like killing that s why this game has some hidden morals and things that only a careful observer who will want to see it will notice in fact the game has a really interesting message for the player who will delve into the whole story and the world around him in this game if only the player wants to see it he or she will see it therefore i think that the game is rather for an older audience but the young ones will also have fun because the game does not have a specific age group in my opinion and the combat system itself is made in such a way that it is quite sadistic but it is made in such a way that you can t see it and a young player can easily play this game so if you are a parent i think there is no problem with it you can safely let a younger person play this game because the story and its main layer is no dark but these subsequent layers are already dark regarding to the price the length of the game and the overall rating i would like to emphasize that i spent exactly 154 hours with the game and i intend to go through it again i believe that the price and length of the game are adequate because the game is long it has great main and side missions overall the content of the game is well done in addition we also have a lot of mods here and the modding community is really big and from what i ve seen you can really spice up the game in an interesting way e g playing fully as yenefer character s outfit and appearance and so on because there s a lot more mods optimization worked well for me and i didn t have any major problems with the game so everything was ok but i know some people had problems my rating for this game is 9 10 why because i had a great time for 154 hours and was not bored at all and by the way i faced interesting moral choices and got a nice ending but for me maybe too short
