2020 product received for free early access review lots of fun play with friends i say this because it s infinitely funnier when one of them inevitably stands in front of the television for thirty irl minutes straight training skills all while you re out adventuring and being productive that s right screw you anti i didn t need your help anyways the only con to this game is that you cannot open canned foods with a knife or rock it angers me to a level none of you will comprehend i don t quite think you realize how much is pisses me off when my character perfectly capable putting two motors together to make a car or house but somehow can t find the iq to take a knife and just wedge it under the lid do none of the cans have a pull tab like is this game just set in the 1700s obviously not you have things like cars and industrial freezers but canned foods why not just put a pull tab on them literally the only canned food i can find with a pull tab is sardines which are sort of known for that all other food comes in a jar twist it off a packet open it or a can pray to god you find that one can opener in the kitchen to all of the people who will inevitably say wow dessy can t you just get a can opener they re not even that heavy shut the up i will open the cans how i want to open the cans i will not settle for a 3 and a half pound utensil to get a 32 oz can of peas open i will use a carving knife or if available nodachi long sword i will tear the thing in two until i get the food i want because i refuse to go with the flow and use the most straightforward method what is also quite troubling is that you can t open them on the concrete either if you haven t heard of this i ll tell you basically if you don t have utensils or tools and you need to get some canned food open rub it the top against concrete rock then squeeze the body and pop off the lid you don t wanna make it like pour out onto the ground but you do wanna give yourself some leeway but i guess this makes sense because my character can t figure out how to put a sharp object under the lid of their eventually life saving sustenance jar do you under stand how annoying it is when i m sitting there about to starve to death and my character just does not understand how to use a baseball bat to open their canned food but it s messy who gives a i m about to starve to death i wouldn t give a if i made a mess trying to feed myself if it meant staying alive but you d just lose food do i care i want to get food at least some some food is better than no food this turned into something of a rant i have decided to myself and then post this guide i will never use a can opener for food again i will use a nodachi and or fire axe combo edit towers fall civilizations live to build high crumble to the ground and decades pass as the flow of time stays ever steady i have come with great news my friends you can now open canned foods with various tools usually a kitchen or butter knife and as such it is time to rejoice this is a monumental day in history
