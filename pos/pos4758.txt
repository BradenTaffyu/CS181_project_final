2021 finally after 5 years i finished this game i got to say that i mostly played it like any other bethesda game i enjoyed the world itself and avoided the main story like the plague and i must admit that it was worth it playing this way by the end of the game when i started to get into the main story i was already level 105 this game does make you feel powerful and it allows you experiment with the craziest of builds the settlement building system takes away a lot of your time and the gameplay loop grind might not be your cup of tea but i enjoyed every bit of it the strongest part for me is the companions they are very well written the way how they react to the story and environment was great combat is also something that i enjoyed more than the previous fallout games the guns actually feel powerful and feel like they pack a punch the weakest part was that the game stands nowhere near the depth of fallout new vegas and the dlc s were quite disappointing also the final chapter of the game was something that i did not fully enjoy even though siding with the brotherhood was the option that i enjoyed the most overall the game is great if you enjoy huge open world games and settlement management if you are looking for something similar to fallout new vegas i would just recommend replaying new vegas again
