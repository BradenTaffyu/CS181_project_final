2020 ats review this is the second simulation game i have played after the ets euro truck simulator 2 and not gonna lie its very good and nice game starting from the mechanics to execution its been perfect for me for killing my time chilling and enjoying quality time along with music gameplay gameplay wise its pretty good cruise through driving with beautiful land of america give a glance to different mountains bridges tunnel sitting from the comfort of your home take a virtual tour of different states and pass your quality time to give your journey more enjoyable i suggest to keep the radio on for making your journey more enjoyable with live traffic updates latest music announcements events and so on its truly mesmerizing settings graphics and controls well when you launch ats it launches with default settings but you can customised it to your wish say like graphics texture models etc you can customised your graphics on what your computer fits in say even you have a very low configuration pc you can still run it based on the graphics you have you can also customised in game settings like weather traffic etc to make your gameplay however you feel like experiencing control wise you can connect external driving set to make your game more realistic however default controls of w a s d and gear adjustments of the vehical you drive is already available by default instruction for 1st timers based on my experience i suggest this is a very good game to start your simulation carrier with buy this game during sales at it comes around 60 75 off during those time start with some basic bundles like black sea bundle and some customizable dlc s and get your hands on then once you are familiar then go for other ones once you start the game make sure to link it to your world of truck account otherwise external contracts wont work in game make sure to check that as your progress get sync with it if you get disconnect in between don t worry as the progress gets auto saved and you will start from where you got disconnected check the basic configuration once as preference for different people varies if you get stuck anywhere don t hesitate to ask scs and community because it has an excellent people who back you up community well community for scs is huge and hence if you get stuck anywhere just see the guides present in steam or ask scs in twitter facebook and other platform and you will get help in jiffy tips never miss any new operation or events because it is the most fun and enjoyable time as more people play during it also free inventory items also can be credited your steam inventory if you finish certain task which is available only during this time overall in my opinion just go for this game you will surely enjoy and have fun thanks for reading
