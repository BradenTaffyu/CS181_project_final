2017 this is proof that a good gameplay will keep you in the game even if the graphics aren t good i just got severely addicted to this game even though it s frustrating at first you don t know what to do and keep dying to 80 men armies once you get the hang of it it ll be a really fun experience making you jump from the chair whenever you fight army vs army or siege a castle a city or fight kings and the accomplishment of beating a army with only your companions and yourself there are the tense moments when a huge army faces off against you you are cornered the calm moments and those where you are soo excited with the battle you actually do something wrong and lose everything feeling in despair only for you to go out and reconstruct your army i have some tips for new players if you want to have a good time on the game fight in tournaments bet on yourself beat everyone down as fast as you can seriously you can make something close to 4k of denizens in just one tournament which may help you buy that armour or weapon you wished for soo much or the companion in that tavern ah companions if a companion is specialist in something focus on that trust me you won t regret it specially after you have lots of companions get a horse a two handed weapon a shield to cover your back and a ranged weapon for emergencies don t bother picking the fastest horse armour over everything but still get a fast horse because the faster you are the more damage you do and don t forget to move around so the enemies can t strike you and take care of one by one recommended to have a bow though with these tips here you can make your way to beating a 40 man army solo or with the help of your companions even if they ll keep falling in battle the graphics in the game may not bid well for many people but don t let that fool you that graphics isn t the most important thing but the incredible combat system it has instantly putting you in excitement when facing 3 enemies at the same time and being cornered having to find a way to kill them all by finding which direction they won t block just like for honor but better no lock on system necessary and if you re gonna try multiplayer i hope you do your training well because if you don t most players will beat you down incredibly easy or snipe a headshot outta nowhere i can just say i love this game now 33 hours well spent and still counting after this review just don t take it to heart
