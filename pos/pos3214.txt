2019 i don t remember the last game that made me start a new run just after completing the first one and sure enough i had missed a lot on that first run the sheer amount of content is pretty insane and there s usually multiple ways to achieve the same goal which is something i love in games also i m not at all a fan of tactics style games but the battle system didn t bother me one bit as you learn the mechanics it all feels pretty fluid and rewarding another positive is the spell system which allows for you to build a character exactly how you want the only restriction of course being the amount of points you have to distribute and even that can be altered by mods tried that on the second run i m not exactly the biggest fan of the story but it is by all means serviceable it also gets a lot more interesting as you progress overall a safe bet for rpg enthusiasts update the addition of a launcher annoys me
