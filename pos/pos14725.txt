2018 i honestly dont agree with all the negative revieuws on here regarding the game im staying away from the spyware ones because i don t care the negative reviews about the game almost held me back from buying it i ve played civilization iv and v for a long time and hoped this game would bring me something new but also gave me that nostallgic feeling that i get when i play civ that absolutely happened with the new districts you can specialize your cities even more than in civ 5 because be honest when you just build every building you can in civ 5 nothing will go wrong and with city s that can do anything and everything winning is easy in civ 6 you don t get acces to some of the buildings because you didn t unlock the right district shame on you for making a mistake this makes city planning more important and crucial to win a game i did nt really care for the spy s in the game until i noticed how easy it is to siphon funds from others into your account money makes the difference it really adds something in the game also i really like the ai with their open and hidden agenda s even though i somethimes think the hate towards me is kinda hard yes i took your city but only because you declared an suprise war on me and pillaged my whole country its fair pay and also happened more than 700 years ago for christ sake it makes frends more valuable because the one or two you can get will be useful in trade in the other comments i read that the focus is more and more on the armies and fighting but for me it did nt feel that way i tend to keep small armies with one combined three star unit in every city and can defend properly the warmongering penalty can really ruin your game at least for my personal playstyle focused on science and trade tl dr awesome game
