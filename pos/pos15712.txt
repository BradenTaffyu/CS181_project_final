2021 early access review this a pretty decent aim trainer for an early access game it already has a good amount of content on top of that it has a lot of settings that you can mess with so you can have a similar experience as if you are playing the game you are training for hope they can add more tasks in the future as there are still a limited amount of them but it s already enough for you to start practicing if you really want to get better at fps games you should create a daily routine of aim training something around 1 hour per day if you follow strictly your routine you will start feeling the differences overall a very good game aim trainer will be looking forward for more updates also i use this to practice r6
