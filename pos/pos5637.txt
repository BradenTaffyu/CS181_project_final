2021 early access review this game is hard for me to rate after years of early access it is still a buggy unfinished mess development is extremely slow feels like it is being done by one guy in his spare time a lot of effort seems to be put into balancing multiplayer despite core features not even being implemented or polished yet leaving balance changes pointless and quickly obsolete anyway each new update also seems to bring new bugs with it that linger for months without fixes the new story mode is extremely simple and only add annoyances to the gameplay at its core the game is just the same game that they have released several times already just with a new coat of paint but the gameplay it just works and it is damn addictive just like the previous games i can easily get lost for weeks just playing around in the sandbox singleplayer world playing around with different builds combining different troops and tactics joining and taking over different factions if you are thinking of buying it maybe wait for a sale or pick up mount and blade warband for a bargain try it out for a bit if you like it you will like this game too like i said it is essentially the same game with a few new features and graphics and be ready to having to use mods to unlock the full potential spare time modders will often fix things in days which takes the official devs months or years at this point i kinda hope the devs just completely stop developing the game so it won t keep breaking mods for pointless tiny updates and so modders could get on with more ambitious mods and conversions like we had with warband it is an aquired taste if the core gameplay clicks with you you can easily get over the mountains of jank and unfinished stuff and the work effort required for installing mods
