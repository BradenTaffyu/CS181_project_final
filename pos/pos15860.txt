2023 this game is so great i can t believe i m saying this but this was the best game i played this year why is pressure washing this much fun pros a hilarious story arc that embraces the metalogic of video games in general it is extremely satisfying to pressure wash all the dirt i have the occasional urge to pressure wash random things in town now the reward dings are on point though i am sure this is how rats in weird experiments are trained to finish mazes the game mechanics are smooth and you level up your pressure washer enough that i didn t get tired of the grind the volcano multiplayer mode is really fun the dlcs are actually legit expansions of the game and not just a special new hat pay attention to the achievements because they kind of make it a little more fun to beat levels in a different way cons default view quickly gave me motion sickness and i couldn t continue but once i figured out that you could fix the camera to one spot and then clean and that helped alleviate the issue for me
