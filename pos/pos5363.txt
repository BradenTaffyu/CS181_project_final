2022 early access review i stand near a small pond of water in it swims a madpole fish whos jaws take at least half of it s body i m waiting for it to swim to me so it would bite my limbs off so it does i m losing my left arm the right one then face i have no fear that s not the first limb i lost and considering that my next destination is lost ruins full of rusty sawblades that will not be my last meanwhile with another bite fish chopes my head off i decide to retreat and heal myself such wounds would be fatal to most but luckely i have a spare head on my back two if you count a sensatory ganglion as one it could certainly act as one if needs be i make a campfire and cook a healthy meal out of my severed body parts and a drop of healing juice not only will it sate my dropping hunger but it will also boost my maximum hit points as well as give me a chance to regenerate a good chunk of it on taking damage i return to the fish and wait for it to bite more of my limbs why am i doing that you see i was born with hooks instead of my feet although theyare mildly useful in a fight but they also prevent me from wearing any boots and with horns on top of my head that prevents me from wearing helmet and quills all over my body that prevents me from using armor i m quickly running of spaces on my body to actually wear any protection but there s cure get your feet amputated regrow them with a healing tonic though i don t need one since my body naturaly regenerate lost appendages and you ll be able to wear boots one more meanwhile i ve spent nearly ten minutes sitting next to this pond and clicking skip turn so that damn fish would finaly bite my feets of yet it doesn t i m getting impatient i m clicking skip turn button faster and faster wanting to be finaly free from this torture until i see it take my second head away i check my status and i see that my first head is yet to regenerate i m down to my last head i try to move away but the fish restrains me from moving another bite and it takes my feet off i do not care since i m suddenly ended up in a mortal danger i try to attack it but only hand i have left is equiped with glowsphere which does only one damage to the fish another bite my last head is off despite heaving full hp i m dead nobody can live without at least one working head my hubris in the face of the monster that was at least 10 levels lower then i am was my undoing i lost 8 hours on this run yet i regret nothing it was fun
