2017 if you re looking for that next great game to play you ve found it undertale is a game that at first i did not enjoy in fact i quit playing for a while because i simply could not understand what this game was trying to be the graphics looked terrible compared to the triple a titles i was used to however i got past that and gave the game more time and eventually i had beaten one of the endings months passed and i got back in on a whim i decided to play without killing anybody despite my attitude of kill or be killed i wont spoil anything but what i can say is that this game made me laugh and i had a good time sure but more than that it made me think undertale made me level up as a person if you re looking at this game and think it just isnt the kind of thing i m into i urge you to reconsider and experience this gem of a game it will give back what you put into it 10 10
