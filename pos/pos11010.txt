2023 product received for free tl dr i don t have to have amazing fps just in case the policeman comes around the corner and shoots at me until they make a mod for that as you see i ve been playing for a number of hours and honestly i m not having serious problems at this moment 26 oct 2023 i m having a little stuttering and lod issues but it s being worked on as we speak at maximum settings and a city with 100k people which comes in at 30fps close up 40 far away sure i have a good computer i9 13 gen 4070ti but i m so busy keeping up with all the new mechanics on managing the city that s what the game is all about right city management and that s what really distinguishes this game from cs1 this is a very rich deep simulator i can understand the frustration if you re new to cities skylines but if you ve been with cs1 since the beginning you know this isn t the final show i expect the evolution of the game to be similar to cs1 which experienced massive changes and improvement it doesn t even look like the same game remember things like cartoony graphics and the wonky mod less road tools back in 2015 we didn t even have nighttime always noon if one thing is true colossal order paradox work hard on their games for a very long time after publishing i expect this to continue that well established tradition you can certainly hold off on your purchase if you wish but keep it in mind because there is undoubtedly much excitement to come hang in there friends and hold on to your hats
