2018 stellaris was lacking in the mid game department made playthroughs rather similar because of the way games developed and made even the largest galaxies feel small because travel times were so fast which made the doomstack problem worse since a single massive fleet could respond to an attack nearly everywhere the creating of space terrain via making all ftl travel in the early game based off hyper lanes think eve s stargate system minus the physical gates themselves and significantly slowing down force projection because travel is significantly slower makes for a much better strategy game you actually need to think about your flanks and use more than one fleet to defend your borders the new mechanism for system control and moving some of the economy to star bases is also a very welcome change as is the ability to build well defended space stations there are far more ways to play now and the weapons and ship module rebalance redesign is quite welcome to make a larger amount of ship builds viable unfortunately in a rather paradoxian way there are bugs most of them are not game breaking but some can be very annoying thankfully stellaris is trivial to mod so things like reducing war exhaustion is something you can easily tweak yourself or get one of the million mods that do it already the changes in 2 0 make the game significantly better than it used to be but definitely not less buggy it will require a couple of hotfixes to resolve some of the nastier issues marauders are op the spectral wraith going on a rampage is a menace when it just smashes everything in its path at 2230 and you just don t have the fleet power to deal with it and the new fleet designer is some of the worst ui ever devised but is entirely ignorable until fixed overall stellaris 2 0 is a much better game than all of its previous iterations and in my opinion by far but just like the previous iterations it is not flawless still i highly recommend it
