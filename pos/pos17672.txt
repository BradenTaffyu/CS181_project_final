2016 absolutely solid 9 5 10this game is just great really great smooth release no gamebreaking bugs so far stable as hell and fun as hell each faction feels drastically different a nice breath of fresh air compared to before where you d get a lot of recycled units and factions with slight differences the rpg like effect of the heroes and the quests are an amazing edition and i really hope they stay committed to it for the next total war as a friend of mine said imagine being able to play as the romans and dealing with political intrigue with quests and stuff ca have proven that they will listen to us the supporters and buyers and have pretty much fixed everything that people complained about in rome 2 and attila especially the nonsensical aspect where you d get punished for building high tier buildings good bad news no squalor some aspects of the game have been casualized a bit but it s easy to get into and just man it s just great i d say it s the best total war game since shogun 2 if you re new to total war or new to warhammer don t feel threatened it does both franchises justice
