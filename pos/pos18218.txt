early access review quoting the famous roman general and statesman julius caesar veni i camei came to expect manor lords as a run of the mill real time strategy rts game vidi i sawi saw as i played the said game that it was the cream of the crop here is why i think it is 1 featuring immersive experience graphics where you feel that you are indeed in the time period you can walk around your created reality enjoy the breeze of the wind hopefully visit your church local pub and market place buzzling with citizens 2 it is a unique sandbox game where you can freely curve roads alter the size of houses farms and pastures and craft a town worth living and protecting 3 as for the economy the law of supply and demand applies in this game let s say that you are producing goods in abundance and likely you would sell a lot of it too the value of said goods changes as you sell export more then the value decreases and vice versa when you are importing 4 as the arrows fly while the swords and shields clash the battle mechanics are quite interesting formations and strategies greatly impact how and who will fell in the battlefield the soldiers morale and stamina affects the outcome of the battle as well as the terrain where the battle took place oh i almost forgot militias and mercenaries are a thing i also saw on the part of the crops that as it is in early access some features are lacking in regards with variety of units like siege equipment manor layout and imagine the wonders of castle design while we are on the talk of crops in the case of the planting ai pathing and automated farming being only harvested once per year and losing all the hard work due how the system game works make some peasants riot finally since it has rng starting map you end up restarting a few times to get a great start but in some regard i think the developer has this in his mind and back pocket as you may have heard this indie game is from the passionate work of a true manor lord dedicating his life to bring forth another life worth playing and investing into vici i conqueredi conquered all the lands and achievements for now as well as all the different modes and setting being passionate in medieval days i took it to heart to accomplish these amazing feat regards your humble manor lord
