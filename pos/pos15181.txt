2020 i finally found a drift game i can relax in and enjoy myself okish physics solid graphics and tracks and of course now cross platform pc xbox ps4 i can put on my drift playlist and leave a trail of smoke around the track with friends and not have to fight the car and sit back slide i played this game for a while on mobile and when i heard it was coming to pc i had to get it and was skeptical at first but the devs did patches for physics and controllability graphics and sounds i recommend this game for all newcomers for drifting and even veteran drifters if you want to relax and catch some doors this game has great customization and designing ability for the paint booth and even better mods from the workshop to apply and make the game even better
