2021 early access review great game but fruit me running the grammar is horrific the moment i was given the decision to pick between chinese english i knew i was in for some garbage translations even the narrator of the tutorials reads the trash grammar verbatim few research descriptions are without errors while some i cant understand at all i won t give this game a negative review based on my own grammar nazi tendencies as it s surprisingly polished and nicely combines aspects of a number of my favorite games but the grammar kills me if the devs see this please reach out i ll correct the sad effort at american english please
