2022 i m 81 y o veteran with commodore 64 computer and my grandson bought this game to play with well you know finally able to buy it with the sale it s a good game aoe titles annoyingly focus on ranked matches a lot but i m a casual skirmish player yet it s fine i enjoyed the graphics unit animations and models are good needs more nations for sure it is one big negative side of the game haven t played any campaign yet intermediate difficulty is good way to start for an old age of empires players also loved the new big walls hooray castle defense
