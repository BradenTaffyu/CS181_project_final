2021 i m not sure how many people will read this review but after playing this game i knew i had to write one i ve played earthbound mother 3 undertale oneshot yume nikki corpse party and other indie rpg maker games but this game tops all of them for me i love all of the games i listed previously deeply but despite them being as great as they are this game has managed to become my favorite of all time this game does a great job at hiding whats to come at the beginning and i thankfully experienced it completely blind because wow is it insane it really reminds me of earthbound because of how crazy the ending is but it keeps you guessing at when you ve reached it because once you think you re almost there it surprises you and keeps making things interesting without going into detail the ending and the parts leading up to it manage to top all of the rpg s i ve played before it hitting you with an insane mind that had me completely shocked again imagine the fight with giygas from earthbound but much much much worse or better in a way then assuming you are on the true ending it literally hits you dead in the heart pun intended and had me on the verge of tears this game is a lot longer than i thought it would be and i have yet to complete the secret ending and get all the achievements but it s been an absolute pleasure to play the entire time since you never know what you ll encounter next you can really tell how this game was influenced by earthbound undertale and yume nikki and that s gotta be one of my favorite parts about it because i love all of those games this game deserves your attention and if after all i ve said you re still not convinced that you should experience this masterpiece of a game for yourself then by all means watch a let s play on it even though you should experience it for yourself by actually playing it if that s what works for you then do it i don t care how you do it but please don t sleep on this game or give up on it i promise you that this game is worth it tldr the game is good buy it and you ll see what i mean
