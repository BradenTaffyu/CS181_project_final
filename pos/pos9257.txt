2017 this is without a doubt the most fun most interesting and most immersive space 4x game ever made and has a lot of potential to become even better in future updates stellaris has nearly infinite replayability incredibly immersive emergent storytelling a vibrant modding community and gives players a lot of choices in how they want to run their interstellar state that being said it s not really worth 40 so you re better off getting it and the dlc leviathans and utopia are the only dlcs worth buying at the moment while they re on sale additionally the game isn t without its flaws so i ll list a few here there are some pretty glaring bugs that aren t game breaking or big issues but the fact that they re there is pretty annoying in the classic paradox fashion the devs have made some truly bizarre and nonsensical gameplay decisions in the name of balance pirate bases i mean the ones that exist from the start of the game not the reasonable ones that are spawned through event later on and space monsters the leviathans from the dlc are actually pretty cool i mean the generic space monsters aren t fun or challenging in any way they re just frustrating to have to expend resources and time to deal with diplomatic actions are kind of limited and arbitrary and the diplomatic ai can be really stupid at times also there still is no option for federations to centralize into a single unified state which you would think be their main selling point but at current federations are just glorified unilateral alliances with a few bonus modifiers attached the galaxy settings are rather limited and the largest map size feels far too small mid late game crises are cool but i wish they were more varied massive empires are way too stable separatist factions only very very rarely actually succeed in seceding governments stay in power for absurdly long periods of time and there are no coups or civil wars adding more mechanics and fixing ones that are already in place to cause large states to easily fall apart the more massive and heterogeneous they get would go a long way towards making the game more dynamic and unpredictable
