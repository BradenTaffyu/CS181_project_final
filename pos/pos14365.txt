2022 early access review absolutely fantastic this is my first factory game and i find it both relaxing and challenging the music is immersive the universe is beautiful and most of all the whole game seems to be very lightweight running incredibly smoothly despite taking up such a small footprint on my pc storage for a game developed by such a small studio this is something that should be envied by aaa studios who are still turning out buggy and unpolished games 6 stars and i can t wait to see where this game ends up
