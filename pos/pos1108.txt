2021 early access review at first i thought that this game could be summed up in that it was all about learning from different mistakes scavenging for food and tools at the beginning and forget to search the area for zombies you d learn to not make that mistake pretty quick managed to slap a functioning base together with only one way in or out you might not have a problem for a few in game days but the one time a horde of zombies stops you from leaving again to get more resources would mean next time you d be sure to have another way out made it to an endgame state but forgot to check your crops for disease for a little too long hoping to get a new set of crops to grow up enough before winter so you don t slowly starve means you ll be pretty diligent about checking if you survive once you play enough make enough mistakes and learn from them you can figure out how to be pretty much untouchable by the horde that roam the outside world but there s one thing that you ll probably never learn to overcome boredom at the end of the road high on your untouchable throne you ll eventually get bored of just simply keeping your characters basic needs fulfilled you might start a building project or decide to expand your base borders or just go cull the zombie population a bit and so you ll descend to earth once again assured that you ve finally learned from your mistakes but they will be waiting because it turns out this game isn t about learning from your mistakes it s about learning patience and about how no matter how much patience you have they have more
