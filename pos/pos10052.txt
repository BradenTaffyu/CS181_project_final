2018 pros great time sink a lot of workshop content watching your people is extremely entertaining selective story amazing gameplay cons no proper multiplayer additional personal opinioni don t even know where to start there s tons of different ways to play this game i find this game to be extremely addictive and the replayability is unending would you like to care for a small group of settles or a lone survivor or maybe you just want them all to suffer a miserable death if that wasn t enough there s also hundreds if not thousands of superb mods available conveniently through the workshop i ve never been much for this particular type of games but man this is gold you must give it a chance
