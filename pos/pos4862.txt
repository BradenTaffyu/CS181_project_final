2023 here in my settlement just bought this new t51 b power armor here fun to wear around in the commonwealth but you know what i like more than armor bobbleheads in fact i m a lot more proud of this bobblehead stand i installed to hold these two new bobbleheads i found it wasn t that long ago that i was in a little neighborhood across the state sleeping on a cot with only 47 caps in my pocket but you know what something happened that changed my life i bumped into a settler and then another settler and a few more settlers i bumped into 5 settlers and they told me what they do to survive in the wasteland again it s not just about the armor it s about the good life health caps bobbleheads and happiness
