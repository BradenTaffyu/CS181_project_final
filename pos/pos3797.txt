2023 do i like this game i believe my hours shows i do i ve played it through 4 times writing this review well that s a lot of course but for me totally worth it and since you can put together your team s in so many ways and give each character so many different roles actually four times isn t that much did it take me 500 hours to do that nah i tested out a lot of things played it from a lot of angles and i simply hated the idea of the game ending why not because it is xcom or ff tactics or homm to mention some beloved titles for most tb fans it isn t at all but it has the same feel to it the same turn based relaxing but at the same time challenging feeling it makes me want to try it all and there is a lot to try so what will you get playing sow probably everything a turn based tactics addict wants and love the story it s ok and it makes you want to know what happens next some people say the story isn t important but it is for me or i personally would not be playing i like the story and i like the main characters they were each given a unique personality i found that intriguing and there are romance a guy named cetiraliss seems to have the most helpful review here on steam and i quote him because he said it perfectly quote this game makes you think especially on warlord mode you have to plan not only your movements on the battlefield but your squads and their compositions items skills etc there are a lot of possibilities so you can mix and match as you see fit and also try things out in the arena quote end i want to add this game has you think and is fun in every difficulty i actually suggest you play it on the easiest at first or at least the first 12 quests a couple of quests can be rather challenging if you want all achievements is there anything i don t like no only that it ended i can hardly wait for the dlc
