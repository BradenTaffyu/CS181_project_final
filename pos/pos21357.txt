2022 physics can be good in a game but it can also cause bugs but tabs uses its bugs for how the game works and even has a free dlc called the bugs dlc and this makes it a amazing game plus the different factions and maps its price is a little bit too high i think that it could be 15 or 10 dollars instead of 20 but overall this game is good
