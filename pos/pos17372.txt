2019 i always wanted a three kingdoms total war ever since playing shogun 2 and being obsessed with romance of the three kingdoms games and dynasty warriors etc the game mostly met my expectations and i loved it probably the most fun on a historical title i have had diplomacy is king in this game there are more options in this game than other total wars my favorite character is cao cao who can initiate proxy wars and thus can snidely weaken an ally you plan to backstab by forcing them into a war very much something the actual cao cao would do also funny that the ai seems to have similar behavior ai cao cao seems to love making friends with me only to turn around and kick me out of the alliance and hide behind my enemy when the time suits him combat is fun but i had a hard time getting into it and i think i mostly fell out of playing the game because was burnt out on the repetition after playing several factions i felt like i was doing the same strategies and compositions for them all i rarely strayed outside of the basic units and the trebuchet and archers seemed to do most of the work have some good cavalry and heroes and the battle is pretty much won however the game has updated several times since i last played maybe it has been re balanced to be more interesting now i like that the game is split between a historical and romance mode heroes are more like their portrayals in the novel and dynasty warriors in romance mode where they are capable of slaying hundreds if not thousands of troops on their own and may engage in one vs one duels with other generals these duels can be pretty interesting and strategic when they work when i played some people used mods to make duels always accepted since the ai liked to refuse them when they knew they would lose can use a general that is meant to stall to duel and waste another general s time instead of them plowing through your men or can use an expert duelist who is able to assassinate general after general on the battle field and quickly rout the enemy as the chain of command vaporizes before them overall fun game and really fun entry i plan to play again when the burnout wears off and am looking forward to see what has been improved in updates even if minor quality of life changes the game did a great job at inspiring me to live and breathe ancient china i went on a binge through the three kingdoms show and many wikipedia entries after playing the game
