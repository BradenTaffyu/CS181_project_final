2020 this game is simply amazing the writing is good and the rpg elements are extremely good all the dlc are simply breathtaking and replay value is outstanding and that doesn t even include the amazing modding community for this game my only issues with this game is the fact that even to this day there are a lot of bugs that require modding the game with unofficial patches from the community the graphics don t hold up that well to games today without modding and the gunplay is clunky although on the plus side there are so many weapons to play with in this game but other then that this is a must have game with writing and memorable factions and characters that still holds up to this day
