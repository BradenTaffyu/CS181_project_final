2022 early access review the idea to bring factorio style gameplay to a galactic scale is amazing this makes researching upgrades meaningful since not only are you awarded through new buildings you re also upgrading your mech for more efficient interstallar travel finding rare resources in outer space travelling tens of lightyears and thinking ahead bringing with you an inventory filled with the correct items and materials to setup a self sufficient mining colony is immensely satisfying in contrast to this making the dyson sphere is kind of meh if it had more functions than giving energy things might be different still it looks cool and you can always build multiple dyson spheres currently the weakest part of the game is the endgame there should be more to the dyson sphere there should be lategame super important cool items that require turning entire planets into factories just to make that one specific item there should be automation available in the form of bots ultra lategame options for sending pre programmed bots to convert planets into factories there should be a way to manipulate stars altering their power output or creating other sorts of anomalies there should be exotic ways to harness black holes in some way and the very endgame should have the map expand into an infinite universe where the player realizes they will never have enough time to colonize everything only to discover one last technology to be researched which allows for swarms of interstellar bots to convert planets into factories en masse ah a man can dream dso much potential but the game s great in its current form too i just wish it had more automation options for more massive scale
