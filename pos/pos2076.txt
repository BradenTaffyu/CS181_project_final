2021 a long time ago back in 2013 when i first played the game i was so impressed i always wished me a star wars game like this and they did everything right they always supported the game never stopped and even still there are new storys comming out but back to the old times where pvp pve and rp servers were when people camped on tatooine to kill each other just hilarious but all the single storys of every class is such a love in work and then the lovely expansions rise of the hutt cartel dont mess with the huts just what im saying also galactic starfighter was a great expansion when it came out unfortunately nowadays nobody is playing it anymore when galactic strongholds came out it was such a dream to get your own stronghold in star wars but then the first really great story expansion came out shadow of revan against revan the legendary jedi master after all you ended in knights of the fallen empire and knights of the eternal throne where you have to prove how strong you really are against everyone and everything and then the old republic onslaught came out with the return of a great sith couldn t imagine that he would ever appear again and now legacy of the sith is coming really looking forward to it such a lovely game bioware really know how to create a mmorpg
