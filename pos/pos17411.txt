2019 total war three kingdoms is a culmination of all the experiments made in the last few years with the series since rome 2 total war has struggled to find it s footing in it s historical titles attila had a lukewarm reception and thrones of britannia used the same engine while not providing a whole lot of new content aside from a change in factions and a few tweaks to gameplay over the years attila and rome 2 have both received numerous post launch updates changing many of the ways of how the game was originally played and for the better the other big thing to happen to total war in recent years was warhammer the fantasy based total war game breathed new light into the franchise and introduced some of the the most ambitious gameplay changes to the series while being well received critically and by players some total war fans were worried that this new title focusing on big heroes magic and myth would overshadow the historical titles in the future which brings us to three kingdoms the romance of the three kingdoms is a sprawling novel focusing on the turbulent years towards the end of the han dynasty and the three kingdoms period in chinese history starting in 169 ad and ending with the reunification of the land in 280 the novel features many outstanding characters and draws from the history of china to tell a story about the unification of china and the grand people behind it all all this combines to give us a historical title with aspects of myth and fantasy woven into it total war three kingdoms combines all the lessons learned from previous total war games and combines them into one it s best historical titles in a long time offering two distinct ways to play the game romance mode a focus on the larger than life characters big heroes that can change the tides of battle engage in duels and are an army of one battles are usually faster with a bigger focus on using your characters abilities records mode a focus on tactics and the traditional total war experience characters are accompanied by a unit of bodyguards and don t wield the strength as they do in romance mode battles are typically slower where positioning and pacing is more important each play mode has it s own distinct feel but given this game s importance in characters i have opted to play the game initially in romance mode as for the game itself it is laser focused on depicting it s source material and setting with lavish colours sweeping landscapes and a suitable soundtrack and audio the added touch of chinese language is nice as well and probably appreciated by anyone playing in china as well each faction has a host of characters and rulers that all have different goals and ambitions in unifying china from scholars and healers to veterans and warlords keeping all these archetypes happy within your kingdom is of grater importance in this title than many previous titles as well all your characters have likes and dislikes and personality traits that will effect their standing with your leader as well as the other characters of your court if relationships sour too far you may be looking at a potential new enemy on the battlefield not only will the character leave your service he may take his armies with him additionally all your characters have a skill tree and inventory to invest in as well as you fight and administer your regions they will gain experience and items that further increase their strengths as well as their dedication to you and your cause the emphasis on characters relations and diplomacy actually feel like a fundamental part of the game now as opposed to it feeling optional or a non important in previous titles new features aside game has had one of the smoothest launches of any total war title and appears to be better optimized than the warhammer titles the campaign is sprawling but the game will keep doling out quests and missions for you to keep you focused on smaller goals while trying to paint the map with the colour of your faction out of all the total war games released over the years three kingdoms is a landmark title that will probably appease older fans and appeal to newer fans as well tl drtotal war three kingdoms is a fantastic game that takes the best parts of total war games over the last decade and creates something truly entertaining
