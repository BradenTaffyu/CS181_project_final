2020 when you gaze long into the abyss the abyss gazes also into you friedrich nietzsche some people may have told you that stardew valley is a chill game about farming and making friends someone might have told you that this is an easy going relaxing game that can be enjoyed by anyone even those who don t normally play video games those people were wrong for me stardew valley is not really a game at all it is a mirror reflecting within it the darkness of the human condition and my own inability to escape it at the time of this review i have logged 114 hours into this game i have completed the community center in it s entirety and i have perfectly optimized my farm for brutal efficiency i make millions of dollars each season and for no good reason i continue pushing just to see how grotesque and gaudy my industrial hellscape can become i have never spoken to a single member of the town who cannot benefit me monetarily if you asked i would likely only be able to name 5 npcs at best i almost never go to the town events and have often found them to simply be obstacles or annoyances in my personal quest for power this game may be relaxed for some but for me it is war there shall be no item left unpurchased no crop left ungrown and no slime left unslain i am become death destroyer of worlds if you share a desire for ruthless expansion and power this game is for you conversely if you just want to have a cute little farm and role play a simple but idyllic rural fantasy this game is probably also for you either way if you value your mental health or maintaining actual productivity the abyss is best left un gazed upon
