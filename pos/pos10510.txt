2017 early access review for players who have never played wows before try it it s a very solid game and worthwhile as an arcadey naval game as far as i know it s the only quality game in the genre of fullscale naval pvp ship to ship combat as of right now of course war thunder another f2p game is going to add naval aspects within the next year but we ll just have to see how that goes the game is free so you don t lose anything if you don t like it as a free to play game it does have ingame purchases and microtransactions but none of them are necessary or forced these come in the forms of premium account which just helps you grind through trees slightly faster than usual premium ships which typically do not give you a competitive advantage they re often namesake ships famous specific names or classes of ships for example a premium ship i own off of the steam version is the uss alabama now while the south dakota class battleship isn t currently ingame as standard similarly designed fast battleship classes are such as the north carolina class south dakota predeccessor and the iowa class south dakota s successor and they are standard trees and having a south dakota doesn t give me any advantage over either of those two classes another example is a charity ship they have a bundle currently as of november 14 2017 on the shop to purchase the uss texas with a cosmetic ship camoflage of the texas state flag proceeds of this bundle go towards the battleship texas foundation for their efforts the keep the ship preserved as the ship is having hull issues with flooding and leaks the money raised goes towards keeping this beautiful piece of history preserved and protected again the premium ships are typically not better in any way and the standard research tree ships are able to stand their own in their own regards and of course they re optional purchases doubloons gold currency the ingame premium currency which could be bought and used to purchase certain premium vehicles or premium account convert to a large amount of ingame standard currency or to convert to free xp which could be used to unlock a ship instantly or substantially cut the amount of time needed to acquire or to buy some cosmetic items none of these are like other publishers who choose to paywall stuff that should be a part of the base game wargaming are very proud of world of warships and they hope to see it flourish with a healthy playerbase which i personally believe the game deserves my only issue with the steam client is not one that affects players new to the franchise looking to try it out but rather those of us who have played off of steam there is currently no way to link your prior wargaming account to your steam account meaning your progress and premium vessels do not carry it s like starting over from scratch of course we still have our wg launcher accounts to play on which is fine i personally was hoping to have the game on steam for screenshots and chat convenience and the convenience of using the steam wallet for ingame purchases personally i will likely stay on my non steam version but might play some on here as it could be fun using a different focus on a new playthrough account but i still recommend new players to give it a try
