2016 this was my first ds i played ever i didnt play the other ones i already finnished the game and i m doing the dlc atm which is cool i have to say i have never experienced a game like this definitely not like this there s something about this game that just amazes me which are the boss battles they are so immersive i literally yell when i m fighting them i feel fear courage and despair and it is so satisfying especially when u kill the bosses u just feel so rewarded this game was incredibly hard for me it was really tough to beat it for me and i gave up many times but in the end at the end of the game i really felt like i achieved something something worthy if u are like me and u have never tried dark souls i highly reccomend it as it is for me an unforgettable memory
