2017 short the best game there is long this game is a gem hidden from most public by not being from some aaa releases and probably it keeps being good exactly cause of it it shows a little more than 400hrs played but that are only the time playing online with steam i play most of time direct from the 64bit starter that steam doesnt count so it is easily above 1k hours in reality the first thing i can say good about it is that it deliveres excatly what the pictures shows and much more it is not that kind of game that is deceiving cause of lots of picture of cgs and not actual gameplay everything show above is accessible right away and much much more gourgerous images are at your disposal the second thing is the community this game has simple the best community of any game ever people are helpful friendly and incredible encouraging you on keep trying and getting better this should be incredible for real life for the internetz its unheard off the third mods my god this game have the simple easiest most fantastic mod support ever some of the mods are more complex than the game itself like fearam aerospace research which adds a much more realistic aerodinamyc aspect to the game and will make your crafts spin a lot on launch and simple destroy your dreams of spaceplane reentry or remote tech which adds more realistic comunication network including ranges planet blockage disc antenna targeting and more the game can room smoothly on most computer or put your video card to pray if you install the visual enhancements mods wich make the planets and atmospheres looks incredible specially from space mods can be completely addictive and you can easily find yourself lost browsing just one more mod to add to tha game the fourth get kerbal engineer redux technicaly its should be on the mod section but it is so light simples and just give you quality of life information that i find it should be already on the main game the fifth the learning curve this game isnt difficult like many people say but it has like a 50hrs learning time it is not the difficult of the gameplay actually its fairly easy its the sheer amounth of new information your have to learn and process to play the game after 500hrs it is pretty easy to go to any planetary body per se the problem is staying there and building your colony in a certain way this game is exactly like a the first half of human life you start knowing nothing and thinking everything will be easy and you hurt yourself at you very first step as you put time in this game you get older then lauching rockets become a little more complicated cause they need to have purpose you start to try to do specific things like going into orbit docking going to the mun minmus then other planets and moons after that long teenager and early adult years you become adult and not the real game begin you manage your resources try to estabilish yourself explore the entire system then at last middle age come and you have more long term goals like having family and a home for them you build your colonies on other worlds and moons and try to get them to become self suficient everything i just said is just a scratch of what this game can deliver the last you will learn a lot of real life physics and astronomy you will not have a master degree but you will know much more that some of the people who do have but dont work on this kind of stuff you will give imagination to your engineering dreams like building rockets and planes and after that some ships and even submarines there is an aquatic moon on the game you will learn how difficult is to get into orbit and how difficult can be to get from orbit to the moon and back the is a mod called realism overhaul for those wanting to try themself into realscale rockets planets and solar system cause the game uses a reduced scale to make launchs more manageable and rockets easier but dont get me wrong it is still very challenging then you will realise how incredible the mankind was back into the 60s and 70s to be able to do that with much less computer power than we have today just out of curiosity the aproximations used into the game are far more acurate than the aproximations available to the real apollo astronauts enjoy this masterpiece one of the few games i took my time to write a review and i think thats the only one i gave a good review p
