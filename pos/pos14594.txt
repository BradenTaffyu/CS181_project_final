still awesome a bit more complex than v especially in terms of city management you actually need to decide what to build where highly recommended if you ve played v a lot and want a bit more complexity but if you ve never played civ before i d recommend to start with v also not a big fan of the 29304830946657 mini dlcs policy but just grab an anthology uberultimate edition whatever it s called now on sale and you get a massive complete game with tons of stuff to play with definitely recommend getting the two main expansions too especially the environmental aspects add a really cool layer to the game
