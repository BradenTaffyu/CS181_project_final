early access review i have a love and hate relationship with this game i don t like the concept of ping spikes and crazy lags but i do love the gameplay and this game creates crazy and insane moments with friends i have to say i may not like it s flaws but but everytime i get burned out playing this game i come back for more just to have some crazy fun and sometimes heated moments with friends to the devs please keep updating this game the more we all come back and have a good time and try to find ways to fix the ping issue
