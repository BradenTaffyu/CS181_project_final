2017 yes stellaris is one of those major 4x games that are still in development and bringing new content each patch with it dlcs are expensive 10 20 because of development phase content is getting better mechanics are getting better might be hard to learn so give it a try if you got money to spare there is one major downside the game does not support multithreading yettherefore the late game is almost unplayable due to being very slow and lagging we can just hope that one day one day multithreading will be possiblethis is my one begging to the paradox team 8 6 10edit i correct the problem is that there is no multithreading the engine is not the main problem as i mentioned in a previous version
