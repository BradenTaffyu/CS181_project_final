2020 so it s been a while since fallout76 been out as most of you know at launch this game got quite some hate and to be fair most of it was well deserved as a fan of the fallout series i played fallout76 at launch i played it for a bit and actually somehow somewhere liked it lots of bugs glitches and much needed improvements but i liked the story at first i played it as if it was a single player game ignored basically all other players and just focused on exploring and the main quest it was actually pretty fun in that way in its core it was and still is a good fallout game great exploration a lot of good backstory to discover and cool locations with some fun quests but sadly after an hour or 20 25 most of the bad stuff like bugs glitches and in the end a lack of content got to me so i parked the game recently i picked this game back up and started from 0 a couple of big updates including complete new story lines had been release and to be short about it was a lot better lots of new content quality of life improvements and bug fixes the main story is decent as in most fallout games it s not the best but it keeps you busy the world is as always a blast to explore full of fun side quest backstory and awesome locations does that mean it s finally up to standard with the other single player fallout games sadly no it s still by far the worst of the fallout games and especially endgame lacks serious content besides some repetitive events or grinds for not to interesting items and although many have been fixed there s still plenty of bugs and glitches to encounter building your c a m p is fun and having people over to check out your base cook their food or trade buy items with you is always nice you can build some awesome camps if you find good spots and most of it works well with some small frustrations like objects that cant be placed even though there is place nukes can also be dropped by gathering codes around the world and clearing a mission silo they basically transform 1 area to a big radiation see with stronger enemies and some special loot they re fun for a while but once you got the gear you want they do nothing special anymore so to close things up do i recommend fallout 76 yeah if you like the other fallout games i think you ll have some fun with this one just don t expect it to be up to par with the other games if you don t like the online part of the game like me just ignore the other players and do your quests it s perfectly do able
