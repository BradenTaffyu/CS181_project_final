2016 great graphics great performance playable even on my very old pc at medium no boring typical tw game great battles great strategy great character lvling great etc simply the best game of many years and will be with its expansions for many more years i recommend it 100 in all my pro gaming honor and super fun just turn off the antivirus completely when playing this game and it wont lag at all but turn antivirs off completely and restart the pc if the antivirus needs this to be turned off but remember to turn it on when not playing i did that and it doesnt lag on high it runs great this is total warhammer sparta epicness also formation abilities are already in the game in passive form for example charge defence vs all etc and this is so well thought cause its no longer a pike wall spam fest for example also units themselves have active abilities also this is important after making a group for example ctrl 4 then u select that group so all units are selected and press ctrl g it saves the unit formation and enables group attack which is like the a move in rts u select when u want the group and click it to attack an enemy unit and the units of the crtl g group will target different enemy squads which are close to the target of course the targets arent always the most optimal so u can select those units which dont have the best target and manually set target but this saves a lot of time and like that u dont have to press pause all the time to manually set targets fr each unit of your army a game with both campaign and multiplayer being great intelligent strategic plain and simple
