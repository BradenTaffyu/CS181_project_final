2017 nier automata is treasure to be enjoyed by all who love games whose beauty is far more than skin deep rare are the moments when i am compelled to take time out to leave a review for a game in fact i think i ve written only one or two reviews in the 8 or 9 years i ve been on steam and yet nier automata has compelled me to leave one i ll try to keep it brief but i will probably fail from beginning to end and from top to bottom this game is exquisite the pacing the feel of its open world the music the twisting and turning story are all among the very best in the class told over multiple play throughs from multiple perspectives and leaning heavily on nihilistic precepts and philosphies the game takes you on a roller coaster of a ride that not only forces you to question the motives of the protagonists and antoganists but their very purpose and yours too from time to time side quests aren t your typical filler experiences found in most open world experiences each one was carefully crafted to add depth and complexity to the story to the background to the core philosophical questions the game poses to the player and its characters a game of depth weight pleasure and pain that slaps you in the face over and over again the game is very emotional the high quality story telling through the game s interactions brings you in tight with the characters even the side characters and doesn t let go the hardships some characters endure over the course of the game is presented without lots of direct exposition rather through subtle body language discouraged commentaries and painful admissions fleeting hope makes you want to grab at it like a lifeline as pain and sadness reaches out to envelope you and your protagonists the struggle of emotions bears the most satisfying of rewards for those players who endure to the end the distance some characters have their reactions to situations it s all for a deeper reason all of which will be revealed with time and it s worth the wait to find out nihlism runs deep in the game as i mentioned and several characteers are named after famous philospophers reading about them will enrich your overall experience so who is nier automata for anyway dreams in my opinion it s for every gamer who loved the story and delivery of games like ff7 and ffx but have been perpetually disappointed with the rpg genre ever since it s for those who love beautiful characters with exquisite animation it s for those who love great action and awesome combat it s for those who love a game with meaning that go far deeper than the surface and forces you in the real world to question your motivations and values should you have an ear to hear what characters and situations are really saying this game will resonate with you like a clanging symbol long after your play session ends it s for those who enjoy the idea or experience of playing a game multiple times from multiple perspectives think dishonored each more rewarding than the last hell the game doesn t even begin until the 3rd playthrough and by then you will have had enough holy s t moments to last the rest of the year level with me dreams should i pick this one up yep i went in with zero expectations didn t play any drakengard games or the original nier and came out the other side championing this game as my game of the year already sorry zelda sorry nioh sorry horizon sorry fill in whatever else is coming this year if i didn t have another single player game to play this year this would be enough for me the mix of highs and lows the pacing the character development the emotions on display from beginning to end have wrapped me around this game s proverbial finger so much so that after 90 hours i m genuinely excited to start all over again from scratch no game i ve ever played has so moved me and with the depth of the characters and knowing the story behind the story i expect the next time through might be even better this is a game that was clearly made with more love than most it takes more risks than most and as a result offers a product rarely seen if you enjoy single player story driven games at all you do yourself a disservice by not playing this game there s a reason it s metacritic score is so high and why so many people are talking about this game ok okay but would you buy it again dreams at day one prices look at me in my eyes i d buy this game again in a heartbeat folks i ve never been more glad than i am now that i took a chance on a game never played any of the games in the franchise before i haven t felt this rewarded by a game experience in 20 years final fantasy 7 at launch and i mean that the game is probably going to end up in my top 5 all time and i ve been gaming for 30 years do yourself
