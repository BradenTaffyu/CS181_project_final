2021 i bought this game on ps4 a long time ago and since then it has had a special place for my heart as i assume it did for many people it inspired me to do things greater than me to push beyond what is thought impossible not only do i take that perspective into my real life but it helped me realize my dream to study astrophysics and aerospace engineering as well the stories created from this game that we have all experienced feel like something to be put in a chapter book telling tales of heroic stories or even the horrific ones filled with disaster and sometimes just pure stupidity but one thing has been constant throughout the years no matter where you started or how you started whether it was sandbox or your first little jumping flea we all had something click in our heads to go even further to push further past the beyond of kerbin and its atmosphere i still remember the first time i had achieved orbit it gave me such a feeling of pride and accomplishment and from there on i began to wonder just how much farther i could go just how much harder i could push jebediah and his outcast of barely knowledgeable kerbins as our knowledge built up and our skills were tested to their extent you would begin to find yourself on new places new terrains you have never visited before the mun minmus duna those were the first 3 i explored and i remember every time i landed on them ksp has taught me many things as i m sure it has many others no matter what i do i still always find myself coming back to the game and writing new experiences for myself to remember and now that the game s journey is coming to a close i thank the developers for giving us something so much fun so memorable and something so inspiring i ask for your stories to be shared here no matter how small or big it is as a thank you to this game and to see the effect it had on all of us
