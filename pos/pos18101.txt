2014 having been a fan of the tw series ever since shogun 1 i simply couldn t miss rome ii so after waiting for a while to have some major bugs fixed i finally decided to give the game a try the first thing i noticed at a faction choosing screen is that there were no hints as to what military strengths and special units each faction has like in previous games a minor disappointment but a disappointment nonetheless so after the game loaded i proceeded to make my first turn i ve always been taking my sweet time in such games but even then i was surprised that my very first turn took a whole hour the reason is a completely new interface minimization is being popularised too much for my tastes in the later years new features and the lack of some old ones after that one hour i decided to play the prologue first which took me 10 hours by the way and didn t explain any of the things i wanted to find out so what s there to notice in general you can t hire units without a general nor you can move your armies without one no more quick reinforcements from the heart of your empire no more splitting your army to catch up to some weaker enemy armies with your cavalry speaking of which i didn t notice a type of units affecting the overall army speed like in previous games where hiring a siege weapon greatly reduced the army speed but maybe that s just me diplomacy has been significally cut no more political marriages between the factions no open map trade no city trade the only way to get a settlement in rome ii is to capture it you can t purchase it from other factions anymore several close located settlements form provinces now each province consists of a city where you can build your most advanced buildings and 1 3 villages happiness is spread throughout the settlements you own in that province culture is spread throughout the whole province no matter how many factions own it which in turn can make alliances a little less effective because you would obviously aim at owning provinces in whole without having your ally spreading his culture to your cities thus affecting a public happiness you can t adjust tax rates for each province exclusively anymore the tax rate is the same throughout your faction the only thing you can do is to exclude a province from tax collection there is no more faction family tree totally the ony people your faction consist of are generals admirals and senators which are fully interchangeable a general can become an admiral then a senator etc and there is no confirmation as to whether they are even blood related agents have become more useful the main reason to that is because they can t die during a mission at all the worst thing that could happen to your agent after a failed assassination attempt is the agent being wounded and coming back to work in a couple turns the only ways to lose an agent are him being assasinated or manipulated with an enemy agent by the way manipulating enemy dignitaries to join you is somewhat strange i managed to capture a druidess and have her spread latin culture the very next turn really even after so much time since the release of the game it has still got a lot of bugs so don t be surprised if you get a critical error after winning a long and tough battle the overall rating if you are a fan of tw series i d still recommend to play shogun 2 instead too many features have been stripped not many new added in their place but if you are new to the series and have nothing to compare it to the game itself is good enough to spend a couple weeks on
