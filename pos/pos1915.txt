2022 on my facebook page a nice follower asked me under one of my swtor posts how is this game i need a new mmo and i answered this if you like star wars and especially if you liked kotor then you would love it story side of it and the theme of choices are incredible you have lots to play too with 8 class stories with each having 3 long chapters to complete but if you like pvp action and if you want good graphics etc it may feel a bit old well because it is byet it s quite polished after 7 0 and gameplay is a lot more fluent its f2p part is quite open and does not have any limit you can complete all the story in f2p you only need sub for the last expansion last 10 levels and endgame as a first impression this summarizes my experience quite nicely beyond that for me there are some pluses that impressed me and some minor setbacks pluses incredible story totally immersive experience where you feel your choices really do matter visually very nice and satisfying since from very early levels nar shaddaa was my favourite place transportation is quite nicely solved you don t waste time running around most of the time gameplay is fluent varied feels unique with each class and combat style follower mechanic is very nice and makes solo play extra fun followers having their own stories is also a very nice touch space combat is incredibly fun both in pve and pvp ui customization is awesome minor setbacks the fact that we have no flying mounts in a space fantasy game is totally illogical a lot of our mounts should be able to fly game mostly feels like a single player game when you are in story chapters f2p system is good but cartel coin system is not there must be a way to convert credits to cartel coins too also there must be a way to pay game time with in game currency this one sided cc to credit seemed to have caused serious inflation everything worth spending credit is crazy expensive in auction house i don t feel rich at all even with 50m credits and the f2p credit cap being 1m becomes quite limiting in that economy not allowing addons it s a bit too strict policy i d love to see my damage meter here too for example some waypoint or map additions etc ui customization keybinds should have a default setting and the main menu where we see our characters should obey this default setting it s quite annoying not being able to change it especially at 4k resolution character list should be a lot bigger and should show a lot more of our characters we should also drag order them if we want transmog system should be simplified and has to be made more easy to collect it s quite unforgiving for low gears catch up gear should just be gear not 3 4 slots of tokens for each armor and weapon well i m actually a beta tester from 10 years ago played quite a lot too but had taken a break these are from the top of my head after returning in 7 0 and playing 200 ish hours from zero with a fresh account i felt like i needed to write a review already after i saw i passed 200 hours in steam too b darth aernathps may update if i think of some other stuff to add
