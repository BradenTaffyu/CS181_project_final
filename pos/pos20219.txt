2023 owlcat has finally made an accessible yet rewarding combat system if you like the setting but have had trouble getting into their prior crpgs this one is different here s hoping they use it as a foundation for a pathfinder 2e game now edit as of 12 20 23 having now completed the game i d recommend either not picking it up or pausing around chapter 3 the quality difference between the first and second half of the game is notable in terms of stability i experienced several breaking bugs and multiple broken companion quests tuning the points for the reputation and alignment systems do not keep pace with expected thresholds so you aren t able to accomplish things the game expects of you and most distressingly the narrative quality drops in the final act all together it feels very rushed i still would recommend the game based on owlcat s historical commitment to improving these issues in their games through a mix of patches and dlc but as it stands you will likely be disappointed by the conclusion
