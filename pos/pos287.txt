2022 pretty neat game started playing with the idea it would just be a regular calming farming sim to pass sometime on after 100 hours in i can say that it s just that and more just about anything you want it to be wanna just play the farming sim go ahead wanna fight mobs in a never ending randomly generated cave with number of floors knock yourself out wanna start a family sure thing wanna get rich and then gamble it all away well you can if you want lots of variety will most likely keep playing the game to completion
