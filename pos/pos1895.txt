2020 a mmorpg with more single player co op story content than many single player rpgs the mmo stuff is there too the graphics are a bit dated and cartoony but with kotor 3 nowhere in sight this is probably the way to go if you want to play a star wars rpg plus you can play on the imperial side this time which is always a good thing
