2015 early access review a zombie survival crafting game crafting like in minecraft but with superior graphics every 7 days there will be a zombie horde attacking your hideout base making it alittle bit like a tower defense game you can place traps like wood spikes log spikes barbed wire fences that slow the zombies down and or kill them its still far from finished though there is enough content to enjoy at the moment if you like solo survival its a nice game but there is also multiplayer which has some flaws at the moment the melee combat was recently improved making it pretty dynamic where you can knock down zombies on occasion cut off legs to make them crawlers etc you can also level different skills like mining scavenging etc there is still more coming and when its finished it will be the best zombie survival game of all times
