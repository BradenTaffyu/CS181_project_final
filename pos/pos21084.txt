2017 casual mode a new game mode has been added for players that want to use slime rancher to truly relax casual mode is a wholly separate game mode that mirrors adventure mode save for the complete lack of tarr slimes and reduced feral slime aggressiveness in casual mode largo slimes cannot eat a second plort and feral slimes will not perform their patented feral slime butt stomp to be completely honest i love getting mauled in dark souls getting the occasional unfair death on a hardcore character in path of exile and getting absolutely butthurt by the toxicity of any random moba but casual mode on slime rancher yes please no longer will i have to feel absolutely gutted if i accidentally drop the wrong plort near an innocent largo and have it destroy the happy lil slimies nearby though i feel like this game mode will have largos taking over everywhere buhyeah this game is my chill pill in between the maulies and murderies and it just got a whole lot chiller thanks monomimi
