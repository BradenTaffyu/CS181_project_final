at its core this is an incredibly solid game it s totally worth its asking price even at release the mostly negative reputation is because the game doesn t have a whole lot of content and because it s lacking certain improvements from post launch pd2 people are rightly disappointed but this sentiment has devolved into a circlejerk so many of the negative reviews are just memes and one liners i remember how well the developers carried pd2 after release and i m optimistic that they ll do the same for pd3 improvements from pd2 the gameplay is super refined it s much less janky and feature bloated than the last installment i ve wasted countless hours in pd2 due to absurd glitches such as the van not showing up or ai getting stuck and i haven t had those kinds of issues with this game the game is always online but i ve had a very stable bug free experience playing the game once you do the first time nebula setup it never comes back to haunt you even between devices i sometimes play the game with very high ping but i was pleasantly surprised with how stable it was the level design and game flow is unmatched the guards cameras crowds have a procedurally generated predictable rhythm and higher difficulties offer just enough entropy to keep things interesting from beginning to end the jewelry store night club branch bank and the big bank and the best levels at release the art gallery is phenomenal each exhibit is a super compelling unique puzzle unfortunately i don t play it because the wifi signal puzzle is especially tedious on this map there are lots of new clever mechanics unmasked exploration and zone specific security tiers encourage each team members to take on a special responsibility during the heist and it gives the game so much more nuance solo play if you want to play solo you can still complete most heists however you want and have a good time doing it if you are using the correct items and skills and you ve done a good enough job of assessing a heist s randomly generated layout you have a fair shot of completing it on overkill difficulty without any additional help there are only one or two levels which cannot reasonably be stealthed on overkill such as the penthouse the ai companions are quite good and they ll actually drop health ammo when necessary their pathfinding and game sense is also much better than pd2 and they actually stand a chance on higher difficulties the lead guard mechanic is a great addition but there are certain cases where he will arbitrarily enter a certain area and you will assuredly fail i actually quite like their unpredictable exploration but i think it should be relegated to certain predictable intervals where i know i might need to clear out of a particular room guard duty shouldn t be a team member s sole responsibility areas to improve this game simply needs more content more levels and more items the existing heists are super fun and replayable but now that i m mid level things are starting to feel a little bit stale moreover there are only a handful of masks and mask patterns for no good reason as it is you simply can t make a unique looking mask even though they ve added a cool new painting mechanic as a start they should copy over the mask pattern greyscales from pd2 to pd3 i work in aaa and i ve spent a lot of time porting over similar textures because even if it s old it s better than nothing please scrap the wifi signal puzzle in its entirety it s far too unpredictable it kills your team momentum game flow and it needs to go for context it requires you to sit in a random spot for like 10 seconds 8 times in a row it takes an ungodly amount of time on higher difficulties because you re waiting for the guards to rotate running over and standing in the circle for 3 seconds and then hiding again rinse and repeat it s incredibly tedious in comparison the phone hack puzzle is much better which requires you to lurk behind a particular character for x amount of time before doing so you need to assess what their likely route is going to be and perform some preliminary steps such as hacking any observing cameras tying up any intruding civilians and so on it feels like a heist in and of itself all of the cool paintjobs are gatekept to absurdly high levels i should be able to skip these requirements somehow even if i have to convert all of my dollars into c stacks as it is casual players can t make a cool looking weapon or mask the ui is incredibly broken i should not need to re open the customization screens to update the item preview or click back and forth between menus to re populate the sub menus i ve also had instances where i finish customizing my character weapon and nothing has changed in game or my customizations get reset this is probably the only unacceptable bug that i ve encountered iirc i had to fully restart the game to resolve it armor penetration is the most important damage stat in the game but for some reason it isn t shown in the item menu this is incredibly confusing and it makes certain weapons appear to be far better than they really are and vice versa as it is the only good source for weapon stats is the datamined spreadsheet on reddit the sniper rifle should be able to penetrate shields the pump action shotgun needs a significant buff handguns shouldn t have an aim speed penalty when using iron sights and the car 15 needs a spread reduction
