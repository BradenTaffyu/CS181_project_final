2020 fallout 4 review fallout 4 it really is a timeless classic it was really enjoyable going out in the irradiated wasteland once more the story is misterious till the last part of the game you always have the feel that there is something strange behind all the factions you encounter at first they all seem to want to do the right thing for the commonwealth or the reasons behind their ideology until you learn more about them and you start to understand the different morality problems that everyone faces in the wasteland no one has the perfect morality they always have some extreme and at the end you will have to chose between one evil or another the best faction has to be the institute is one of the most misterious bad guys in all the games that i ve palyed everyone in the wasteland talks about them and the synths that they create what they do with people and all the terrible things they have done it s really cool and i loved it aside from the main story there are some cool sidemissions that are really easy to miss if you don t get the time to explore the world some are a highliht of the game and deepens the feeling of immersion of the wasteland one other thing that is really well done is the companion system you can find up to 13 companions and they are all different from one another with different stories and some with cool personal sidemissions tied to the ammiration that they have for you if you get enough ammiration you have the possibility to romance them and you will be getting a unique perk also they will be reacting to one another and to every important thing you will do during your playthrough making them feel alive the shooting remains a bit clunky but the variety of guns makes it fun nontheless there are amazing cool loocking unique weapons and legendary ones with different modifiers on them it is really fun to hunt for them and take them in your personal collection also you can modify all the guns you want with different mags stocks sights ecc the same thing applies to the armor and power armor system one thing that i really enjoied is the possibility of building your settlement and when you get to the infamous diamond city you can build your own house where you can store all the different weapons armors chems junk ecc that you want to keep it is really fun to decorate your house or settlement to your liking with all the things you got during your playtime and making a display of all the bobble heads and magazines you ve found all this is the good now with the bad there are some weak sidemissions always requiering to go to some place get something and bring it back at the start it s fun because it encourages the exploration of the wasteland and you get to discover many new places with important loot but near the end the loot you find becomes almost useless and these missions start to get boring and repetitive i had an incredible ammount of tecnical problems that i had to resolve changing the game files like mouse accelleration different speeds for the orizzontal and vertical mouse movement fov changes since i have a 144hz monitor the game would speed up for every frame higher than 60 audio sync problems so many crashes and a lot more it almost broke my pc also the graphics and animations are not good even for 2015 standards and despite that the game runs so bad at times dropping down to 25 fps i have a gtx 1080 and i play on a 1440p monitor even with all of these problems i still recommand it it kept me interested enough to get me to the end and still wanted to play more and try the different endings fallout is really a unique series that everyone should try it makes me sad to see how bad fallout 76 turned out to be and how bad bethesda is getting adding microtransactions even to singleplayer games because of this we may never get a new singleplayer fallout game 8 10
