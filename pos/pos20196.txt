2023 this review is for people who are fans of the previous pathfinder games but have no previous knowledge of the warhammer franchise as someone who absolutely loved wotr so far so good roughly 4 hours in gameplay is now turn based which is ok because it s more focused on long range ie guns i have absolutely no idea what s going on because every 6th word is some warhammer 40k lingo that i don t feel like researching but i m still mostly enjoying the story seems like less character customisation than the pathfinder games but don t take that as gospel as i m basically just finishing off the tutorial at this point
