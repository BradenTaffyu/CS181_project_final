2016 this was an ok game when i first got it with the various mods it was a good rainy day game you sit in the house and play all day because it s too crappy to go outside but since the 1 5 rescale beta and now the v1 5 rescale update this thing has really got interesting most mods still work on ats like trailer mods truck mods some do some don t gfx mods the only mods that i know for a fact that do not work as of this writing are map mods those will probably be back up and running in a couple of weeks at any rate the rescale has made the world bigger and the time scale longer as a result of this ats now has a more realistic feel than it did before trips take longer and the day and night cycle feels more normal there have been numorous bug fixes and overall improvements to the world in general even the ai seems to be better scs has taken a good simulator and made it a great simulator edit this simulator has undergone several updates since my initial review and it has only gotten better with these changes new mexico has been added and oregon is due to be released soon though an exact release date has yet to be announced scs has also hinted at some other surprises down the pipe i can t wait to see what they have in store i said it before and i ll say it again scs has taken a good simulator and continues to make it a great simulator edit oregon has been released as well as the special transport dlc and as an added bonus scs also just released the volvo vnl truck and the volvo dealerships to purchase it at there is also talk of more trucks coming such as the lonestar and possibly the cascadia among others at some point next year this game is really starting to take shape and every dlc just adds to the enjoyment we now have logging and steel industries among several others and as the states continue to be released we should see even more industries meaning many more types of loads to be hauled oh i almost forgot we also got ownable trailers which can be customized to match your company livery or just match your favorite trucks your employees can use the trailers or you can set them to private and keep them to yourself if you so choose all in all this is one game that just keeps getting better with the passage of time and i for one hope it s around for a nice long time update i m updating this review again as this game just continues to improve we now have utah and some other goodies are expected soon to be honest i ve never been as excited about a game as i am with this one new states are starting to roll out and now we ve just been treated to a sneak peek at a new truck which should be available soon i m pretty sure that it s the international that a lot of us have been waiting for for so long so all in all this year has been a good one for ats and next year appears to hold even more surprises
