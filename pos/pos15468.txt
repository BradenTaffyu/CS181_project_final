2023 great game to learn about cars and how they work this game gets into the vast majority of repairs that a mechanic actually has do in a real shop being a mechanic myself i am extremely impressed with how realistic this game is there are a few things missing that would make it even more realistic like having to drain transmission fluid being able to rebuild the diffs and trans axle along with having to tear down the cylinder heads and diag a bad valve or weak spring however i am just nitpicking at this point in the end it is a great game for cars enthusiast and people just looking to get into the car work and even better the trade of being a car mechanic
