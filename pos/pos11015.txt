2023 edit at 20 hours now that they have released two patches even with a city with over 80k cityzens my framerate with the settings i had when i was getting 20 40 fps in a starter city i am now getting 40 60fps my biggest issues at the moment are the amount of trash in my city it seems that no matter how many incineration plants i build they re always full edit looks like 9th of november they released a patch to fix the garbage problems d after 5 hours of gameplay i d like to give this game high remarks for being what i expected ofcourse as everyone expected performance was not as you would hope the other cs2 to have counter strike that being at max frame rate at all times the fps was for me with a ryzen 7 5800x and rtx 3070 arround 20 to 50 fps i felt that was perfectly playable ofcourse i had to adjust the settings a bit to get that perfect fit for quality and framerate i prioritized factors like anti aliasing and others while tying to reduce vram stuff like texture quality due to only having 8gb of vram i think the picture looked pretty a lot prettier than cities skylines 1 i think this is one of the most beautiful games i play i did also turn the simulation cpu setting to max and that might have affected me dropping frames now and then but as someone who loves simulation games my profile should speak for itself palytime i feel cpu bottlenecks are the best case scenario for a game this game is a perfect excuse for having the kind of hardware i do have while at the same time giving me a reason to look at gpu prices in the future i know that if i get a new gpu it ll be contributing to something and not just being a vanaty purchase personally i love the simulation aspects of the game as someone who really enjoys infrastructure way too much everything from trains to houses to electrical grids this game is the perfect sandbox for me to be looking at the details of the inner workings of my city it s not mandatory for my city to have radio masts but if they do the cityzens will thank me for it there s also a level of microing you can do with low and high voltage power lines that i enjoy a bit like in oxygen not included but as with the radio masts it s not really something you ll get annoyed by in normal gameplay i feel like this game has so many macro and micro simulations that it will keep me occupied for a very long time there will be a lot of small and interconnected moving parts that i want to learn how they work the splitting of the rci meter to more colours is a great way to communicate the needs of the city to the player the import export page is a great way to communicate what the city is lacking suburbanites noting that their rent is a bit high is a great way to reward the player for building more housing with the more realitistc style of assets in less donut wans realistic looking consumer cars realistic parking day night cycle with the agents driving at different rates at different times larger scale and upgradable services i feel this game deserves a 10 10 from me personally for the possible optimizations i hear the devs were going to focus on now to get the console releases out i hope they won t toutch their beautiful simulation to make that happen if they just find some optimizations to make the graphics run better then that s great i do love the way the graphics look i think this is the first great ray traced game after quake 2 rtx i ve really played that i know of even though i ve had rtx cards for like 5 years now it looks great and the artefacts of temporal antialiasing are barely notecable assuming your framerate is above 20fps d even then just for about 3 frames depending on your settings d also the lighting effects are great highrises make great shadows to alleys with the global ligting system the water looks great too tldr buy if u like simulations and you have a decent enough gpu to run it if you do the game is beautiful
