2021 really cool game highly recommend to anyone who enjoys slow burn turn based strategy games in comparison to the civ5 it has a whole new aesthetic and art style which looks brand new smooth and clean there are some changes in terms of playing features however feels more immersive and connected especially when discussing with other ai civilization leaders in game with the new addition of leader s agendas it gives a greater understanding of their motives and personalities when playing and really helps if you want to specifically annoy or remain at peace with specific ai leaders for older civ players it can take some getting use to but doesn t take long to figure out after playing around with it for a bit overall i recommend this game with the new look and features it is clean smooth and fun to play on your own and with friends
