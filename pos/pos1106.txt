2022 early access review i m not sure how to put in words the way i feel about this game imagine the sims 1 meets strategy games meets zombie survival and you have project zomboid this game is unique it s literally one of a kind the developers involved with this game are some of the kindest and most fun individuals i ve had the pleasure of communicating with on forums through email and twitter that alone makes me feel good about it it s one of those games you have to just experience however complex you think this game is multiple that by 100x believe me when i say this project zomboid is the most in depth realistic and intense zombie game ever don t let the isometric style fool you at the time of writing there have been some issues with dedicated servers but playing with your friends on your own private game works flawlessly even with a bunch of mods it s how my friends and i play the game it s definitely one of those games that s even better with friends nothing like settling a base and smashing heads with your friends or going on a road trip through un dead kentucky which reminds me the map is enormous and will get expanded further unlike anything i ve ever seen i ll expand on this review as time goes on as it s too much to cover in one session edit i should also mention i have 500 hours on this game and i m planning to make it at least 500 more if not a 1000 it s very addictive and fun to beat your own personal best survival time you learn every time you play
