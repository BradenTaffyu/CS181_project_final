2018 i wish steam gave a maybe button for recommending games but it s a positive review for me despite more negatives in my list below two point hospital is in a nutshell a hospital tycoon that does give a rather nostalgic feeling when playing if you re old as the hills and played theme hospital it is also a good introduction to hospital tycoons for younger gamers that wants something fun to play there are positives but there are also negatives in this game positives are it gets challenging after the first 4 levels so stick with it even if it feels easy at first it s beautiful to look at there is an element of micromanaging see negatives you could easily lose hours in the game see negatives below for more on this negatives are bugs there are a few bugs that need patching out bad pathfinding some patients will go from one area of the hospital to the other side just to play on the arcade game or to the toilet when there are arcade games or toilets right next to them random influxes of people that could send a hospital spiraling into a circle of no return if things aren t carefully planned out needing to micromanage nearly everything to have a hospital that works smoothly how fast the time goes i understand why it s so fast but adding in how fast patients can die if they re stuck in an endless loop of gp office and being diagnosed i feel like it s a little too fast you can lose hours to this game once you get past the first 4 tutorial levels difficulty can ramp up quickly but also can be overcome with enough time to the point where you don t have to fear about ever running out of money again overall right now i say wait a couple of months to see how many bugs are patched out but if you re looking for a fun theme hospital esque game i d say this is the one to look into
