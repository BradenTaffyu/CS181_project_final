2017 now this is an amazing game in my opinion it s far better than harvest moon and nearly as good as rune factory i have enjoyed this game with and without mods the cost is reasonable and i would gladly pay it to support the one person who created it the game itself is awesome the story and events in the game are fun and cute there s so much to do the characters are amazing and they are so different from each other just because it s mostly farming doesn t mean you have to be a farmer you could be a fisherman a monster hunter or just forage for loot anyway i would highly recommend this game and i m sure if you played it you would too
