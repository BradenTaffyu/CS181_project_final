2015 early access review updating this review this game has only gotten better in my opinion its one of if not the best survival game on steam i love the devs they are a bit slow but super thorough build 41 is one of the greatest things ive ever experienced only waiting on multiplayer for b41 and those npc s now they added vehicles and they re amazing and enhance the gameplay a ton honestly i love this game its just the greatest thank you devs for making this and being as dedicated as you have been its truly been an honor to play this 10 10 older review people always want to know 1 should i buy this game and 2 will i like it 1 yes 2 yes a few things to know before you do though 1 this game is difficult some would call it hardcore the reason is that your life is very fragile and everything you re up against isn t it s like a watermelon against a sledgehammer surviving in this game is like real life one screw up and it s over 2 whatever skill you choose know that no matter how proficient you get at it if you level it from skill level 2 up to skill level 7 and you get bit you can kiss all that progress goodbye 3 when you die you re dead it literally makes you start a brand new character so don t get too attached 4 you will die like a lot5 first several times you play you ll know very little and feel like it its easy to get frusturated but stick with it if you re one to easily give up this game is not for you 6 multiplayer can be super fun if you can have your own server like we do7 single player is a totally unique experience to multiplayer but man does it feel good to survive alone building your own shelter and growing your ownfood catching your own food it s so satisfying because you know you re on your a game if you make it pros excellent survival engine zombie ai is very impressive but not perfect zombies are kind of creepy but need a few more styles wide array of items excellent character creation traits mostly feeling of hopelessness stress heart thumping action realistic feeling town and just the right dab of guns weapons food etc base building is very good and on a grid system masterful multiplayer with a server is amazing singleplayer very fun and challengingcons could use npc s and vehicles because damn some of these trips are long sometimes zombie ai is too good like how do they always know to knock on the doors and not the walls trapping is kind of a pain in the arse ive had minimal success cooking and farming can be kind of tedious but very helpful should have a server save state option so we dont get corrupted files from things like a power outage items sometimes vanish into the void mostly when harvesting crops which is super annoying sometimes you get a cheap death like i one time looked in a window and didn t see any zomie so i hopped in and was instantly bitten as the animation to land inside was still going wtf when you forage it doesnt show on the screen what you picked up if anything can we at least get a quick little pop up that fades away after 2 seconds overall this game is excellent and i was pleasantly suprised how good it actually is i didn t even realize it s in ea it s that polished and good impressive good work devs
