2021 early access review a phenomenal time wasting physics based game which has dynamic destruction of the environment at its heart with the exception of the foundations and the floors practically everything is destructible perfect for playing something when waiting on people or when you need to blow off steam the campaign this gave me the giggles the whole way the levels are challenging without being over the top and forced me to do a lot of outside the box thinking in order to get things done there are mandatory objectives and optional ones for the masochists and the truly creative sandbox it s creative mode but with a lot more destruction what else is there to say workshop exactly what you d expect from the modding community not integral for the experience of the game but you d be a fool not to at least check it out
