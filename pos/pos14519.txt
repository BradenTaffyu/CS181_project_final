2018 i am a 39 years old gamer who was lucky enough to play all civ games starting from civ i on my beloved amige 500 fast forward 26 years and now i am playing civ vi on my msi gs63 it is so similar yet so different from civ i i have really enjoyed the ride but is it perfect surely not i have some mixed feelings about civ vi the ai bothers me like most people here especially with its weird warmongering penalties and stupid war mechanics the ai in this series has always struggled to get it right and civ vi is one of the worse in the series but who has not struggled it is such a complex game with so many layers even we struggle i still have not got used to the idea of city states i think the game gives up valuable land to these many cities there is a balance problem with the victory types some are harder than others i usually find myself having a science victory i think that should be the default for many people and the religion system is complete bullocks with spamming religious units blocking tiles and stupid religious wars i wish i could just cut it out of the game i am surprised with the number of bugs and glitches i see in an otherwise such polished game and how they still have not addressed those i am talking about base game i do not have the rise and fall expansion pack the big difference vs old civ games is the cancellation of stacking and boy it makes such a difference so for me civ v might be the pinnacle of the series but civ v was also too bland when it first came out and it took 2 expansions to get it right i sincerely hope same will happen with civ vi if you have civ v with the expansions i would not recommend to buy civ vi at full price still it is a yes for me when you catch it discounted but i would recommend to wait for the next expansion since they will discount rise and fall heavily after the 2nd expansion launch edit after the recent starter update which is a bad excuse for ads directx 12 version have weirdly begun to fail starting the game and i hear this is causing problems with mods especially in civ v very bad decision firaxis and 2k fix this edit 2 the gold version is more expensive than the sum of the packages it includes in turkey the seperate packages add upto 146tl and the gold version is 152tl fix it steam and firaxis
