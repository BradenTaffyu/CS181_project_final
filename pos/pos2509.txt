2023 pretty fun game up to ch 3 5 actual review because too many steam reviews are just unfunny reddit jokes see tl dr at bottom if you hate walls of text game s mechanics can seem overwhelming at first or down right complex but eventually you ll get used to it with time tutorial doesn t really explain it too well it explains enough though but that s mainly because it s introducing concepts that you don t really need to understand to beat the game that is you should be more concerned about a skill s power instead of matching the same colour or sin type i m not sure if it s changed since i ve been playing from day 1 but it does leave out some very very important concepts for me that was clicking on an abno s part to show resistances and the hold down on a sinner to see uptie level gacha is really generous and the compensation rewards we get are insane though that s not really fair critique as it ll undoubtedly change in the future if anything i ll note that you don t need any 00 or 000 to beat the main story 3 5 10 as of right now though this system is flawed most people will assume 00 s and 000 s are better then 0 s as soon as they get them they re right to think so as in chapter 1 or 2 they are much better but as soon as you get to chapter 3 it s the opposite the game enforces the 00 000 is always better as completing chapter 1 2 upgrades base id upties meaning that when you unlock chapter 3 you ll be more inclined to use the underleved and underprepared units instead of the now good base units ergo why so many people malded over 3 4 or 3 17 i believe this can be fixed by touching up the tutorial though the story as usual of pm is really good i don t believe you need a full understanding of lobcorp or lor but they do aid in understanding the world more there s not much else i can really say here as i m terrible at writing well actually i d say it goes on for too long early game as you ll mainly just be reading the story during chapter 1 2 instead of fighting half the time it s good though so i m all for it if you really hate it though why play this then you are able to skip it bugs are prevalent in this game but they re usually minor and get patched out very fast for something like ea i d call this lazy but given how small pm is i believe 30 people i figure it s fair to cut them slack about it especially given the compensation we receive it s their first time trying a gacha game and their golden track record combat early on will be fast like 5 8 scenes or so combined with the lengthy dialogue i figure it ll bore some people away from the game but the story combat ratio does improve in chapter 3 along with the difficulty of the game you ll need a real solid grasp of resistances sin resistances skills and upties to make it through it without strife well that was until the great sanity nerf of long ago where most coins will now land heads with 45 sanity you ll probably be able to scrape through as long as you have good skills it d also be better to add an easier way to identity the sin s names and colours i know them by heart now but i was only able to find out what they meant by going to some weird page s tutorial menu you can get by without understanding them but you may get lost sometimes i ll leave em here though red orange yellow green light blue dark blue purple wrath lust sloth gluttony gloom pride envy tl dr fun game boring to grind out kinda hard to understand so watch a youtube guide on it great story generous devs reading hell easy early on difficult later overall it s free and you don t ever have to open the spend money tab the game doesn t even tell you it exists lol so i figure it s worth checking out well atleast on youtube also another note please don t grind out exp luxcavation or shiny banners it really isn t worth it since level 15 20 is enough to beat the game and the banners are entirely visual it s seriously not worth the mental strife when you can just get enough level 3 tickets for level 30 from events anyway op note so ignore this i wrote this while sleep deprived at 3 am and edited this at 2 am and not only that i m terrible at english despite being monolingual i ve touched it up a bit because seeing the 88 helpful ticks rather irks me as i m pretty bad at reviewing in general lol 222 2 get
