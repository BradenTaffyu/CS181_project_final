as this is an owlcat game freshly released there are a lot of bugs i m used to it i was prepared for it and i m going to overlook them for the rest of this that being said if you want to dive in without waiting the toybox mod will save your sanity and your save file rogue trader is in my top 3 40k games competing with space marine and darktide but is at the bottom of the three owlcat games that isn t to say it s a bad game but kingmaker and wrath were much more emotionally engaging on a lot of levels that being said the writing in rt is up to owlcat s usual great standards characters have a distinct voice in how they re written their actions have sensible motivations why they are the way they are makes sense i know that seems to be an obvious thing that should happen but there are no end of games that ignore basic things like this i never wanted to stop playing because i wanted to keep engaging with the story the characters and what was going on even some minor side characters without so much as a character portrait i wanted to learn more about and spend more time with a short dialogue questioning someone dying in front of you their personality came across so damn well that i was genuinely upset afterward that i just met this fascinating person who is now dead also overall they really do get 40k the imperium is awful humanity is garbage aliens are garbage with shinier toys and being a good person is a trial that might just make everything worse it s a crapsack universe and the writers know it mechanically the system rt uses for combat took some adjusting after getting so used to things with distinct dungeons and dragons dna in their way of things but in the end i came to really dig it i definitely will up the difficulty the next time i play as once i figured things out there was seemingly no end to the crazy bs combos of talents i could throw together especially when some new item enabled a whole new wacky and broken idea if you like breaking rpg systems you re going to have a lot of fun with rt ship combat is a nice side activity not terribly complex not a ton of customisation you can do but it s fun enough though i do wish it was expanded upon made more complex maybe let you control a full fleet etc etc but for what it was it was decent basic game stuff looks fine aesthetic is perfect sounds feel great music is pretty good but eh it s a crpg that isn t baldur s gate 3 so that s not really what i play for i want the story and the combat my only major complaints is that the game feels small it s by no means short but it felt like events unfolded quickly i can summarise the plot in my head far too easily then i d really like engaging with the colony management system or working my way up the vendor reputation systems i felt like i got all these cool toys and then had absolutely no time to enjoy them before the game was over tl dr an above average crpg a way above average 40k game and the least good owlcat game but since all 3 of their games are damn good one of them has to get the bronze enjoyed my time with it wish it had been longer
