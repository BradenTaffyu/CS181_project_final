2020 i started playing fallout 76 with no special expectations at all i actually had a good time you always have something to do even more so when you start the game there are lots of quests and events to participate in but these activities or the combat is not what i appreciate the most in fallout 76 it s the exploration the map is vast varied and full of detail running around and discovering the map is really what i enjoyed the most you can salvage most items lying around and use them as crafting materials with enough materials you are able to create gear consumables and a base concerning this base you can be creative with the location as well as it s design through the building elements that you have unlocked in game and through the shop i haven t and won t subscribe to fallout 1st the game is fully playable and enjoyable without it the limited stash space is a bit frustrating at first but after some time you ll learn what you can sell and throw in order to make space for more important things the multiplayer aspect isn t forced on you it s easy to team up with other players if needed the emote system is pretty funny to communicate with others there are some negatives i feel i have to point out the quests and characters aren t gripping like some other rpg s the game has bugs they haven t stopped me from progressing at least they vary from your daily challenges not resetting to invisible quest markers and also include stuck npc s navigating through some menus can be a bit clunky at first the performance framerate can be inconsistent at times i feel like the game is worth it on sale with at least 25 off for the exploration alone the journey to improve your character is fun but i don t see myself playing too much after that that said new content is still being added to the game so i may stick around some more edit 500h after that 1st review well i sticked around for alot more amazing game
