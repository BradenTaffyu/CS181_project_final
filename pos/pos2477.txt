2020 fallout 76 a new player s perspective why i love this game i bought this game in late october 2020 and i already have 150 hours this is my favourite ever game when i first loaded into the game i wasn t entirely sure what to expect for the first couple of hours i did some of the main story and was greeted by many npc s after completing some of the main story line i decided to explore appalachia and was instantly amazed the stunning map this game s map is stunning i have a mid tier pc and have enjoyed the warm scenery quite nicely the map is huge i ve spent so many hours just exploring this vast wasteland 150 hours in and i m still discovering new locations and cave systems and so on the landscapes range from big valleys and harsh hills making the game feel so much bigger i guarantee you many people will love exploring this the gameplay and grind this game offers so much to grind for i m always grinding to level up and unlock new perk cards to work on my fallout build perk cards in this game make such a big difference to your play style i ve unlocked so many high level legendary guns yet i still get so excited to find a new one with bethesda s adding a free battle pass each season i always have something to grind and play for bethesda s effort as many of you know bethesda had a very rocky start when this game released as a new player i have seen nothing but more and more new content get added to this game giving fo76 s players something to grind for bethesda still care s for the f076 community and it really is starting to show fo76 s community fo76 s community is the nicest community i have ever seen as a new player many higher level randoms would help me out and give me weapons or meds to help me survive appalachia everyone is the community is extremely caring the bugs as a new player i have experienced less bugs in fallout 76 than i have in my 17 hours of fallout 4 on pc i have never once experienced a game breaking bug the only bugs i have experienced is minor onces such a killing an enemy then their body appearing on my porch 100m away the one and only problem fo76 s hate train many fallout fan s come to this game looking a very story driven game and get upset this is quite multiplayer driven duh i see so much hate for this game especially die hard new vegas fans and that hate on this game without giving it a try hell yeah you could ve hated on this game when it released go ahead but in it s current state its so unnecessary as the main arguments myths are a this game s bugs are horrible and make it impossible to play incorrect b this is nothing like the original fallout s they destroyed the fallout lore this is a multiplayer game focused on working together as a community with or without friends c this game relies on micro transactions and is based around spending money incorrect you don t need to spend a single dollar on this game once you ve purchased it a game worth buying i bought this game on 60 off but i d be more than happy to buy it at full price in it s current state i think many people will be very happy with the purchase should you buy this game yes 10 10 would easily buy again
