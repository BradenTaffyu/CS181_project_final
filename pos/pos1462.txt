2020 early access review with the amount of time and thought the devs put into the various mechanics in this game it s more than forgivable that certain common sense things are left out in terms of post apocalyptic survival with the amount of raw customization and easy moddability this game brings it seems particularly easy for zombie fans from any walk of their proverbial gaming life to enjoy this game example if i wanted i could make dawn of the dead zombies that shambled and were weak but their strength game from their clustering ability and frightening numbers especially when it came to loud noises firing a gun meant death by horde on the other side of the spectrum i could create zombies reminiscent of 28 days later who sprinted could open doors and had better hearing and sense of smell than a bloodhound on the hunt any misstep could spell demise but it was unlikely i d be swarmed by them unless i was unlucky enough to be at ground zero of the infection which of course i could make as a scenario with advanced zombie population tweaking also provided in the base game settings this is of course not even touching the vast amount of worldgen wildlife date time timescale and various other intricate and in depth settings laid out as baseline options nor even touching character creation as far as traits skills and professions with the work they re doing for version 41 i m more than excited to see what comes next and happily ready to endorse this game and their developers it s currently fun to play with friends on 40 and extremely fun to play solo on 41 since it s not multiplayer compatible yet and this isn t even close to the finished product as stated at the beginning of the review the only downsides i ve found immediately apparent are the lack of seemingly common sense crafting options la makeshift and reclaimed utilities sheet crafted bindles and shoulderslings makeshift rawhide backpacks ripped sheet footwraps and such reminiscent of neo scavenger fortunately this is a minor downside as these kinds of things are easily accessible through the wonderful modding community this game has fostered so until they re brought into the game proper by the devs a band aid fix can be found for many of these in the workshop
