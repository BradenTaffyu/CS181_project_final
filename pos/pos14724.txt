2019 this is a great strategy game in sid meier s tradition with amazing tech and i personally love the city stat civics and all the gameplay editions civilization vi is offering really why all this bashing on civilization vi did any of you played civ v without expansions and dlc in its initial release it was one of the worst civilization to date and most of the people were saying how they preferred civ iv with all expansions again than civ v without expansions it was justified cause civ v was just a skeleton of a game in it s release no religion although the new skeleton no stacks of doom was better and so it grow to be better than it s predecessors now it s the same for vi though it s not justified cause it s the best initial release of civilization until now it s the first one that not only revolutionize like v unstacking cities but also having almost every feature of it s predecessors with expansion without expansions so please be mature and stop talking about the unit graphics and clash of clans and see the essence of this game which is much more strategic and full in its release it has the best skeleton to build upon also except units which for the first time have different looks in different civilizations without mods the map and cities are gorgeous and much much better than civ v with it s chaotic and ugly architecture of super one ultimate type cities and labyrinth of roads simplistic wonders in wrong place pyramids inside a frozen lake p with useless worker in every hex p s if you learn to play with unstacked cities you can never go back to the old mess same as when we learnt to play with unstacked units we couldn t go back overall i would say this is a must play game and really addictive down to its all cores
