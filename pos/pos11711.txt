2014 early access review i m changing my opinion on this game things are getting better especially with 1 or 2 mates to play with to share the experience getting less lag from the server we bought still the problem with the zombies is there but definitely getting better after a few days of gameplay i should say my opinion on this game it is extremely interesting in the contents altough results often laggy in a continuos way there s lot of loot to find expecially in single player and the crafting results quite challenging even if not complete yet unfortunately the zombies are a pain at night becoming undecently aggressive and spawning in masses givin you little time to explore during the day in order to spend most of your time crafting traps to protect yourself for the nightime this seems a good thing of the game but becomes easily boring and repetitive as the daytime is too short in my opinion for the day cycle to hold that kind of gameplay so i tried to opt for a no respawning of the zombies and the game became easily boring not because of my lack of creativity but because it s glitchy and often laggy when the game doesn t lag excessively rarely it s possible to build or mine but the process seems complicated i find it very difficult to place the blocks expecially the tall ones even building a small shelter becomes stressing this game has a lot of good premises but at the moment shouldn t cost so much
