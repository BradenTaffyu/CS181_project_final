2021 this game is dangerous when i first started playing i was like it s cool farming is fun but i don t really see the hype around it then i kept playing it s gotten so bad that i have 10 tabs open just to look up stuff on the wiki for this game i open the game and blink and two hours have passed and while i feel sad that i just lost so much time i look at the progress i made on my farm and think worth this is one of the most fun games i ve ever played it s designed in such a way that it allows both casual players and competitive optimization oriented players to have a blast with this game there is so much to do in this game and there s so much to offer you can spend your days farming fishing mining foraging talking to the villagers etc the game is made in a way in which you don t have to hyper optimize every little detail like min maxing profit time management etc because there s no time limit for things unless you count seasons but there s always another year and there s no stakes but if you want to you definitely can talking to the villagers is fun as well they re well designed and you can even find patterns in their daily schedules there s a lot of details in this game i haven t tried the multiplayer but from what i ve seen it can definitely be a lot more fun with friends but playing solo is extremely fun as well my only gripe with the game is that it s a huge time sink i waited until my semester was over to get into it because i heard about the time sink beforehand and i was glad i waited because all i can think about now is what crops am i going to plant next season where i should place them how much money am i making from these should i fish or mine did i feed my animals today did i talk to robin today and of course robin is best girl no discussion there
