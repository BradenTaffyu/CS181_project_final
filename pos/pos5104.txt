2016 after 60 hours of gameplay i feel have the complete picture about this game so i wanted to write about it long time ago when i was 18 and a beginner gamer i found out that i am into almost everything apocalyptic or post apocalyptic so much so that it kind of influenced me as a person and made me who i am today simply put i m a post apo freak d therefore i have seen things heard things played things enjoyed a lot of post apo media it s what i love but until recently fallout was something that kept escaping my attention there is no real reason for it it simply happend as it happened and i never played any fallout games ever i was told that it s something soooo like for me and that i should try it before i go stupid etc that was years ago finaly the planets aligned virgo entered mars and i bought a fallout game it was fallout 4 duh as a self named post apo expert i loved it as a self named video games expert i loved it as a descent but not so great pc owner i loved it as someone who expected 3 10 i give fallout 4 a huge 9 5 10 the storyline is great the world looks great the all in all impression of boston after nuclear fire is amazing it even made me go and google boston and see if bethesda was making it as realistic as possible a truly amazing experience so far i do have just a few issues with fallout 4 the lack of a developers presence on steam seems kind of discouraging and there are bugs in the game no matter what you do there will always be bugs in it but again there are not even close to making the game unplayable definitely worth the buy even at a full price recommended
