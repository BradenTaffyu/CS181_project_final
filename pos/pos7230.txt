2019 i love both ats and ets2 and would definitely recommend them to anyone it s surprisingly fun to spend hours driving back and forth through the states and not to mention it s amazing if you want to sit down and play something simple after a stressful day however it does have less content than ets2 american trucks are some of the most customised vehicles on the planet but ats has far less customisation options and interior cab customisations are practically non existant where as ets2 has bobble heads ceiling decorations air fresheners also with the roads being so long and straight road events such as toll roads help to keep you on your toes and immersed i know you can turn up road events ingame but this just adds road works my road event are on max and i can do an 18 hour journey without coming across any road events aside from the occasional person stood in the middle of the road in the middle of nowhere it would also be nice to have more truck manufacturers and model to choose from so aside from the few minor cons this really a fantastic game for such a simple idea and is definitely worth a try and good value for money as a message to the developers it d be awesome to see an alaska dlc for the opportunity of some ice road trucking with the incorporation of the ferry system from ets2 to get up there
