2023 i was genuinely surprised by how good this game was i was expecting some cute one dimensional rpg game about some depressed kid and his bubbly friends but got something completely unexpected the cute and horror elements flowed really nicely and storytelling was amazing the art and cutscenes are beautiful and it s what got me into doing art myself this really is a choices matter game which is exactly what i wanted i ve already completed it but because of the endless possibilities i wanna go back and replay it to find all the possible routes i could have taken and things i missed through my first playthrough this game isn t for everyone but i loved it 10 10
