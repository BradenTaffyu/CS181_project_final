2022 early access review i had cancer when i started the first year of university and unfortunately chemotherapy has left me with hand wrist pains an incredibly slow processing speed and chronic fatigue there s a lot of things i used to be able to do in real life and in gaming that i really miss i think playing this daily will help me a lot as well as helping me to get good at pvp games if my hand wrist pains eventually go away
