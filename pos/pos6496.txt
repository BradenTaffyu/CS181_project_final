2018 it s difficult to describe this game i like it a lot but if you watch someone play you might think it looks boring it s a simulator that you have to play yourself to really get the feel of it while it s certainly not action packed there is something enjoyable and even relaxing about this game pros plenty of roads and i mean plenty good graphics especially the landscapes very friendly community runs great i have never had any technical issues running this simulatorcons none that i can think of honestlyand please no jokes about asian or women drivers i am a very safe driver with a perfect record hehe
