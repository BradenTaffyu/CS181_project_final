2018 total 8 9 10honestly this is the best simulator game i have ever played 1 map 10 10 it happens that i have visited lemnos island in greece and i can say that those guys have done an extraordinary job 2 gameplay 9 10 it is more polished than the older armas but still it has this feeling like nothing is actually alive from the other hand it is really heroic to survive at this game every shot counts and you get obssessed to come back and play again 3 scenario 8 10 a little cliche but they managed to represent it that way so you actually get excited 4 graphics 8 10 for a 2013 game it should have way better graphics than it has also the explosions and npc deaths are really not good although there are some details that actually look so good that you get excited and forgive everything 5 sound 9 10 really good atmosphere you feel like you are actually there the soundtrack is also epic 6 mods 10 10 people do miracles 7 developers 10 10 it is well known that in real life the greek army arrested some of the team because they were taking photos of the army locations something that is strictly forbidden by most of the european countries there are also labels everywhere with signs not to take photos but those guys respected that instead of hating and they continued so we can have today this piece of art 8 characters environment 7 10 most of the locals don t look like greeks and none speeks greek i can hear a lot of russian accents and some arabic like turkish language although greek writing is all over the place and all of the locals have greek names except some little fantasy names that must be a combination of greek and latin the bad thing is that villages are dead its like a ghost town scenario no people and inside the houses there is absolutely nothing not even a table so i strongly recommend this game for now and for many more years to come
