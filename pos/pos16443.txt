2017 early access review what an absolute gem if you are into simulation games and cars like i am then this could be very well up your alley you play as a young man living in finland during the mid 90s your parents are away for the summer and you are left with a car to assembly from scratch the chassis is completely bare zero suspension componets no doors no body panels no interior no nothing the engine itself is in the same state disassembled all the way to the bare block crankshaft engine bearings connecting rods pistons all the way to the fan belt and individual spark plugs need to be installed correctly using the many different sized bolts that also need to be tightend properly on top of all this there is no tutorial i mean quite literally no help at all you are left to figure out everything on your own luckiley there are some very nice write ups available online that can act as a very helpful resoruce to have when assembling your car for the first time yes i said first time because it wont be your last time you have the engine apart but more on that later fast forward to after you have the engine completely assembled chassis is assembled engine is installed topped off with oil coolant brake fluid clutch fluid you pour some gasoline into the tank you re ready to fire it up for the first time you pull the choke out turn the key give it a bit of throttle and she is alive the sound of the engine starting up for the first time is very very rewarding but wait it runs like crap and wont idle time to get out your screwdriver and get back under the hood cause the carburetor needs to be tuned okay now that you managed to get it to idle on its own at this point all you want to do it drive the damn car already so you put it in gear pull out of your garage and begin driving up the dirt road for the first time but wait something is still wrong the car is pulling drastically to one side and it impossible to drive straight thats because you didnt align the front tires time to get back under the car to fix the alingement now with that done you figure it would be a great idea to drive up to the market to pick up some food and some smokes while testing your car yes this is also a survival game you have needs that need to be full filled hunger thirst bladder stress dirtiness sleep all need to be taken care of either by chain smoking cigerattes drinking beer peeing on the floor eatting entire packs of sasuages or taking a nice hot sauna okay now you remember when i said all the bolts in the process of assembly need to be tightend properly if your first time was anything like mine you probably will forget to tighten atleast one bolt in my case it was one of the bolts that held the head of the engine to the block i made it about a mile up the road before i heard a loud thud noise and the engine died didnt take much investiagting to discover the head has completely detacted from the rest of the engine block so you would think there would be a easy way to recover your car in the event you crashed or have broken down but nope gotta walk all the way back home and use either the van or tractor to tow the car back got my car back home reattached the head after having to hunt for my lost head gasket okay now im finally confident that my car can make the journey to the store i drive all the way there no problem fill my car with fuel get my sasuages my smokes and a cold crate of beer pay the funny finnish man at the counter and hop back in my car to head home but wait whats going on car wont start well thats because i was driving my car at 7k rpm the entire time on the highway and didnt pay attention to my temp gauge or the steam coming from my hood and have damaged my pistons at this point i figure it would be easier just to start a new game fresh then to go through the trouble of towing my car back and pulling the engine apart again i d like to add that some of the main components of the engine head gasket pistons rocker shaft crankshaft water pump alternator and fan belt all have a wear system to them so the more you drive your car and the more you beat on it the more these parts are weared down some faster then others so at some point you are going to have to rebuild just about the entire engine your 2nd time around you will have a good idea of the things to do and not to do i highly recommend buying the racing radiator before ever really driving your car at speed you can make money various ways in the game such as sucking out septic tanks with the sewage truck cutting and delivering firewood making homemade alcohol to sell and giving a drunk man a ride home from the bar money in which can be used for buying groceries and upgrades to your car upgrades include carburetors wheels racing seats gauges exhaust systems cosmetic bits and even nitrous oxide there is no real end goal to the game except i suppose placing 1st in the rally race that is held on saturdays i know my review was more of just a description of the game and my first experience with it rather then pointing of specific pros or cons but i feel its the only way for me to give you an idea of what makes this game so awesome if any of this sounds like the type of game you would like buy it seriously buy it easily my favorite indie game but just be warned this game will greatly test your patience if you lack proper patience this may not be a game for you
