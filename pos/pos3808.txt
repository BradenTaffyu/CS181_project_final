2022 symphony of war is not only a homage to games such as final fantasy tactics and ogre tactics but also presents an evolution of the genre in modern times beneath the surface of its mediocre presentation lies an incredibly deep and well thought out of game with a fantastic class system as well as great customisation and squad building mechanics i would not exaggerate to say that this game alone provided me with more fun than most titles this year alone not only is there a complete drought of tactical turn based rpgs but very few give you an opportunity to manipulate character squad progression to this degree the fact that the game was made in rpgmaker does not at all prevent it from achieving its potential albeit where the game could use further improvements lies in the ux ui work and character writing with the former having the developer s full attention in future updates the story is serviceable although it suffers from predictability and a juvenile dialogue with zero cutscene dialogue options this would be cost effective to improve for the developer so fingers crossed the sequel brings in better written characters and a more fleshed out story the music and sound effects do a good job as well helping to set the right tone for the campaign the game length is great too although i kept wanting to play more and would wish for more side quests where only once in the game s progression does it occur this is offset by the arena fights available upon finding the relevant tokens in summary sow has been an incredible bucket load of fun i would encourage support for the developer and the project the game has an immensely satisfying and deep gameplay loop in spite of the limitations in its visual and story presentation truly one of my personal highlights of the year
