2017 if you like divinity original sin you ll love this game plays like the first but with a lot more to do in battles around the world and interacting with npcs and your party theres that same humor that the last game had so youll still find those flavor items and people in the world the graphics are beautiful and the world looks vibrant and captivating the writing is as good if not better then dso with an added narrator and voices with every npc battles are like they were in the original but they d added more spells and abilites as well as an armor mechanic for both physical and magical damage over all a great game 23 5 hours
