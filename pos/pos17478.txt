2016 i ve just finished a 23 hour dwarf campaign before writing this review this review is targeted towards those familiar with other tw games for newer players let me just say that this game is a perfect starting point if you are looking to get into the series pros campaign i was always detracted from finishing long campaigns before it was often grindy and finishing was just a formality the restrictions to settling in this game actually help with this it allows you to interact with other factions as friends foes rather than future property of me i was skeptical with this change but it gave a refreshing amount of direction to my campaign that said i am still going to use the upcoming conquer the map mod but perhaps not all of the time the chaos event was fun in a way that wasnt also annoying i m looking at you rome ii ia civil war combat combat is meaty cannons sound amazing lords smack away soldiers like sauron from lord of the rings unit design and animations utilize the fantasy setting very well map landscapes are varied and gorgeous in all i found myself using auto resolve less than my first campaigns in other titles ui and control is closest to attila difficulty there was an artifical difficulty on easy normal in the last titles where you would have hordes of one city factions with an army or two complicating your movements in this game confederations are usually established by the midgame allowing much more epic fights with much more balanced enemies the easy normal difficulties have never been more accurate i have yet to test higher but i ve watched heirofcarthage hard vh and legendoftotalwar legendary and i can say that challenge is alive in full force you can take a look at thier lps to be the judge depth generals and agents have a depth that was previously only achived with mods like ttt if you play chaos and want to field lots of armies you might choose to be a better leader for marauder units since you will have a lot of them if you play dwarves like me you can make your general better at setting up underground ambushes for all of those pesky orks this can only get better with expansions and mods the faction leader quests involve epic scripted battles that were tons of fun system i would be shocked if i had to wait over 10 seconds for an end turn in my first campaign most were 5 seconds i have an i5 4690 with the game loaded on an ssd with a gtx 970 i was able to run on ultra with only a few frames dropped here and there though not everyone plays with my system this is a pro since on the same system both rome ii and attila run much much worse cons towns towns have not have a lot of depth since empire maybe shogun 2 besides a few regions that have a special building chain to encourage you to think you will very quickly find the right buildings to build in your 6 4 4 4 i think this was the intent i suggest a return to population and more ways to affect region wealth outside of buildings and building modifiers popluation taxes trade wealth made empire one of my favorites despite the awful combat and ai food and sanitation are gone i don t mourn thier passing but it does leave less to manage agents it is difficult to keep up with the ai in terms of agent levels in the early game on easy the ai was fielding lvl 11 agents while i had lvl 4 success against ai agents was in the range of 20 with an equal amount to injury enemy agents would succeed often and kill my own making it ever more diffucult to catch up deployment grants almost no exp a level every 8 turns or more it seems the game wants you to utilize army placement but even then i could not keep up i think the numbers just need a small revisiting to fix this issue you get agent spammed less but your agents feel about as useful in campaign action as in empire total war pretty bad i am happy this review is done because i really want to start another campaign this game is a must buy for tw veterans or fans of the warhammer ip as it fits with the gameplay so well tldr yes buy
