product received for free early access review project zomboid is the zombie survival game i m someone who has the most fun gaming when i can really get into the character i am playing zomboid lets you be who you want to be in the zombie apocalypse whether it s a park ranger who built a home in the woods away from society or a fire fighter whose lost his purpose in life and now just hacks zombies down all day all the way to the mechanic father who s looking for his daughter you can get even more creative in co op a fitness instructor and his obese student struggling to stay alive together the possibilities for creativity in this game are endless and i ve only talked about the character creator i cannot recommend this game enough if you have even the slightest of interest in zombie games i get so invested in my character and what they themselves would do in the situation they re placed in that i forget i m playing a game sometimes 10 10
