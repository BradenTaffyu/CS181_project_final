overall i love the game it seems to incorporate most of the best things about my favorite total war titles and adds some new features that are really interesting it gets a lot of hate from other reviewers but these days what doesn t never the less i think it could have benefited from more play testing many aspects of game play are rough and or confusing look below for the good the bad and the ugly the good how it is like or sometimes better than other tactical games chariots unsurprisingly egypt s are the best chariots are the only apparent cavalry unit and this was the period when they were mainly used you can really see the strengths and weaknesses of them in battle they can smash through most light units but they struggle in pitched melee keep them moving great battle mechanics and unit balance it is equally possible to win a battle against overwhelming odds or to loose against a seemingly weak opponent it comes down to the general i e the player as much as the troops elite units are better obviously but you can still get a lot done with a relatively basic force battlefield weather and terrain are fun mud thunderstorms trees burning forests and more all combined into interesting dynamic maps there is a lot to exploit many ways to approach a tactical problem and unit abilities can really shine if deployed correctly love that beautiful art work and modeling the aesthetic is very appropriate for the depicted period it makes me feel like gilgamesh stomping around mount lebanon you can almost taste the bronze it tastes of blood zoomed in campaign map the areas that once contained 2 4 settlements in old games eg lower egypt in rome ii now contain dozens this makes the relatively small geographic area feel reasonably big native unit recruitment you can build a native recruitment building in each region province and recruit a limited roster of the local troops some are better than others as egypt i fielded many native desert armies that enjoyed bonuses in their favored terrain regions very useful for securing your borders settlement outposts these are useful for the owner bonuses exploitable by the invader sackable raisable i especially like the forts and warriors refuge buildings they help you secure your settlements without committing expensive units at full upkeep forts cost half upkeep for the stationed units and allow you to customize your garrisons i have a warriors refuge up to 6 non faction units that has repeatedly defeated much larger armies when attacked don t mess with old warriors generals do not age at least not in any way i can see i hated in the former games where your favorite commander faction leader would age 4 years in one turn i know why they did it that way before they wanted to encourage the player to get out there and do things not just sit in their capitol clicking next turn that said i like being able to decide that for myself campaign customization a handy feature that makes for improved replay ability and tune ability chariots i know i know i said that before i just really like chariots the bad mostly campaign mechanics hopefully they fix these things in future updates the endless invasion of sea peoples is a bit tedious i feel like the sea invaders come too early and too frequently and are a bit predictable aimless even the inexorable tide can be broken but there is little room for empire building especially if you have coastal settlements to defend after you beat back four or five waves it gets a bit boring diplomacy is not very dynamic by default most factions of a specific culture have the same diplomatic traits except the playable lords they don t seem to start many wars not with the player or one another they just sit there defending their territory this makes interacting with your neighbors pretty humdrum campaign customization can help the options exist but you have to suffer through the default state before you know what you want to change not enough unit trait details this is an old gripe i have with the total war games many unit traits are completely hidden or only show up if you know where to look eg ranged unit accuracy is hidden in the ranged damage stat and accuracy matters it makes it difficult to judge what units you want to recruit and how you want to deploy them i understand the argument for not pulling back the curtain on some things the player doesn t always need to know how the sausage is made but i m a nuts and bolts kind of guy i like the details and i have seen sausage being made then i ate the sausage it was delicious it is ok to let people have a peek if they are interested the game is short on historical information especially on the gods it falls short of the admittedly high standard set in previous tw games you have to dig for what details were included i am relatively new to this period of history and would love to know more about it you can tell the developers did their research why not share with the players i don t need a textbook of info but would appreciate more than is currently there the ugly not necessarily good or bad more kind of off to the side you know resource management this is what seems to get the most gripe on the negative reviews there are five resources food stone wood bronze and gold different settlements produce different resources mostly food some produce a mix unit recruitment and upkeep involves food for all units duh plus bronze for mid tier units soldiers need gear plus gold for elite units this can make fielding large elite armies punishingly expensive a player must balance their armies according to their resources this can be challenging but sensible budgeting deployment and diplomacy trade can make up for most shortfalls its more to deal with but not that much more rich stone deposits at first i thought that the displayed deposit values default 20 000 were all the stone that was available in the region and when it ran out that was it so i demolished my stone producing buildings when the deposit hit zero i was wrong the rich deposit just gives a bonus until it runs out at which point output drops by half this was unclear in game and kind of messed up my first campaign choose your path player can select their campaign goal shortly after starting the game there are many options within the two courts egyptian or hittite but only one middle road destruction this makes the canaanite factions a bit awkward to play if you want to run a cautious or defensive campaign could use more options there neighbors routinely trespass this can be alarming but they are usually just on their way to fight an army of sea peoples it would be nice if they respected borders though makes me miss the warn trespasser button from tw warhammer many aspects of game play are under described could use more adviser hints especially for newer features there are tutorial tours for some of these aspects which can help but they could be better and more numerous you can figure it out but the devs could have made it easier clearer an overall rushed to completion feel it almost plays like an early access game not as bad as the haters make it seem but not great either a little more polish could go a long way interacting with fort and refuge garrisons requires a general you cannot dismiss the units without pulling one of your commanders off the front line or recruiting a new one i also wish i could dismiss assign or otherwise make changes to the garrison commander who stays there all the time and counts as one of the stationed units up to 6 for warriors refuge up to 10 for forts not a huge deal but kind of clunky hope this helps and if it doesn t well moloch take yoouu rrrraaaagghhhh now i m going to go play the game some more
