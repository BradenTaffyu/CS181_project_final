2016 pros great atmosphere smooth combat and looting system interesting companions constant discovery great crafting system awesome base building system if you are into these kind of things quality voice acting hidden stories you can discover humour lets you play after completing the main storycons watered down rpg elements the new dialouge system is too simple lack of real choices in the end you dont feel you made a difference you get the same cutscene however companions and npcs are reacting to some of your choices but its not like the end of fallout 3 or nv some faction missions are too similar to each other every faction has a few repetitive side quests which is quite annoying once you rescued the 20th kidnapped settler bugs and glitches i had to mess with the console sometimes because my companion wouldnt talk or my quest didnt begin properly if you are a hardcore fallout fan and you are looking for a game like fallout 3 or new vegas you re going to be dissapointed i can understand why fans were upset but despite of all the cons i can recommend you this game because its not bad at all its just not what a lot of us expected
