2020 early access review really well made game it s everything someone would ask for if they were looking for a survival based story mode game it really does give you an immersive experience that you control which i also love sometimes you can t progress unless you hit a certain point but this game actually does the opposite playing with friends makes it an amazing bonus i recommend to my friends
