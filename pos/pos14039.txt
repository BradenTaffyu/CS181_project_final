2018 early access review disclaimer english is not my native language this game is so addicting that i don t dare to play it unless i have a whole day free i meant a whole day with me got nothing to do or any kind of plan with others because everytime i start to play this game i ended up not eating nor drinking for 12 hours straight and i will continue playing it until i can t keep awake anymore that s how addictive this game is that s all i can say about this game it s very very very fun but it does still missing quite a lot of thing and hopefully the dev will add it later but even then this game is already very very addictive if you are into management type of games then this game is for you
