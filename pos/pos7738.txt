2014 early access review i purchased this game since day 1 and i am very very glad i did i have seen the development of the game grow from the start the developers have been amazing keeping us informed of the status of the game with consistant detailed dev blog s an amazing game with the best physics engine for vehicles out there from crashes weight of the vehicle traction torque everything is incredibly accurate there is so much to do with many many hours of fun from using community made mods such as vehicles maps objects and much more cruising around the beautiful maps re enacting crash scenes racing demoilition derby the list goes on it may seem as if i have only been on this game for a couple of hours but i can assure you i have played this game well over 100 hours
