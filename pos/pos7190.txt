2021 well i ve both game in my library ets and ats though i like ats more because it s just feels different i just can t explain it well but surely this game is magical elixir for people who are facing anxiety depression during pandemic time it s really works like a drug and instant anxiety reliever simulation features are perfect and gives you real life driving simulator experience no doubt why reviews are overwhelmingly positive it s awesome game to try with steering wheel i am really enjoying it and looking forward to buying all remaining dlc if they decide to low down prices little bit in sale time overall must game for people who want to experience real truck driving buy without hesitation and support the developers
