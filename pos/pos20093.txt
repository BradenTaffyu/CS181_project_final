2022 i ll be honest was initially a little underwhelmed when i began my play through i obviously had to endure the u shaped tutorial roadside assistance of a fdic compliant car insurance group that basically guides you through the southern map like a tesla vehicle but then i found it new vegas and what did i find ghoul prostitutes i banged i bumped and i gnawed on some leathery gash i m not gonna lie though i was still a little disappointed i tried to recruit all the children in the vegas strip area into a death before dishonor style child army but obviously obsidian isn t ready to let us live in a real acopolyptic world oh and by the way i took you down house never forget
