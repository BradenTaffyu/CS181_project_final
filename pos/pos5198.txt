2017 from someone who has played every fallout game and tes game i can say that fallout 4 is a great game you ll see a lot of reviews about how this game is unimaginative and lacks the rpg elements that the series is known for this is kinda silly since fallout 3 and nv have very little rpg aspects in the first place all games have level systemperkscraftingopen world explorationside questmain story with multiple outcomesactually it s kinda hard to find something in 3 and nv that makes them seem more rpg like except maybe one thing the voiced protagonist is a double edged sword it adds quality and refinement to the game but very much limits the overall options you would normally get i also dislike the short descriptions of the options that you do get i like the voice protagonist but it most certainly has some steep limitations is it a good game yes but it does have some issues that you would come to accept from any game made on the creation engine is is a good fallout game yes it feels like fallout and it has the same charm its had since the beginning combat the combat in this game is leaps and bounds better than any fallout game ever it makes the older games feel unplayable atmosphere with better visuals and an insane amount of detail fallout 4 is on par or better than the older titles performance with most systems you can get 60 fps on high in the wasteland no problem but when you enter the cities well unless you have a gtx 1080ti or a rx 580 with an i7 i would expect nothing more than 40 fps average story yeah it s not great finally my favorite part music i m not talking about the stuff you hear on the radio i mean the background music is amazing fallout nv was a lot better in this department than fallout 3 but fallout 4 takes this to a very high new level it does an exceptional job at putting you in the mind set of what area you re currently in the word streamlined gets tossed around this game and skyrim as well i would say that it s true when you play oblvion morrowind you really feel like the world is completely open to you the world just seem so much bigger than how most other games feel going along the roads in oblivion to find and inn to stay in just to wake up with this mysterious character watching you is just something most games don t do anymore in conclusion fallout 4 is streamlined but it s a fun game to play and if i wanted to play a fallout game where the second to second gameplay is the best i would go with this one p s this is not a detailed review and it shows a lot of pros to this game but there are a lot of cons about this game if you want to see those go to another review because there is no shortage of them
