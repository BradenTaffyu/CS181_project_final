2014 okay here s my verdict on total war rome ii when i was looking into buying this game i read through some of the reviews many of them being negative this really surprised me seeing all the previous games empire total war shogun ii etc were all quite awesome so disregarding the many negative reviews i went out and bought it anyways and that was the best decision ever as i was playing the game it came to my why so many people were hating this game there is no easy solution you can t just shoot your way out of everything as in battlefield or call of duty if you are expecting a quick and easy thrill stop hit the back arrow and buy a fps game this game is not for the faint of heart it s a strategy game for crying out loud so all the reviews complaining about how ing hard the game is you should really just get a life as i said before if you don t like games that go deeper than point and shoot you should never play the game also about all the comments of the glitches and such i m pretty sure that they are all fixed now i have not experienced any yet so now down to the business of actually reviewing this game pros graphics are great if you ve the hardware to do it it s really worth a look with the added 4tpy 4 turns per year your generals and agents last longer also the seasons look really good too cons there s not very many cons just a few for me what is with the unit cards they look like cave drawings these always looked better in previous games the encyclopedia total war what were you thinking what you had in every other game up to shogun ii was working perfectly fine now it s dependant on the internet is not laid out nicely and is a pain to use bring back the old one please and lastly a bit of nostalgia from the first rome anyone else remember when you could click on a city and view the city in real as you flew through the city you could see the barracks you built and that lovely shrine to athena why why is that gone overall though i love this game every time i sit down to play this game i put on my laurel wreath and say with conviction veni vidi vici i came i saw i conquered so really if you want a challenge i dare you to play this game otherwise just go back to whatever else you play
