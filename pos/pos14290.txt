2023 early access review i played this game for about 20 minutes one day and decided that the movement was clunky dropped it immediately i picked the game back up about a year after that and immediately lost my life progressing to the very end of the game it s a masterpiece watching your starter base slowly unfold into a robust interconnection of planet wide factories across the stars to create dyson spheres is just a breathtaking experience i don t think anyone can recommend this game enough just don t give up in the beginning because the controls are weird you get used to it and you ll thank this review later
