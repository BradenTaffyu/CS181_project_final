2023 after 170 hours my overall experience is that i ve loved it so far please note i have only played up to season 2 dlc at this point also this is assuming you can look passed the whole ubisoft connect thing i know we all hate it but if you can just kinda pretend it isn t there you re in for a good time the good lovely soundtrack looks great runs smoothly can be a really relaxing experience vs easier ai or no ai starts of slow but the more islands and regions you build the more complex it becomes can play co op with a friend and build up the same islands together which is nice can be as challenging or as chilled as you like based on difficulty and number of ai stamps are now in the game which is nice basically you can create templates which greatly increase the speed at which you can place down a design for infrastructure the bad combat is really not amazing and seems to be a bit of an after thought the ai build so many defences that you would need a large fleet to take them out and that is going to take a loooong time before you can get there plus as soon as you or an ai declares war your trade network just gets obliterated as they pass by enemy islands on their merry and doomed way so for me at least that kind of forces the buy them out route but good that this is at least an option i guess the balancing of resources using the in game statistics although not terrible is not the most informative using some basic maths the closest you re going to get to figuring out how much you need to send import to different islands is an educated guess the campaign isn t the best as the story is kinda meh but you don t play it for the story really overall if you like tropico cities skylines type games you will most likely love this edit i would possibly recommend playing the base game first both to see how you like it without spending too much and not to overwhelm yourself with content if you like the base game start introducing season packs as suits you
