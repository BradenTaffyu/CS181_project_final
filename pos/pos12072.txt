2022 let me guess you ve come all the way down here to the reviews to see if the subscription is worth it of not let me try to give you an answer by asking you a very simple question exactly how far do you want to go into the dark dark world that is simracing or how die hard do you want to be in simracing if you just want to dip your toes in an try it i d suggest you look elsewhere try titles like assetto corsa ect ac has good physics imo good graphics with content manager and sol and a ton of content whether its dlc or modded content you can pick the game up with all the dlc for like less than 10 usd on sale and it usually is but if you are the die hard go ahead pick up iracing you might just enjoy it as much as i do
