2020 i regularly complain and rant about this game in my various posts on the feed and in some of my screenshots probably giving others the impression that i hate it no i don t hate it if i don t enjoy a game i drop it even if i ve played it for several minutes only i played this for 541 hours and counting it s actually my favorite fallout game there s no question that the roleplaying aspect quests characters companions and writing were abysmal and here s where i start to sound like a broken record and i hated with passion the fact that you have to join one of the factions all of which were annoying to be able to finish the main story worse for the minutemen or institute you re forced to become the leader but you do nothing but run errands more suited for lackeys it s like the janitor ordering the ceo to do nothing but menial tasks and the ceo can t say no it s not impossible to make the pc feel like an actual leader bioware did it in dragon age inquisition with the war table thing and those parts where you render judgment on captives far from perfect but better than in fallout 4 i would have left the main story hanging and instead just do side quests and the dlc but there was no other way to make my character shut up about muh baby which she conveniently forgot about when doing those 10 unrelated side quests i had no problem with the basic story itself but the execution was terrible mods and a bit of imagination can only go so far to fix the problems there the side quests weren t much better either most of them end up with you killing everything that s red in vats pretty much anything that moves with a fetch quest here and there and the stupidity it s not even the funny self aware kind of stupidity it s more of the facepalm inducing type that was supposed to be taken seriously to mention a few again there s the factions that make you a member or their leader after doing a few fetch kill quests then there s those defend the settlement quests where you have to drop whatever you re doing wherever you are because your settlement that s full of laser turrets can t defend itself without you there s also the end of the far harbor dlc main story where i literally wanted to yell objection with the phoenix wright pointy finger even if the npcs were arguing in my favor heck that s exactly what i imagine would happen if we were to have jury trial in my country shudder oh wait so i guess it s somewhat realistic xdback to the topic and enough with the complaints you get the picture the game is flawed despite those complaints and also despite it being an objectively terrible rpg as a game i still like it more than new vegas my second favorite fallout game and a good rpg because i prefer fallout 4 s setting for exploration it s prettier the combat is fun playing as a sarcastic jerk is fun half the time when the voice acting was on point i got the effect i wanted my character sounded like she was getting fed up with all the bs and the blatant idiocy and most important of all unlike new vegas which froze crashed a lot when i last played it in my most recent run of fallout 4 probably around 100 hours it crashed only 3 times so far i ll mark it recommended because there are no neutral or it depends options i can recommend it but it s not for everyone if you re looking for a proper rpg stay far away from this play new vegas if still haven t played it yet if you want an open world shooter with rpg elements you like taking screenshots mindless exploration and combat and can overlook a bit lot of nonsense in the story etc you might enjoy fallout 4
