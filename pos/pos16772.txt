2018 i waited so long for this to come out and i cannot stop playing it i m so pleased with how it came out of course i have a high end pc and have very little issues with lag or fps drops i have logged 27 hours already in this game and intend to play a ton more suggestion i d like to do work on the outside of homes making gardens free reign over making the house bigger and adding additional rooms etc also would love to see more furniture paints floorings c but so far i m in love even without those suggestions the game is really damn good i ve had such an incredible time working on houses and decorating to my hearts content d
