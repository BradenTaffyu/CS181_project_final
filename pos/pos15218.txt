2018 i want to start from saying that although the game is free on android it s a completely different game on pc and totally worth 10 pros 1 the game runs really good on bad systems like mine 2 it has good customization which keeps getting better with the body kits they add on the new updates3 it has amazing physics and supports all kinds of wheels and controllers4 great community and friendly people on the servers5 big variety of cars to drive most of them are locked on android version and require special coins to unlock which you usually get with real money so that s a nice feature that you can buy all the cars with ingame money6 realistic car tuning you can tune pretty much everything on the car from tire pressure to suspension shiftness which can help set your car just as you likecons1 altough there are plenty of tracks some of them are not ideal for drifting when the game specializes on drifting and they are not played on online2 the game doesn t get updated oftenly 3 the dlc s are kinda expensive in my opinion 4 for a dlc with 3 cars in it is kinda overpriced and that s the reason i don t have any of themi have plenty of hours on the game and i definitally recommend buying it it s really fun with friends and totally worth the 10
