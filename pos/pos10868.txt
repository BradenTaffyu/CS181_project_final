2016 so i bought this game today i went through the tutorial and continued as italy started wwii by accident from a war with greece ended up controlling half of europe then started laughing to myself in a cynical power crazed way although i only have 5 hours on this game i already feel i know what i m doing it has a great tutorial and is easy to learn one thing i d just like to add as i found this rather funny i played as usa and decided lets become facist so i started growing facism in my nation and after a year i had an option to begin a civil war for facism i though yes this is great all i need is to defeat some democratic rebels and im good turns out no i became a tiny little nation at war with usa and from national focuses i chose earlier all of south america joined the americans and i thought surely im i then had adolf hitler himself offer to join the war at this point i was rather confused as i wasnt in a faction with the axis but i though hey dont question it after about 2 1 2 of playing i won the civil war and became the glorious facist usa and just as i was really getting into it and as i was ready to destroy the ussr the great commander of the facist usa had to go for his dinner goodbye life hello hoi 4
