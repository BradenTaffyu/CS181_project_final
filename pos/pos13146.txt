2015 i ve only had this game for a month and i ve already logged over 50 hours into it kerbal space program is not simply a game about building rockets launching them and seeing where they go its tagline is conquering space was never this easy and that is true it is easy compared to doing it in real life but don t let it fool you ksp actually has a pretty steep learning curve in the month that i ve had this game i ve only just gotten my first satellite into orbit of kerbin ksp s version of earth i haven t even gotten to a single moon or other planet but don t let that deter you look up tutorials for the game side note the in game tutorials are actually pretty terrible i recommend finding ones online such as scott manley s who does a great job of explaining how the game works the sense of accomplishment you get when you do accomplish those tasks even if it s just setting up a simple probe like i did is phenomenal and from what i ve seen once you do manage to master the game you can do basically anything never give up all in all kerbal space program is not just a game it s a lifestyle 10 10
