2021 b me maybe like 2012 see one of your fave ytbers at the time play the original game wow this is really cool and unique play the game merciless yet quiet and peaceful exp for the most part i never got anywhere exciting or more difficult than the surface due to being total garbage b me again xmas of 2015 get this game play it with my homies literally the same exp but even better due to multiple units cooperating on an open field late autumn arrives hound attack everything you grinded on for like two days is gone quit game that was fun terrible 4chan board post style imitation aside this is the well deserved multiplayer sequel to tim burton s wet dream as seen in two dimensions it has stood the test of time as a game where both the developers and players are figuratively speaking butting heads for which can put more passion into what they do with it lacing together a style so unnervingly pleasing as this with some of the most unforgiving and merciless gameplay ever seen in a semi popular indie game don t starve together is an endlessly enjoyable experience with one of the most active playerbases i ve ever seen for a steam release of this caliber
