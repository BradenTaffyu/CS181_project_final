2018 kunos i m actually incredibly proud of you and your team you took this game from an early access hodgepodge of bugs and turned it into a future classic gt3 racing title i recently got back on this game after all sorts of major patches and changes were made and i must say i am incredibly impressed with how far you ve taken this game when i first got the ea of the game i was honestly starting to get a little skeptical if this title would ever live up to the ambitions set fourth for it s roadmap ffb early on was a disaster optimization was dog doodoo and there were tons of other issues here and there but having a fresh look on this game it s as if i playing a completely different game from how much it s been improved very good job i would highly recommend this game to anyone who want s a true gt3 experience this is the best gt3 sim racing package you can get and you can put your faith in kunos to keep delivering you better and better updates to this already stunningly impressive game
