2016 if you re a newcomer to the series i have a few simple advice for ya death is the core mechanic of the game so dont afraid to die if you are about to smash your monitor quit the game for 30mins or more then come back and try again or try again the next day dont cheat and dont lookup on the internet for guide maps tips or weapon location et cetera i know its tempting to googling for all the secrets and hidden paths or location for all items and armors but leave that for your 2nd playthrough the less you know the more you gonna enjoy the game i bet on my life that a lot of people would wish to play any souls game for the first time again lastly if you havent play the original ds please do
