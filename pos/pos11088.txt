2021 so its been a month and ive played this game almost religiously since launch im a big fan of the older operation genesis game the first game was disappointing at first but grew into a great game this game is most defiantly better than the first its kept my attention much longer and has more customization options except individual trees not the biggest deal in my opinion but i know lots of people are upset about that few problems that i found work around s forbugged dino ai mainly happens to carnivores because the goats bug out which in turn bugs the carnivores when they try to hunt it also can happen when the ai can t figure out social interactions so the dinos sit locked in place the only other way i ve found to reliably reset the ai is to exit to title or quit the game and return to last save luckily if you save even with the bug active it still resets the ai and murders the bugged goats hopefully this gets ironed out by frontier my other small complaints are apparently being addressed after dec 9th update soo may update this review as i go also sandbox kinda needs either a god scientist who can do synthesis and incubation instantly or just add a no scientist feature and a no combat button would be loved now for the good cute animations beautiful graphics and maps the animations for hunting make muuuuuch better sense dino territories pack hunting marine and flying creatures a good way to chill and be annoyed at tornadoes less boring down time
