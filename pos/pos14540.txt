2016 9 10after 20 hours of play i can easily say this is the best civ on release easily a 9 10 there is a lot more strategic depth and player options than there were in vanilla civ 5 is civ 6 perfect no there are definitely a few tweaks needed especially to the ai which does some silly things and gets annoying bonuses king difficulty which i am really not a fan of there are few strange ui design choices overall pretty good though mostly clear and consice and diplomacy victory which is something i quite enjoyed has been removed saying that for every small problem i have there are 3 or 4 great changes great people system government types and policies tweaks to combat and movement housing and amenities in individual cities etc etc i love the changes to districts and wonders it makes terrain and planning extremely important there s a lot of changes which can t be summed up in this small review however unlike civ 5 and civ 4 i dont think 2 major expansions are needed before a buy this is already a great game worth your money and after after some patching and tweaks to the ai and ui and hopefully an awesome expansion to add diplomactic victory back this will easily be the best civ to date
