2022 early access review if you re curious about traditional roguelikes but you re put off by having to learn 100 ish key combinations just to play one effectively like cataclysm dark days ahead a free traditional roguelike i ve sunk over 1 000 hours into probably then is probably the best entry point into the genre there are three reasons i recommend as a beginner friendly traditional roguelike 1 excluding the directional keys you only need to learn like 10 hotkeys a lot of the time the ui also shows which keys to press to do what 2 permadeath is optional hardcore fans argue the way death is handled permadeath is part of the definition of roguelikes but i disagree lets you choose 3 the game doesn t skimp on its own lore there s a large backstory behind the game s world unlike df which also has a roguelike adventure mode in case you didn t know and procedurally generated lore only acts as filler around the main lore of the game lastly i have advice for getting into the game 1 i recommend using a preset character while you re learning i ve realized they re built to be combat viable from initial spawn in allowing you to focus on learning how the combat system works instead of forcing you to trial and error your way into building a character that can survive the first few levels 2 start in joppa and look up beginners guides by dr incompetent on youtube he ll talk about the basics of gameplay and how to get into that gameplay 3 the game world mechanically gets more difficult as you travel from west to east the western end of the map is for early game and as you go east you get into midgame and then endgame difficulties
