2021 early access review so i guess i should review this game now xdhad it for almost 2 years and been an absolute blast it is incredibly relaxing and overall simple with a pretty engaging story not lore wise i tend to ignore that bit you start off just wondering the ocean and collecting trash to build and expand and float from island to island the story has you constantly going from one point to another using a map radar and you come across some fun places for sure it isn t over the top and i think for 20 you ll easily get 20 or more hours out of it coop is a real blast too and few bugs moderators on the forums are friendly and helpful and the developers are adding even more to the story when i started they had just added one new big island now there was 2 additional ones and more to come when i say big i mean the islands locations easily take up to 30 mins to fully explore some even an hour or more worth the price for sure if you are into survival games edit oh before i forgoet important info your starting raft is the center point and original 4 foundations of your raft should be remembered if you are going to build an incredibly large raft by center point i mean it is what determines the spawn in spawn out radius if you stop on an island and dont anchor your raft your raft will eventually float away far enough for the island to despawn though the distance is incredibly far for that to happen just know that those original 4 points is what determines spawn in spawn out radius
