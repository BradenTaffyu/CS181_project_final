2022 edit the review below was based on version 1 8 since update 1 9 i would no longer recommend this title acc is not a game as such its much more of a sim than a game the career mode is just racing against bots no story animations or cut scenes etc if you want an idea of how hard this game is go to any driving game you own and turn off all assists although there is traction control and abs in acc its still not easy and turn up the difficulty to max you need to practice and practice and practice and probably need learn some advanced driving techniques just to get up to race speed acc is the official gt3 game and as such it is restricted to just the cars and tracks from the gt3 series there are also gt4 s essentially slower gt3 s available as an add on but no one really races them some may see this as a bad thing but this does mean that they only have to concentrate on 1 style of physics and they have done the gt3 cars justice then there s the setup of the cars you have a choice you can buy them from a 3rd party or learn the art yourself i warn you its not that easy the tyres are the easiest part of the setup and the one part you will have to use all of the time the tyres are everything in this game get the pressures temps wrong and you will not be able to drive fast and will probably spend all your time sliding and spinning out you need the correct temps to have decent grip you will need to drive multiple laps return to the garage adjust your tyre setup then go back and drive a few more laps and rinse and repeat until you have the desired temps psi this may need 6 8 laps to achieve the desired temps and that is just for the track temperature that you happen to be on at the time change lobby or track temp and you will have to do all this over again it does get easier to do over time as you get the hang of it i wouldn t really recommend you play on a joypad it is doable but not ideal i d think you would struggle to be competitive but if you must i d suggest to find a good guide on how to adjust your pad there is a great one on here for those that do like the format and physics of this game it can get expensive and i am not talking add ons etc i am 800 in so far on a wheelbase load cell pedals stand for the wheel and pedals and a gt style wheel just because and this is the cheap gear thrustmaster you can easily spend 3000 to 5000 on a nice setup i just realised i haven t even mentioned the rating system within acc some think its really bad and others think its ok i wont go into details on it but i will say if you want to race online then you must pay attention to it and you can only have one user within the game and there is no resetting your user to reset your stats acc is not am arcade type of game sliding and drifting is bad crazy fast changes of direction are bad and crashing into other cars is a big no no it will lose both yourself and the car you hit some of your safety ratings which is the most important stat in the game so don t expect the person you crash into to be happy with you so if all the above sounds good to you go for it you will love itif you do buy acc then please do everyone a favour and don t just jump into an online race straight away it will end badly for all please go and practice practice and practice before joining any public lobbies
