2017 early access review one of my favourite games of all time not many games like this give enjoyable survival the game can be easy it can be hard there s plenty of difficulty options and the game s hordes seem to get more plentiful with more diversity over time i first bought this game on xbox one i am happy to have bought it a second time on pc gameplay the game starts off slow and gradually becomes more fast paced with better loot the slow start has driven away a few of my friends but the progression and late game pace of the game has kept some of them around loving it is the game too easy turn up the difficulty make the zombies feral mod it a little bit bad performance i run between minimum and rec specs with integrated graphics and get bearable frames having to run everything on low with high lod the game could use some optimizing but right now in my opinion it isn t totally impairing my game also seems to run better on servers especially nitrate servers which are cheap bugs seem to be a little rarer since previous versions currently in a17 the only bug that s annoying me is precipitation and cold temp going through windows glass blocks doors and hatches there aren t a lot of variation in ranged weapons in my opinion there s over 10 iirc i was also slightly disappointed to learn 10mm bullets were removed but the current weapons are satisfying enough to enjoy the game thoroughly i really enjoy the new way we gain levels it adds to the game s longevity and challenges 1200 overall skill points is not enough to max your perks out so doing quests is a necessary requirement to get everything or to play with friends and distribute points the game needs an option with coins to return all skill points overall the gameplay although sometimes buggy is very enjoyable for people who are in it for a few months of playing including work in between graphics looks i am really not fussy with graphics when the gameplay is enjoyable i can t speak for something i don t bother much with i can play with blurry trees and grass i just need to know what i m hitting but i think the game on max looks pretty i love how the terrain isn t all cubes and how it changes to damage updating the game seems to be regularly updated so do the forums i love seeing what the devs are working on over time currently i m looking forward to the behemoth zombie and bike physics changes conclusion i would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys zombies anyone who loves building with good block variation and to anyone who wants a fun stressful talking to those i play with experience with friends worth the money all day long i ve bought it twice i would buy it again just make sure your friends are competent i ve had enough of the yeah thanks guys leaving me out here on my own i needed it died situation
