2023 early access review pros dyson sphere program is an exceptionally solid purchase even at full price if you enjoy automation games e g factorio achievements and built in aspirational goals encourage multiple playthroughs early access is laughable in the most positive way the game feels feature complete with multiple end game goals achievements etc solid buy in the current state quality of life for factory building and logistics is high for example conveyor belts can be raised or drawn around corners logistics local planetary and interplanetary is also a simple supply and demand system interplanetary logistics is a core mechanic and required to complete the game setting itself apart from other automation games interstellar logistics is highly encouraged due to higher resource density and rare resources that simplify production chains dyson sphere has more interstellar exploration and mechanics than starfield feels amazing when you use the gravitational mass of a star as a slingshot to increase your speed feels terrible when you pass your destination at 2000m s then run out of fuel and drift aimlessly into space at least you feel something the dyson sphere is not a required for game completion to my surprise you can start the dyson sphere swarm in the mid game and progress as you expand research and production completing the dyson sphere requires so many resources it s more of a end game or mega base victory this gives more casual automation players an reasonable conclusion without too much investment but more dedicated players have a concrete aspirational goal cons many mid to late game components have room for improvement for example some have long production chains of intermediaries with often two but occasionally only one use alternative uses with new content or more efficient recipes would increase the value navigation within a planet is challenging in the late game i frequently found myself flying in circles around a planet looking for that one production line however foundations in dsp can be colored to help organize production lines and there are some other tactics like segmenting a planet by longitudes since north and south poles are always defined one feature improvement would be an intra planetary indicatory similar to what already exists between planets verdictbuy i can t believe this game is in early access it feels complete
