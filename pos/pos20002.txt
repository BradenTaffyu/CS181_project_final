2014 took me a while to get into but once i did i loved it it s better then fallout 3 why because it lets you do whatever you please you can kill everything if you feel like it even important characters related to the main plot of the game can die and the world will react to it properly with many dialogs with npcs changing to what you did and some quests might not even be open to you anymore due to what you did quests in new vegas tend to have alot of multiple choices solutions and endings not just one neutral ending one evil ending and one good ending instead there s a fine line of varying shades of grey which will often make you think about what you re about to do instead of doing the usual video game trope of well i wanna be a good guy a hole so i ll pick text that s in blue red this is why people tend to recommend obsidian s new vegas over bethesda s fallout 3 new vegas has far more intreasting things to do in it with an insane amount of choices and outcomes which make replaying it a second and even a 3rd time still a somewhat refreshing experience without resorting to installing community made quests via the nexus mod site however the problem new vegas still has to this date is the engine it s powered by even when it came out back in 2010 the engine it had was considered a fairly limiting and old engine it can only use 2gb of ram on a system which is just one of the many reasons why this game loves to crash so much it also comes with an annoying micro stutter bug that s caused by the fact than the engine was for some reason coded for 64 hz at 64 fps for some strange reason and since pretty much no one in this world has a tv monitor that s 64hzs it ends up causing weird micro stutters in the game thankfully the community created various mods which fixed these issues there s a popular mod which removes the micro stutters so you can enjoy a a nice smooth 60 or 120 144 fps experience without any stutters and there s a community made launcher which enables new vegas to properly use at least 4gb of ram and not just 2 which is a must if you plan to mod new vegas with graphical mods that increase texture sizes alot or maybe add alot more models and other things in the world to be loaded by overall it s an amazing game that s sadly sometimes hampered with technical issues it has due to the engine it uses
