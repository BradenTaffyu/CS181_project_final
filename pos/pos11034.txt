2023 product received for free tldr version is this game perfect are any but even though i walk 5 18 miles daily took a vacation in italy travelled to other cities twice to visit friends played tour guide to a friend visiting from europe and then moved to another country since getting the game i m so tired every spare moment i must play just can t stop d here s why version love the wee easter egg buildings that dot the countryside they can be moved and make great special places in your cities i ve heard a lot about performance issues but haven t experienced many problems so find it hard to comment i can only say that i ve played the game on 3 computers the newest 3 years old the oldest 11 years old but with a newer video card and the other a mid line computer bought 7 years ago without an upgrade since disabling blur and depth of field made the game run smoothly on them all i hate both of those in any game so win win for me i ve not run into a single game breaking problem it crashed once but me dropping something on my keyboard right then may have been a factor lolthe game is lovely at night it s glorious it s worth zooming in and i can name the critters it can be easy or challenging depending on your own experience personal goals and your own style of playing i like the development progress that allows you to pick and choose how you want your own city to develop i like the xp system you get rewarded for doing trying and learning things and not only for having things run perfectly you can try something but decide it s not for you since you spent the cash and the time on trying it you keep your xp even if you delete it later that can be cheated if you have the cash to do so if you d rather not play the game in normal progression it s your choice traffic works fine but road maintenance matters the road services tools are handy and nice the traffic system has some rather humorous moments that are just like real life at least in my neighbourhood i like the signature buildings and being able to build to meet the requirements and therefore chose whichever i want first some negative reviewers don t seem to know the game very well and many have gone on to double triple or more the time they keep playing since the review so perhaps they are starting to like it after all example i read somewhere you only get low residency needs ever no matter what not true i ve had hours of play time without a single blip of low residency desire on my maps and have recordings and vods to back that up residence desires are tied to things like land value job availability etc if you want something different you can build your way there i wanted posh high rises so built to encourage that and got them all low residency needs went away later i wanted a smaller farming area with single residence homes around it and had to build to make their desire for that start up again i ve played every city builder i can get my hands on since back in 89 with sim city on amiga i love the genre and i love this game there have been minor glitches and imbalances some already fixed by the company for me to date these issues can all pretty much be ignored or worked around without any reason to stop playing the company are continuing to fix change and pay attention to the comments of their customers i m good with that it s not perfect but it s rather grand anyway i got the game given to me so bought one for someone else it s too nice to not share
