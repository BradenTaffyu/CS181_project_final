2023 this is the combat empire building simulator the not a this is an improvement over the original in so many ways especially so many of the quality of life features that have been added tracking locations so you can find them on the map showing how much money you have when looking to recruit a new companion and the save load file screen showing an image of your character and some stats like how many people the morale and food amount in your party there s a lot more but those were some of the first things that jumped out at me upon coming back to check it out post launch another favorite thing i like is that trading is much easier from rumors suggesting a good place to buy or sell various goods for a profit to even showing thru the color of the numbers how profitable it would be to sell certain items at the place you re currently at there are so many important things i didn t even know would matter so much to me then there s the crusader kings style side of it i never really cared about in the original all the political intrigue and building of your clan and notable figures within it and how they interact with the game world while you re doing your thing for example i married one of my people to someone else she got pregnant and had a kid and that kid s father won a tournament somewhere and earned my the clan 2000 monies the combat is still there but even that has been improved upon from what i ve seen so many different stats to take into account for battle how long is your weapon how fast can it swing how well does it handle what tier is it and more it feels like there are so many more options for weapons rather than just a few different types of swords axes etc for example even within a named type of sword such as a spatha there can be many differences in how they handle in combat if you re looking to play a new rpg and potentially build your own empire from scratch as a nobody and on your own check this game out it can take quite a long time to get to the point where you are able to start capturing towns and getting your own land but the journey along the way will most likely be filled with a lot of fun running around wiping out bandit troops their hideouts doing quests for various noble other named people and or ransacking villages there are so many ways you can go about building up your warband and your reputation around the game world you don t even have to have any aspirations of becoming a lord or the emperor you can just spend all your time amassing money and reputation and become a merchant with a ton of businesses and caravans bringing you income as you just manage your business empire in some ways the game can be a medieval life simulator and i never expected to want that from these games i was just happy to do the battles and take over castles and towns i feel spoiled like i got so much more than i asked for edit they updated the game so that you can continue playing on as one of your heirs in your clan in essence you can now play kind of like crusader kings and build a dynasty and play on generations after your original character has grown old and died there s an update coming in version 1 2 that improves the current fog of war mechanic that encourages you to go around and explore and talk to people because you no longer have every bit of information unlocked in the game encyclopedia now you learn things about people places and so on as you explore in that same update they re adding even more maps to the bandit hideouts and other locations you can fight in plus an overhaul to the crime alley mechanic and your ability to become the leader of a criminal empire as well as the way environmental effects such as rain and snow impact cavalry in determining combat advantages in short they added a bunch of updates and content post launch and even more is on the way and might even be here already by the time you read this review also the original couple that got married in my clan have 6 kids now and the dad has won 2 more tournaments and is becoming a real charmer in social circles boosting my clan s reputation with various notable npcs in the game on top of earning me money every so often and expanding my clan s list of potential future playable characters or leaders of their own parties or caravans or crime alleys
