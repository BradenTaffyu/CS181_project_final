2016 early access review i love realistic games and this one brings it to a whole new level this game perfectly simulates real life physics there s so many things to do and you can do anything you want there s missions tons of maps and not to mention a huge selection of modded cars and custom maps you can even go into the files of a certain car and give it 3000 horsepower if you really wanted to they are constantly adding new things and fixing all of the bugs the customization level is ridiculous you can drive around with only a frame wheels and your engine who needs a car body you can tune your suspension throw on a supercharger and much more i highly recommend this game if you enjoy tinkering with things or even just driving note it will take some getting used to because the handling is realistic to real life it s not any old racing game it takes real skill plus you can use a controller enjoy
