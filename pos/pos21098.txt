2021 this is one of those games that you want to play when everything else gets too frustrating or aggravating i played mostly during early access so i can t say much about story or plot but the objectives herding collecting slimes farming exploring the land are fun and you re allowed to go at your own pace graphics and map design is simple but lovely you can take your time enjoying the experience and farming for money isn t tedious since the slimes are so cute overall there s no big cons to this game besides maybe having a few slow parts where you might have to farm more i remember playing slime rancher with quite a bit of enjoyment i would recommend it especially if you desire a break from strenuous games
