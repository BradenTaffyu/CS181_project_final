2014 early access review beamng drive is a very physics heavy simulation utilizing torque3d and a very accurate realistic soft body physics engine what does this mean for you however this game provides stunningly realistic vehicle deformations much like rigs of rods which beamng drive is based off beamng drive tries to be the most accurate vehicle damaging simulator and it is succeeding while it is still only in alpha i strongly recommend picking this up if you re like me and find pleasure in smashing pickup trucks into small japanese compact cars if you wish to own this title you can order a steam alpha key at their website
