2020 divinity is in many ways the ideal rpg the requirement for this in my eyes is a rich fantasy story with plentiful characters and deep customization of your playstyle the combat is turnbased and gives you a limited amount of actions per round with attacks movement and abilities taking up varying amounts of actions enemies tend to hurt a lot if you let them so a large part of the strategy is using status effects to skip their turns outright or raising your defences and healing up and there is a lot of status effects that can be applied a different game might limit you by saying no you cant just stunlock the primordial megakraken but in here noone is immune to everything so you very much can do that just knockdown god if you feel like it the ai is also amazing about 95 of the time the other 5 running into cursed fire and taking lethal fire damage trying to get to a better position they will use all the abilities given to them to their best effect for example fireballing their allies when you froze them to trade some damage for the opportunity to hurt you more or by linking their health with yours then hitting themselves there is also an elements system of sorts ground can be frozen on fire etc and there is many combinations for example you shot a guy and now he is bleeding all over the place so you use a lightning spell on the pool of blood to stun everyone standing in it my main complaint with both this as well as the first part is that the balance can be wonky especially in the beginning you can get revive scrolls as the only way to bring back dead party members but in the beginnng you cant really afford them so every death is a huge issue this doesnt mean the magic crocodiles casting bolders in your face care though so the most brutal fights of the early parts feel almost unfairly punishing since it feels like there is no way to not at least lose one or two guys though with the tactical depth offered there is most likely always a way to not lose companions if you are good enough and lateron sometimes there is specific fights usually in hidden sidequests and areas that are way more brutal than anything else you will find in the area the final boss is a counterexample and with the stuff you went through pretty much a pushover in comparison the abilities themselves can be switched at any time and mixed in any way you see fit you want to be a dude with a big axe but you also really like necromancy you can totally do that and if you dont like it just become a dude with a crossbow who turns enemies into chicken the next moment the difficulty of the fights makes you seek more power throughout the entire game you always need that bigger boom against the bigger baddies and for the most part the high end of your skillschool feels like proper ultimate abilities in a similar sense you always want that better equipment and always need that gold for equipment and skillbooks you are naturally motivated to do any quest you can to get as much as possible and never end up with seemingly infinite power and money and nothing to do with it the areas look pretty nice as nice as a topdown perspective game of this style can look i guess more importantly though the maps are not only huge but they dont waste any space either seemingly every square inch is filled with encounters npcs hidden treasure sidequests etc it is no open world that just ends up empty a very bog mention absolutely needs to go to the voiceacting not only is there naturally a huge amount of text in this it is also fully voiceacted instead of just acting the first few lines and then being text and if you decide to gain the skill to speek with animals thats a whole new chunk of voiceacted dialogues that you could just completely miss out on its even whole new quests sometimes the quality is also solid it doesnt feel like a handful of people doing everything but rather like a huge roster of different people sometimes i even found myself not skipping ahead after reading faster than they talk simply to enjoy certain performances from villains for example the final point that lifts this game above even many non rpg games is the multiplayer options there is absolutely zero difference wether you play coop with others or play on your own simply because you have full control of all characters anyway and multiplayer is just handing that control to someone else in part and you can just naturally play throughout the entire campaign which is around 90 hours with someone else the deep fights and the story decisions you will be forced to make also make for great planning and interacting together i really really want more games where you can have a huge story experience for multiple people with no issues i could gush over way more details in way more depth but i tend to clash with steams character limit when i review things so to sum it up its a great rpg and game in general and currently one of very few big singleplayer games that can be played with others this is one of the only games id buy even at this high of a full price
