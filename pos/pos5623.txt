2021 early access review a worthy successor to warband but it still needs more time in the oven mods fix some of the bigger issues i d rank it as a must play if you were a wb fan or if you ve ever wanted to play a total war game as a 3rd person rpg of sorts pros looks good many times even better than the screenshots on the steam store moddable gorgeous soundtrack the core gameplay loop is awesome it feels good to go from zero to hero you eventually find a favorite weapon that suits your play style and smithing can let you obtain an even better version of it battles no longer end when you die and you can fast forward the remainder of the battle which is very nice a lot of the crashes that made the game almost unplayable near release have been fixed in 1 6 2 i got about one crash every 3 4 hours and that s while running 10 mods which is pretty good in my book just save often cons the first and biggest issue is the way experience works because new levels ask for exponential increases in skill levels while decreasing your learning rate reaching mastery in any skill takes an incredible amount of time i get that realistically you could only hope to master one maybe two things during a lifetime and the game wants to lean towards realism i just wish the game also offered you the choice between realistic and power fantasy when it comes to skill leveling because the game is a lot more fun when you can personally take out 30 50 enemies before formation combat even begins as of 1 6 2 you can address this by using the leveling rebalance mod possibly in combination with the kaoses tweaks mod unfortunately mods frequently break during new updates so this will be a recurring issue endgame kingdom management should have some auto resolve options such as give fief to noble with most council support highest relation lowest relation there should be a way to contact lords without having to find them on the other side of the map couriers and emissaries would be a way you should also be able to talk with them while they re in jail at least if it s your jail the ai could use improvements riders still frequently crash into trees ladders are sometimes ignored during sieges cavalry attached to infantry formations will ride ahead to their death instead of staying close archers in the same formation will prefer forming one vulnerable long line unflinching even when clearly being overrun by cavalry infantry instead of splitting up and moving around during ai control which i imagine is a limitation of the formations system but i wish the ai itself could handle smarter splitting of troops enemies will constantly stream at you when respawning instead of trying to regroup and have a sizable force for a new wave though your troops are guilty of doing the same also during sieges one unit will sometimes get stuck and you can t end the battle without exiting the map and restarting it still it is generally competent enough to make the gameplay fun i just feel like it s a few steps away from being truly great i hope to one day come back to it and replay it as an rts where i dodge the occasional arrow with troop command being a fully viable play style overall rating 8 out of 10 swadian butter caravans some changes to the way you gain experience and how the ai handles itself as well as further improving on game stability would bring it over the finish line and all of these seem doable with time
