2016 darks souls 3 was the first souls game i had ever played so i wasn t quite sure what to expect i expected a difficult journey though i wouldnt know just how difficult and gameplay similar to games like the witcher skyrim or dragon age what i ended up getting was a game that made me feel like i was handed a sword and told to explore this insanely unforgiving relentless and utterly merciless game a game that makes you feel like you were handed a sword imagine if with all your years of fantasy game experience you were handed an actual sword and told you face this world do you think you would be good no we would all mostly get pounded left and right this is what dark sousl 3 does to you it s not your typical fantasy where you feel like you know how to play and you got this dark souls 3 casts a feeling of helplessness and feelings of unfamiliarity into a seemingly familar journey dark souls isn t your average hack and slash fantasy but a dark dark unforgiving bully that will never spare you this game will kick your legs in and then continue to kick you while you re down and it couldn t be better not only are the graphics impeccable the mood is enough to make you go wow not only that but learning about the lore could be a game on its own deeply sown within each item description enemy and place you visit are inklings of game plot and lore bosses are relentless and will slaughter you and your dreams with brutality and the strength you wish you had you will be crushed time and time again but this game is like drugs and you will continue to come back for more whether it be for vegeance pride or anger there are so many weapons to be found views to be sought out friends to be made people to rescue magic to learn bosses to defeat stories to be heard secrets to be discovered blood to be bled and souls to be lost your armor will be your comfort your weapons will be your arsenal your spells will be your plan b you will nervously dodge fail to parry attack too early attack too late miss attacks run out of stamina and desperately run this game is like bootcamp i recommend dark souls 3 to anyone who is a fan of the fantasy genre likes a challenge isn t afriad to back down and has the vigor to push on praise the sun
