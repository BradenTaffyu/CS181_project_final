2021 i became a big fan of fallout 4 after my grandson talked me into getting the game i delayed on fallout 76 for the price to drop and to insure pvp wasn t an issue not a fan and i have to say there are a lot of positive things with fallout 76 i also waited for them to do major updates etc i do enjoy the mission lengthy though they be i m a slow player almost 70 years old having to move around servers for camp emplacement is a pain but i understand why so not too bad building isn t quite as much as in fallout 4 though you can do a lot as you choose i do wish combat was more along the farcry 4 5 type where you had the chance to truly sneak into a camp and remove the baddies but overall if you are a fallout fan you should enjoy this game graphics are good they corrected a crashing issue continue to add content and changes and supports different styles of play i don t pay extra for fallout 1st monthly fee which gives you some nice benefits and while i could afford it well i haven t paid a monthly subscription since my wow days like most games some of the missions are tedious but there are lots of events dailies etc to mix up game play so i do recommend it being an overall fallout fan happy gaming all be kind
