2022 early access review looking for the best zombie survival game on the market this is the one this is it get this one seriously hunger stress fortifications clothing exploration environment appropriate looting vehicles skill development the constant looming dread of absolutely positively never being certain of your safety at any given time this game has it all and as a comically perfect cherry on top workshop integration for some of the best mods i have ever used to enhance the experience of a primarily singleplayer but also multiplayer game at least for me easily the best feature of this game is the mantra of there s no correct way to play it you can customize everything and i mean absolutely everything in regards to how your gameplay experience will change the number of settings you can fiddle with in the custom sandbox options is truly something to behold want to play the default punishing experience of apocalypse difficulty you obviously can want to have incredibly vicious smart perceptive zombies that will become more active at night and are capable of sprinting and make the lootable resources available on the map rarer across the board you can want to make zombies weaker but want to counteract the ease of that by making the standard population multiplier absolutely insanely bonkers high and to counteract that make them respawn in smaller quantities so after meticulously clearing an area you re never 100 safe alongside that do you want this run to include an absolute spreadsheet of modded in melee weapons firearms new calibers weapon attachments new character occupations new lore appropriate clothing irl vehicles of the 90 s and entire new neighborhoods and cities added to the map you can and it s awesome play it solo suffer play it with your friends cooperatively suffer together hilariously this game is gripping tense satisfyingly complex and has given me the only gaming experience i can honestly say is probably accurately representing the absolute chaos depression depravity and struggle of trying to keep yourself together during a devastatingly dangerous apocalypse anyways back to clearing out the commercial district of downtown louisville with a suppressed benelli super 90 while rocking a hawaiian shirt and a clown nose on my face i love this game so much
