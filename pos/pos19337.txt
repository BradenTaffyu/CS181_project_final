2021 my competitive rts background starcraft 2 diamond and age of empires 2 1500 mmr positives i absolutely adore the art style and graphics units are very responsive and micro pays off buildings and units are diverse enough to allow a ton of builds and tactics the sounds are out of this world goodnegatives unit path finding is a bit weird at times arrows always hit which is a bummer considering how important movement vs archers was in aoe2 late game ai is lackluster if you are into that kind of thing dark age pacing feels a tad too slow a few extra villagers could solve this no official ranked play yetabsolutely amazing game my biggest surprise this year 10 10i can t wait to watch tournaments and come up with builds buy buy buy
