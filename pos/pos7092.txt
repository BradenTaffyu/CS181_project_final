2017 don t let the steam trailer fool you there are more then 2 states in this game xdfor the simulator crowd that likes to tease the speed limit to all you out there who like to keep your hands busy while you listen to a podcast this is a great game for you even if you ve never played a simulator before this game is very approachable at the time of writing this there are only 3 states california nevada and arizona but with more to come even then there is still plenty of space to explore the game is fairly grindy at the beginning but if your playing it for fun then you ll have no problem playing till you pick up your first truck and garage this game really comes into its own for the casual audience once you pick up a fellow driver for you company as his income helps offset the occasional traffic ticket or fender bender my recommendations for playing this game turn off the hud s side view mirrors for more immersion f1 menu ensure your turn signals are bound to your q e key for full one handed gameplay turn up weather fequency rain probability the day to day gameplay is more interesting when you don t know if its goin to be sunny or rainy turn down trailer stability makes the on and off ramps more interesting for you speed demons set your cruise control c key to 3mph above the speed limit makes deliveries easier to be on time for without recieveing tickets plus driving on californian highways gets boring after you get to go down interstate 10 75mph you can never take a wide enough right hand turn the trailers like to get caught on poles and fences
