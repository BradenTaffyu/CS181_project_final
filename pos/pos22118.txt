2017 the dark souls 3 community is cancerous trash there won t be one day where you don t meet someone spamming trolling cheating hacking of course pointing down after they kill you in the most annoying way possible you might come across some friendly players but very rarely if at all even i find trouble not wanting to be trash because everyone else is to me shows no respect it s a cycle of getting trolled all the time getting mad then turning into one of the cancerous players yourself as for the game itself i have 2 words buy it i ve beaten this game at least 60 times between xbox one ps4 steam i have all the achievements for it you will be put to the test of beating one of the hardest games known to the general gaming community you will die over over over again you will think that it s impossible after being stuck on a boss for 4 hours i have personally been through hell when i started playing dark souls but in the end it is worth it it is a amazing game even though the community isn t great i still recommend this you can enjoy the game the community even if you re a friendly player like myself just be prepared to have a lot of patience otherwise you will end up either quitting the game or turning into a sh tty player like everyone else by the time you beat it praise the sun
