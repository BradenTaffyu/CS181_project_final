2021 early access review oh it s already 4 a m haven t had that in a while this game is a nice rabbithole of designing optimizing and automating your acutal task of building spheres around stars an important feature for me this game does not rush you to do anything and you can completely play at your own pace fixing bottlenecks is a big part of this game but they don t punish you in form of throwbacks stuff just moves slower until you are ready for stuff to move faster i guess this is what it would feel like if life adjusted its speed to you despite it s early access status i m not missing much except for some minor qol and insight into resource production in the stats page and even those are in the works
