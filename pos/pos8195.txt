2022 instead of making this review a meme i thought i would genuinely tell you what you re getting yourself into yeah i wrote a review longer than the bible tl dr at the bottom gameplay literally everything is fine the animations look good the game itself is the nicest looking yu gi oh game i ve played it feels nice to play and everything works well the real issue you will either sink hours into this game or you will be turned off by either the state of the game not the game s fault or the way to obtain cards the game gives you enough gems to start and make a complete deck but afterwards gems are generally harder to come by my advice is honestly just to go to master duel meta and look at the current tier list of good decks and make one of those so you can get gems though doing your challenges don t feel inclined as the main point is to have fun but if you wanna make the decks you want then you need gems and to get gems you need to win and play a lot doing challenges also you can scrap cards you get from packs to craft the cards you want so that makes it easier to get all your ash blossoms and baronne de fleur to make your opponent cry the dueling experience i casually played yu gi oh and various yu gi oh games and thought i understood the card game very well nope your opponent is gonna special summon 14 monsters a turn and lock you out of using cards before you even get something on the board i ve adjusted well as a regular plat player trying to grind to diamond this is gonna be the experience this game only has ranked so if you want a more casual experience you can make custom rooms with friends or try to join randoms i guess either way you ll see a lot of locking down and taking away your ability to play the game kind of games if you play for a bit you ll definitely adjust and be able to play through your opponent and win it just involves learning the key cards of the popular decks and formulating strategy they do have solo mode that teaches you the basics and lets you verse some pretty mediocre archetypes but gives you cards and gems for doing it so i d say it s worth running though but don t expect a fully fleshed out solo story mode or anything from this tl drpros good feeling dueling good starting amount of gems to get you going card scraping system to get cards you want a lot of cards good way to introduce yourself or get back into yu gi oh if you don t mind some commitment to learningcons state of yu gi oh jk jk but definitely off putting for new players less gems after your initial burst its a free game so that s fair no casual mode only ranked so expect tough competition not mentioned but a really wack banlist that isn t updated as much as it should be tbh solo mode is definitely a side feature don t expect to play this game exclusively solo hope this helps have over 300 hours across 2 platforms and this is what i ve experienced since the day 1 launch great game love it to death but definitely be aware of these things and give it a go
