2023 a very chill and relaxing game where you blast at nature with friends if you got any the base game is functional but the dlc really makes the game shine they clearly knew this as well as there is like 40 dlcs that being said don t buy this game unless its on sale the base game regularly goes on sale for 70 off and its dlc goes 15 to 60 off like its only mid may and i think this has already been on sale like 4 or 5 times my recommendation is wait for a sale and grab the following greenhorn bundle it has weapon pack 1 and 2 modern weapons atv and tent yukon valley map for bison moose and wolf hunting smoking barrels weapon pack fun goof around weapons like an actual musket m1 grand and a good ol lever action assorted sidearms weapon pack more fun goof around weapons weapon pack 3 if you want even moreyou should have a pretty good spread of caliber type so you should be able to take down small 1 3 and big game 4 9 with all this stuff i would also recommend looking up the thehunter call of the wild wiki and see if there is any weapons you need to have and if they are in a dlc bundle or unlockable in game could save yourself some bucks neat things you should know if you have a dlc map your friends can play with you they don t need the map as well if you leave they are giving a short time limit you cannot swim you get knocked out when you get to far in and appear on the coast where you walked in animals that are shot and die in the water move towards the edge of the water you shot them from you can take damage from falling or animals and get knocked out respawned at a camp okay have fun gg
