early access review steam says 11 minutes it s closer to 1600 hours i m the longsword guy switching this to positive since someone on reddit that was mad at me made a good point about me liking the normals game mode didn t expect something good from reddit o o the game is worth playing the free to play mode for normals alone for sure and it s arguably the most fun part of the game the rest of the review still explains why i think the game isn t in the best state this game has struggled throughout its existence with balancing issues between the class due to ironmace s approach to adding things that are fun without care for balance which was fine but they ve recently said their latest update will be pushing the game more in the direction they want moving forward which is good and bad the good it s less of a battle royale and more of a dungeon crawler with their changes big w the bad their balancing pushes it to be a bad slow fps game for the solos duos gameplay mode and an unrewarding meta of buffball in trios where you take two support classes and spam buffs on one character and send him in like a pokemon on top of all this the game still suffers from drastic dsync that effects many aspects of the game from melee swing manipulation projectiles registering and spells registering they ve managed to dial the dsync in one time for a period of two weeks back in february good luck blocking while learning the game and good luck blocking after 1000 hrs in the game lol the balance in the game has been worse and worse over the course of the ea that happened off steam through ironmace s self launcher the only balancing they ve done a decent job on it feels is the gear balance they finally settled on recently they ve gone through random periods of gutting class types on multiple occasions wizard and rogues nerfs that never stick and always get rolled back since their balancing approach is always off are likely the most egregious culprits it s been a consistently ranged dominated game in solos and duos for the past 4 months or more and their recent changes to balance with the wipe only exasperated the problem further your experiences in the normal mode will be a far cry from the actual gameplay mode of high roller that s locked behind paying for the game i genuinely enjoyed the game for a long while but it s been an unenjoyable slog the last few months that even with taking breaks for weeks at a time i just can t justify telling other people it s in a good state ironmace dropped some cool content with their recent wipe just a day ago but largely i feel that cool content is overwritten by the consistent poor decisions they ve made to balance the game from a fun melee ranged driven rpg into a slow moving ranged only bad fps game for the vast majority of the content outside meta trios buffball play i hope they turn it around someday since i can t get my boys to come back and play this game with me in the current state how can you give a bad review when you put 1600 hrs in idk didn t think i would but i can t say i d recommend the game to friends at all after playing the first couple days of their wipe patch with the balance they made in the game and looking back at the recent months it s been nothing but things i also couldn t recommend great content ironmace bad balancing that makes playing the content unenjoyable is the issue i m still around since i love the game and want to see it come around to a better state again that s more enjoyable and i think the ironmace team are awesome with their transparency and the way they ve approached the community since the playtests and throughout ea and still support them just sometimes you gotta let people know there s issues with the stuff you like still so they can know what they re getting into ps edit free to play bros the game is free to play the normal mode but you won t be able to use your gear outside the same raid you find them in you can go down and fight all bosses across all queues definitely approach it as a demo the game for free not a free game to play the entire game trade high roller where you can use gear multiple character slots are part of the full game purchase but normals is the most fun part of the game right now high roller sucks so enjoy the normals mode everyone lolparry on longsword bros oggieson
