we can argue about meta and broken cards all day if we want and thats what 90 of bad reviews complain about and everyone has a different view of the matter what doesn t change is that this game is extremely f2p friendly you can build a whole new meta deck every month if you play regularly i often find myself with way too many gems not knowing what to spend them on and the fact that you can even craft cards by dismantling the ones you don t need puts it several steps above duel links or any other gacha game i d love for it to be more beginner friendly and it s something konami has been struggling with for years i think the 2nd anniversary deck they give for free swordsoul by using a referral code for new players is pretty solid easy to use and powerful to start with so it s a step in the right direction i d also love for more alternate formats we have events every month with customized banlist or special rules but retro formats would also be very welcomed as it d bring more variety as well as partially solve the complexity issues by giving you an easier alternative to play in at the time of this review a very small retro fromat event has been announced so i hope this becomes a regular thing i do get frustrated with certain metas and decks but overall i really like this game and i m grateful it is the way it is considering how badly konami tends to treat their own ips
