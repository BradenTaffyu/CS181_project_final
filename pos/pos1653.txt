2017 byte sized review so nier yet so far review in under a minute nier automata is an admirable sequel to the quirky original from 2010 that virtually nobody else outside of a small and dedicated fan base had heard of despite the first game being considered a dismal failure financially kudos to square enix for allowing yoko taro s vision to be expanded on by the visionaries at platinum games which gives the nier universe a much needed pull out of the mire of obscurity but is it enough while nier automata showcases platinum s hack n slash gameplay at its most visceral and best well best since bayonetta at least nier automata may still be a little too quirky for a mainstream gaming audience outside of those gamers who lavish all their attention on anime playing jrpg s and or on japanese culture in general nier automata s narrative structure is clever but it also irritates in equal measure personally for me by the time nier automata had concluded with all 3 major endings completed i found the game to be a very well made glass half full half empty experience and while i eventually did come around to liking it in the end at times it was a real struggle to get me there one word to sum up the experience off the wall performance bug related incidents the port launched with a bevy of complaints from many users that nier automata suffered from white screening artifacting broken anti aliasing and overall performance problems there was also resolution issues while i personally did not have any issues with it the user reviews for the game on steam indicate otherwise make out of that what you will similar to games bayonetta nier metal gear rising devil may cry suitable for suitable for teens and up position in my games of 2017 cleared list 13th position rating recommended community created artwork for steam artwork by the dogfather recommended games are games i would have normally scored within a range of 7 10 8 10
