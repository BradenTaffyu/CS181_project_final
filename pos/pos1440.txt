2017 early access review when i was younger i d talk with my friends about this amazing zombie apocalypse survival game we d made up we could go anywhere we liked in any house use every object every weapon build whatever we liked and construct massive safehouses and fortresses while going out of our base to raid local houses for food and supplies it was an impossible game with no actual thought about how feasible it would be to make this gamesomehow the devs managed to make this game a reality really its the ultimate zombie survival simulator also the devs give a really detailed weekly email describing the current process and showing off prototype systems which is amazing for an early access game and shows how much they care about the game and its community
