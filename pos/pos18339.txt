the pc version was relased on dec 17 2018 and it is also available on the iphone ipad on metacritic it has 0 metascore from critic reviews an average user score of 7 4 from 30 ratingsif you ve played flash games before you d probably come across bloon td if you are someone who loves tower defense games you d probably slay a ton of bloons before ninja kiwi and other flash game developers migrated to steam because flash is no longer supported by adobe so these group of people have seen how bloon td evolved till today as for the younger generations this may seem like some wild crazy mess up monkey revenge business against balloons did i mention that it was also fun can be frustrating at the same time overviewbtd 6 offers players 40 over maps to play it comes in 3 difficulty and each difficulty has different set of challenges that will test your skill and knowledge for some odd reasons btd 6 has a complicated map system for online co op game play you can t play online or co op under the standard play game daily challenges are strictly solo co op challenges can be played with friends others over the internet co op can only be played in co op maps there are 2 variations of co op maps play the entire map play in 1 of the sections of the map other events challenges are strictly solo your towers have it s own leveling system aside from that the more you play you also gain up exp for your own account this is the monkey knowledge system as you level up you gain monkey knowledge points which can be used to purchase perks for your towers or heroes tower yes there are heroes tower which needs to be unlocked purchased not microtrans if i am not mistaken the first 2 heroes can be unlocked and given to you after you reach certain levels other than all of the above you now have powers non towers that can be placed on to the map to assist you in various ways insta towers free towers that you have acquire through challenges events these towers come with certain upgrades already on top of all of this it has a trophy store where you can purchase various in game elements visuals ui emoticons nothing that can affect the gameplay you earn trophy from odyssey game mode finally it has a microtransaction shop btd 6 isn t just your standard tower defense game with all this features controls audio visualsvisuals it s 3d ish looking colorful clean certain maps have objects to interact block your line of sight monkeys and bloons have been properly designed no complains 1 to the teamaudio energetic vibe i believe you can purchase additional soundtrack from the trophy store yet to try there s a jukebox to enable 1 to the teamcontrols mouse for more advanced hardcore gamers you can use keyboard keys mechanicsas a tower defense game your goal is to prevent the bloons from exiting the map if it does your life will be deducted once you lose all of your life the game ends at this point you can either replay from scratch or use monkey cash to re try again what makes btd 6 complicated is the difficulty and what game mode you are playing on a standard easy vs deflation easy is 2 totally different game mode while they share the common easy rules same concept applies to the other difficulty harder maps on the surface it may seem like all the maps and bloons are the same so what exactly makes the game harder the first criteria is the game mode which you are playing it will set the tone on how hard what sort of challenge you will be presented 1 hp game magicians tower only reverse path half cash etc the second criteria is the difficulty levels on a general note the higher difficulty you play you will be required to play more levels easy 40 levels medium 60 hard 80 you will encounter much harder bloon types mix and match from various properties camo ceramic metal rainbow regrow fortified etc the bloon type is what dictates how hard the game will be in order to beat hard maps you will definitely need to max out your tower levels and invest into monkey knowledge heroes are not prominent until you start to play on hard maps or you have a particular way of playing sync it with other towers the tower themselves are unique and depending on your style of play you can mix and match certain tower styles in this sense it gives flexibility to the players some may opt of the ninja tower but others prefer the sniper my personal thoughts my summarybloon td has come a long way i wouldn t say btd 6 has revolutionize tower defense games but it s certainly not your average tower defense what makes it fun challenging is the bloons knowing your enemy properties and spawn at which level will greatly increase the gameplay experience else its going to be bonkers 40 over maps playing solo can feel repetitive and boring on harder maps where you are required to play 80 levels or more more time spent can be a turn off after xxx hours going co op you will have to stick with the map layout and without a proper way to communicate can turn the game into a messy monkey business spamming of emoticons that doesnt make sense i dont voice chat unless i am playing with my friends in other words playing online with public you have to bare with the 1 map layout free for all or play in a section of the map 2 communication limitation 3 knowledge of the person and style of playcan lead to a painful experience ever played in a co op map where one of the player just build 1 tower in a hard game map or leaves immediately once the game starts or mass tower hugging at the entrance vomits bloodon the other hand if you are playing with knowledgeable people you learn and have more fun i wished there was a way to add them into your friend list i would love to have more co op maps that are free to play style than sections though so on the scale of 0 10 my personal rating for bloon td 6 is a no monkey business creative coconut mess that is fun an easy 8 10
