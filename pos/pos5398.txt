2021 early access review caves of qud s depths are worth exploring though visually unappealing for a lot of folks it s an obstacle worth hurdling i and i think it s safe to say a lot of other folks who praise this game appreciate the ascii as a deliberate aesthetic rather than seeing it as a technical limitation and i get it from the outside looking in the game looks like an excel spreadsheet on lsd but not unlike a little known indie title called minecraft i d argue fidelity is not necessarily the benchmark for a good game and the same goes for qud the highs and lows of games like this are different than your typical rpg and hell now the developers have made it so the game doesn t even have to be played as a rogue like the game is very inclusive even speaking as a fan of the genre it can be frustrating as a new player to navigate a world that just keeps killing you for some of us that s half the fun but for others the option to explore the rich world the good folks at freehold games have created is there for them without the consequence of breaking your drywall with those mouse missiles you ve been meaning to tell your landlord about if i could offer one piece of advice for first time players don t play this game like any other ol rpg woe to the table flipping min maxers who will never be invited to another dnd night again because i will seriously not get my deposit back for what you did to my toilet woe to the egalitarian who naively believes qud should be a fair and just place you will be the first to be eaten alive by the swarming centipedes or interdimensional bounty hunters who teleport in with no warning to hemorrhage your brain no it s the one who thinks outside the box who breaks the rules of the game on such an absurd level who doesn t ask if they re allowed to give a wall sentience but gives new meaning to if these walls can talk who beguiles a baboon bandit lord and his baboon goons to throw rocks at people who s dismemberment plan is injecting themselves with unidentified fungus spores to regenerate a talking mushroom for an arm break the game before the game breaks you
