2020 this is possibly the best free to play game to exist some might say war thunder takes that spot but i believe it is way to hard to grind if you are on just a free account its so interesting how a game that is so easy to get into has such a high skill floor such detail that it take years to master just a single line of a single nation s ships trust me i have hundreds of hours in this game on my non steam wargaming account that i also lost access to and was to lazy to get it back not to mention i like starting over again and grinding back up this game unlike a lot of others makes you actually turn your brain on and think its a giant game of rock paper scissors destroyer beats battleship cruiser beats destroyer battleship beats cruiser carrier beat everyone until the end of the match and even then these are not hard counters and any ship type with a competent captain can beat another most of the time anyway if you seriously have not played this game after half a decade you need to check it out
