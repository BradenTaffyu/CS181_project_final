2018 howdy partner we sure have a lot to talk bout this mastapece ready here we go main quests in most of the rpg s made by big studios your choices doesn t affect the story much it s just an illusion to make you feel like your choice matters but it doesn t really in fallout new vegas your skills attributes perks and gender changes a lotta dialoges and opens up new options in the game in a meaningful way briefly there are a lotta factions and people affects the big picture and your interactions with them changes the story significantly but you don t have to listen to them or choose between them you can just say f it and kill everyone who stands in your way and become the leader of your new brave world so basicly this game makes you fell like you have huge balls or a ginormous baby pumper depending on your gender side quests usually in this kinda games you re an errand boy you go to caves and dungeons to find someone s missing amulet or sword and it s just boring but not in this game sir no for example you meet a pimp and he s business isn t really great he s looking for hoes so he asks you to find an old man a cowgirl ghoul and a sexbot now when you find old man and cowgirl ghoul you have to persuade them with your speech skills you have to choose the right options when it comes to sexbot you gotta find a robot then repair and program it to be a sex slave and you can use it right there to see if it funtions right pnow that s a quality mission even though graphics are ugly and gameplay is slow and stiff this is a true rpg experience and the best rpg game i ve played so far really fun game with great humor and strong writing it s a mastaapece viva las vegas 7 out of 7
