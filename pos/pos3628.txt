2023 the most emotionally impactful game i ve ever playedi have played many video games in the past but there has never been one that could close the gap to my heart as effortlessly as omori has the first hour or so of this game is misleading probably intentionally so i thought this was going to be a cute lo fi aesthetic rpg with some quite frankly sluggish combat or something along these lines but as i progressed through the game and the first major plot point i realized i wasn t playing omori for the gameplay no there are clearly better rpgs than this but the story the world the characters now this is something worth exploring and believe me when i tell you that in the end of it all i regret even thinking of doubting this game at the beginning i can t say much without getting into spoiler territory but i can tell you this omori has so so many powerful ways of gripping your heart tightly so one moment you ll find yourself with a glowing grin and watery eyes then moments later you ll be feeling the painful chills down on you as you slowly explore the horrible truth you care about what is happening without the game making you do so it is the most meaningful game i ve ever played in terms of presentation the world building is meaningful the horror aspects of this game are meaningful everything matters and this game will make you realize this thoroughly what is even more astounding is that such a brilliant game was made in rpg maker it just shows that a bold vision can shine adamantly even on restricted environments five years of rough development that paid off tremendously a tiny group of individuals that wanted to create something beautiful even on rpg maker this game looks amazing the little details in every level the gorgeous pencil drawn animations the expressive character portraits complementing each other to deliver a bizarre colorful world the soundtrack is very beautiful and very well achieved omori is sad it is happy it is terrifying it is a macabre ode for young people it is a message of love and forgiveness omori is a warm smile in the cold fog in the endless void it is a reminder a reminder to look ahead past the overwhelming darkness there somewhere you ll find the smiles and love of the ones waiting for you so don t keep them waiting because of this game now my life is miserable 10 10
