civilization i associated with a good serious even majestic game and with all this to see in the sixth part of these caricatured and completely ugly rulers a strange system of moving units when with all the desire it is impossible to catch up with the enemy unless he himself allows it the type of locations maps has also undergone far from the best changes and looks more like spore in its own childishness yes this game looks like a child s game despite the initial claim to be serious social institutions have also undergone a global change although there is nothing new here they have become exactly the same as the tree of scientific research i was only pleased with the updated system of diplomacy and a small trifle the fastening of units so what do we have in the end the fifth part has been updated and supplemented over the years in fact becoming the sixth itself reaching brave new world and the developers obviously played too much into these additions leaving no good ideas for an official sequel and now the sixth part reeks of the fact that they tried but did not come up with anything my advice is if you re a fan of the series play the fifth one and the sixth one will only upset you
