2020 early access review in warband i ve never managed to have as much fun let us be clear i love warband i ve spend a number of hours on multi player mp servers shooting hacking and slashing but i never had much fun in single player sp with bannerlord okay if i m to be honest it might help that i m streaming it and having fun with the viewers i discover an entertaining game with great graphics as i write this review we are still in the openn beta phase as to be expected there are some issues and bugs occasionally some incompatibility but i think it s to be expected they are rolling patches after patches about everty day working on those issues which is great news overall it s a game i really recommend especially for the lovers of the mount and blade franchise
