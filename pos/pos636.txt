2016 i m not a big fan of reviews and i rarely give my opinion about the games i usually buy but this one deserves it i can remember of my sweet childhood when i used to have a ps1 and i could play harvest moon back to nature on it yeah i was pretty addicted to the game but unfortunately one day my console crashed i felt bad and ugh i didn t want to play anything anymore so when i got a computer i discovered the magic world of the emulators then i realized i could revive the good ol days playing harvest moon back to nature i downloaded the stuff and started to play the game with a controller to make it more nostalgic too bad it hasn t the same taste as before i didn t want to play it with the same vigour as before so last monday 03 07 a friend that i made at my new college recommended this game he said i could buy it without any regrets and you know what he was right i sold some of my most precious tf2 items in order to buy this game but it worth the risk i got something way more precious this game and now i can have some of the taste i was looking for since my ps1 crashed long time ago so if you like an old school game with a countryside thematic like harvest moon i strongly recommend it i gurarantee you won t regret spending your money on this game a little update i ll nominate it for the best use of a farm animal award panother update now nominated to the the labor of love award ppanother one update again nominated but now for best with friends award pppyet another update nominated again now for another the labor of love award pppp yeah i ll never get tired of this another another update yeah 5 years nominating this game for something nominated again for another labor of love award pppppanother another another update 6 years and counting here we go labor of love again ppppppanother another another uhh another update 7 years of labor of love let s keep going pppppppanother another another bruh another aaaaand another update 8 years labor of love here we are again let s do this pppppppp
