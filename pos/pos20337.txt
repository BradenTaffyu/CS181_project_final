i m bad at this game i m not a poker player i don t like am not good at keeping track of odds and numbers me counting cards absolutely not am likely to be thoroughly unimpressed at minimum if i am made to do mathtm to make game decisions and all things considered i should hate deckbuilding games and yet some of my favourite games are deckbuilder roguelites it took me over 20 hours to win my first balatro match i considered giving up multiple times convinced it wasn t for me and yet 35 hours later i m still playing it and do recommend it for reference my favourite game of the genre is monster train meaning i love being able to find synergies that just go bonkers insane to make huge combos as well as the rewarding feeling of plainly getting better at playing something just from playing it and being able to learn from my mistakes because the game design allows me to learn from those mistakes with clarity rather than plain confusion and pure rng there s a lot more rng involved in balatro than others in the genre which is understandable it s literally poker and in comparison to those it also allows less modifying of your deck it doesn t not allow it it s just harder to e g remove playing cards from your deck at all in the first few many matches but more opportunities for that unlock as you progress and unlock new jokers vouchers etc having gotten frustrated with this game plus what with everything i opened the review with being here still and fully recommending the game means that it s just good it s a refreshing take to the genre despite and because of its going back to the origins of deck games and it does allow a lot of fun scaling and strategic decisions if you stick with it has enough going for it to appease both tryhard snobs of the genre likely to deride anyone who doesn t appreciate torture of the hardest slay the spire levels as well as the more relaxed players who don t want to necessarily sit down with the intent of burning through neurons to have some fun engaging gaming each run also has a fairly good runtime and needed focus level to allow you to put on a podcast essay audiobook while playing at the same time all in all good game design pleasing ux nice learning curve and many many hours of potential fun
