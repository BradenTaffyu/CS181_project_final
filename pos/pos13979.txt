2018 i was a very big fan of don t starve so when i saw that klei had made another game i jumped at the chance when i saw the similar art style i also watched a youtube video of the early development and loved where the game was the game has come leaps and bounds since then and i have little to no complaint the only ones i do have are not really the games fault it s that it can be rather complex and complicated i m quite simple minded and the game still lets people like me be able to play i am not able to progress very far into the full automated bases that i ve seen streamers do i m able to replicate what someone has created already but i m incapable of creating something myself because i do not understand how the more complex machines work i m just fine either using coal machines or keep my duplicants running on wheels i absolutely adore the critter breeding i always have the easy mode settings on no stress responses i love that they included options like that again for people just like me that need or like easy mode settings thanks for making the game klei keep up the good work
