2020 early access review raft is a great twist on the survival game instead of running around on land gathering materials to build a base and defend it your entire world is your raft lose it and you re dead you can t just run away from danger and start in a new area i bought two copies so i could play with my teenager and that was some of the best gaming we ve done together very family friendly but she wouldn t go into the water for the first ten hours so i had to do all the harvesting with bruce around little shy on content right now but solid core game play
