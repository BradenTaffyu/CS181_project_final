2020 it s the best new tycoon game i ve played in years the only two things i don t like about it are the lack of enough available good employees and tediously spamming gold star pictures to keep hospital attractiveness up there is a mod that will take care of the employee issues there is a lot of attention to detail in the game some of the animations in the treatment rooms are quite funny water runs out of the waterfall painting things like that i got this on sale and it is definitely worth the price that i paid however i don t think that i would pay 35 for it i m a single mom and money is tight so part of that is my circumstances if the price isn t an issue for you i would recommend it to anyone who likes tycoon games
