2019 one of the few modern reboots to get it right it s exactly theme hospital but with a modern coat of paint and i love it it may become a tad repetitive in the later levels but somehow i always find myself come back to it there is a bit of balancing issues in that my cash was either constantly in the negatives while bootstrapping a hospital but then quickly rises to such great amounts that it becomes irrelevant and you can just pay your staff insane wages
