2018 the total war warhammer trilogy is one of the few game series in which i instantly pre order anything that s announced why because it s bloody good and has a lot of passion and love put into it why do i think this let s break it down mind you this is from the perspective of someone who has bought part 1 and 2 and plays almost exclusively the grand combined campaign called mortal empires da gud bitz nearly infinite replayability every race is unique in units buildings economy quests and objectives roam the world as chaos or the beastmen and plunder your vile little heart out crusade the deserts as the bretonnian knights or rebuild ancient glory as the lizardmen the possibilities are vast and every campaign unfolds differently lore porn as a warhammer fan the love for its lore truly shines the details on the units the flavour texts the art the buildings the magic creative assembly has brought the warhammer world to life in virtual form in the best way ever glorious combat the combat is as vast and bloody as you can expect from a warhammer setting having a hydra rip its way through hordes of barbarians looks great and a silver helm knight charge into waves of skeletons feels glorious one more turn yes that feeling of finishing your research or building next turn so you stall going to bed just a bit longer only to have your city be besieged by angry ratmen which of course need to be fended off as well and the gold from that fight can then be spent on some new buildings so better to grab a few more turns to get that the music is thematic with your position with the camera on the world map determining the kind of music you hear creative assembly is very open with its communication and even has a roadmap of free dlc that is planned for the game da stinkin bitz initial load time of the game is quite long although that of course depends on your rig the races of game 1 seem rather bland now as ca is evolving and new races have more mechanics than the old ones to get the experience i m having you need to spend quite a bit of money i ve spent it over the one and a half year that the trilogy is running now and in the light of the amount of hours i ve gotten out of the game it s a pittence but it can be off putting for new players i s gonna tell yaye gitz betta get dis game or da boyz iz gonna stomp ya gud harharhar
