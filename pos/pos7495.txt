2021 early access review the game is fun however be warned the dev is a bit f ed in the head when it comes to how why most people have use saves what do i mean the world state and character state are separate in other words if you happen to die for any reason even if you load an old save you re character will still die upon entering the game losing all items on you at the time of original death so if you re a solo player like myself always dump everything into a chest and create a backup save first before venturing out also carry as little as you can if you think you re heading into danger this really does need to change as much as the dev wants his risk anyone actually looking to make use of those save files would disagree whole heartedly the multiple backups are literally pointless otherwise
