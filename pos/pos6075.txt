2021 sims 4 gave me depressionsims 4 is 81 on steam meaning it s less than 5 so i got it because i had watched a graystillplays video on how to torture sims and thought it would be fun i buy it download it open it up and start playing and then the pain starts flooding in my sim who i made maybe 5 minutes ago starts talking to people making friends and having fun i build him a house he gets a job and everything is going well i quit the game and go about my day the next day i open it up again and keep playing about 10 minutes in my sim who i named eva unit 009 has a girlfriend i joke to myself is this guy speed running or something so i keep playing making more money friends skills etc next thing i know my sim has proposed to his girlfriend she said yes and they get married damn he is speed running i say fast forward real life 2 days and now he has a stable job a house kids and a wife money friends and happiness this is a certified bruh momentea has created a game with the intent to taunt me my sim a cluster of 1 s and 0 s on a screen has achieved what i can only dream of as i cry myself to sleep i have friends but they re the kind i ve known since we were toddlers so i have little to no skill in making new friends i have tried to get jobs before but this pandemic screwed me over i have no opportunity to go out and see my city to meet people to feel alive my only escape from online schoolwork is to stare another screen this whole damn year has taken me to depths i didn t think i go and now because of sims 4 i forced myself to acknowledge it for the first time in what feels like forever i cried last night i have a deep longing for fulfillment and happiness for friends and family but i can t see the road to reaching it i don t think i need a therapist since i have never struggled with things like this before but i just need to get it off my chest
