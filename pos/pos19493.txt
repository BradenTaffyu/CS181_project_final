2014 i absolutely loved fallout new vegas yes its more of the same but the story is more engaging i enjoyed the expanded equipment roster tons of locations and the companions were not half bad an excellent game spent hours scavenging and exploring the endless amounts of loot if you can get past the technical hurdles it s a heckuva gaming experience
