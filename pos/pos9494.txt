2015 kunos simulazioni came under a lot of criticism from most sim racers for their previous title netkar pro but they have learned from that experience as assetto corsa is an outstanding racing simulation the early release of assetto corsa has satiated the long awaited sim racing community as the beta and bi weekly updates kept everyone satisfied sim racing fans will argue about who has the best tyre modelling most accurate tracks physics and visuals but assetto corsa has managed to take all that and package it up in one great racing sim with a top notch physics and sublime tyre modelling spending time with each car you will appreciate the nuances of the physics each vehicle has to offer the visuals speak for themselves crisp clean and easy on the eye the tracks are accurately modelled and replicated from laser scan data the force feedback even after logging on a solid amount of hours is appreciable with subtle feeling still surprising me on top of the regular developer created content assetto corsa already has lively modding scene making third party tracks and cars so the future is really bright for this sim and i don t doubt most will still be playing this in years to come with a great core kunos simulazioni has proven that they have built assetto corsa into a successful racing simulator
