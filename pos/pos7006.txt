2021 early access review i actually haven t played this in a while but steam awards are upon us i nominated raft in the sit back and relax category though one could certainly argue that it fits better in the better with friends one did a quick launch just for the badge and nostalgia hit so i decided to briefly update my review as well i ve finished the full release story and in all honesty i had mixed feelings the final chapter felt a little rushed for the first time i ve encountered pretty bad bugs during a boss fight i felt like they could ve done more in terms of populating the ocean no need to go full subnautica but they mainly just added a few more decorative fish groups in the shallows it was nice sure just felt a little low effort all that aside i did continue to play mainly to chill on easy mode while listening to music or audiobooks it was a great way to completely distract myself after work sort of like diving into vacation mode and melting that stress away in terms of recommending the game i absolutely do though i do have some friends who got dreadfully bored within a dozen minutes or so and some who enjoyed it personally i loved raft and i ll keep coming back to this game from time to time oh if there s a bruce plushie that i can poke with a pencil or something i m so buying it leaving the entirety of my early access review below i ve loaded 2 worlds so far one with a teammate on normal difficulty and later solo easy i m so glad i started with a teammate and not on easy the initial poking around wasting time and a bit of survival chaos that ensued from neglecting the food water meters resulted in a few hours of incredible fun nothing more priceless than that initial oh moment when you re still clueless the shark bites off a bit of the raft for the first time and you re now floating on your measly 3 tiles not gonna lie when the shark started going right through them with the waves that became a little biggish and unruly i got a hit of mild thalassophobia on easy you don t have to worry too much about your food and water intake so you have more liberty to explore without stressing about supplies however going solo and already familiar with the basics i did notice that a certain repetitiveness can set in mostly due to survival mechanics there is a minimum necessary routine and oh no not this island again moments can happen but i d say it s not too much of a problem if you just surrender to the experience and relax fish dive have philosophical conversations with the shark poke it with a spear when it disagrees you definitely can t rush this game solo i can play this for up to an hour with company it s much more enjoyable so my advice would be don t venture into the ocean alone grab a buddy or two in case you re wondering no you can t eat them when supplies are low p though you can enable friendly fire so declaring an ffa for the last bit of fish scenario is entirely possible and don t fear the shark too much later you can wear it as a hat edit i ve now finished the story it took us around 40 50 hours in total to complete mind you we were taking our sweet time stopping at every island and stripping it of all its materials from the moment we built the radio receiver and started properly pursuing the objectives i d estimate there were some 15 20 hours of gameplay once the story was over my trusty teammate mostly lost interest while i m still floating about grinding achievements and enjoying the current endgame which is basically furnishing the raft of your dreams
