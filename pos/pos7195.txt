2022 the trucks look beautiful map looks great and of course its massive quite optimized 4k high and max is possible on mid tier gpu s i got a rx 6600xt and can do 4k max 60fps only issue is the lack of intelligence in the ai they will gladly cutoff a 130000lb truck halling gasoline doing 70mph at a 2 1 lane merge at the end of an highwayand the engine s don t sound realistic enough for me to get fully immersed but this game has a amazing modding community and a mod can easily fix that issue
