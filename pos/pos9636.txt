2014 this game is addictingly accurate even playing with a controller rather than a wheel you get so much feedback that driving the cars feels to natural that s not to say easy some of these cars and the challenges the game gives you to complete with them will kick your ass but the physics make sense you can improve your setup and driving because you ll know exactly what you did wrong and you ll feel how the setup changes impact your lap great tracks and cars already with more coming and a great modding community never been into racing sims but i can t stop playing this long story short get this game
