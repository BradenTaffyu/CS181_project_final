2016 early access review the good new races to play no pawns so full 4 player co op available alot of improvements from the first game overall graphical upgrades new special ability systemthe bad you always feel overpowered stats need rebalancing going full initiative makes sure you always get to play first you can kill all enemies before they have a first turn on highest difficulty obvious huge gaps in item upgrades pickpocketing still way too broken unlimited gold all shopitems for free having 1 magic armor is enough to stop all debuffs enemies too easy to crowd control stun freeze knock down spam rangers still do too much damage very broken in first game no penalty for poor intelligence low magic skill your spells will always land and you will always have 100 chance to crowd control you can have a warrior rogue ranger hybrid mage having a pure mage is such a waste whole game revolves around the teleport spell or simular transportation abilities too many abilities that allow you to escape or move enemies you can never get hit by melee enemies and you can always teleport enemy ranger mage infront of your melee team and just insta kill them on highest difficulty almost all of the quests are broken if you don t do them in the correct order which means you can t explore anything you can never complete them even the final quest of act 1 when you start a fight your characters run around and position them selves very awkwardly even if you pre set them in high ground etc they will run down and just stand somewhere totally unconvenient sometimes the conversations always end in the same way no matter what you choose to say for example you argue with an npc the outcome is exactly the same no matter if you win or lose the argument argument stats intimidate wits intelligence etc don t matter if you have maxed out your strenght you will still lose intimidation checks vs cowards if that s what the game designers intended conclusion all non direct damage spells need to be nerfed alot debuff vs magic armor system needs to be reworked conversations need to matter it s an rpg for crying out loud exploring shouldn t be punished by breaking quests crafting is totally pointless and needs to be reworked pickpockets needs a huge nerf since the starting area i have had the best items available to me there are alot of things that need improving and changing obviously it being in early access i still recommend the game because i really enjoyed the first one and i know hope they won t polish this one any less hoping they put alot of effort into balancing things out so i don t feel like a god at level 2 on highest difficulty i will probably rate the game 8 10 when complete and nerfed
