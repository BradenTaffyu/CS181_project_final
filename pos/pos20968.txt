2023 i thought dredge was the best indie game i played this year but dave the diver is just as good if not better without a doubt dave the diver has tons more content than dredge with just so much to do that it feels like a steal to buy it at full price all main and side quests are exciting to complete and the mechanics of building up your gear fishery restaurant farm etc is fun and not a chore with both dave the diver and dredge being in the dredging diving bundle on sale right now i would definitely recommend getting both in the bundle they re both different games that complement each other well with crossovers too if they don t win this year s steam awards in their respective categories then the voting is surely rigged
