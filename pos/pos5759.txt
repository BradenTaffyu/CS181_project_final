2022 early access review 226 hours in i ve fully gone down the medieval warlord rabbit hole there are many components to this game but most all of them work well enough the star of the show is the real time battles at full war scale for maximum effect i strongly suggest getting voiceattack and configuring it to let you make voice commands for your troop formations it s wonderfully fluid once you get the hang of it so yeah i recommend this game if you have a lot of spare time on your hands last year it was kerbal space program and this year it s bannerlord
