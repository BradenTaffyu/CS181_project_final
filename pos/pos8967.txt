2018 it took 2 years and many dlc releases for stellaris to hot 2 0 it took just as long for me to finally commit and do a deep dive into the game it would not be dishonest to say that prior to 2 0 i had bounced off hard with each try but finally something just clicked i have been playing it now for a couple of weeks and i m seriously impressed i see where it needs more work but for the most part stellaris is a very polished and fantastic game a new experience to be had just around every corner i think paradox interactive knocked it out of the park no the city with this one good job all around they have earned my business yet again
