2015 i don t know why people dislike this game yes this isn t skyrim if you hope it is then you re wrong but if we compare it with fallout 3 this game have a lot of improvement shooting is much more realistic the combat system i would say better than fallout 3 and skyrim skyrim is just plain punching shooting slashing this one is different pros combat system is amazing chair now actually have a function and i think it s unfair for being able to wait everywhere modding weapon is amazing power armors are more realistic a lot of people complained about it being given in the first two quest but you can t do anything if you don t have the fusion core you have to wait at least sometime to get them dog meat isn t as tanky as in fallout 3 but it can do a lot of other things grabbing enemy searching etc dialog system is perfect i don t remember that talking with more than 2 people simultaneously is common in both elder scroll and fallout but in fallout 4 everywhere also the dialog is rich settlement what else can you hope for cons could use a bigger map but each location is far more deeper than fallout 3 and nv both karma and reputation are gone this is a huge cons for me no more casino like nv but it s understandable it s not nv settlement system sometimes can be more like chore than fun but still a good addition
