2017 garry s mod is a sandbox game no objectives no goals it just provides you with the tools and allows you do whatever please however it s beyond that since there s the steam workshop which is likely what your fun will come out of the most maps models more tools gamemodes etc gmod also comes with trouble in terrorist town or ttt for short basically you either hunt down all the terrorists or kill all the civilians and etc depending on your role as for me i mainly play on ultimate chimera hunt which is a hide and seek gamemode based off of the game mother 3 there are two things to watch out for you ll need to have the resource files for both team fortress 2 and counter strike source in order to fully enjoy the game and not have missing textures on most maps which means two long game downloads and 20 down the drain for a dead game and some resources there are also the achievements which are very time consuming very can hardly describe how long these achievements can take regardless i find the 10 price tag worth it if you look at how much you can get out of it and the fun shenanigans that can be pulled with friends
