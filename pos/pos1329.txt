2022 early access review i first thought i couldn t play this game because my computer is really crappy but i bought it anyway cause i liked the project and wanted to support it after downloading it i launched the game and as i guessed i didn t had any fps at all so i left and uninstalled but didn t asked for a refund i want them to keep my money so i did everything i could so that they would gain even more like by paying the game outside of steam sales it s my first ever donation and i m glad i did it i just hope it will work and the game will evolve to a more movie esque roleplaying survival game the graphism are perfect the gameplay is variable depending on your mods because yes this game is heavily moddable and even better it runs on low end pc to come back on it i had a problem with resolution which put it to 2200x2200 or something like that and i couldn t change it at all but after fixing it i was able to modify it to 1920x1080 which made the game playable with 95 fps on my crappy computer so yes i m glad i gave my money to this game and the overall gameplay was fun even if i didn t play for too long i do think some mods should be officialy added to the game like the one with the hairs that stays the same even with hats or the zombie modifier but an overall is 9 10 played some sandbox watched a youtuber privatelime playing it made me learn how to play better faster than reading tutorials i was able to survive an empty of ressources multiplayer server full of zombies for 15 minutes i know i m not a good player but it was impressive considering the low amount of game time i have that now if i learn how to use a keyboard properly i would probably be able to survive indefinitely quickly
