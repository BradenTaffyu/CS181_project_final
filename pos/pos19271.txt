2022 i played all the aoe games empire earth rise of nations starcraft warcraft command conquer dawnofwar some other random games the total war games so i m a fan of rts i ve played these games on and off pretty casually since i was in elementary school back in 2001 ish with starcraft ii i played ranked and was in gold well there s my rts background and i can firmly say that this game is also pretty good my main complaint is the lack of civilizations compared to aoe ii but aoe iv does seem to have more unique civs compared to aoe ii and i don t exactly like how extreme the unit counters are compared to aoe ii that had softer unit counters last complaint is that i don t like the cartoonyness of the unit size scaling which can be fixed with mods and the super vibrant colors i don t like other than that yeah it s great i actually enjoy it more than aoe ii in a lot of ways for example in aoe ii there was a bit too much micro controlling of the units regarding the ranged units and siege which was just too sweaty and took away some of the grand epic strategy in aoe iv i can focus less on micro and more on the big battle strategy which is what i m more into personally for an rts give this game a try despite its apparent rough launch it appears the devs have made some good patches and listened to the community
