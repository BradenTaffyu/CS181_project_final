2018 no matter what faction you play as every single encounter and every single individual campaign plays out differently every time this game has some of the best replay value i ve encountered there are not very many other single player oriented game s ive sunk so many hours into this game is epic and deffinately worth 120 00 dollars for the mortal empires campaign i regretted buying tw wh just for the mortal empires until i actually played it the map is so huge with everything mashed into one big campaign for example i m currently playing as clan angrund the dwarf clan and one of my long campaign objectives is to capture some of the dark elf settlements all the way to the west of my starting location and it s like that for most factions meaning in order to complete the campaign you ll have to pretty much conquer the whole map
