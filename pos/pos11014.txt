2023 tldr i 100 recommend cities skylines ii despite the optimization issues and some bugs the game has tremendous potential and even in its current state it is a fantastic city building experience i felt compelled to write a review for this game especially after seeing unfair negativity surrounding this game both here on steam as well as on other social media platforms firstly i will state that obviously my experience with the game is not necessarily indicative of how anybody else s experience with the game may be my review will be broken up into a few sections and give you a well rounded view of what i found particularly good about the game performance this is the biggest area that most people have been unfairly bashing cs ii i truly believe the only reason people have been as frustrated as they have been is because the game is not running super smoothly in 4k resolution with every possible setting and effect at full quality here s the thing if you go into this game with the intention of running it at that quality that smoothly you need a monster pc i went into the game understanding that my own hardware is quite outdated and have achieved a stable and smooth frame rate so i have been able to enjoy the game without any real complaints i have my game set to pretty much medium graphic settings and it still runs smoothly with my city s population passing 10k residents i hope that the game does improve in its optimization as it would allow for even more seamless gameplay but i am willing to deal with what issues i encounter until those fixes do come one thing i have noticed is that the game consistently runs gpu heavy where my gpu is constantly running at about 94 usage for reference my pc specs are as follows cpu i7 6700k oc gpu gtx 1070 8gb vram ram 32 gbi am also only using a 4tb hdd for storage visuals graphics so let me paint you a picture of my gameplay experience so far after booting up the game i settled on building on the twin mountains map as i had heard it was based on iceland and thought this would be a neat setting but also a good way to test the accuracy of the weather climate and day night cycles the game starts you in june 2023 at about 0800 hrs so summer time conditions the weather fluctuates between the mid 50 s and the low 20 s just like in real life i left the game unpaused and keep building as i wondered when night time might come as in real life iceland s summer nights are very short the sun did not set until almost 2300 hrs and quickly rose the next morning around 0230 hrs i was blown away at the attention to detail and the accuracy of these systems the rain effects are stunning cloud coverage creates realistic shadows over the city and the visuals as a whole are absolutely stunning even on medium settings the game is just aesthetically beautiful to look at gameplay i came into cs ii with about 600 hours of experience on the original right off the bat this game is a vast improvement over the original in terms of how it plays the road building zoning districting and terraforming tools are much easier to use and function seamlessly the new zoning types fit right in and allow for redevelopment in a realistic and creative way the only thing that i have felt underwhelmed with was the lack of props and ways to fill awkward spaces gaps between uses to be fair the original cs did not find a solution to this problem until the advent of the parks dlc years after the initial release so even then cs ii is not in a bad place with how things have been so far i look forward to the introduction of the map editor so i can design my own maps mods and new dlcs that will just add to the overall pleasant experience that i have had so far final thoughts i know many people have been less than enthused about this game many have been angry demanded refunds review bombed the game or outright bashed the game to oblivion online they have their reasons i am merely posting my review to give you a side that hasn t been talked about in that discussion i have a mediocre pc by modern standards and have been able to play the game just fine at 1080p i know that with time the review score here on steam will become positive given how colossal order has previously handled cs and made it one of the best games of all time i have faith that cs ii will become the best city builder of all time with all of its new features and innovative simulation functions overall i would give the game in its current state an 8 5 10 it is not perfect and has its bugs but is a great foundation with potential to get even better
