2016 this is a really refreshing game as far as the total war series is concerned i was initially concerned by them going in the warhammer direction but my fears no longer exist it is such a nice feeling to send your hero unit into battle and watch the mayhem he creates it reminds me a little bit of sauron just destroying units except it s not sauron but karl franz they improved a lot as far as cavalry is concerned too it used to always be a little disappointing to me in previous games when a cavalry charge would just fail because the enemy turned his units just on time now cav has weight and units will go flying even when prepared also no more of that if one unit is engaged the whole cavalry stops and turns back bs spells are fun to use as well seriously powerful but not completely op the campaign is actually really intelligently done too when i first heard that say the empire could only take occupy other human settlements and vampire count settlements i was a little concerned but it turns out it is really a smart move because now every campaign will automatically feel different since you will be settling in different regions completely ish i had stopped enjoying total war games since shogun 2 however i can now finally say that this is no longer the case bottom line this game is great and i highly recommend it oh and you don t need to be a big warhammer fan to enjoy the game i barely know anything about it yet i am having a blast i am sure it helps but i don t think you will miss serious story altering facts yes i realize warhammer fans now think i m a giant moron i m okay with that
