2018 this game must have some of the best quests i ve ever seen all quests are so different from each other and i can t easily think of another game that put this much detail in its quests the world that you play in the mojave wasteland is huge and has a great atmosphere fitting into the style of the game all characters you meet have their own unique personality which is very important for a good rpg fallout new vegas does a great job at it all and it makes for one of the greatest games i have ever played
