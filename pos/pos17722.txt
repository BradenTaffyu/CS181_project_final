2016 i am not one to have played any total war title before this game i can t even say i ve played a whole lot of strategy games hell even as far as warhammer i ve read more than i ve played i have to be honest though i m hooked into the lore of warhammer and when i saw this game announced i knew i had to have it i preordered it i ve preordered every dlc yes i know there are a ton of people who want to string up ca and sega and even gw for the way the dlc has poured out for this game but the truth is you don t want them fine don t buy them you want only specific ones then buy them this game has offered me endless amounts of enjoyment my friends get tired of hearing about me discuss it i fanboy over every race full roster or not my favorite race dark elves aren t even out yet and yet just the evolution of this game and the bright future it has excites me i can t wait for the next dlc or freelc or race or whatever i just hope that whether you want to piss and moan over the dlc or not you at least try this game it s worth that much at least
