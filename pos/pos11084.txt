2022 i wholeheartedly recommend this game to any dinosaur lover with 50 ish bucks to spare this incredible game allows you to experience the jurassic franchise in a whole new way the best part though is the premise of building enclosures for the game s dinosaurs speaking of which the dinosaurs themselves are very convincing at times sometimes bugs or wonky animations break the immersion a bit though still a huge step up from jwe1 i m 14 currently and i ve been obsessed with dinosaurs since i was 6 so being able to spent hours watching ai dinosaurs is awesome its not like a movie or documentary where you just get a few minutes of screentime or less for every animal nah enjoy your dinosaurs for as long as you want the game also works a dream other than a few minor bugs this game is very reliable i ve had it since launch and it s only crashed on me once the dlc s are yes a bit overpriced but if you buy them one at a time over long periods then this won t be a huge issue still kinda annoying that a lot of the game s coolest dinosaurs are behind a paywall though the game can be a bit underwhelming sometimes and it seems that frontier has chosen to drop the game but aside from that there is really nothing to hate ok that s it really matthew aged 14p s this is my third iteration of this review the others were pretty bad so i decided to restart from scratch
