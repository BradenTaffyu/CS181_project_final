2020 update in 2024 please make the weapon hits harder i e shotgun can one or two shot humanoid enemy in the head without focusing too much on that certain gun perk or focusing too much on bloodied build reason so much people focuses on bloodied build is that the damage for non bloodied build is lame and ammo consuming and the risk being low hp is not that high updates as of 2023 the game itself has become bland every update and gameplay feels the same go here wait for enemy kill kill and kill nothing is different especially after the pitt and alien update people who want to switch to new playstyle will have to grind exp again to get the cards relevant armors and weapons that are hard to find rng suggestion get the game when it s heavy on sale and you have friends to play this game summary an open world fallout 4 style and feel type game where you got other 23 other players in same world s server you can build camp take outposts and it will all refresh change when you leave the world you can take main quest side quest daily mission raids and in world event most of these are joinable by your friends and or public early foreword about me hated the game but then fell in love with it i wanted to play and buy this game the first time it came out on bethesda s launcher but after i heard the news and gossip about the game was extremely bad everywhere especially on twitter and 9gag and it even said that the game was the worst fallout game series ever published i decided to not buy it full of bugs clunky unoptimized lack of content very dull because of no npc quests are boring only chasing empty voice notes left by previous overseer chasing ghost i m gonna be honest with you all and to bethesda i despised past tense the game so much hated it made fun of it mocked it down made fun of bethesda for being this bad and i even tried the free trial and still dissapointed badly i followed the bad train hype and i felt disgusted so much with fallout 76 my god the hate on fallout 76 was so much on twitter i was dissapointed with this fallout game because i loved the previous fallout games 3 nv 4 and they were all amazing but this one i tried it myself and the hate trend was right after all that mess next i decided to forget about it and move on completely fast forward in time few months or maybe years later something different came up fallout 76 had wastelander update and coming to steam big news steam platform for me was my most beloved and trusted game platform no sarcasm im being honest compared to bethesda s launcher it was an important turning point for me to try the game the review of fallout 76 after wastelander update was super good blue color and the steam reviews said bethesda has redeemed themselves especially by adding npc well obviously i tried the free trial on steam and they linked my account from bethesda to steam amazing work i could continue where i left off my progress on existing character before the game came into steam from that moment i fell in love with the game all hate and disgusted feeling just gone the game has the feel of fallout 4 there so much but much better because it s online i love fallout 4 and this game is a perfected edition of fallout 4 the best and most favorite game for me so far review pros and cons cons what s lacking chat feature come on man its 2023 perk feature is kinda confusing for new players need more tutorial on that inventory limitation management i e if you got 400 stimpaks or 400 radaways and your inventory on stash box is limit you cannot store them inside you gotta bring those heavy medicines all around and selling those large items on store is limited to 1400 caps a day continued on next point so you gotta manage your inventory well this is for me is the most annoying part you are limited to selling roughly 1400 caps every 20 hrs mean if you got tons of items in your bag valued over 1400 caps you cannot sell more after it s exhausted so yep you ll get tons of ready to sell items in your backpack weighing you down and you cannot sell em unless you wait 20 hrs tomorrow or just waste them down the drain dropping it not fully optimized for weaker pc laptop imho building replacement can be a pain in the butt sometimes prepare to start over guys please make it better bethesda general quest is not boring unlike some games telling you to go here kill here go here kill this so the quest is not always about battle there s some quest you don t even have to kill shoot attack at all though it could have some more in depth consequence based quest to make a proper build such as armor you need to grind the materials needed such as script and some are rng random if you re making 1 focused build it s easy if you take it slow and your rng is good i e perks for tank such as more health more defense but if you try something new it really takes time because everything is limited you want to grind so much sure but you can only get few script points per day so if you already gathered enough scripts to roll a random perks for your armor it still generated randomly so you gotta gather scripts by participating in events and trading armor for script points again to re roll the perks on the current armor until you get what you want it s usually fast 1 2 weeks but still a pain in the ass what s good if you love the feel and core gameplay of fallout 4 you ll love this game it has same feel as fallout 4 make your own base in a slice of land in the appalachia wanna make huge base full of walls or decent luxurious house or maybe a shop you re free to create fallout sense and feel atmosphere dialogs lores etc raids battles in dungeons are good guns and combat gameplay is good core game is fun solid and good a good casual game where you can drop out of game anytime and join anytime no penalties whatsoever so you can enjoy this game to your heart s content looting stuff for your base is easy just loot everything normal regulars ammo are self suifficient in dungeon daily ops mission you ll get tons of em free more effective ammo is a bit rarer perk cards or skills can be equipped and re equipped with no penalties that means one time you can equip that lv 3 maxed out lockpicking skill or change it to something else flexibility core gameplay is balanced enemy is balanced to give you challenges you cannot have too much ammos without sacrficing something either storage inventory limit or weight but the game also provides you with free ammos if you do some challenges like daily ops or quest you also cannot be filthy rich cap is maxed at 30k caps you cannot hoard everything storage is limited so that level of detail for me is good so you manage everything in moderation if you like fallout 4 you will love this i used to play fo 4 a lot and it became boring in a world where you roam alone then this game jumpstarted my love for fallout even more with the same feel recommended to try first buy at sale not recommended to buy on regular price without trying seeing it firsthand since it may not suit everyone s taste recommendation for the developers make weapon as powerful as they look 50 cal should be devastating even to hardened mutant bones and bodies especially perhaps cannons and so forth sometimes the shotgun is not that powerful to humanoid enemies so basically tune it to more realistic
