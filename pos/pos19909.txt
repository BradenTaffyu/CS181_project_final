2015 there are lots of people who say that fallout 3 is better than fallout new vegas because fallout 3 has better dialogue or more interesting characters or makes you care more about the world than new vegas does those people are lying let s start with the obvious one the world in fallout 3 you basically have a choice of being a good guy or being a douche bag but no matter what you are railroaded into following the main quest line which is to grow up in the vault leave to chase after your father join up with the brotherhood of steel and fulfill your parents dream of a wasteland filled with life the only difference between a good and evil main quest completion is which of two options you pick at the very end either putting a modified fev strain into the water supply to kill off unfit humans becoming a eugenicist in the process or not doing that that s it a do you want to be evil y n dialogue box at the very end of the main quest is not good design even worse picking one choice or the other doesn t actually change anything after you complete the main quest in new vegas by contrast you have four different ways to finish the main quest line and you re locked into picking one when you re still a few quests away from the climactic ending once you ve firmly sided with one faction the others will shun you and even attack you if you re particularly mean to them the fate of the mojave wasteland is real and dynamic and you get to shape it to your will far more than you can the capitol wasteland and that s not even mentioning the fact that it takes a solid ten minutes in vault 101 before you re let out into the world while you only need about sixty seconds of listening to michael hogan before you can start roaming in new vegas the tutorial in nv is more organic than f3 and completely optional what about the mechanics well f nv has everything f3 does plus a fully flushed crafting system fallout 3 let you make 10 marginally useful items from blueprints new vegas has dozens maybe hundreds of craftable items that includes campfire remedies reconstruction and recalibration of bullets improvised ammo natural poisons and lots more the ability to aim down your sights i didn t remember how much i valued that until i picked up fallout 3 again a higher level cap and more and more specialized perks lots of fallout 3 s were just add 5 points to this attribute and 5 to that one boring the need to choose two handicaps at the start of the game to make each playthrough pose its own challenges faction disguises a hardcore mode decreased effectiveness of v a t s to make the choice of whether to use it or not meaningful in fallout 3 you could just spam jet with grim reaper and mow down tons of foes without thinking nv makes you play more tactically and lots of other things i ve mostly forgot about from a mechanics perspective then fallout new vegas does beat fallout 3 what about characterization lots of people have said that they just didn t care about the characters in fallout new vegas the way they did the characters in fallout 3 i can only conclude they didn t get exposed to any video game characters before playing fallout 3 because new vegas characters are definitely more flushed out companions are the best example of this in fallout 3 your companions have the personality of two lines in a speech bubble stapled to a cardboard cutout with a crayon smiley face drawn on there are no real differences between the companions they simply run around shoot whatever weapon you give them and have a few generic lines of dialogue in new vegas however each character starts out holding a part of their personality back from you you know like people in real life they have personal motivations and will leave you if you do something they don t like for example retired ncr ranger boone will leave if you start hurting ncr people cass will leave if you have very low karma etc if you do things they like while they re travelling with you for example if you have chuck bartow i mean arcade gannon in your party when you direct helios one s power to freeside and westside you will eventually trigger more dialogue options where they tell you more about their past because they trust you and depending on how you respond you can trigger a quest that has them confront their past the choices they ve made and what their future holds you as their friend have some influence based on your dialogue options and that impacts the way these characters will act in the future this is the epitome of characterization in video games that is about as close to how people work that we re going to get in an open world post apocalyptic rpg and i love it i m not going to bother getting into nitpicky things like weapons armor buff items etc it s a sequel so of course there s an improvement in the variety of items that s to be expected in short the worst fallout new vegas can be accused of is not improving on fallout 3 enough fallout 3 is better from a narrative storytelling perspective the narrator of course being liam neeson but fallout new vegas is a game where you choose who you are which is the crux of an rpg a fallout game in particular i recommend you get both this and fallout 3 but if you have to pick just one new vegas is the better option heit
