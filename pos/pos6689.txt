2015 even though driving around may get boring after a while this game has to be one of the most immersive driving games i have ever played content wise the game s not dissapointing either you don t get too many trucks but you get plenty of variety when it comes to customizing the map is pretty big and you can easily expand it with modifications i do recomment promods their map expansion is like really polished and really huge if you get to add your favourite playlist or an online radio station you ll love this game for sure oh and thanks to this game i started looking at mirrors when turning or changing lanes in the other games nothing s better than a game which builds good habits
