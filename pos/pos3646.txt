2021 this is my game of the year you know those special games that you ve played where once you finish you can t help but think you won t be able to experience this again but you re so happy you did well omori is one of those games for me i have never ever been so emotionally wrecked and inspired at the same time mother 3 had me in shambles at it s end and got to me emotionally a few times outside that but omori does it one better in my opinion this game teaches you in unorthadox ways to make unpleasant things something you have to do it brings you into the experience it s not just your character overcoming these challenges you do as well you have to face your fears face your conscience at times and you can t just wait for something to happen from someone who horror is genuinely not an experience i enjoy feeling here it felt necessary not cheap and the things in between it were so wildly rewarding and engaging it was worth it to challenge my fears and come out on top it was worth the anxiety to see my digital friends get closer to what they hope for the main cast in this game never break immersion of what you expect from them they have character and they will probably make you reflect on people you once knew and had grown apart from they made me feel nostalgia for characters i was just getting to know they ll give you reasons to like them they feel like they belong together nobody is some third wheel who has no input or you could do without this is probably one of the biggest sells to omori it s fantastically written characters the battle system is somewhat what you would expect from an rpg turn based each character is somewhat classed into their own thing like dps healer tank speedster and each with their own pool of moves what shakes things up is the emotions system so like rock paper scissors each emotion beats one and is trumped by another sad beats happy happy beats angry and angry beats sad with a few nuances like happy making crits occur more often while sacrificing accuracy or anger and sadness making sacrifices between your offense and defense these statuses can be inflicted on your own party and enemies to control the flow of super effective attacks and strategies and usually not one strategy can work forever so you ll have to experiment to maximise your efforts battles also have follow up attacks each character can bounce off one of the others to do team up attacks for example if kel looks to hero for a follow up they ll perform an attack that targets all enemies if aubrey looks to omori she ll do another attack trying to get him to notice her everyone bounces well off eachother in the story but it s reflected in the battles too it s a great system and i never felt the need to grind in the normal run through the game the music is perfect it balances those bouncy joyful tones of a colorful rpg and it s darker undertones honestly it s so well done any horror or unease you just felt will probably be undone by the next great battle theme it s memorable the music always compliments what s happening the soothing notes of mari s theme sells who she is it reinforces the safety she provides while the battle theme of otherworld instils that spacey pop vibe that keeps things upbeat and nostalgic while you fight tape decks and dial up for a soundtrack that incorporates horror it s weird that i d still listen to it outside the game the story of omori well to put it spoiler free it s about travelling the world of headspace to look for your friend who s missing you get to meet them and get an idea of who they are and why you would want to find them rescue them all the while dealing with instances that make you feel something isn t right this game will go into some very heavy themes of suicide trauma anxiety and depression this is not for everyone but i feel it s worth overcoming and i m glad it isn t a tale of malice it s very human it s about mistakes and the trauma that follows it s about the climb back up and facing the hard truths omori is a beautiful game worth so much to me and i just want this experience to reach more people i d recommend this to anyone who likes rpgs and good battle systems strong characters and story maybe even to those looking for a genuine perspective into some hardships of mental health
