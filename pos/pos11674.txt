2016 early access review this s like dayz you have to survive againt the weather players and zombies while you hunt and harvest to have your own food but here you also may construct your own house base in blocks relax the game is not in blocks watchout contruct your base before the 7 day or you will see what is difficulty the beginning may be a bit hard for beginners so i will give some tips about the weather well don t go to the snow before you have your own clothes specially a good sweater and stay away from water or you will freeze faster in this biome use stones to make a bonfire and wood to ignite about the desert use light clothes and if you find water jump into to refresh before you lose health in the beginning you can make your clothes using plant fiber or cotton and construct a stone axe using plant fiber wood and stone and this is what will help you to take more woods and stones to construct your stuffs you may also contruct a shovel that you will use to cave some clay you may recognize it by the orange earth on the ground while you walk or even in the map and contruct a furnace to make some iron burning some metal and finally progress in your game there is a lot of thing to learn but i can t write everything here just discover by yourself this is the fun oh and be sure you will die a lot good luck i just love survival games and this one impressed me a lot 10 10
