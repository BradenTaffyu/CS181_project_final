2020 i generally only write reviews for games that have either disappointed me astronomically or have far exceeded expectations stellaris is by far one of the best games i have ever had the privilege of playing i will try and put this in useful form as to why this game stands out above all other 4x strategy games 1 as a multiplayer experience the politics of this game led to so many absolutely hilarious and unpredictable events at one point my friend and i were fighting a mysterious empire off effectively saving the universe we asked everyone else for help and they flat out told us to off left with the decision to unleash the threat on them or save the universe we still saved the universe2 your species is actually unique i have made three separate species and play them all completely differently you don t have to be a warmonger events in the game flavor each playthrough differently 3 the empire management is not tedious but is incredibly fun you genuinely tend to want the best for your empire whether you are a slaver space koala or xenophobic snail species some events soften your view on the universe you end up with unlikely friends 4 the battles look epic and the soundtrack is really incredible cons 1 some may say too micro managey around planets i don t mind at all 2 on lower difficulty the ai is extremely stupid i have not yet played on hard but an ai that took over half my planets hilariously managed to completely ruin them by the time i could take them back this could be different at higher difficulty levelsthis game is really amazing i would put it in my top 10 of all time quite easily give it a shot what do you have to lose
