2016 my friends asked me to play other games with them playing anything else is heresy so i put them to the torch my boss was telling me that i might lose my job but my job is devotion to sigmar anything else is heresy i put him to the torch my family said i need to spend more time with them turning off this game is heresy so i burned my house down my computer crashed before i could save and i had to load an old file time travel is heresy so i set my computer on fire i guess if you want a real non heretical review this is one of the best total war games i have played so far although there are a few things that could use a bit of work i still think this game was worth it 9 5 10
