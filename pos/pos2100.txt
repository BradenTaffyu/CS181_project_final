2023 i wanna start by saying i absolutely love the payday series with 4 000 hours in payday 2 payday 3 is a game that took a little time to grow on me i didn t love it at first but after getting some time in i really started to enjoy the game the stealth is a total blast heists can be completed with mask on or mask off with multiple ways to go about successfully finishing said heists random generation of levels means it has a chance to be different each time you play loud is pretty fun too not a ton of weapons to choose from currently but a lot of them are fun to use and heists can be pretty intense on higher difficulties movement feels good with the addition of vaulting and sliding the skill system is interesting and similar to payday 2 they are skill lines instead of skill trees you can build for loud or stealth and don t have to put points in order from beginning to end the skills revolve around edge rush and grit these 3 things are buffs to the player activated through the skills i personally don t love this but it doesn t mean it s a bad system since the soundtrack was amazing for payday 2 i did want to mention i personally don t find the soundtrack to this game nearly as good compared to the previous game we ll have to see what comes in the future map design for the heists are pretty freaking sweet minus road rage not that it s a bad heist but it felt like the weakest out of all of them customization for weapons and heisters is ok not a ton of attachments per weapon but they do change the way it performs slightly there are cosmetics like suits gloves and masks they re alright but nothing insane there s challenges that are directly tied to leveling up your character heists career and weapons you ll need to be doing these to earn infamy to keep leveling at a consistent pace it s ok but i preferred the way it was in payday 2 most of these are just completing missions earn infamy and doing certain things with individual weapons overall i do like this game maybe not as much as payday 2 currently but that could change in the future there isn t a ton of content right now but i m sure that will change over time with only 8 missions remember payday 2 didn t have all the heists that it has now at launch pretty sure it didn t even have the fugitive skill tree in the beginning the biggest problem is the online only like everyone is saying with no offline mode as of writing this i ve spent nearly half my time in the game trying to load into a heist the servers aren t working very good whatsoever the release of this was extremely rocky negative reviews pouring in because people quite literally can t play the game they paid money for i completely share the frustration a lot of others are having with the match making and nebula errors i believe this will all be ironed out eventually but don t know when as of writing this i can t even load into the game because of the nebula error i do recommend the game but definitely would wait until starbreeze figures their server issues out
