2019 great remake feels just like the old one my one gripe the remade music is not note for note and that messes with me i grew up hearing the same songs over and over and now they make these new versions and they re missing notes or they make an easier to play section for the musicians you can t get lazy with the music kind of wish there was a way i can import the old music
