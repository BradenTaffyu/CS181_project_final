2016 games like this make me truly wonder if aliens are aware of our existence but don t want anything to do with us so they remain out of contact welcome to garry s mod a horrifying chimera of internet culture pink checkerboard textures and preteen administration god help us all garry s mod is less a game and more a platform for further modification there are hundreds if not thousands of gametypes across servers both paid for by mum s allowance and desperately needing to be reset in case you re wondering why i m so quick to jump on this kids run this game lol schtick you need to understand that every single server you play on will be moderated by someone who hasn t nut yet there s really no point in me getting into the visuals or sound design for garry s mod chances are if you re interested in this game at all you aren t exactly concerned with either considering that most of this game s base assets are over a decade old the only thing cutting edge here would be the polygonal geometry that aside garry s mod is home to a ton of great times you can have whether you re playing by the rules or not the average player is gonna spend about 99 8 of their time in multiplayer with that remaining 2 being where you mess around in sandbox mode after your initial purchase get a couple friends together and buckle up because you re in for one wesley willis tier hellride once you and your crew s decided to move onto the bulk of the game you ve got a number of modes to choose from popular ones include darkrp deathrun cinema and of course trouble in terrorist town that s about it i mean this is all i can really say about the base game itself so you may be saying to yourself hrunghfhfhguaa this is a positive review this is telling me that i should probably devour an entire cask of lead before i touch this well make no mistake the best part about garry s mod is the mods within it let s cover a few of them shall we trouble in terrorist town generally considered the magnum opus of the game modes ttt drops players in the middle of a 3 way standoff the detectives the innocent and the traitors are all chosen at random this is a great party game with friends as well as a brilliant attraction for trolling there s a karma system implemented to prevent that but it s basically the equivalent of putting layers of grip tape on a knife blade it s functional it s fun and i definitely recommend at least trying it darkrp ever wonder what it would be like being a cop would it include smacking civvies in the street chasing people carrying money printers to benny hill and cybering with a hobo why would you expect it any other way darkrp is something that allows you to escape real life by imitating real life with the added bonus of crippling depression if you haven t already gotten that covered be a radio dj be a shopkeeper be a cop be a criminal be whatever you re among friends just like the ones in your head deathrun disguised as a game mode this method of torture was previously used in nazi germany as a way of escapism breaking their captives to ease the pain and strife knowing that they were not going to progress any further through the russian tundra and that their own corpses were now the ones piling up in stalingrad this twisted take on the famous children s game press the button and live milton bradley is taken to the extreme and allows you to murder both friends and strangers alike in new and exciting ways and if they re trying hard they can murder you too wow cinema you watch videos with your friends in a virtual theater this is as exciting as it sounds now that i m finished completely alienating you from this game hopefully you can see why i recommend this game it s like watching a train wreck in slow motion except you re a passenger on said train and xxxgunthehedgehogxxx is still trying to get you banned before the impact wouldn t have it any other way god bless
