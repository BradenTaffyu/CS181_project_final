dark souls 3 is the souls game that we wanted and it is the souls game we got as the smoothest and most refined of the trio ds3 takes what was good in ds1 and ds2 and expands on it aside from no power stancing to start the gameplay is extremely smooth and combat works exactly how you desire it one of the biggest issues i had with ds2 was that combat felt clunky that issue does not exist with ds3 due to ds3 being a lot more modern than ds1 the combat also just feels more fleshed out you still have your melee ranged magic builds but ds3 introduces a mana bar i still think the game was meant to be played melee but whatever build you do is up to you bosses were extremely memorable and scale up pretty reasonably the bosses in the early game are manageable even if you are new to souls especially since quite a few of them are gimmick bosses however we get some of the most memorable bosses across the souls games in ds3 whereas in ds1 we had many extremely memorable bosses ds3 introduces a large plethora as well ds2 bosses were overall less memorable imo some of the ones i thought were most memorable include nameless king lord of cinders sister friede dlc gael dlc lothric princes aldritch and champion gundyr what s better is that ds3 is actually quite related to ds1 and you ll even revisit anor londo map design is also excellent for ds3 and you get some of the same stuff that we loved about souls in ds3 most of the main world is connected in some way as a big map with twists and turns bringing you to new regions that somehow link up again afterwards shortcuts hidden paths bonfires etc make the map and levels really fun to get through one of the best feelings is when you d been grinding for a while and then suddenly open up a shortcut via an elevator or something the only part of the game that i highly disliked is the 100 achievement hunt ds3 is basically souls achievement grinding on steroids because getting all the rings takes so much time additionally in order to get all the different spells you need to max out covenants to max out covenants you need certain drops that were meant to be received via pvp now if i played ds3 when it came out this should have been no issue because there were plenty of people playing online however years later now the online base has dwindled making farming covenant items much harder if you were to farm it pve it has an extremely rare chance to drop in certain mobs making the pve grind experience super super annoying boring and uninspiring i ended up sticking it out for 100 to the end but it was not worth it overall definitely one of the most fun souls games i highly recommend you pick the game up and give it a swing you will not be dissappointed
