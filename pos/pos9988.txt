2022 rimworld is an incredible example of emergent narrative gameplay rimworld gives you a toolbox full of systems and subsystems to play with if you wanted rimworld could be a game about farming or about a long drawn out war across continents or about being the most successful trader in a post apocalyptic world technically rimworld has the goal of making a spaceship and taking your colonists off world to safety but you do not have to do this rimworld lets you decide how you want to play the game all while providing you with constant little hiccups or outright nuclear winters along your journey will your colonists thrive or die will you accept new colonists from prison or sell the kidneys of those who cross you rimworld lets you decide your own story even if everyone generally picks the psychopathic narrator of said story i ll admit it i have made armor out of human leather more than my fair share of times in this game but that is really the meat and bones of rimworld as a title player freedom and choice with minimal interference what other game would allow you to grapple with the metaphysical question of whether or not it is okay to feed someone their husband after they died playing horseshoes in a cold snap the graphics are dogwater the music is repetitive and the performance can get pretty crappy if you put in too many mods or have too much stuff going on in your colony that said if you are reading this if you made it to rimworld s page you should probably pick it up and play it easily one of the best games i have ever played outright
