2019 i bought this game expecting a micromanagement sim with a light focus on interpersonal relationships between the different colonists boy was i wrong this is a game where your colonists are the focus and everything else is designed to either keep them alive or lying dead right in front of your base giving your other colonists mood debuffs because you forgot to designate a burial zone now one of your colonists is suffering a mental breakdown from the stress of his unimpressive barracks combined with that aforementioned rotting corpse one of his traits is pyromaniac so he lights the entire room on fire and leaves feeling relieved the fire heats up the adjacent barracks and another colonist suffers a mental breakdown from sleeping in a room without an ac she throws a tantrum and her fist into every object in her room punching a hole straight through her wall the colonist next door suffers a mental breakdown from being disturbed in his sleep so he struts right out of his room with a shotgun and starts blasting anyone unlucky enough to cross paths with him this cycle will continue until you have one very mentally scarred and untreatable colonist left they will try to keep the colony running but to no avail as winter has hit and randy rando rolled a d20 and destroyed your unimpressive wooden base with a flash storm you ll keep coming back though you always will welcome to rimworld edit 80 more hours in barely a drop in the pond to veteran players but my points still stand and the review s aged well fantastic game 11 10 obligatory would bang
