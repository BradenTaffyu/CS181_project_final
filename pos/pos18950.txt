2015 the real fallout 3 to a lot of members in the community fallout new vegas picks up where fallout 1 and 2 left off by continuing to expand upon developments on the western coast of the united states in a post apocalyptic world the new california republic is back as is the brotherhood and enclave or what remains of it veterans of the franchise will notice a few subtle nods to previous games in the franchise such as poseidon energy and a few characters coming from locales in fallout 1 and 2 unlike fallout 3 new vegas maintains consistency in its lore with previous titles in the franchise the brotherhood is a reclusive organization rather than an army of do gooders the enclave isn t the powerful organization it once was and super mutants aren t all over the place for no reason it s no surprise that the creators of fallout nv are also the minds behind fallout 1 and 2 before the studio closed and bethesda bought out the franchise the post apocalyptic world is still fresh in their minds and care was applied when creating the world and lore so that it meshes with previous entries new to this entry is the faction system whereas fallout 3 automatically made the brotherhood the good guys and you only had one choice in the ending tamper with the purifier or not new vegas lets you side with one of four factions affecting the new vegas power struggle and the ending whomever you decide to side with they carry their own mainline quests to win control of the hoover dam the faction system also carries it s own subset of reputation a faction may despise you attacking you on sight or idolize you reputation is gained or lost by finishing quests for a faction and or siding with them when presented with the option when doing the mainline quests for a faction you ll slowly lose karma with the others until you re attacked by them on sight whilst siding with a faction for an ending is excellent don t place too much thought on juggling reputations whilst exploring and doing sidequests whilst exploring the mojave its in your best interest to side with the ncr when presented with the option they have camps all over the map they account for at least 25 of all sidequests estimate and a potential companion and his quest requires ncr fame the only factions you ll have to juggle rep with outside of the main quest arcs are the legion and ncr all other factions have peaceful resolutions if presented with an issue between the two of them most of the time it ll be a question of whether or not to fu k over the legion since the quest will come from an ncr official the legion has one camp in the game the other reached through the storyline and no sidequests so always side against them don t worry there s a point in the main storyline where negative rep is reset with either the legion or ncr or both allowing you to do all sidequests and then side with the legion in the main story so it s a coin toss either you appreciate the ability to do all sidequests in a single playthrough without having to worry too much about factions and reputation which i believe or you believe the system failed since it s effect outside of the main story quest arcs is non existant perhaps the brotherhood and followers should ve fought more perhaps concurrent sidequests between two factions should ve been introduced forcing you to balance reputations or maybe you aren t a fan of having to play through a game multiple times especially when you invested a ton of hours into one playthrough what is clear is that the legion despite being an important faction in the game has very little representation in the game this is due to time constraints with only 18 months in development obsidian had to leave everything east of the colorado river an unexplorable area originally being legion territory there s also an entire western portion of the map blocked off by mountains and the north eastern end of the map as well the game also has a significantly lower amount of interiors buildings you can go into as compared to fallout 3 and the mojave wasteland is littered with meaningless locations abandoned shacks empty areas with no interiors you don t have to look too far to see time constraints everywhere all to the game s detriment i would ve preferred more interiors with pc terminals and notes delving into inhabitants lives or situations around the mojave fallout 3 did exploration better more interiors and towns but fallout nv does everything else better lore story writing fallout nv is more of a fallout title than fallout 3 was and if you re a fan of the franchise you ll love the care obsidian put in handling its congruity with the other titles if you really can t be bothered and are only interested in exploring then fallout 3 might be higher on your list whatever the case nv s short development cycle and the quality of the end product is a testament to how skilled and dedicated obsidian is to the franchise thumbs up loved it more than fo3
