i was expecting a 40 60 hour adventure like the first original sin 120 hours later the credits roll and what a ride it s been while a good deal more difficult and obtuse than baldur s gate 3 it s a steep improvement over divinity original sin the voice acting narration included was fantastic from start to finish and the story while largely your predictable high fantasy fare threw a couple of twists in that i didn t see coming the characters are all very well written and interesting especially once you start diving into their individual side quests i loved the character development in each party member especially the red prince s and fane s and while i typically don t revisit games once i ve beaten them i m very much looking forward to taking another run through this excellent rpg down the road edit it s worth noting that i played through the majority of this game on my steam deck and it runs almost flawlessly out of the box
