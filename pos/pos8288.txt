2022 product received for free to be honest i didn t accept much from this game i thought it was a cash grab but positives not pay to win you can open packs like any other card game and if you are not that lucky you can dismantle a card that have more than 3 copies or an unwanted card and craft the card you want i think its 3 card to make one from the same rarity or you can craft the card that open the secret shop for the archetype you want interface clean and simple interface i feel like its perfect for the kind of game they want to be shop the card opening is satisfying and good looking visually and duel field is very will done you can mix parts between different ones mate is a nice addition soundtrack very good soundtrack but i feel like if they add music kits in the shop it will benefit the game because i feel like after some time you will grow tired from the same battle sound every time you enter you duel they should add music kits that change the game music solo it will help you learn the game and if they add every deck type in the future it will be useful for players to figure out the deck they want to play and the story lines are very cool i used to watch videos about cards stories negatives iraq is not available in the region options konami pls fix it s not that big but they are so close to make it a perfect game every time i open the game i have to change it to full screen the field need more details and stuff to interact with duel pass it need more visual staff and just make the right click open the phases conclusion its a very will done game from all parts it need some more details and improvement and it will be a perfect game and its the best yu gi oh game in my opinion from the games available on steam i think this game will have a long life for me it s a 9 10 but unfortunately there is no iraq in the regions so it get a penalty of 12 final score 3 10 not the game we expected for me at least but the game that we deserve and here is a review that i made of duel links it s my first review on steam and this is the last one for now so i felt like adding it thank you for reading click link c tenor com
