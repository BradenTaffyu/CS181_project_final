2019 this reboot of the relative new company two point studios some of the guys worked on the original theme hospital is everything and more of the old title great graphics funny animations relaxing music get s a bit repetitive in the higher levels after unlocking all illnesses rooms and items quite easy forgiving no difficulty settings wish there were more items added with dlc s so the hospitals would look different interiors and not just different themes around the outside of the hospitals two level and more would be even better but quite different difficult to manage i suppose overall a relaxing funny charming reboot of a classic done the right way recommended for every theme hospital player and newcomers that like simulation games 8 5 out of 10
