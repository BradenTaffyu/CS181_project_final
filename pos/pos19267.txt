2021 the game is certainly unfinished it s missing a lot of fundamental aspects any rts age of empire player is going to notice miss and wish it was in aoe4 i am actually pretty disapointed that the game seems way to basic and not competitive at all hopefully the devs will add in those little things that aoe rts players prefer watch any number of youtube reviews for examples however the campaign is absolutely one of a kind i am a major rts total war historical type pc player and i don t think i have ever played a cooler more well put together campaign before every map you get a history lesson filled with beautiful graphics and awesome real life footage mixed in with age of empires sounds and aesthetics 10 10 campaign and i can t wait to play through it again utterly awesome i felt like i was watching a mini documentary and then given the keys to go act it out with the age of empires game model so fun and so cool
