2022 i ve played this game probably for close to a decade but just started a new account a few years ago i probably have 300 hours off steam too before it came to the site i feel like this game has something for every type of star wars fan but the story is really where it s at i love being able to make choices that actually effect the game deciding who lives or dies or what path to take light or dark and having my actions shine through in my build with the new update makes it even more immersive i like end game content too like pvp so having your completely unique character build and different stuff you ve picked up along the way is really satisfying each story brings a really unique feel to the universe whether you re a jedi knight fighting for freedom a bounty hunter just trying to get paid or a sith inquisitor learning about the dark past there s so much to do in the game including events it s really hard to pull yourself out of sometimes i ve spent countless hours even just looking at the cartel market or the galactic trade network customizing my look or my mounts to fit my character sometimes the graphics might feel old school but this is truly the best star wars game of our time just through the gameplay and intrigue of the storylines if you buy anything though buy it through the official site so there are no delays but the main game is free and if you subscribe even 1 time you get to keep all the dlcs and expansion content forever
