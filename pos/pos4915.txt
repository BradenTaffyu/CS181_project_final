2016 it s a fun game but it wasn t what i was expecting in the previous fallout games i loved that you could solve problems without violence a no kill humans run the branching story paths the unpredictability and the humor none of which are found in this one the new weapon and armor mods system is very nice but why won t the weapons break or jam anymore especially those that are made from plumbing supplies and driftwood i love the power armor idea it kind of makes sense and it is very well executed compared to other bethesda games the world here is small but it allows them to focus more on the details and i liked the environment and wildlife the addition of a base building element is fine but i didn t bother with it because i m not a fan of that i want to go and explore the world and have adventures i don t want to be fixed at one location for hours figuring out how my furniture will be positioned the revenge rescue story is okay it kept me going all in all yeah it s more of a fps game with a big emphasis on action it s a bit sad really since fallout was the first game through which i was introduced to the magic of rpg however i do find this game enjoyable and the combat is very addictive highlights of my first fallout 4 playthrough a screenshot of fallout 4 by burn 300 years of us military history in the fallout universe community created artwork for fallout 4 by burn unlocked all achievements
