2019 early access review i almost always play the same character in this game their name is lion they re huge covered in fur with horns and sharp claws lion has lived and died dozens of times sometimes they only make it a few minutes out of the starting village before they re torn apart by a living rock or choked out by a sentient plant or overrun by an army of goat people other times lion will get lucky they ll stumble across a rare folded carbide blade early on maybe even find a hoversled to help them indulge in their hoarder s tendencies so equipped they ll pick a direction without much consideration and begin their long trek in earnest maybe they ll head north across the salt desert to the towering cathedral corpse they ll wander the market stalls that surround it chat with the other pilgrims and befriend the librarian maybe they ll turn to the east to explore the deep jungles they might end up embroiled in the internal politics of a village of deer folk or stumbling through the shining ruins of lost civilizations scavenging baffling techno baubles and dodging hails of automated gunfire perhaps they ll just head down deeper and deeper into the caves searching for treasures until they ve lost all sense of direction eventually they might re emerge their sled laden with bulging waterskins ancient weaponry and mysterious piles of metal tubes either way they ll probably die in the end because a fish cut off their face and all their limbs
