2022 age of empires is a series that i have loved right from the beginning it s very likely i ve spent close to 2 000 hours playing these games mostly in aoe 2 i d perhaps rank the first three games as follows aoe 2 aoe 1 aoe 3 after spending 300 hours in age of empires 4 i think it s the best by a mile it makes sense to compare aoe 4 to aoe 2 as they both deal with the same era technologically and are the two best some of my highlights below the rock paper scissors system is very much in place and for the most part is well balanced it also includes a light and heavy system which further expands upon the system each of the 8 civilisations are far more distinctive in how they play than in aoe2 the campaigns are very well crafted and easily on par with aoe 2 siege units are actually fun to use and very much feel like glass cannons with major vulnerabilities the landmark system is a great way to further differentiate the civilisations and despite some duds most landmarks are viable in summary people frequently say that aoe 2 and 4 are essentially the same game as if that s a problem yes they are but age 4 has more than 20 years over it in terms of game design and it really shows it s the little things a lot of little things that make this game the best of the bunch
