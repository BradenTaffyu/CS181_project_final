2021 review of plants vs zombies game of the yearpopcap were once the kings of well crafted and addicting games that didn t demand much from you and yet you stuck to them like glue pvz plants vs zombies is in my opinion one of the biggest examples of mastercraft work from the studio said game has been with me since the day my young self found a demo online for it from that day on it s a game that i return to every now and then and it even became popular with my mother at the time plants vs zombies is a colorful lane based strategy game within the tower defense genre this was the first lane td i ever played but it was easy for me to fall in love as one of my top genre is tower defense the game is incredibly easy to slip into especially for first timers that s not to say the game is easy certain challenges late game levels will test your seed packet skills quite a bit however there s plenty of additional side content here to provide something for everyone i must stress that for these reviews i prefer to do a full clean slate playthrough just prior to writing however for pvz i only did a partial run through with the game so if information is off assume i ll have it fixed up at a later date general gameplay adventure mode when starting a new profile you re only going to have access to the adventure mode this story mode of sorts consists of 5 separate zones with 10 levels each for a total of 50 overall adventure mode levels to play you ll be tasked with fending off waves of increasingly difficult zombies with nothing more than your garden of plants quite the unique idea each stage consists of 5 horizontal rows lanes 6 for pool stages and 9 vertical columns lanes this sets up a board or yard in this case of tiles for which you can freely place your plants upon you do this by collecting sun power adventure mode will take you from the front yard to the back yard pool both of which come in day night variations and lastly the roof after each level you ll be awarded with a new plant seed packet a new tool or even a written message from the zombies every fifth level is a minigame challenge crazy dave will introduce himself and shortly after you ll start collecting coins while playing these can be spent at dave s shop for new plants more seed slots and lots of other goodies you ll also occasionally obtain gifts which contain plants for your zen garden and minigames your goal is to keep the zombies from eating your brains and ultimately defeating dr zomboss yes a full fledged tower defense boss battle once you ve completed adventure mode the rest of the game s content opens up to you additionally you ll unlock new game which allows you to play through all 50 levels again however with larger amounts of zombies for greater challenge and as icing on top crazy dave will force choose 3 plants at random per level that you must make do with the gameplay is very smooth easy to understand yet complex enough to allow critical thinking dynamics of the gameplay will change based on time of day and type of plant for example some plants such as mushrooms will sleep if placed during the day however if you have the appropriate means it is possible to wake them up at night sun power will not drop from the sky so it s a slower start to place expensive plants this is why most shroom plants are cheaper but also weaker places like the roof are slopped so you are intended to use catapult type plants to launch attacks over the slope not to mention the wide variety of zombies have various weaknesses that certain plants will excel at taking care of to name a few mini gamesquite possibly my favorite part of the game there s so many different minigames to play and complete they re great ways to just sit back and enjoy something a little different or collect money for the dave s shop each one is very unique and different from the last however keep in mind that some of them are incredibly challenging zombotany may take you by surprise for example while i enjoy almost all of them the classic whack a zombie is probably the one i play the most you ll also find plenty of references to other popcap games within this collection of minigames puzzle modeconsisting of vase breaker i zombie i zombie is my favorite single side mode in the game it flips the role and sees you playing as the zombies there s a lot of really fun puzzles to solve within this unfortunately though vase breaker is my least favorite mode in the entire game purely because it s essentially based completely around rng so in my opinion it s hardly a puzzle upon completing all stages in the respective puzzle you ll unlock an endless mode for continuous play survival modeas it says on the tin this mode contains a collection of levels where the only goal is to survive it s intended to be harder than your standard adventure mode level much like with puzzle mode you ll unlock endless versions of each stage as you complete them for continuous play zen gardenlast but not least the zen garden is a passive area that you can leave and come back to later on you collect and grow your own plants here move them around and get paid to do so it s a calming and fun little mode but there s very little to do in it when starting out and it s not intended to be played with regularly you can only do so much at one time before needing to wait around for someone to get thirsty once you get full gardens going though it can be a fun treat to try and collect all of the plants additional notesthere s a wonderful soundtrack to back the gameplay a catchy performance by supershigi in zombies on your lawn classic cheat codes to mess around with a side mode that allows you to customize the flag zombie lots of cute zombie plant puns jokes plenty of easter eggs mainly to other popcap games as well as the tree of wisdom conclusion pros cons a fantastic game for any or those interested in tower defense fan it s fit both as a game for veterans of the genre and newcomers who wish for a sweet smooth introduction i see myself playing plants vs zombies for many years to come this is a great example of what i d consider a near perfect game pros loads of pvz content catchy ost a colorful and cute artstyle steam achievementsneutral removal of michael jackson zombie no official way to re implement outside of modding cons n adisclaimerthank you for taking the time to read my review please remember that this is just my opinion we don t have to agree one thing i love you may hate and one thing i hate you may love hopefully this gave you an idea of what to expect review
