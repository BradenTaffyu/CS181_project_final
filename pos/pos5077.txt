2019 this was the first fallout game i played and i can now confidently say that after having played the other ones the one i ve played the least is actually new vegas what do you know this hardly even counts it s such a radically different experience that i feel a lot of sympathy for people who felt cheated i went through something very similar myself with my favorite game franchise and the sad part is that much like people have pointed out the game itself would be much better if it didn t have the name attached to it i love the companions i love that codsworth can say my very common name i love the gunplay i love the general art style and the detail of the world i love some locations in the map certain quests the crafting and settlement system i love that you get certain comments depending on what you do and i love this game to pieces but the thing is almost none of these reasons are very much like fallout and if you can manage to get past that initial shock and distaste you might find there s quite a lot to like maybe i m not your mother maybe it would have been better if you had played it before every other fallout game to just appreciate it for what it is which is not a compliment due to its other glaring issues the perk system dialogue lack of focus in role playing etcetera but nobody can stop me from enjoying this game so fight me also nick valentine that s a plus he s every lady who played this game s universal crush oh and the silver shroud quest minus points for shaun however i won t defend that especially because the blend of linear and interactive story wound up terribly near the end it s like people just forgot shaun existed
