2022 10000000000 10 get it bought and play it it took me so long to play this game so many people recommended it and i kept putting it off and off mostly because of graphics among other things i played all harvest moon sos games and those type of games in recent years were getting really stale with the same tired formula but eventually i got stardew valley on switch so i could play it on the go like a ds and my god i wish i d of picked it up back then i ve sunk hours and hours into this game but one of the best pluses is that i connected with my friends family playing it co op i love the gameplay it s suited to any playstyle you wanna just play a dating sim it s that farm sim go raise some livestock or grow crops and trees just like designing stuff you ve got numerous farm layouts to choose from and go ham maybe you like combat or just plodding about adventuring there s always something new in this game and was addicted well and truly and i am in the minority that absolutely love the fishing game then i bought it on steam and was introduced the modded community and fell in love with the game again it opens up the game completely and there are so many mods that turn the game into something completely new or if you re like me and loved the core game just adding stuff into it that s just for aesthetics or adds new places people similar to how you would add dlc to a game my favourites and 100 must haves are stardew valley expanded ridgeside village hell there s even magic now so you can be your own wizard what i will say is that smapi the modding device is pretty complicated to put in but the mods themselves are really simple once you get past initial setup i do appreciate that i played it vanilla first and i would recommend anyone do that first because like a good book movie you can t experience twice this you actually can and it s worth it
