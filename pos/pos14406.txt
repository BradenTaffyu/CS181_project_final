2021 early access review wonderful game if you like factorio or satisfactory dyson sphere program is almost a hybrid of the two it s 3d like satisfactory but third person like factorio the defining element is that you play the game on multiple spherical planets unlike factorio and satisfactory there are no enemies at least none that i ve encountered yet that isn t to say this game is casual there s always some task to accomplish but it s nice to do it at one s own pace much like factorio in peaceful mode traveling to new planets and learning how to harvest and distribute necessary elements from them is a gratifying experience i haven t even left my starting solar system yet but i m looking forward to that i traveled to a planet that had no atmosphere and discovered that my wind powered generators wouldn t spin i ended up building solar panels on that planet instead watching the sun appear over the horizon to power my new factory was another wonderful experience this game runs well even on my nearly obsolete pc i think the opening tutorials could be better but i managed to pick up the basics relatively quickly i experienced one glitch where my character was partially under the terrain but it fixed itself within a minute or so of walking around i have never needed to reload a save because of a bug or glitch if you have put any decent amount of hours into factorio or satisfactory buy this game don t wait for a sale don t worry if the price rises to 60 you will get your money s worth from dyson sphere program
