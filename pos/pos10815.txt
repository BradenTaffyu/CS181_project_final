2022 polen frankreich russland das sind so nationen die kann ich dir komplett zerlegen und wieder zusammenbauen wenn ich will rumms bumms in mei m tiger pardon that german i just had to d what can be said about a series that got dislikd by casual gamers loved by hardcore strategiest it s funny looking back at magazines disliking the games as being ugly confusing too strategic and going beyond the small iq of your average magazine editor those were the old games i started with the second game and looking back to that and comparing it to the behemoth that is hearts of iron 4 it s hilarious hoi4 is confusing it is a convoluted mess and it is not for casual gamers who think the pinnacle of strategy was command conquer or warcraft or anything newer is there even a new rts that isn t some casual clicky click well for anybody still interested in it you start either a few years before world war 2 or immediately before it you pick a nation and you can set up some option beforehand most disable achievemnts for those who care that can have drastic impacts on the game world then you re pretty much left a lone there is a rundimentary tutorial but it s as worthless as 3d glasses are to stevie wonder you have to fight your way through all the submenus all the politics all the war mongering all the addiotonal politics the skill trees the engineering trees the tactical trees and when you made it through that jungle you probably can t even set up a proper front line but once you figured out all of that either by watching a lot of youtube videos or by trying and failing you will see one of the best grand war strategy games ever the depth is amazing you can control literally every single thing from what states in your country produce to your relationships with other nations doing alliances or even chaning history completely even if you start with nazi germany you have a chance to turn it around make it a democracy and hopefully allign yourself with the west before the russians think you re easy prey then again you can even change how the ai controlled countries act fascist russia part of the allies this is as possible as changing the cheese eating surrender monkeys into communism or making the americans allign with china versus japan further replaybility is created due to the workshop and mods in general there are mods that turn the game completely around chainging the scenario like fallout or the setting kaisserreich doing alternate history what if germany won and several other mods that add more music important nothing better than some more contemporary war marches jazz blues and marlene dietrich or other things as always for paradox you will get a ton of dlc and a ton of rip off dlc the high priced ones are the important ones that add gameplay elements like designing tanks ships submarines and more political trees for nations and there are the flat out who is dumb enough to fall for that dlcs like the speech packs the skin packs stuff that can also be aquired from the workshop i mean who would pay 5 bucks just to get churchill s we will never surrender speech when you can just play maiden s aces high from live after death that starts with it it s way better in that combo and i have to say i really hate how greedy paradox became overall and sound is important since there aren t much graphics outside of the world map with some units and a newspaper outside of that though it s still one the best true grand strategy games and once you figured it out it s a blast
