i am kind of mixed at the moment on one side i am having blast with this trpg developing my characters in every possible way however on the other side although the game wants to tell us a story in a dystopian cyberpunky world which is right up my alley after several chapters trying so hard to have my focus on the story and every character it just lost me i think it safe to say that if you are not coming here for the story as an rpg fan there is a lot to enjoy here definitely following this developer closely
