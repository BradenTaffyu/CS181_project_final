2023 this might only be the 2nd steam review i have ever done and i ve been a member since 2005 but a game like this it would be a crime not to do one while it has its nuisances such as an invisible barrier on a small patch of grass that should easily be passable or the inability to view jobs in the cargo market for all trailers that you have available instead of having to swap one by one to check it has way more positives than negatives firstly if you enjoy driving in general you will love this game as even if you don t purchase any of the other dlc you have plenty of drive time with what they give you in the base game between california nevada and arizona secondly you feel like you are rewarded for putting in an hour or so of real time because you actually are the money you earn feels nice because it s how you expand your business by buying other garages upgrading them hiring people buying them trucks and letting them do jobs third is the realism you have rest stops and gas stations aplenty as well as service stations for maintenance you ll have to stop for gas and to rest as well as possible maintenance in real life and they did a very good job including features like that instead of just ignoring those and letting us drive around without incident fourth would be the scenery and i love the addition of those photo spots i cannot say how accurate each map is and i know they can t include everything but i would assume they did a hefty amount of research and it s basically like visiting there yourself with more dlc to come as they continue moving eastward across the u s this game should be around for a very long time and i very much look forward to the future dlc they drop although they should bundle smaller states together or make them cheaper ex oklahoma and kansas because oklahoma is really small for 11 99 currently bottom line is if you enjoy driving go pick up this game
