2016 so first i should note that i am a long time paradox game player i m used to the foibles and nuances of their games as well as their development process i found the game very fun as is there are some weaknesses but nothing that prevents me from enjoying the game it s not perfect but it has enough depth novelty as well as modding support to sink countless hours into the game however i also know that paradox is in it for the long haul they will continue to flesh out and develop their games for years i endorse their games knowing that they will only get better with time and they aren t afraid to overhaul major game mechanics if they aren t quite right almost all for free it s a unique style of development more like an mmo if you just want a perfect experience right now play the game and just forget about it then this may not be the game for you yet you can wait and get a more evolved version of the game later as for me i will enjoy the richness of the current experience and watch as the community and developer together explore and evolve a fantastic and unique game
