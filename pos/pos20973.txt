product received for free dave the diver is utterly delightful i received a copy of the game for christmas as a joke as i share my name with the titular character my 7 year old son immediately fell in love with the game when we tried it together and it s become a family activity that even my wife who doesn t game has joined us in playing we re close to completing all the achievements but from the animations the music the boss battles the characters the humour the mini games etc you can just tell this game was a labour of love can t wait to see the next title coming out from this studio
