2021 been playing civ since iv and this might be the best one they simplified things that were overly complicated and added significant depth to many of the games systems every one of the games core mechanics has been updated to a more sensible and complex style adjacency bonuses for different districts based on terrain other districts wonders and unique buildings really rewards the player for planning ahead and understanding how their civ works in my eyes they ve made the game notably easier to learn with a much higher skill cap than previous titles overall very good and each main dlc adds much to the game
