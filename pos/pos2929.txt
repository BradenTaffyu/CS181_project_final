2016 ok so beat act 1 and larian out did themselves everything from the atmosphere to the character building has been improved using the same formula as before and making every aspect better the combat is the same style but with many subtle at first differences that expand into a lot more combat flexibility update release the game has finally released and i really have to say larian has out done themselves playing through the game on tactician and seeing how the ai does its best to break the combat system like a real player would ending their turn with their back to a wall so your rogue is inefective reversing your moves by throwing water on the enemy you just shocked and stunning your entire party it s an incredible system that larian has created so much flexibility every move of every fight becomes a question of did that just happen can i really do this which is something no other game can capture gone are the supercharged ridiculous characters of the first game replaced with smarter and more adept enemies that force you to make better decisions the flexibility in character creation and the much more intuitive world makes me excited every chance i get to jump on and uncover just a bit more of the world the inclusion of a darker story and races adds a much needed party diversity and the lore being less silly pulls you in far more to the atmosphere which is beautiful from the musical score to the graphics creating a much more enjoyable transition from combat to exploring and giving you more to want to explore the beautiful score and excellent voice acting talent so far has been an incredible treat in an age when games have been spending less and less time and devotion to world building and character development the party while smaller than some crpgs is fully fleshed out with interesting characters who i actually want to talk to and interact with so far i am incredibly excited with the release and looking forwarding to simply getting through act 1 on tactician and exploring the unknown well done larian you have brought art back into the gaming industry
