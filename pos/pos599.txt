2016 pc s alternative to harvest moon perfect time waster with relaxing atmosphere and lots of content as of writing this review i have 100h on record and still haven t seen everything the game has to offer and i m still enjoying what i have seen so far there s also supposed to be multiplayer mode released in a patch later so keep your eye out on that absolutely worth its price can t think of any flaw besides controls which are only kinda wonky if you play with kb m and abysmal with controllers you d get the same experience with using joy2key but controller support might change considering the recent console release
