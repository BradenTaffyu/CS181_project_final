2015 the best motorsport simulation that exists period bear in mind i m not talking about a game i m talking about motorsport if you are expecting an experience similar to forza or other games in that sense you ll be bewildered at what iracing is offering iracing isn t as much a game as it is a motorsport simulation from licensing to competing in various series iracing is more about long term development as a driver than it is about jumping in and just winning races like you d do in forza you won t win your first race you porbably won t win a race in your first 30 starts you re going to have to work at it and thats what makes iracing special there s a couple major things you should know 1 you ll start in a rookie series with other drives learning to drive it can be chaotic but focus less on simply getting out of the rookie series and more on improving your driving craft over time you will develop and once you move out of rookies you will feel much more confident in the higher license levels the driving is more predictable in the higher brackets as well 2 if you intend on playing the game with a keyboard or a gamepad for that matter you are not going to have a good experience at all you need to use a wheel pedal set you simply won t be able to properly compete or enjoy the game for that matter without a proper setup whats the point of immersing yourself in a motorsport simulation without taking that first big step and using a wheel trust me you ll enjoy it so much more 3 you will be slow practice and you ll get better i promise as a rookie you ll only have to master one or two cars and only a handfull of tracks master them once you do this qualify if you are finding that there are tons of wrecks all around you and you re getting caught in them qualifying with a lot of practice will often put you near the front of the pack and the wrecks will safely happen in your rear view mirror 4 use the forums honestly there are a ton of super helpful people who are willing to help you especially when you start to learn about setups and making tweaks to your car the forums are a huge asset 5 don t get frustrated practice the results will come if you have any questions about iracing don t hesitate to ask by commenting on this review i will respond and do my best to help you out
