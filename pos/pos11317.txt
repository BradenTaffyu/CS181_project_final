2015 early access review edited for a14 7easily the best zombie survival game on steam and probably the most promising alpha i ve ever seen i often watch youtube videos before purchasing a game and this review has been written with past experience of all the games i ve mentioned with dayz rust and h1z1 being played on friends accounts it s a blast with friends but the main reason i recommend this game is because it has some things which are almost unheard of in the zombie survival genre 1 zombies no not the glitchy ethereal zombies in dayz or the ones they just simply couldn t be bothered with in rust because zombies in 7 days obey the laws of physics and are everywhere and the regular hordes completely unheard of in almost every other survival game as well as variation in zombies keeps combat fresh we already have vomiting police officer zombies feral boss zombies take horrendous punishment undead dogs which are extremely dangerous if not properly handled bears and undead versions and mutant hornets the zombies in 7 days are threats and for a long while at least not a manageable one by default they run at night gaining speed and finesse turning an already formidable foe into a nightmare i won t say much more but it is called 7 days to die for a reason 2 it s actually a challenge to survive this isn t like in h1z1 where you can live forever off of blueberries until a bear mauls you to death or in rust where starvation feels practically nonexistant the scavenging itself is rewarding but food is low in quantity and far spread however once you survive long enough to have a fortress going you have time and opportuinty to hunt or farm where the goals in the game radically shift from getting by on cans to actively improving your wellness which takes me to the next point 3 unique mechanics be it the wellness system eating good food and staying healthy increases physical fitness weapon quality the fact that you can get infected and become desperate for a cure building a base or even simply that zombies run at night 7 days has many things that similar games in the genre have merely scraped the surface of if they ve even bothered at all it s a true game hidden amongst several cash grabs something i will note though the devs are currently experimenting with temperature based survival and hordes and both are fairly broken atm still they re making progress have no intention of giving up and listen to the community besides that s what early access is for right 4 singleplayer this one is probably coming off as a surprise to you right as i read it but i think it s worth a mention singleplayer is a feature that most similar games lack and that s a really crucial feature for those who want a decent survival game without the constant pvp like in dayz or h1z1 it s obviously not initially intended for single player considering that there s still chat but it still works and works wonders 5 base building this isn t like in unturned or h1z1 where it is seemingly bolted on as an afterthought base building in 7 days is important not essential you can still get by by moving from place to place for survival in the new world there are many items easily lootable that serve no practical purpose but are instead simply decorations to further the impression that base building is a core feature of this game 6 the devs and community the fun pimps listen to the community and the community itself is very helpful and supportive the incredibly steep learning curve is quickly offset by the community who tirelessly answer all questions the noobs may have plus there are npc bandits and traders in the works and that s awesome 7 anyone can mod it the fun pimps have deliberately designed the xml files for the game to be easily moddable i d check out valmod once you consider yourself truly hardcore it makes the game way harder alternatively you could do what i did and mod more recipes and guns into a private game with friends to get a more walking dead style vibe if you get confused again the forum section on modding is amazing at helping you with whatever problems you might have the game itself has regularly been referred to as a mashup of minecraft and dayz but i disagree from the perspective of a buyer this may look the case but it isn t it s a completely different animal far greater than the sum of its parts i will not lie to you there are more than a few balance issues bugs galore after every major patch and big patches take a while but i believe that it s all worth it in the end because there s no other survival game to my knowledge that doesn t act like that goat sim parody dlc while also having hardworking devs who are willing to put more than ten minutes into the game if you re still skeptical get it on sale i mean it 2 hours is nowhere near enough time to judge this game properly there is just so much here that you won t find within two hours recommended as a 7 5 10 the learning curve is steep and there are balance issues and the devs are hardly experts at meeting their deadlines but that s what alpha was meant to be about if you re the type of gamer who wants survival building a true zombies game or an amalgamation of the three then this is the game for you and you won t regret buying it ps if dogs end up killing you a lot ask politely on the forums for help us forum folk are tired of seeing f ing nerf the dogs op as you guys are morons threads when they try to punch them or something else stupid there are tactics to beat them and a lot of them the forum guys who are better at surviving than me could probably point you in the right direction
