2022 the premise of stellaris is pretty simple you are a spacefaring civilization that recently discovered ftl travel you are now going to explore the galaxy you ll claim foreign stars as your sovereign territory colonize alien worlds and also run into other spacefaring civilizations you can do the rational thing and simply purge the filthy xeno or you may plug your nose and attempt to negotiate with them the choice is yours bear in mind that negotiating with the xeno was not very in depth or profitable until the past few years otoh genocide and slavery have been very well supported since release so that should inform you a bit about how much of a genocide simulator stellaris is at its core when you design your empire you set a few things first you create your species this can be humanoids mammalians reptilians avians arthropods fungi plants and a few other things i recommend the moth gecko or fly agaric portraits then you give them a few traits these can be upsides or downsides and downsides allow you to take more upsides mechanically i consider the traits rather uninteresting aside from a few dlc locked traits you don t really think about them too much next you must determine your government and ethics you have 3 points to allocate for this and there are 4 axes that you can place your points along these are militarist pacifistxenophobe xenophileauthoritarian egalitarianspiritualist materialistthese determine a lot of how you play and much of the actual decisions you make are locked behind your ethics for example pacifists are often locked out of declaring certain types of wars e g wars of conquest egalitarians are not allowed to keep slaves unless they are xenophobes as well in which case they can enslave xenos spiritualists are not fond of robots xenophiles and pacifists both dislike genocide you get the idea you can take any 3 so long as you don t take two opposing ethics e g xenophobe and xenophile you can also spend 2 points to take the fanatic version of an ethic as a result you either have 3 ethics or you have a fanatic ethic and one more ethic you then select your empire s government aside from egalitarians not liking dictatorships or empires and authoritarians not liking democracies or oligarchies you can choose whatever you want there are also hive mind and megacorporation empires which are both locked behind dlcs megacorporations are sorta like oligarchies but they have more ways to interact with other empires for profit hive minds get around a few core mechanics e g consumer goods happiness political representation but also have a bunch of restrictions this choice determines how your leader is chosen and also has some ramifications for your civics next you select two civics these often have pretty significant gameplay ramifications and are often locked behind specific ethics for example the slaver guilds civic requires an authoritarian empire and also forces that 35 of your empire be slaves at all times if your default slavery type is chattel instead of indenture then this can cause some specialist labor shortages there s also the fanatic purifiers civic which locks your empire out of all diplomacy but also lets you wage total war against every other empire which does not have the same primary species as you suffer not the xeno to live you then select your empire origin which can also affect the way you play some of these are fun quests and others let you have weird planetary starts a lot of these are dlc locked but they re a fun bit of variety finally you choose how your ships look and your flag and name your leader lots of customization there the gameplay itself like other paradox games is real time spreadsheet gaming map painting you balance your spreadsheet of resources and then use that to build a military which you use to paint the map with your empire s flag there s a lot of complexity and nuance here which i won t really go over but if you don t like balancing spreadsheets or playing other paradox games then you probably won t like stellaris you can also play the galactic un or form federations with despicable xenos if that is your thing the un is funny because it lets you pass a bunch of resolutions which basically just exist to make everybody s life worse the game s difficulty curve is pretty reasonable and it feels like there s always new ways to challenge yourself however the sheer amount of mechanics in this game may be overwhelming to new players it is recommended that you not be too attached to your first few runs as you may run into serious jank it is easy to mismanage your economy into exploding or to get into a war which you botch horribly since you don t know how the casus belli or shipbuilding systems work luckily they have so many automation tools for this stuff nowadays that you can approach them at your leisure i think at this point you can literally just create an empire start a game and then have the ai do literally everything except direct your fleet claim systems colonize worlds build megastructures and initiate diplomacy in other words you can choose to learn this game at a very leisurely pace and it will always sorta work they also rework the game significantly every year or two release stellaris is nothing like modern stellaris you may find that you boot it up one day and then they have reworked the economy system so significantly that you have no clue how it works anymore also they don t really seem to know what they re doing with ship combat but it s a known issue at least the soundtrack and visuals are pretty nice the game also has tons of flavorful events called anomalies and situations which you find while exploring the galaxy they actually have a lot of cool stories in them plus the story is rather noninvasive and you can just click the confirm button to see what rewards you get it s fun to read them sometimes or just ignore them well designed by paradox they also have a lot of roleplay progression such as being able to have a psionic awakening or uploading your entire species to robotic bodies instead i believe that those are dlc locked though you will genuinely be able to customize a lot about your empire and create a cool little story in each game though as a final point this game has a lot of dlc and they ask for a lot of money to buy it you can also expect to pay 20 to 40 in dlc tithes each year if you want all of their updated features i highly recommend utilizing key resellers or sales whenever possible especially for older dlc which you can often get like 80 off from resellers game is pretty good though would recommend
