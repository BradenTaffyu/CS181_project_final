2018 i cannot recommend this game enough it is an rpg that breaks the boundaries of what you perceive an rpg to be every problem or puzzle has what feels like more solutions than you can conceive of original sin 2 rewards clever thinking tactics and the role playing itself over all else stat building and creating the perfect character is always a fun aspect of crpgs but i d say it s not the main focus here don t get me wrong there are tons of numbers and plenty to min max but at the end of the day it doesn t matter how much damage you do if you re not in combat and the game truly shines when you can avoid it don t get me wrong the combat in this game is fantastic you can control all of your up to 4 party members individually outside of combat and prepare the upcoming battlefield to your liking assuming you have the drop on your opponents place your archers up top give your wizards ample space have clean terrain for your warriors e t c however when you find yourself able to circumvent combat you ll be rewarded with a level of satisfaction very rare in games these days it constantly feels like original sin 2 almost dares you to break the game s boundaries it challenges you to out think the developers everything matters in this game i ll leave you with an anecdote as i explored searching for a quest target i came upon a ruin i saw a passage through but in between it and myself were a few foes i was most certainly not equipped to handle at my current level in other games i d probably have left and came back later when i was a higher level but not here i navigated around the edges of the npcs detection radius in stealth with each of my characters individually until i found a minuscule spot i could teleport to that would get me past my foes it was certainly inconvenient but it worked i painstakingly teleported each of my characters in turn to that one spot only to realize the one doing the teleporting was stuck below the one casting the spell is unable to use it on themselves after some hard thought i realized i could place the teleportation artifact close enough for my previously transported characters to grab i then used it to pull my last hero past the baddies i exhaled a sigh of relief and then panned the camera to see i had just come face to face with the very character i had been trying to track down i was positively oozing with smugness
