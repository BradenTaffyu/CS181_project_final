2019 this game is fun but complicated you can be good at this game it is possible however that is really hard and i had more fun messing around in sandbox mode than trying to complete goals in career also the dlc is only worth it if you have loads of money to spend or are really into the game i didn t want to spend the time figuring out the mission builder and it was not intuitive new parts were cool though overall great game even though i m bad at it just fun to play with rockets edit the recent ish update that improved the graphics of the planet s surface is great it helps make the game feel more modern
