2023 i usually dislike fishing mini games in other games so i had my doubts when i saw that this one was about fishing however it was a pleasant surprise how much i enjoyed the game and how entertained i was while fishing it never got tiring well except maybe taking care of the tamagotchi haha this is a fishing game with several other interesting mechanics surprisingly for me it has a story and quite an interesting one at that with fantastic humor excellent pixel art and let s not even get started on the music this game has such great music i can t get enough of it basically our main character dave is invited to an exotic island to try some delicious sushi but surprisingly they actually want him to go diving and by the way be a waiter manager farmer fish breeder card collector photographer and researcher among many other activities poor dave 24 hours a day are not enough i found all the mini games very entertaining except for the tamagotchi mostly because when i was a kid i hated how much attention it demanded and the minigame reminded me of that i think it s an excellent game to relax while doing some fishing and if you like it get hooked on restaurant management lots of laughs with the cameos and references as well as the game s overall sense humor i had a blast and i might even say i felt a bit sad when i finished it i don t know what the devs are planning if they have more content in mind for the game or a sequel but i m definitely looking forward to any news highly recommended
