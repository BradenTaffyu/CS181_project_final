2017 early access review i was making my way back home with a car load of groceries and one and a half empty crates of beer on the floor beside me after smashing a shop window and pissing on the driver of a yellow car who told me i smelled like i d been drinking all afternoon in town because i spent the day pumping crap from people s septic tanks so that i could eventually afford mail order steel headers for my satsuma when i saw the cops the beer hadn t done my driving any favours and a red line at the top of the screen told me it hadn t done my bladder any favours either but not wanting to lose the day s hard earned on a fine i kept driving while pissing drinking swearing speeding and throwing empties out the window this continued nicely right up until the point where i drove under the truck good times noodle salad buy this game your life will not be complete until you own it
