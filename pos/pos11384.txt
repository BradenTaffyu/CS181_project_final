2021 early access review bought this during the sale 2 pack for a friend and for myself i didn t check the game out online so dived straight into it first impression boring for me tutorial was really minimal status effects were unknown to me and i was struggling at first unsure of where to go what to do etc 7 days to die more like 7 minutes to die i lost in a fist fight against a walking zombie laugh over time this game grew on me as there were multiple things that i could do and discover on my own such as creating crafting materials creating and designing my own base fortifying an existing building clearing and scavenging materials had to think of how i could secure enough resources during the day for the night where the zombies are fasterin a nutshell do not be quick to judge and do take some time to explore this game out with a private server where you can tweak the settings check stuff out there s a lot more reality to this game where i d like to admit for example there s a chance that eating food from a crate can get you sick or another funny scenario where i came across when trying to build a bridge from my base to another friend s base where the bridge came crashing down as there s no structure to hold it securely as the bridge got too long without support near the start of it game physics exist in this game wow i m kind of a hoarder in games which led to me being encumbered in the early game and that s not good as you move slower stamina drains faster etc so you d have to think of ways to get around it hint you can craft a storage and put stuff inside all in all there are still many things that i have yet to explore and am planning to but for now you can say that my disinterest in the game has passed and i am now looking forward to exercise my creativity in creating a base that can hopefully last the blood moons and those to come edit this review was done when i had 22 hours into the game had zero knowledge of the game and honestly didn t feel any hook or a goal to move towards the beauty of exploring a game and slowly understanding how to play what to do where to go and how to make things better easier and more efficient is what got me loving the game but i guess there would be some elitists that expect a newcomer to do prior research before playing the game and some butthurt people who love to impose their opinions onto others i love this game because in the servers that i ve joined i met with lots of kind and friendly players who guided me through the game and this is something that i look forward to after a long day of school work i hope that the servers you join or people you play with warm your heart like they did to mine also i hope that this review doesn t make one think badly of the game or to lead people to make any assumptions by all means please try out the game and see how it fares for you i know i had and will continue to have a pleasant experience to the stranger never did i say that the game is bad because it s hard or that i don t want to learn on my own and want a guide hold my hand tutorial but shoutout to you good sir congrats to you on playing on 5 nightmare difficulty cheers the internet is proud of you and your achievements
