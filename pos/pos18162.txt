2022 imagine shrek hittin a blunt and eating an onion that s the level of layers this game has the lore is more convoluted than norse mythology and the gameplay is like a mcdonalds jungle gym i have started giving affirmations to the goop and i ve spun the globe 420 times in case there was a secret i only recommend this game if you have the mental capacity for differential calculus or if you like playing back gammon 10 10edit i got a comment from inalough which i would like to address the main comment is completely disconnected from the actual game and only serves as mockery inalough s own review of the game was made 16 hours into the game and at the start of the second act the review in question complains about superposed false marketing which i find hard to credit since they had only seen a small part of the game at the point of making the review while im not trying to bully or mock inalough i want people to keep in mind how regardless of if a review comes from a 15 year veteran with 1000 games or a newbie its important to remember that even a review from someone who has 100 a game will be biased by that person and their taste if you want a good review of a game find someone who reviewed it and then continued playing it
