2023 enjoyed it typical fallout out free roaming go anywhere world some great weapons kept the game interesting tinkering with them the combat shotgun with exploding shells was my fave but the fatman always entertains scenery and the vista s from high up are stunning good story made me want to just get to the end to unravel what happened finished the main game and continued with the dlc far harbor probably is the best of the dlc and now looking forward to racking up another few hundred hours on starfield next
