2014 early access review first time playing when it turned night i had no choice but to burry myself in the dirt sitting in the pitch black hole just listening to the insane sounds of the zombies outside i felt a real rush and fear not knowing what would happen its rare a game can do that to you pros great extensive crafting mechaniclootingzombies present an actual challenege especially at night when they runmining for resources feels like you actually acomplished somethingcons dogs themstill in alpha so some glitches may occurperformance can be rough on older systems unless you turn graphics all the way downall in all though i give this game a strong 8 10 the fun pimps seem to care about the game and are quick with fixes it can be insanely addicting to play i love the mining and crafting mechanics the fun to be had in this game is only limited to your own creativity lots of replay valuei am not good at writing reviews but i hope this helps at least one personfinal verdict buy the game
