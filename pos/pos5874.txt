2020 early access review engaging extensive fun if you liked warband you ll love bannerlord definitely early access assets are copied voice acting is minimal some minor quests are bugged but the gameplay starting anyway i hear there s a lot of interesting stuff in the mid late game is essentially a heavily upgraded warband better assets tons of quality of life improvements and just a ton of fun update several hundred hours in this thing is dangerously addictive rough unpolished needs tons of work but i love it it s deadly be ye warned
