2023 when you ignore or work around the performance issues cities skylines ii is an impressive city builder game and a hefty improvement over it predecessor unfortunately there isn t many landscaping options other then paths bushes and trees but hopefully they will add more options in the future although the game is good right now i still believe the game should ve been released as early access and full release delayed until the performance issues were fixed things you can do to improve performance turn off v sync disable dynamic resolution disable depth of field disable fog disable volumetric quality disable global illumination disable motion blur set level of detail to low very lowgpu nvidia geforce rtx 2060cpu intel core i5 10400 cpu 2 90ghz 2901 mhz 6 core s ram 16gbrunning the game at 1080p medium settings except for above options avg fps when starting new city 55begins dropping slowly as city grows bigger frequent staggering when zoomed in on heavily populated areas have not tested performance on lower settings i would still heavily recommend this game to anyone thinking of buying as many performance issues will probably get resolved in future patches and game updates
