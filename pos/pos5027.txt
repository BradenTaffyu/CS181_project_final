2020 having played all the fallout games before this one i have to admit that the game play has greatly improved however the writing is not as nuanced as the the previous titles the story is a generic one as with many action games of the time but the game is fun and quite immersive out of the 50 hours of game time i have on this game 60 of it is just building and improving my settlements indeed the settlements was a mechanic i didn t know i would love in a fallout game the game is enjoyable and worth every penny 4 5 would recommend
