2020 bought the base game when it was on sale for 5 roughly a cinema ticket because i liked the environment thought i would probably spend 2 to 3 hours looking around and that the gameplay wouldn t really click with me now i ve spend more than 180 hours and stalking animals is much more fun than i have anticipated don t get me wrong this is not the kind of game that provides an action packed experience especially because most animals don t fight back but it works when you need to relax let s be honest games like doom or dark souls are not very good at letting you calm down it works best when you take your time enjoy the vista and watch wandering animals through your binoculars instead of going in guns blazing whenever something shows up don t play the game when you have a i want to do kill something urge as this would most likely leave you disapointed for example running will most of the time scare animals away long before you have even spotted them kind of inverse stealth game behaviour where you you encounter more targets by making loud sounds maybe think of it as an alternative to traveling during holidays in covid times i ve really made photo tours with the ingame camera and enjoyed it only switching to a gun once in a while just like in rl holidays and don t be overwhelmd by the price tag of the complete edition or the amount of dlcs you do not need all the dlcs unless you are really enjoing the game the different region dlcs are something you can consider once you know the game suits you and you want some variation the base game contains two large maps which will keep you busy for quite some time the weapon packs are absolutely optional and the additional hunting equipemnt only becomes really usefull once you start to take the game more seriously e g errecting your own blinds to ease mission completion you can be picky with the dlcs without missing out
