2014 honestly probably the game that got me into most of what i like to do computers pc gaming just almost anything without this i probably wouldn t be a pc player at all the game is overall perfect you can do basically anything you want within the source engines limits and that of your computers hardware and has a very strong player base anything from hide and seek to role playing in a deserted world this game more or less has it all with mods a plenty customizing what your character looks like from almost any game movie tv show ect as long as you or someone modeled it its great fun with friends and just random people overall if you haven t even touched this game or tried it i highly recommend you get it because its jack of all trades game and it may help you discover yourself overall 11 10
