2023 a good sequel to a great game graphics combat system trading and battles are the strength of the game diplomacy developing your own fiefs and creating a kingdom is the weakest the game is so complex that the developers have not been able to make decent ai on the tactical map for three years since release to create a kingdom you will have to grind main quest clan ranks after which the whole world will declare war on you without a kingdom you don t have ability to call an army have fun fighting with your band of 150 200 against armies of 600 1200 men fighting is fun and interesting but sometimes there are too many fights the gameplay becomes too repetitive all kings are deranged and nonsensical starting 3 wars at a time and making a peace when starting to destroy enemy too much developing town is slow as takes weeks of real time no upgrades for the villages you can have 1mil coins but no way of developing of your land would like deeper diplomacy easier access to kingdom content not as a vassal of a lunatic kings better kingdom content less useless fights and more meaningful tactical battles
