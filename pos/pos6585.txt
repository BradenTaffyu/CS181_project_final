2020 my favourite simulator game so far great and realistic gameplay works great with keyboard mouse gamepad but i d recommend getting a wheel good graphics not the best though a huuuuuge lifetime basically endless a huuuuuge map but you will need to buy the dlcs to unlock the whole map worth it imo besides being huge the map is quite detailled and each region feels different and unique a lot of fun with the multiplayer mod great soundtracks but please add d a m a g e m o d e l s
