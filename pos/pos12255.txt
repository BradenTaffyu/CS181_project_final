2016 i m going to give an introduction to people who have no idea what garry s mod is and why it s one o the most popular games available on steam garry s mod isn t necessarily a game it s a tool it s a tool that the steam community have been able to turnaround and make into a game with servers game modes weapons and armour i personally don t think face punch are the developers of this game they gave the community a basis to form their own game if you get garry s mod and nothing else you are probably going to be confused why people like it this much however if u get around 10 mods off of the steam workshop you will see why one of the main reasons people love garry s mod this much is due to the community mods it s not the game necessarily but the mods made by the community garry s mod was originally released in 2004 as a mod for half life 2 and escalated in popularity when it was brought onto steam a game that was released in 2004 still has 1000s of players going on each day i have tons of friends that just play garry s mod an nothing else on their steam profile because of the variety this game has there s a sandbox mode which is what it is you can do whatever the hell you want you can make a zombie apocalypse happen you can make npcs into a happy family or you can shoot an npc in the face there are online servers dedicated to each of the garry s mod game modes so you can play multiplayer in sandbox which furthers the possibilities of what you can do you can role play you can have a death match with your friends there are endless possibilities there s trouble in terrorist town which is best to be played with at least 4 players and is not possible to be played with 1 player there are a group of players in a server all of them are innocent except for one depending on how many people are in the server there can be two terrorists and there can also be one detective who can examine a corpse and determine information about him the terrorists goal is to kill all the innocent without being suspected and not to be killed by the innocent the innocents goal is to stay alive for 5 minutes and find the terrorist and kill them i personally don t play much of ttt mainly due to neither me or my friends having a mic but if you have a group of friends with a mic this game is perfect my personal favourite game mode is prop hunt there are two teams hunters and props the props are given 30 seconds to disguise themselves as props and hide in the map after 30 seconds the hunters are released and they are given 4 minutes and 30 seconds to find all of the props there s something about prop hunt which i find addicting i always find achieved and feel like i outsmarted someone when i m on either of the team if you feel like you aren t accomplishing anything in life give prop hunt a try another game mode that i ve spent a lot of time on is death run there are two teams again the deaths and the runners the runners are unleashed upon a map and their goal is to get to the end however there are traps hidden around the map which the deaths need to activate to prevent the runners from reaching the end i found this game to probably be the most frustrating out of all of the game modes as i kept on dying half the time because of my own stupidity and not because of the traps i only recommend that you play death run if you re experienced at garry s mod as there are a few things in death run that inexperienced players won t understand how to do there s also hide and seek which is self explanatory there are two teams the hiders and the seekers the hiders need to hide in the environment and the seekers have a certain amount of time to find all of the hiders this is a bit like prop hunt but it s harder when in prop hunt the hiders could disguise themselves as props and blend in with the environment and the seekers had a full arsenal of weapons in hide and seek the hiders won t be able to blend in with the environment and the seekers don t have any weapons to kill the hiders with they need to chase them and catch up with them i only recommend this if you re finding prop hunt either boring tedious or you re sick of winning each time as if you are still enjoying prop hunt there isn t much else here it s only for the players that want a bit more of a challenge the next game mode is murder murder is basically like ttt but harder in murder there are two teams bystanders and the murderer the murderer is given a knife and they need to kill everyone with it and the bystanders are defenceless except for one of them that has a magnum revolver their goal is to figure out who is the murderer and the person who has the gun needs to shoot and kill the murderer similar to hide and seek i only recommend this to people who are getting sick of ttt or are finding it too easy as if you re enjoying ttt there won t be anything here for you the last game mode that i m going to talk about is jailbreak this is basically like the minecraft mod cops and robbers there are two teams the prisoners and the officers and one of the officers is the warden the prisoners goal is to escape the prison which will take about 10 minutes or to kill all of the officers the officers goal is to keep the prisoners in check and stop them from leaving the prison and they win if all of the prisoners are all either dead or if they re still in the prison after the time limit has expired this one is a breath of fresh air as this one has cooperation involve with it it isn t necessarily every man for himself the prisoners have to work together in order to escape the prison and the officers have to work together to keep the prisoners in check i recommend this game mode to anyone getting gmod or anyone who has gotten it i ve just scraped the tip of the iceberg as there are tons of other game modes in gmod i haven t talked about like base wars a game where you defend your own base and zombie survival a game where you need to survive a zombie apocalypse if i have not convinced you to pick up gmod then i fail at being a reviewer just get gmod and enjoy it for what it is along with 1000s of other players pros good graphics tons of fun to be had replay value even 10 years after it s original release addicitng something for nearly everyoneconsfinal verdict 9 10my steam curator group
