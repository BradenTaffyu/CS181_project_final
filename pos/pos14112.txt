2020 i ve had this game for about a week now and i m totally addicted already i purchased it as part of a klei software bundle and even though the other games are top notch i can t stop playing oxy be ready to dedicate hours and hours to this game aside from the usual problems expanding my colony the biggest problem i have at the moment comes from the wife one of the best games i ve ever played warning this game could cause serious harm to your marital status i m about another 180 hrs play time into this game and i m still learning new things about it and i m thankfully still married many thanks to youtuber francis john for making some really great tutorial videos and the nuggets videos pearls of engineering wisdom the learning curve is huge on this game but stick at it it s worth it good luck all
