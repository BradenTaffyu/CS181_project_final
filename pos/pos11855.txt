2017 product received for free early access review disclosure i marked received this product for free because i was given a key for this game as one of the beta testers note this review covers dead cells in its early access state on release day may 10th 2017 when i first read the steam store description of dead cells i was less than impressed the page is filled with words like rogue lite souls lite metroidvania and even somewhat humorously the term roguevania it was almost as if whoever wrote it had no idea how to describe their game so they just picked assorted words they thought sounded good fortunately this is a review of dead cells and not the aforementioned description you play as a blob of cells that takes over a suit of armor and sets forth on an adventure as far as i can tell there hasn t been a story implemented yet the main abilities are the dodge roll double jump and ground slam there are a variety of melee weapons shields spells traps and bows at your disposal at any given time you can hold two main items bows shields and melee weapons and two active items spells and traps you re allowed to mix and match as you please and can even choose to use two shields if you so desire in addition to weapons you can also obtain a reusable potion for healing it takes a moment to quaff so it must be carefully used while in active combat dead cells is a a platformer with permadeath and a persistent upgrade system defeated enemies can drop cells and item blueprints which can be used to unlock new items and buy permanent enhancements for your character in order to unlock an item you must find its blueprint carry it to the end of a stage and then purchase it with cells once an item is unlocked it has a chance to appear during future runs cells can only be spent at the end of a level and they will be lost if you die while holding them from what i ve seen so far the exploration aspects aren t what one might expect for a game calling itself a metroidvania rather than a single large map that you can freely explore the game is split up into separate stages as you progress through the game paths to alternate stages open up once certain upgrades are obtained they aren t directly attached to each other in a way that allows backtracking in the traditional sense the stages look great and are beautifully designed and varied while you will see the same types of enemies multiple times each stage is the host of at least one type of unique foe although dead cells is still in early access it s easy to see that an immense amount of time and effort has went into polishing the content that said there is at least one flaw i encountered while playing the game the air combat feels awkward and stiff this can make fighting airborne enemies somewhat frustrating i hope the developers expand on air combat in the future because improving it might allow for more variety in combat as it stands dead cells is a thoroughly enjoyable experience but people that read too much into the steam store description may end up being disappointed although i do agree that it has roguelike features i m not sure i would describe this game with the term metroidvania as it s lacking many of the qualities that define other games of that genre during the beta motion twin was very willing to listen to feedback and made many changes that i believe greatly improved the game if they continue operating in this fashion i fully expect the complete version of dead cells to be even better than it is currently i would recommend this game to fans of roguelikes and platformers that aren t opposed to playing a game that is currently a work in progress like the review follow my curator page to see my thoughts on other games
