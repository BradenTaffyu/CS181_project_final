2017 i gave my axe to the blacksmith to have it improved he would return it in a few days when it was done when i got home i wanted to build a fence for my chickens ducks and rabbits said and done i noticed i had forgotten to insert a gate okay i thought let me take out one section of the fence to make place for said gate alas my axe was still at the blacksmith s i could not insert a gate was stuck behind my fence and died of starvation in other words i had to reload 10 10 would showcase my idiocy again
