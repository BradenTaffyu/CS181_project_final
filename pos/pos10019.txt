2016 early access review i started my colony as a lone rich surgeon who had crash landed on the planet i named him boris he wasn t a violent man and shunned fighting whenever possible one day a strong brute joined the colony after he crash landed on the planet and i used my medical skills to patch him up to perfection lovely he did the heavy lifting boris did the research and looked after his sniffles things were going well then she came she was perfect she could shoot a gun like she was ex special forces she could mine like a nutjob on meth and her construction skills were second to none boris was in love over time he tried to woo her but she always rejected his advances one day boris noticed the other two colonists had developed a little relationship and wanted to share a bed together boris felt the rage in the night he arrested the smart talented lady he strapped her to the surgeons table he removed both of her arms at least they will never cuddle in bed boris was not a violent man but he was a good surgeon
