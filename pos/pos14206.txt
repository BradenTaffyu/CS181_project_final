2018 early access review this game is fantastic absolutely fantastic regular updates plenty of new content with every update and soo much to do it can be overwhelming for those who first pick it up as there is a lot of different menus and things to try to wrap your head around once you get the basic understanding though it s such a rewarding game and no other game provide the same experience i love this game it has been the main focus of my twitch streams recently so much so that i have been giving copies away to viewers and created a fan art inspired poster which is used on my streams cannot recommend this game enough buy now thanks me later
