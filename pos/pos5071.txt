2016 fallout 4 is another addition to the fallout franchise although the engine is a bit old and buggy the game still looks amazing at times wandering through the commonwealth is just amazing and there are hundreds of marked and unmarked locations to discover each with its own story it s amazing to just discover everything read the terminals listen to holotapes and discover the lore of fallout 4 the main quest doesn t have the best story but has some unexpected turns to it that keep it a bit more interesting but even after finishing the main quest there is so much more to do crafting and customizing your weapon and power armor is really cool and building settlements is a nice add on to the series depending on if you like it building settlements can easily take tens of hours looting now finally makes sense since you can scrap everything for materials to build with the game has excellent music and some really fun and surprisingly deep side quests the various characters you meet while playing are interesting and it s really cool to be able to send some of these to your own settlement fallout 4 also introduced voice acting for the main character and although this is really opinion based if you ask me this is a bad thing i liked creating my own character instead of listening to a premade one when you finished fallout 4 or you want a more challenging approach to the game you can try survival mode survival mode delivers a more hardcore experience with things like cooking sleeping sickness stronger enemy s and more as some call this the best way to play fallout but this really comes down to personal preference since you can t save the game so easily you might have to replay certain parts and walk all the way back to that one spot personally i found it really fun at first but got tired of it rather quickly sadly this game also has a lot of cons for example they removed the karma system known from fallout 3 fallout nv this makes choosing certain dialogue options a lot less interesting since the outcome is the same they also made the dialogue system a lot simpler since now you have a dialogue wheel instead of the whole sentences this results in you never knowing what exactly you re going to say and dialogue is a lot more simplified the game has a terrible ui and settlement building can be really buggy and unhandy at times in my opinion you also get power armor way too soon in the game this should be something to work towards instead of getting it handed to you after an hour of playing and lastly the game has taken away too much rpg elements and focusses too much on fps although shooting has greatly improved in comparison to other fallouts it is sad to see they removed some awesome rpg elements when you re done with all of the above there s always mods mods deliver a lot of extra content improvements from simple mods that fix bugs or add weapons to entire new worlds quests and settlements to explore mods really give it another fresh and unique twist if you re done with the game overall fallout 4 is another amazing addition to the series and despite it having some down points this game is so much fun mainly because of the massive world and all of the things to do discover and find out the game has a great atmosphere and looks really amazing i highly recommend you to try this game but be aware it s quite different in comparison to older fallout games
