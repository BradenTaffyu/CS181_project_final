i m not going to bore or entertain with another story of rimworld joy or pain instead i m going to keep this one simple if you like colony sims anno farthest frontier etc or if you like the randomness of kenshi and crazy different stories mods replayability then this one is for you don t be put off by the graphics or simple look of this it s incredibly fun and addictive once you figure out the basics the modding community for this game is massive so any aspects of the game you don t enjoy just change it don t initially worry about dlc s the base game is more than enough to work out if it s for you
