2015 early access review this game is the first roguelike i ve really gotten into and it may very well be the last it blends fantasy and sci fi in a way that i ve never seen before and i doubt i ll ever see something like this again it s cringe worthy rage inducingly hard but i just cannot stop playing i ve never played a game that gave me as many character creation options as this one does a lot of the lore is randomly generated and yet still manages to be intriguing and entertaining this game is so good i m worried it ll overshadow all the other sci fi rpgs i know and love but not too worried because if i had to pick a single game to play for the rest of my life i d pick no question very important update this game has hands down the most reliable dev team i ve ever had the pleasure of interacting with and i have interacted with them directly they often respond to questions on the community hub if that s not enough of a hint that they re a stellar team take a look at their update feed they put them out like clockwork when they skip a week it s because they ve got a big update in the pipeline and they never fail to give a heads up when that happens come for the procedurally generated sci fi stay for all the new stuff the dev team ll be adding
