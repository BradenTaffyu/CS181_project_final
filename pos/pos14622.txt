2018 i have little to say other than civ 6 has kept me entertained for now tens of hours and keeps me hooked every time i launch it back up while i originally disliked the game at launch the frequent updates rise and fall expansion and mods have brought the game to a fantastic state the ai works well and can be further moded to be harder or easier to change it s decision patterns etc ot your liking the civilizations are all very unique and allow for a good mix of gameplay and frankly the overall experience is most enjoyable civ 6 has simplified and streamline lots of micro from civ 5 and added in tons of planning complexitiy through its districts sytem and adjecency bonuses in my mind it s not about comparing civ 5 and civ 6 as they are relatively different games but rather admitting that civ 6 brings soemthing new and fresh to the civ forumula and it works well hour after hour recommended especially if like me you have been putting off civ 6 due to it s strong design changes from civ 5
