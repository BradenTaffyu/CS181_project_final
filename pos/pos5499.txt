early access review developer scheduling is all over the place but the game is good user interface is now ostensibly fixed from the weird overlay situation we had before it took a few years from when they announced it but appears to be panning out love this game and now it s playable controller support is surprisingly well thought out and the user interface is pretty inspired especially for a more traditional roguelike gameplay has always been awesome and now it s much more intuitive glad to hear dlcs are planned for the future hopefully the releases are easier to deliver on the planned date
