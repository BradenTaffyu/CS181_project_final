2015 it may not be the prettiest game this year or even the most stable but fallout 4 delivers 100 on what i wanted most another amazing experience in the wasteland the crafting is impressively in depth and the settlement building is insanely addictive i find myself losing track of everything else for hours on end trying to figure out how to layout my towns a mention to the updated combat systems as well as i find myself very rarely going to v a t s this time around all in all i d say probably my personal favorite game this year 9 5 10
