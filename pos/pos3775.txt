this game is a masterpiece and probably one of the greatest games i ever played in my life a melancholic game that makes you feel nostalgia for memories that you never had the game is pretty much a mix of undertale yume nikki and earthbound overall regardless of who plays this game which ending you do like your experience or not you will feel something and that s what makes this game so special i hope that anyone who reads this review enjoys the game as much as i did
