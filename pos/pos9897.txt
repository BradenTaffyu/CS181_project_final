2017 early access review the colony was going swimmingly then the escaped patient stumbled upon my colony with a pack of slavers right on his tail he implored us for aid in return he will join our colony to be perfectly honest we were a lil short handed in the cleaning department so we accepted the slavers rebuked at our sneaky traps and ambushes and fled in terror not bad for a day s work christopher the patient turned out to be a great addition to keeping the core of our operation clean and tidy however we realised there was a lot wrong with him but mostly he was incapable of complex tasks like cooking good meals researching things tailoring fighting hunting or sculpting mixed with a bag of sociapathic behaviour christopher was also an occasional pyromaniac that never quite put out the fires he started never the less we gave this stranger a chance a month later the slavers came back with reinforcements it was a tough fight all my militiamen were somewhat wounded in the process we fought them off in the end but not before the slavers set all of my experimental crops on fire it was a major effort putting out the rampaging fires as a result most of my colonists passed out with wounded exhaustion in the field christopher the patient came running and hauled all of us to the medical bay we have never been so grateful it was in that moment that we realised that our true enemies are not the ones we can fight physically the true enemy is to ourselves the defects and the darkness within christopher hauled all of us into the medical bay we watched him through pleading exhausted eyes as he lit the match
