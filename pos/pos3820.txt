2023 if you appreciate tactical turn based rpgs this will probably be up your alley each main character serves as the squad leader of an army unit every individual unit can also become a squad leader but their aptitude for the role will vary each squad can have different formats that will impact how you are attacked and defend against enemies there are many different unit classes to switch in between and that process of switching classes is very forgiving and reversible which allows you to experiment very freely with different combinations the game comes with 4 difficulty settings i played on the average difficulty and with permadeath on and it seemed very fair in it s tactics the story is nothing incredible but at least good enough to help keep the story going with minimum intrigue to keep you interested the main interest is how well the gameplay is i thoroughly enjoyed myself with it and it goes on longer than expected to my delight at least the game seems very well planned out and developed i didn t encounter a single bug the gameplay is good a lot of savestates if you like testing various strategies and an interesting battle format i played for almost 70 hours but i did all the extra content and battles to over level and gain more items so you could probably beat it in around 15 20 hours if you want it s a super recommend from me
