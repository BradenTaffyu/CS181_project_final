2023 if you don t own the game or considering an upgrade from the base version i highly recommend the anthology it goes to discount quite often it has a good amount of leaders to pick from and variety in their play style the timeline ages natural disasters and the usage of real names for mountains rivers etc adds a nice touch as much as i hate their business model in the end they know what they are doing and it is a solid game in my opinion buying the base game on release and then waiting until the release of the whole content and upgrading to it during a discount is the best approach worked well for me so far with civ 5 and civ 6 i suggest the same for the confirmed upcoming civ 7
