2016 product received for free the end times have arrived chaos fanatics and abominations led by archaon the everchosen the three eyed king and favored son of chaos march ever forward from the desolate north with a single goal set before them to bring forth the end of the world in honor of the dark gods entire nations of men have fallen orks have been wiped out from the world and the only thing standing against the tides of darkness is an uneasy alliance between the mountain dwarfs and the undead legions of sylvania or at least it would be if the damnable dwarfs didn t decide this was prime time to exact revenge for a trade dispute that occurred ages ago as i sat there watching my entire empire crumble i was left wondering if i should be angry the ai decided to essentially throw the entire campaign and condemn us all to eternal damnation or genuinely impressed it managed to do exactly what the dwarfs in warhammer lore would do seek revenge against anyone foolish enough to end up in their great book of grudges the factions unlike previous total war where every faction only differs slightly from their neighbors the ones in warhammer all share the same general idea of warfare but are unique in their implementation the aforementioned dwarfs not a spelling mistake mostly adopt a defensive playstyle as earning new enemies is way more trouble than its worth due to the entire campaign revolves around crossing out names from the book of grudges which naturally means beating up anyone that ever slighted you orks on the other hand care little for defense and prefer to fight as often as possible this is represented in game through the fightiness meter that increases as you win battles and crush your enemies but decreases if you lose battles or hide behind walls like some sort of a dwarf instead of loosing troops as you constantly advance across the campaign map your numbers will slowly increase as long as you remain on the offense eventually ending up with an entire army trailing your primary one an army you don t have to pay in anything other than blood the vampire counts my personal favorite race don t rely on such silly things as archery artillery or even taking good care of their front line troops what they have instead is a nearly endless sea of corpses to drown their enemies in zombies skeletons and skeletal zombie dogs all serve as cannon fodder to hide your more powerful units the various monstrosities that have been forcefully risen from the grave and a surprisingly effective and diverse set of spectral cavalry that will tear through the enemy s defenses with ease there is nothing quite like watching thousands upon thousands of zombies slowly shamble towards terrified defenders stuck within their burning cities if you re up for a somewhat standard total war experience however the empire is there to provide exactly that their troops mostly consist of peasants with halberds entire legions of crossbowmen and naturally noble knights riding upon steeds of war there s plenty of wierd stuff out there as well but these guys are your total war classic the art of war if you ve ever played a total war game then you know exactly what to expect the battles are usually drawn out affairs where good positioning quick thinking and tactics will win the day over pure brute force the one big difference compared to the previous games in the series is the inclusion of magic both in the defensive enhancements and tornadoes made out of pure fire unfortunately most of these offensive spells are nowhere near worth their mana costs as they do rather meek amounts of damage and tend to move about the battlefield in a random fashion it makes sense from a lore perspective as the mortal races tend to have trouble understanding the winds of magic but from a gameplay standpoint this means you ll mostly be spending your mana on efficient but extremely boring offensive defensive buffs the normal ai while clearly not a genius did offer me enough of a challenge throughout the campaign to never make me feel like i was getting an easy win though i was warned when i picked up my review copy that it was slightly overtuned pre release so your mileage may vary the most important thing to note is that i haven t encountered any situations where the ai is so stupid it essentially throws away an easily won battle due to idiocy however i do have one big issue with the combat and this comes down to the fact that many units in warhammer look similar when viewed from above especially the armored ones in a battle between black orks and skeletal swordsmen its next to impossible to tell which side is winning without looking up the health bars which themselves could be covered by other health bars i would like to see an option that gives your units an outline in the color of your choice as otherwise you have to rely on the pause button far too often and that is something i don t consider very fun campaign the biggest addition to the campaign is the inclusion of legendary lords important heroes from the lore that usually take the role of generals in battles the best part about them is that you get to slowly watch them ascend to power through various quests these quests will appear periodically on the campaign map and usually force you to bring your entire army into hostile territory with the carrot being a magical artifact of great power you will start the battle with your entire army at the ready while the opposition will get a pre built force that might just be vastly inferior or completely overpowered depending on when you decide to undertake the quest while that can be a small issue i m generally pleased with how the quests work especially since they often give you an interesting scenario to fight in one that you wouldn t get in any random battle which is great as it manages to keep the game fresh what doesn t feel fresh and this is probably the biggest issue with total war warhammer is the fact that the end of the campaign is so repetitive almost every faction has the exact same goals destroy two opposing nations and stop the chaos invasion so no matter how unique your playthrough and faction are you re going to result doing the exact same thing as everyone else once you reach the end game as far as the campaign map is concerned everything is more or less similar to the previous games so you will be building up your forces creating new buildings to either generate income or recruit more units research spells and abilities for your units and so forth the only thing worth mentioning here is that the insanely stupid diplomacy system is back again and you will often have your allies decline your requests only to instantly repeat back the same request but also pay you money to do so closing thoughts total war warhammer is a crossover between two franchises i ve enjoyed for many years now and i m delighted to say that it manages to be faithful to both sides but most importantly an actually enjoyable experience on its own it has some clear flaws especially when it comes to the generic campaign ending terrible diplomacy system and occasional performance woes but even with all of that considered this is the most fun i ve had with a total war game the factions are unique the units exciting and the battles often a spectacle to behold so i do hope the problems get ironed out through future patches and dlcs as this is a game i would love to keep coming back to for many years to come in order to keep things brief and yes i realize how ironic that sounds i ve had to skip out on some aspects of the game so if you re interested in my fully detailed review i welcome you to give it a look here
