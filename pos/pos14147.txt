2020 i purchased this game probably 2 or maybe 3 years ago it gives hours and hours of play and even after 337 hours of play i still didnt launch a single rocket i am still learning the ins and outs of this game if you like complicated yet cute graphical games this one will be perfect i have to say it will keep me busy for next 300 hours
