2017 early access review youtube video the baron reviews rimworld views 1 214 store page steam reviews curator page it s really hard to define why rimworld is so incredible but it really is on the surface it looks really plain the graphics the animations the gameplay but it really grows on you when you discover how deep the game is the real gem is unique character personality system unlike just about every other management game in existence rimworld really makes you feel for the characters whether it is positive or negative i ve had colonists that i really felt terrible for when they were tragically killed or maimed and colonists who i have despised because they put the rest of my colonists st risk it s really surprising how much empathy the game can make you feel for those little 2d sprites the personal stories created from the struggles and victories of the individual characters is what makes the game incredible initially the short term goal of the game is to just survive the brutal conditions of the early game and get on your feet slowly but surely the quality of life is improved for your colonists challenges arise raiders are beaten back news friends are made enemies created the long term goal of the game is to escape the planet either by building a spaceship or by making an epic quest across the planet the controls and ui get the job done nothing particularly novel but perfectly functional the graphics style works well for the game and the music is outstanding both remind me of the tv show firefly with that sci fi western theme totally being an influence the modding community is fantastic with dozens of incredible quality of life mods to some downright outstanding conversion mods like the star wars one all being available on workshop
