2020 do you have a functioning social life do you have a functioning life at all would you like not to overviewmound and blade warband is basically an updated version of mount and blade effectively the same game with a few updates it places you in the shoes of a recent arrival to the land of calradia a land torn by strife between the nords rhodoks swadians kherjits vaegirs and sarranids thrust into intrigue as soon as you arrive you soon naturally find yourself in the mercenary life fighting to keep your belly full gameplay tacticalat its core mount and blade is a medieval combat simulator when a battle starts your army and the one that opposes you are placed in a randomly generated battlefield created by the terrain where your armies meet and from there you fight until one side no longer has any troops it s a very dry affair and although the combat seems simplistic at first glance it s surprisingly deep with a lot of blocking and precise stabs and slashes to actually deliver blows there s a kind of beauty in its simplicity where just a few moves make up a combat system that s actually quite engaging there s also the horseback element which makes up the mount of mount blade again despite its simplicity fighting on horseback requires a surprising amount of coordination and practice to actually get down and when you do it s utterly satisfying gameplay strategicwell i couldn t really write a mount blade review without talking about this the tactical element is fun yes but then there s the strategic element of building your armies your wealth your holdings and your reputation and i ll put this blunty this aspect of the game is digital heroin it s addicting how much care and time you ll put into slowly growing your influence throughout calradia doing favors for local lords and just spreading your goodwill across the lands and for the life of me i can barely articulate why maybe it s the vaguely realistic aspect of the setting that makes you feel like an actual warlord coming to power or maybe it s just the numbers going up or the pipe dream goal of eventually becoming kind of the entire realm whatever it is it ll suck you in and won t let you go until someone calls the cops to check to see if you ve died i really can t stress how addicting this game is and how rewarding it is to have your character grow more powerful over time it scratches a very very specific itch i ve seen no game really do since this one and if you re that kind of person that has that kind of itch this is the perfect game for you summarymount blade isn t the prettiest game out there but it has a cult following and for good reason a depth that betrays its first impressions a thriving mod scene and gameplay that manages to be rewarding even in 2020 it s a game that will consume your life if you let it i m serious you will lose weeks to this find more reviews at balance patch
