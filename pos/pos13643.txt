2018 great milsim 9 10 one point away from being perfect in game dlc advertising is super annoying you re in a firefight ran out of ammo went over to enemy friend to pick up his weapon but it turned out being a dlc weapon nope you cannot use it sh t hits the fan and you have to escape using a nearby vehicle but it turned out being a dlc vehicle nope you cannot drive sucks when that happens
