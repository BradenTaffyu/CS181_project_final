2023 i haven t personally found any depth to a lot of the complaints some don t seem to like the brighter graphics presumably because they have confused wwii with lord of the rings and think the wehrmacht blocked out the sun so that their orcish panzergrenadiers could move during daylight i dunno where i m from what lots of people are calling oversaturated graphics i just call going outside pseriously though i m pretty confident north africa and italy are not permanently overcast and raining ash at least not since pompeii in short while most of the criticisms seem to be based in a grain of truth yes the graphics are brighter the conclusions drawn from these objections are fairly overblown at best and flat out incorrect at worst in the latter category for instance we have the bizarre suggestion that the game is not finished or in a worse state than earlier entries despite the fact that it has shipped with double the playable factions of any earlier entry at release and the most ambitious single player campaign of the series even if the campaign is flawed the one major criticism of games journalists who have otherwise praised the game at the time of writing most critic reviews are very positive and 2 3 people on steam recommend playing the game this is also considering that of the remaining 1 3 a decent portion seem to have review bombed with barely enough time to play a single match while this small but vocal group seems intent on sinking the ship i d seriously recommend giving this a go if you are on the fence highlights for me smooth and satisfying to play well optimised all the core game play features of the earlier entries but expanded with cool new additions like rideable tanks and towable field guns greater relevance of infantry and light vehicles due to their abundance and role variety factions are less one trick ponies with the capacity to be played in a variety of fun and thematic ways exciting possibilities for new battle groupsexamples of really fun thematic choices north african german force consisting primarily of armoured infantry that get synergy bonuses when fighting next to vehicles even basic infantry can also repair though less effectively than engineers and can build halftracks right out of the gate focus on panzer iii as main battle tank makes for a very different german experience to what has come before us forces with a universal upgrade to give all rifleman squads a bar rifle and the ability to then individually upgrade each unit to a second bar add in a veterancy upgrade that allows them to suppress and you get some great theme around the relative carefree expenditure of ammo that us forces were known for ability to focus on infantry air force or armour through hq choice in addition to commander doctrine battle group choice allow for some great combined arms builds
