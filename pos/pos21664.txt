this game is absolutely sublime and one of the most unique games i ve played it must be played with two players and one player cannot always carry the other that being said my 4 year old daughter and i played this from beginning to end and were absolutely blown away by how amazing it was initially we gave up because it was too tough for her but after about 6 months playing other games we tried it again and were hooked each level is a unique world with unique tools weapons skills that needed to be used to progress this kept the game feeling fresh and exciting while still having many common threads throughout the entire story the game is part puzzle part skill and timing part action and all fun puzzles were just hard enough to where we only had to youtube one or two of them overall execution of the game was nearly flawless and would love to play more like this speaking of execution the only instance were the game went wrong it went terribly wrong as our characters were an about to separate couple magically turned into dolls they decided that the only way to become human again and break the spell was to make their daughter cry which was a stupid assumption in the first place so to achieve their goal they decided to kill her favorite stuffed animal an elephant this is already a bad idea but when they confront the elephant she was absolutely the sweetest and kindest creature on earth they then proceed to kidnap the elephant and make their way to a cliff to throw her off along the way the elephant s leg and ear are ripped off meanwhile she is pleading with the player s characters to let her go it made you feel cruel evil and basically disgusted my 4 year old daughter kept asking why do we have to hurt her she was so upset she couldn t continue i was completely appalled we stopped the game and i waited to finish the murder when she was no longer in the room just so we could continue the game i then told her that we let the elephant go and didn t kill her it was such an awful misstep by the creators to put a stain on such an otherwise great game
