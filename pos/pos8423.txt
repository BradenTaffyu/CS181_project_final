2019 i put 14 hours into this game on the first day of playing it it is addicting opportunity for a few different starts and a good challenge there s some great moments of excitement and disappointment that will keep you on your seats it does get easier once you get the hang of the importance of resources health and obviously heat but survivor mode is incredibly difficult if you enjoy strategy this is a great game
