destroys magic armour cast dominate mind mind maggot grenade charm person or madness me every moderately difficult fighti was told this was the best game to play after baldur s gate 3 and as i get to the end that was totally right it fully feels like a stepping stone to get to bg3 and is also just fantastic to play pros honestly having so many levels feels very satisfying even compared to bg3 where you only got 12 the fighting is just really fun took a second for me to get used to the small changes like turn limits source and no resting needed for spells but it was certainly well done and had so many possible moves spells characters are great sebillle ily and a fun plot that i enjoying playing out voice acting is very good sebille va ily there s so many options for armour that all have different ways to boost you so many different designs ability combinations sets to match etc not being able to level it up is a little unfortunate but i think it makes sense for the game so i wouldn t say that s a con making your party specialize in different areas and have different abilities is so fun which realtes heavily to the fighting but in general it s just great the support abilities are so much better here than bg3 partially because i didn t need to worry about wasting a spell slot and because some only took 1 slot which would be all i was left with but also they were just legitimately betterdifferent than bg3 not really pros or cons just differences when comparing a relatively older game to a modern masterpiece the characters side characters and main ones don t have nearly as much depth in this game even though what we get from them is great no cutscenes again these points aren t giving any negative points in my eyes just stuff that could make it even better if it came out now levelling up doesn t come with as much customization and changes aspects of the story and side characters are both a bit more convoluted and simple as well as just harder to follow still good there s no long resting and short resting using bedroll is only for restoring health honestly besides missing the camp that aspect was actually more convenient oh yeah there s no camp clothes and costumization options due to no cutscenes but there s also more armours and lacking informal clothes doesn t do anything there s no dice rolling which i missed even though it was kinda nice that i didn t have to worry about rolling a 1 lol moving and actions are counted in the same 4 moves the amount you can walk per move depends on character which i can see being better or worse i like bothcons the levelling system can be a little annoying and i ended up needing to look at level maps which i guess is elaborated on in my next point the game doesn t feel like it guides you enough or gives you quite enough freedom to be clear this is a grievance but isn t nearly as bad as that makes it sound just something i encountered a couple times there were times i would accidentally stumble into enemies who were too high levelled but they were already aggravated or i couldn t talk my way out so i would have to load before i met them and just avoid them until i could reach the correct level there was also one major time that i didn t know i had to trigger events in a specific order or a couple times i thought something would trigger another event so i avoided it only for it to not matter like going on that kids boat in act 1 and what i needed to do wasn t really said which led to me kinda up a part of the main story also led to me not getting resolution on peeper and reloading continuously to save him for half of arx only to realize he had no relevance after the arc he got introduced in and i had just not casted spirit vision where i was supposed to the persuasion or i guess this applies to tags and just general interactions too aspect can be annoying maxing it for the main character is the move but it can still be annoying just because occasionally your allies will be the ones to be spoken to especially after battles if you aren t the closest one to the npc then you have no persuasion and are lacking your tags which can lead to another issue also had to reload a couple times to bring my mc closest to the npc before a fight ended or to intentionally trigger conversations that my allies accidentally didanyway i m sure there s many more things i could add and i probably should ve waited until i actually finished i m sure the end is great especially to the pros but if you enjoyed bg3 and see this review yes it s a fantastic game to play after bg3 it s got no major issues and is just great if you re craving another game like bg3 or just craving any game to put some hours into this is the one
