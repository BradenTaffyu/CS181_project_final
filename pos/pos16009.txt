2021 i ve never actually played a real board game before i ve gotten together with friends looked at a board and considered playing a game but at no point in the 19 hours of play time have i ever played a real game so you might be asking yourself what i have actually done all this time and what exactly me and my friends are achieving you also may be asking why i m recommending a game that in all seriousness i haven t actually played there are many answers to those questions and they range from sarcastic to possibly useful if you like using the vague musings of strangers to make life choices the answer to what we ve done is goof around we spawned a bunch of nonsense in listened to music slammed figurines together flipped the table and even performed a science experiment to see how many marbles we could fill the table with to crash the game none of this is what the game is supposed to be but it doesn t matter because i had fun and my friends had fun and technically the option to play the game correctly still exists i don t know if we ever will but maybe and even if we continue to act like a bunch of children who just got access to a board game maybe that s all we need to enjoy life maybe we re simple people maybe we re insane i m cool with either in all seriousness the game seems amazing and i do want to play it seriously i am recommending it because of the prospects and the fact that i am hyped for playing it for real even though i ve never done so myself there is so much going on in this game almost to an overwhelming degree and i hope to actually properly entertain what this game is meant to be one day
