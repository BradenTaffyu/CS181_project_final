2023 quite possibly one of the best games i ve ever played i ve never left a review for any game but there is just too much in this game that i love and i feel people have to know about it first of all the mechanics for the game are quite simple and it s designed in the perfect way for you to learn as you go it introduces every mechanic exactly when it needs to and not a second sooner next the style of this game is beautiful the amount of detail and love that is put into every single part is very obvious and it shows how much care was put into developing this game finally the lore it s so rich and bountiful and every new discovery you make just puts you further into the rabbit hole of wanting to know more this has easily skyrocketed into my top 10 games of all time and is gunning for a top 5 spot 10 10 would recommend to anyone
