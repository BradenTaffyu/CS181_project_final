i didn t want to write a review but stardew is a game that deserves one i bought it to strengthen my friendship with a friend who had played it for over 500 hours every day after school we would play stardew together while i only took care of the chickens they managed the entire farm even though i lost the friendship that grew because of stardew i still miss my chickens i hope they are taking good care of my chickens play stardew on your own at least you won t get hurt and you ll have a happy farm to enjoy
