i recommend but at your own risk if you just want to get into a city builder because yo like creating roads and laying out a city etc you may have fun with this however this is not a game at present that provides any challenge you do not have any consequences for a mistake or for forgetting to install or build a certain city service heck you don t even have to pay for your roads the roads pay you without even needing a toll booth i thought it was really weird to have barely any population and not be in the red for the miles and miles of road i placed down seriously i built out all my main roads interstate highways interchanges intersections i built all upgraded city services education medical etc with only a population of a few thousand but i was raking in money faster than i could spend it i have over 80 000 residents and make over 2 million credits per month i have more roads rail air boats than i have areas filled by residents i have so many roads etc that most of them don t even get used somehow my children and teens get highly educated even though i have 6 000 eligible for h s but only 600 actually go to high school meanwhile my elementary schools are completely full 1200 students each in 5 schools over 6 000 kids i did have a college and university but i deleted them this did not have any effect on my high schools attendance there should be a policy that says teenagers can not go to college nor go to work until they have graduated h s no middle schools in which world do kids go from elementary school straight to h s why isn t their any middle schools pedestrians why do pedestrians jay walk why do they jay walk when they are provided beautiful pedestrian bridges yes i have turned off crosswalk on my intersection but some pedestrians refuse to obey the laws most of them use the bridges but 10 which is a lot walk across the road and stop the flow of traffic additionally it seems like everyone walks more people walk than actually drive i followed a lot of sims from their homes to their work or other activities they don t use the taxi the bus the metro nor use their own cars instead they walk miles and miles to get to work even though a bus stop and taxi stand are nearby as well as a reasonably close metro stop what is going on here resource extraction some of my resources actually perform really well but others under perform even though the areas rated yield is 300 to 800 tn they never produce even half that and in my production tab it shows i have a deficit of double that rated production output what is happening there is this a bug no matter how many more of these same resources i plot my production is never enough and it does not reflect what the resource production limit for the drawn out or zoned area is this is just one aspect of the production chain i could go on about other issues but i am tired it s late at night so please buy and play the game at your own risk it has many improved features and other mechanics that cities skylines lacked mods fixed that however cs 2 is not complete nor enjoyable if you were hoping to keep your city from failing with every new road zone service industry or etc you installed because for now it is impossible to fail no matter how badly you build the city good luck have fun for now until a major update is done or mods are officially supported i will not play anymore i will continue to play world of warships
