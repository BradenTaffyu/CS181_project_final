2016 gameplay mechanics are great and storyline was okay nothing like new vegas or even fallout 3 s i would say you are better off getting both gotys of nv and f3 during the summer sale and installing tale of two wastelands ttw mod if you want the rpg elements rather than the fps elements also for god s sake please do not buy the season pass the dlc is utter garbage besides far harbor thus far hopefully one day obsidian will make another fallout title and bethesda goes back to making the elder scrolls because fallout 4 has been quite the dissapointment to us long time fans
