2023 before playing dark souls 3 i had a full head of hair a healthy sleeping schedule and a sense of personal accomplishment after many long nights filled with the sounds of my own screams echoing through my home all of these things have vanished in dark souls 3 your role is simple you play as a masochist the game consists entirely of dying in new and interesting ways learning from your mistakes then proceeding to die in the exact same ways at least a dozen more times the variety of weapons are amazing though i find the most effective one is a sturdy controller to smash over my own head the lore and world are rich deep and utterly incomprehensible the story seems complex but requires decoding ancient runes and a degree in philosophy to understand so i just skipped all that and went straight to dying 10 10 experience would recommend to anyone who hates themselves or values their sanity
