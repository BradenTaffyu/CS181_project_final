2018 early access review jarrizard s pros and cons review while the game is decent enough to be played with friends on a night out i wouldn t recommend it at full price it shows promise the game as it is now is just lacking and unpolished there s not much to do you ll find yourself always focused on food and water crafting more stuff to make it easier to get food and water etc maybe it ll change overtime when more updates are rolled in pros overall look and atmosphere of the game is nice relaxing too constantly updated by the developers better with friends multiplayer support enough freedom on how you choose to build your raft cons unrealistic thirst and hunger it felt like a chore catering to your character s needs than actually surviving unimmersive environments islands are random gen and sometimes there s no way to reach the top where you can get most of the resources from bad creature ai the shark attacks at fixed interval and rate too predictable and not fun usually they re just there to hinder your progress on whatever you re building no physics if a foundation breaks everything above that breaks along with it lack of content depending on how fast you progress you can see what the game is trying to offer in 5 10 hours while the soundtrack is good it becomes repetitive because the loop is too short and it gets boring as you spend most of your time in game without music even the sound effects are recycled over and over end of review
