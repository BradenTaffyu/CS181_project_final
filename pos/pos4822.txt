started with fallout 2 as a kid went through all games of fallout as well as elder scrolls 3 4 5 fallout 4 is wonderful game that i came back to got it via steam for me and my friends eventhough there is fallout 76 with co op mechanics fallout 4 would be great to enjoy in co op that s only downside for me that you do crazy things explore but you do it alone build wonderful bases but you do not have anyone around to share excitement with yet it s one of the best games i ve played you can go badass build or nerdy build or role play up to you variety is huge personally i finished this game multiple times and it still takes me back to keep playing it however i got hooked up on fallout 76 that doesn t mean i do not prefer fallout 4 more i do thanks for updates and modding community for making this game absolutely amazing
