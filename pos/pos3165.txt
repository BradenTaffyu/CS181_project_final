2020 though i m still a newbie to this genre i found this game extremely addictive and quite unique unlike some other turn based rpgs i ve played the combat not only relies on your abilities or moveset but also heavily on the environment and terrain your success depends on how you re able to manipulate your surroundings to your advantage this is the reason why every single fight feels unique and not repetitive at all the engaging and branching storyline according to your choices is one of the strongest aspects of dos2 the scope of customization is insane the game offers great replay value it doesn t hold your hand at all just how a perfect rpg should be it s impossible to experience all of it in a single playthrough there are a bunch of things that the game does really good including the great voice acting and the visuals tl dr this game is a must play for any rpg fan even for people who aren t into crpgs or turn based combat i believe this is a great choice if you want to get into this genre
