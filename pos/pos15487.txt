2022 i would recommend this cms 21 to anyone who wants a simulator that lets you learn and play at the same time now i wouldn t say this game is even close to 100 accurate to actual mechanics as there are no gaskets wiring and spark chasing vacuum hoses to run or find in some pain in the arse cases tight spaces and torque requirements don t factor into the job and apparently you always know where the 10mm socket is the most unrealistic part of the game the game will give you an entry level insight into part placement and function and may peak your interest into certain components that may prompt you to research things you otherwise wouldn t know the question to ask after you have or if you have a thorough basic knowledge of mechanics you ll get to the point you can just shut your brain off and just relax as you take a rusted jalopy from the junkyard and turn it into a highly tuned masterpiece
