2022 i never expected this game to grip me by the as much as it did it shattered my expectations of what a city building game could be this game is amazing for the micromanagement game time control players who want to perfect their strategy i played the main scenario multiple times before finally being able to know what i had to do to get through the storms that was all fun and all starting over every time slowly perfecting my starts but once i was able to play the game through without issue from starvation or lack of heating the feeling i felt directly before during and finally after the final storm in the main scenario was nothing short of heart pumping adrenaline in my attempt to at the least survive and at most save every life i could the game does an amazing job building atmosphere and connecting you to your people you feel responsible and relieved making it through every storm with some tough decision making along the way after completing the main scenario i was hooked and i ve completed almost each scenario and i m now playing the endless mode this game rules if you re still reading this get it
