2018 i have 400 hours in and i m still not sure how i would review this game it s amazing it s frustrating it s challenging it s annoying it will make you feel like a master when you get it right it will punish you mercilessly when you don t assetto corsa is not a game in the traditional sense of the word if you are looking for fun go play forza or project cars they will provide fun if you are looking to be a better sim racing driver if you are looking to be forced to actually learn and improve your driving this is absolutely the title for you for me there was a point where i had to push myself to keep playing this title it was t fun it annoyed the crap out of me for a while on the other side of that however came immense satisfaction the realization that i had actually improved i was mastering something this is not a feeling that i have ever gotten from other racing titles when you get it with ac it s incredible
