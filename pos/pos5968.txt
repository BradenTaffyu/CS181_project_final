2020 tl dr this review focuses on the sims 4 dlcs because i believe they re necessary for a fun experience but they re expensive if you can t or won t spend twice the cost of the main game on dlcs i can t recommend the game i won t go into detail about how the sims 4 works because most people know how these games function but i want to mention that this game doesn t have an open world like the sims 3 and the worlds are much smaller however the game has decent content but it can feel empty without dlcs so if you plan to buy the sims 4 i recommend purchasing a few dlcs it s costly but i think it s necessary to enjoy the game below are some dlcs that i recommend but only if they re on sale at least 30 off i only recommend dlcs that i have played or know are good tiny living stuff this is a cheap and fun dlc it allows you to build super small houses with compact furniture making it possible to fit 5 to 6 houses on the same lot it s unique and adds a new dimension to the game seasons this dlc adds four seasons with holidays new items and activities it also adds new weather and ways to die pro tip you can kill your simmers really fast in a frozen pool get famous this is a decent dlc for its price especially when it s on sale it s great if you care about fame and money and you need this dlc to become an actor get to work this dlc is a must have as it adds active careers to the game the option to become a store owner and hospital visits cats dogs is the only dlc i own but unfortunately cannot recommend i felt compelled to mention it as it s typically the go to expansion pack for new players and with good reason it was highly regarded in previous sims titles however in the sims 4 it adds little content beyond cats and dogs and is plagued with numerous bugs adopted pets often become stuck leaving players struggling to figure out how to properly care for them in conclusion i like the sims 4 it s more alive in interactions than any of the previous sims games and the building and character creation is user friendly however the cost of dlcs is quite steep and it s frustrating that some of them aren t worth the price
