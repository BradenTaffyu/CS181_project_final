2017 early access review 7 days to die is probably the best zombie survival base defense game out there the mechanics are great you don t need to demolish or move blocks to upgrade your base you can upgrade blocks in place so long as you have the required materials progression makes nighttime more dangerous to the player this forces players to plan their bases accordingly for example running several furnaces and workbenches will attract more zombies to your base this is because 7 days to die uses an actions per area per time feature that most people call a heatmap this can become problematic or not depending on your base design the graphics are good this is especially true if you like the gritty style art textures i am not necessarily a fan of the world textures or character models but it fits with the rest of the game if you re looking for great hd textures and models play rust if you re looking for great pve pvp and base building that doesn t wipe every week or month play 7 days to die
