as someone who has played a lot of card based roguelikes and often felt disappointed by their inability to live up to slay the spire balatro is an impressive breath of fresh air i played the demo for over 40 hours and had high expectations for the game and my expectations were absolutely exceeded i played this game for over 13 hours today this is such a damn good game and i can easily recommend it to anyone who likes card based roguelikes
