2022 nier automata stands out as a truly unique gem in the gaming world and any review of it should strive to capture its essence as i grapple with this task one question looms large how does one do justice to such a magnificent creation without diminishing its brilliance perhaps i should begin by acknowledging that if you consider yourself a gamer if the title gamer holds any significance in your life then you owe it to yourself to experience this game it s as simple as that but for those seeking a deeper dive into my thoughts i welcome you to join me on a journey through my reflections firstly as someone who has played tens of thousands of video games i hold my own standards for what defines a game i am not swayed by hype or the opinions of others my judgment is based on a deep understanding of games and their potential impact when a game like nier automata emerges it becomes a standard bearer for decades to come it transcends the typical boundaries of a video game and stands as a masterpiece in its own right it should not be compared to anything else it existed as a concept before it became a game and that concept continues to resonate whether you are actively playing the game or not the game starts off with a great homage to the typical shoot em up arcade style games and quickly leaves it in some one dimensional alley bam all the way to the big lasers killing off teammates until there s only one paradigmatic hero you and you are the game the creator plays and you will be the main goal of this game s creator for the duration of your playtime welcome to nier automata get trolled hard it will get to you it will make you feel it will make you depressed a lot that is as long as you re mature enough to understand why the beauty of it is that you needn t discuss it with others all that you need to do is simply experience it you re not simply playing a game here you are experiencing it the mere joy of gaming the mere essence of gaming it s here folk use it people say that beauty is subjective but for me beauty is ethereal it is the prevalent beauty of the game s ability to rekindle your imagination for me it clicks and i ve experienced so many games that i consider myself perpetually grumpy nothing s amazing anymore or if it is it s short lived when you combine that with my elitist snobbish outlook the fact i ve played best of the best of games and top it off with my unforgivable demands it s a hard bargain that ll make me really enjoy a game i love the fact that nier automata urges you to think and rethink it is something that happens passively not the story that does it for me it is the atmosphere keeps you longing for that unattainable distance of metaphysical longevity even when it s guarded by nihilist walls of nothingness and you constantly feel like the end boss is hidden in plain sense and that s yoko taro he s playing 4d chess against the player and instantly wins why well partly because of game s beautiful aesthetics and marvelous atmosphere partly because of abundant philosophical concepts written on those empty walls you will congenially take the great ghost of nihilism by hand and the two of you will run around like robin hood and little john nier automata will make you rethink your very own existence several times over you will question how you d like want to live your life you will question everything and nothing and it will keep you puzzled making you sway in deep thoughts of your own introspection but is this game for just about everyone hell no here it stands within a reason do not throw your pearls to pigs game s art a random person would say that this is a typical action rpg the controls and mechanics during melee combat definitely feel that way nothing about this game s intrinsic mechanics stands out as unique or never seen before i know of at least twenty similar arpg some dating from ps1 era the camera will change its focused perspective based on the area you are visiting and it is pleasant this adds to the overall artistic expression too i can t recommend this game enough but at the same time i can t recommend it to the people who are afraid of abstract concepts i also can t recommend it to the people who aren t imaginative or fastidious if you don t find yourself being absorbed in deep thoughts if you lack the wit of a mind imaginative perception or if you re just someone who d like to kill some time kindly pass this game it s not for you go away the way this game played with me as i interacted with it convinced me to add a particular step an addition to my scrutinized standard for defining what i suffer a game should be or at the very least what it ought entertain harmoniously call it nen s consolidation or nen s amalgamation but if it doesn t meet my standards in a very particular way it s only downhill from there there s no cure only the grim judgement i think there s just one more game that made me do that and it was el shaddai ascension of the metatron i can clearly see similarities in camera movement between these two and some of the art choices if you care about the gaming the way i try to then you will surely admit that gaming is a pure art form and i don t just mean about the effort put behind the game s creation no i actually consider the entirety of the gaming world in itself for me that is art we all experience it somewhat differently based on our beliefs teachings and backgrounds yet i can t shake off the feeling that not every game can be called art sad skyrim for instance isn t art for me mods and the community behind as well as what players achieved over the time now that is art but to even plague my thoughts with a comparison of these two feels like i did a great disservice to all the artistic value that nier automata is enriched with it just shows what a marvel a game can be when you have developers behind actually caring for the atmosphere story progression and even finalization good god the amount of layers this game interacts with you is astonishing you will interact with it whether you keep playing it or taking a break the seamless musical progression from a regular fight into asteroid esque hacking scene with the 8bit addition is the stuff of dreams for any old school gamer it feels like a home it s cozy i like it i like it a lot to me this game feels like one of those unique mint vinyls that you d play only on a special occasion fearing that its fragile case might get damaged it remains among my favorites and i d want to preserve it as much as possible i m still playing this game in my mind from my perspective this game should be like one of those obligatory literature subjects you get to learn be advised to not play this game languidly as a player you want to remain receptive to things and ideas that might contradict your own remain glued to this story so that you can recognize all the finesse i d say play it but that d be a terrible understatement do experience it is the keyword here thanks
