2020 i am an engineer by trade never have a played a game that works your problem solving brain to this extent in abstract ways if you count in the hours i ve watched other people play this game when im unable to play myself sometimes while i m at work then i am probably around the 500 hour mark currently don t get me wrong if you are thinking about getting this game prepare yourself for a mild learning curve you will screw your colony up many times as you learn the best way to manage certain problems that arise most of which you have brought on yourself but i promise you that once you get into the swing of things there is hardly a more rewarding and entertaining game on the market today this is a game that is well worth full price but if you can get it 50 off its just a no brainer the steam workshop is well supported and there are also plenty of really great tutorials on youtube of tricks to keep in mind francis john is the best
