i played this game when i was 16 years old it was my very first souls game and provided me with so many amazing times i was heavily depressed at the time but this game became my home and reminded me to never give up no matter how dark things get here i am nearing my 26th birthday and having played all souls games this is the one that will always be special for me i write this as i m reinstalling it if you are doubting if this game is worth your money this is your answer thank you and praise the sun
