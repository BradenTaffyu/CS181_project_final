2015 when i started up fallout 4 i had low expectations of it as i cranked up the difficulty to the hardest level and journey my ways in the new wasteland in my power armor i was kentor wielder of the legendary bladed aluminum baseball bat long story short i ended up where i am today because of my journey the slayers of deathclaw this game is worth a buy if you are new to the series a fallout fan or someone who is ok with changes you will like it otherwise those that hyped it or expected too much out of it please research some more or wait for mods before you do pick up this game it is really damn fun though and i am going for round 2 with mods installed video review at the bottom pros love the skybox and landscape graphic engine itself a bit rusty and could be improved more many quests all over the map looks small but so much to find and explore and discover building a base and settlement is a fun and of course optional character customization adds variation the combat feels much more smooth shooting and melee weapon modding adds variety to weapons armors are now worn in layers much more fun to mix and match gear and stat enemies animations are better than previous game much better voice work the hours i spent exploring and finding easter eggs easter eggs are fun hundreds of mods support already to fix many of the issues players had with the vanilla version the game gets harder as you level up cons the interface being more friendlier to controllers so it was fustrating for a kb and mouse user mod being worked on this dialogue choices only had one word as description to what your character will say mod was just released to show what dialogue are not amazing in terms of the graphics wanted to see even more mod being worked on this some of the quests were decent and some were star quality but overall could had branched out more bugs and glitches of course they re being resolved by patches survival mode lacked actual survival eating and drink to survive mod inc building aspect of the game didn t feel rewarding but is optional in short i don t think i ll have any cons for this game soon as people keep on releasing mods to fix all the issues thats in the game now i think i should make a mod of destructive explosive weapons myself video review youtube video fallout 4 pc game review views 427 forgot to post this a few days ago anyways enjoy it and check out the video at the end i know i went kinda fast on this video but kept it to what i felt needed work and what was great about the
