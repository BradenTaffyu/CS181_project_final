2019 my warhammer 1 review is pretty much applicable here except for one thing don t buy this game unless you have the first warhammer game the standard campaign kinda sucks and doesn t feel good to complete the true draw of this game is the mortal empires campaign it improves a lot of the problems from the first game and brings the sense of scale up to near unimaginable amounts and again we have the dlc problem again but if you only have the second warhammer game you don t really need all the dlc from the first just the game itself to play mortal empires 8 10 make sure you have the first game too get ready for some long waits between turns due to the amount of factions
