2016 i wasn t sure if i would like this game but i gave it a chance and bought it i haven t slept 2 nights in a row after that i ve spent the entire weekend playing it i have no idea what to say about it but it s a very addictive game that you can t stop playing once you start it you will keep telling yourself one more day and the next time you look at your watch it shows that it s 4 00 am now the game has coop too that means that i don t have to spend my weekends farming alone anymore
