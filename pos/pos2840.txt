2019 i played the first original sin game but i didn t like it the combat didn t really draw me in i thought that this genre is simply not for me however when this game came out i didn t pay attention to it since i didn t like the first one but it was on sale and it seemed more interesting so i gave it another shot i m very grateful that i did since this game is way better and more engaging than the first one from the very beginning i struggled with the combat since i m new to the genre and i almost gave up on classic difficulty i considered lowering the difficulty but my stubbornness didn t allow me to do it i got used to it and managed to beat the game thankfully the story is superb and engaging the gameplay is fun once you get the hang of it graphics are beautiful soundtracks are well done the best thing about this game is your decisions and their consequences there is not black and white decision everything depends on your perspective and how you see right and wrong the replayability value is very high since you can play it in various ways anyways i really loved the game and i absolutely recommend it also keep in mind that this genre is not for everyone so look up reviews and videos before purchasing if you are a newcomer just like me
