2020 early access review had my entire fortune poached by wandering looteres most of my men were killed those who weren t died later of starvation and the only one to make it to a town was me where i was promptly ambushed by brigands who let me go because i was too poor at some point i realized i d lived my entire life in poverty misery and eventually i decided to turn my life around i became a blacksmith created some minor works barely making a profit until one day when i made a sword that broke the town s economy everyone wanted my sword in merely a day i d earned enough to purchase largess too grand for even kings then my life so deprived in years gone by was filled but still empty money begets money and violence begets violence eventually when i had conquered the world i knew nothing but stillness my clan was large and thus was my lot eventually life was bleak if a man could have anything would he want for nothing or did it mean he could not desire anything as well then it was 3 am and i realized i had work in the morning all in all ten out of ten would bannerlord again
