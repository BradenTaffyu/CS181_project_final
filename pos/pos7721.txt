2022 early access review if you re into cars as much as me this game is definitely for you thanks to the massive modding community you rarely get bored of this great game i can sit for hours and change things on my car just to make it faster or so i get the grip i need to take a corner at 200km h i think one of the funniest things you can do in this game is just to build stupid fast sleeper cars i know i ve only played 322 hours of this game but i ve been around this game forever my friend got it just when it was released and i have watched him play it a lot it s so impressive to see what the developers have done in a very short amount of time just a few years ago this game did not have as much stuff and features so great appreciation for the team of beamng drive keep the updates coming devs we love what you re doing sincerely yours a car addict
