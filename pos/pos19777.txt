2019 fantastic value at only 20 or 15 for hd owners this is a full fledged remaster with a lot of love put into it far superior to the aoe 2 hd offering if you re interested in playing aoe2 this is the version you should be playing pros classic and great aoe2 gameplay fresh new graphics and animations packed with content includes all prior expansions and a new expansion campaign 4 entirely new civilizations which roughly doubles the content civilizations etc from the original release and expansion tons of campaign content 150 hours 35 civs total more than two dozen campaigns numerous historical battles etc lots of quality of life improvements including on screen control groups default qwerty grid hotkeys can toggle to classic auto reseeding farms improvements to queues numbers telling you how many villagers are gathering each resource and more but nothing that feels like it s dumbing the game down revamped campaigns with new voice acting and thematic polish updated music and sounds camera zoom server based multiplayer instead of terrible p2p connections a bit rough at launch have patience people improved ai new official tutorials to help people ease into online and competitive play new empires war game mode allows for random map style games without the first 7 10 minutes of monotonous sheep herding scouting and boar luring of course rm is still there for the purists cons optimization isn t great and hopefully will be improved it runs completely fine for me on a ryzen 7 and a 1060 gb but a lot of aoe 2 players have potato pcs judging from other reviews if you have a potato pc this release may frustrate you multiplayer was rough at launch but has been rapidly improving i hear there are crossplay issues still but it s been very smooth for me especially in ranked pathfinding could have been improved more tl drwololo
