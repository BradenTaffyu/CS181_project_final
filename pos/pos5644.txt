2020 early access review m b 2 is brilliant and it surpasses its predecessor in almost any manner you could care to mention it s also really far from being finished i ve spend entire days messing with it and i enjoyed my time with it but i wasn t ever really doing anything i hadn t already done in warband apart from commanding troops with some tactical understanding beyond charge which is very welcome don t buy it yet wait another year it s great but it needs a lot more time in the oven
