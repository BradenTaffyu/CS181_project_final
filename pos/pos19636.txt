2019 my review as of 500 600 hours of playtime overall new vegas is one of if not the best fallout game edit 21 feb changed some points to be more precisepros the classic fallout experience fallout fo2 but 3d enjoy the great world of new vegas gambling crime and just people trying to survive in the wasteland a great story which i personally find to be an improved version of the classic fallouts stories open world with many many quests for you to do you won t get bored an actual role playing game very rare these days but fonv provides plenty of ways to roleplay with many builds factions to join or destroy quests to finish in different ways etc cons first 5 hours are basically just detective courier the game until you finally reach vegas although the game does give you a reason as to why you should choose that path not the best but not the worst still you re being forced to do something in an rpg with no real other alternative which is bad the engine sucks i don t think it needs a ton of explanation it s made by bethesda after all also the game looks incredibly ugly without graphical mods although there s tons of them so it really shouldn t be an issue lack of expansion of the legion side of things imho adding more legion territory would make less people think legion man bad and just side with the ncr it would add more depth to the already big debate of the right choice of ending the legion had barely any backstory and content which is a shame they re cool but the reason for it is understandable which is also the next point obsidian were extremely limited on time while making this game which lead to a lot of problems from what i explained here although there s a thriving community of modders which are willing to spend their free time to expand upon the world created by obsidian overall although it definitely has its flaws fallout new vegas still remains the best game i ve ever played 8 5 10 extremely recommended for fans of the original 2 fallouts the engine still sucks ass tho and nobody at bethesda bothered to improve it probably because they re salty this game is better than anything they created made in 1 5th of the timeframe they had for fo4 and such honestly if it werent for the limitations they gave obsidian this could ve easily been a 10 10 and probably would ve been the best fallout game notes i have about 600 hours at the time of writing this review although almost none of them are on steam due to me having a pirated copy of the game i copied from a friend years ago i was and still am broke as so i can t afford to spend money on games i have bought the game now though so it s all good
