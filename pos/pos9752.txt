2022 50 hours in my furthest run so far business is booming but wave after wave of raiders insects and robots keep coming food and meds are low arms and legs are missing along comes a group of travelers they need meds to save their friend all my meds in fact and there s a small chance they ll even give me a couple coins for them on the way out the door i do what any reasonable person would do start checking their weapons and stats to see who i m taking prisoner the rest tend to get offended when you steal their friend but they have sticks we have body armor and assault rifles this group s bigger than the typical 4 5 travelers seems to be about 25 dealing with that many might not be worth the risk that s unfortunate because we could use the reinforcements what a waste it s funny how they run around while staying so clumped together you know what d be hilarious is if i built a wall around them could create a bottle neck or even close it off and start a fire maybe i d get a couple survivors to recruit it works i can t believe it all 25 are trapped in a building surrounded by kindling and don t seem to mind i wonder am i going too far even for a video game na they re little pixel people and we re not surviving the next raid without some reinforcements i light it up the room starts to heat up they begin banging on the walls trying to get out i feel awkward but i also hope those walls hold because this is taking awhile 300 degrees 400 degrees finally one drops then the next pretty soon they re all down i break down the wall and the air rushes in i hope a few survived my 10 colonists rush in to put out the fire and look around 2 visitors are dead 23 are unconscious i couldn t believe it we grab as many as we can carry i m throwing people on the floor in any room with 4 walls 5 to a room some in the freezer some in the barn it s madness everyone s a doctor today even that dopey girl i keep outside because her ugliness and weird voice seem to upset the other colonists this is too many there s no way my food will last i ll choose my favorites and send the rest off to be sold hopefully they make it to the next camp before starving down from 23 to 10 whew way more manageable ugh i forgot to send a crappy one though and the caravan already left well my twisted colonists love a good ritualistic sacrifice and hell they ve earned it after the great work they just did but i m not wasting those valuable kidneys and lungs he won t need those much longer i m multitasking but i queue him up for his operation and let my surgeon do her thing i come back later he s still alive and looks like his organs are in a box in the corner nice but wait a minute who is this this isn t the reject ugh it s my new super soldier on the bed i must have mixed up the directions so disappointing hold on i can fix this he s still under we ll just pop them back in and maybe he won t notice when he wakes up dead this game is ridiculous and i love every second 10 10
