2019 i really think this is a good game with a large learning curve the first thing to learn is basically survival you get through autumn easy if you don t idle around the same spot learn to craft some tools it s not under winter hits that s when you realize there is a lot to learn about survival after surviving all the seasons hopefully with friends you learn there is more content to do such as giants as well new areas including lunar isle now developers always updating so you know this game is always managed balanced and fresh that s how you know the developers care about their game and it s not all about the money worth every cent
