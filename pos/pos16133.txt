2014 early access review when i initially bought this about a year ago i felt ripped off i had paid 15 and the game didn t even work it would constantly ctd with out of memory errors when i ve got 12 gigs of ram and 1 gig of vram which is not the best but entirely functional so i gave it a few months for them to update and iron out the issues and by that time it worked it was well worth the purchase this is a game where you can play pretty much any tabletop game in existence it comes with a few such as chess checkers chinese checkers poker in the style of texas holdem backgammon and several others if you want to play another type of game using the components you can do that there s no rules here it s just the players and the components if someone is losing at chess they can chuck a piece at their opponent in frustration perhaps knocking over the king and a couple pawns if you want to reach over and steal some cards from your opponent s hand you can though you ll probably upset them in the process and they re more than likely to take them back from you if you don t know how to play chess bugger all move with the pieces however you want throw the pieces do whatever this isn t to imply that the community is a bunch of savages that don t care one mote about the rules quite the antithesis i ve found that most people whom sit down to play a game like chess poker or any other game tend to play by the rules of the game they re playing sometimes you have someone who doesn t know the rules and they have to be explained which is fine but every once in a rare while you have the person who gives no damns whatsoever comes in and starts throwing things everywhere and attempting to flip the table ruining the game for everyone else luckily the admin can kick and ban troublesome players so this is seldom a problem in public games and much less so if you re just playing with friends this game is extremly flexible in what it can do one of the things i like to play most with my friends on this is a card game called gin rummy there s not any predefined mode for gin rummy here instead i have to go to a chest which is a tab where the admin can spawn in pretty much anything they want including custom components from here i can spawn in a standard deck of 52 playing cards explain the game to my friends if necessary and go that s all there is to it if you re decent at creating your own images or modelling the game allows you to load in custom cards and pieces and ergo make up your own game with your own rules if you re not then this game has a wonderful steam community workshop feature wherein you can browse other user created games pretty much every board game you can imagine can be found here and this allows for a lot of freedom in what players can actually play most video games are simple they have a set paradigm that the player cannot change or can barely change using mods for example a video game that s designed to be just an uno game or a game designed to be just a chess game are nothing less nothing more they offer the experience they want the player to have and that s it tabletop simulator to an extent has these limitations of course it s not an everything simulator it s a tabletop simulator but that range is extremely broad and within that context you can do whatever you want either using its predefined pieces creating your own or finding some really epic games in the community workshop eels and escalators anyone it s not a game that says do this or else or a game makes you lose half an hour of progress because you completed an objective incorrectly heck it s not even a game with objectives it s just a game that gives you a whole plethora of pieces and says have fun and for that it s one of my all time favourites
