2021 i only played original the sims over twenty years ago that says something about my age doesn t it i didn t think i d ever come back to the series lately i checked out new early access game the tenants which borrows some sims mechanics and that was what reignited my curiosity after so much time many things have already been said about ea s greediness i haven t seen this amount of dlc for any other game i played especially not as overpriced good thing is you definitely don t need all of them many of the stuff packs is just minor cosmetics as far as expansion packs and game packs go below is an exhaustive list of essentials which will make your base game experience richer only first three are a necessity seasons for having well seasons and a calendar of events throughout the yearcats dogs if you d like four legged friends run around your house and neighbourhoodparenthood catered to family oriented players provides deeper mechanics for raising your in game childrenlaundry day adds the aspect of having to clean your clothes extends gameplay immersionnifty knitting one additional activity for your sims very cute perfect patio useful stuff for decorating house outsidejuggling between ea play subscription steam bundle offers and major sale events happen 2 3 times a year you can complete your desired set much cheaper than the asking price other dlc can be looked into every now and then it s definitely not needed all at once from the beginning as a person who only played the sims back in 2000 i quite like this fourth instalment in 2021 i know it s already seven years old and it took a long time for it to be where it is right now non overwhelming interface responsive controls fairly big selection of build buy items lately maxis added over 1000 new colour swatches to over 120 base game items game works great on ssd gtx1060 and a five year old cpu steam integration is flawless origin starts quickly in the background and shuts down automatically right after you close the game i could only wish for steam achievements i like that this game can be played in so many ways shoutout to all you fantastic builders out there but also in terms of using not using cheats or creating different starting scenarios i like sims traits aspirations and whims which add more to the gameplay i very much like the inclusivity the one aspect that surprised me the most in a positive way is gardening i also love the overall sense of humour not only in regards to gardening how about growing that cowplant anyone or maybe a money tree is more up your alley huh be warned once you re hooked three hours of your real life will fly by like an hour and this is still an understatement as for the product itself choose your purchase timings wisely so you don t go bankrupt irl happy simming 8 10
