2022 got it for free on microsoft store from amazon prime but decided to buy it here for 10 i normally have a bethesda blacklist up but dammit this is fallout sort of after what 4 years since launch it s actually not bad it sort of feels like fallout 4 at times but you quickly realize the grind here has increased the online aspect of the game can help carry you through the grind as it s actually quite a nice game to just log in and do whatever you want team up do quests farm or build i think you actually get a lot here for your 10 sale price the optional monthly fee tier is a joke that i cant imagine anyone paying for my biggest complaint by far here the lag the combat feels like 56k dial up quake 2 back in the day and its always laggy just killing ghouls they always react about 3 4ths of a second late to your guns or melee attacks i really cant believe this feels so bad and that i ve never seen other people talk about this its a damn shame i find that melee especially is complete trash now and the longer distance shooting you are doing the less you will notice i m mainly shotgunning right now and it s just barely tolerable but it leads to me firing an extra shell i didn t need to because the enemy is still seemingly alive because the death animation is lagged overall a good freeform chillout and screw around game for the time being don t expect a story on par with f4 or a story even half as good as fallout new vegas lvl76 character follow up after 55 hours i really think people who are still bashing this game as a solid thumbs down are just engaging in mob mentality the biggest complaint i see is the 1200lb inventory limit i wish they d consider that your fallout 4 saves would get quite massive in size and a limit for the sake of the serverspace is not too unreasonable you are really given a lot here for a free game or a 10 sale price on steam it s pretty damn generous if the inventory limit bothers you i suspect if you actually looked in your stash you would not be able to justify all the garbage you have hoarded and you can sell most of the broken down garbage by bulking it up with excess plastic as wrapping and selling it to the vendors i sold probably 900lbs in steel scrap i didn t realize i accumulated and now my inventory space has breathing room again i will be making it more efficient by selling other garbage this is really a stupid hill to die on bash the game for it s scripting and physics bugs and other typical bethesda don t bash it for a totally understandable serverside limit besides that i just wanted to say the grind actually has dramatically loosened since the stat lvl cap of 50 reading a few character build guides helps i am just obliterating most enemies now with my gauss shotgun and my well optimized perks and setting my mutations permanent with the specific luck perk everyone goes for i have yet to even decide on power armor and i may not bother i prefer mobility and stealth it felt like a long road to lvl50 and then it felt like hitting lvl76 went by at 6x speed the endgame content is surprisingly reasonable yes if you want specific armor sets you are gonna need a lot of gold bricks by doing a lot of public events as they occur i am still an asset to teams now without the elite armors bethesda is still on my list but for now i commend them on fixing a game after 4 years but i really hope the ip eventually either leaves their hands or they finally just switch to unreal or something else as an engine because the game has no excuse to run as bad as it does in some areas especially when it s using only 30 of my cpu gpu lvl105 follow up dear lord there s basically nothing left worth doing it was a fine ride i guess but this definitely doesn t have mmorpg lasting appeal
