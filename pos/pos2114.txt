for the record i waited until a sale to pick the game up gold edition and gifted some friends the base edition would i recommend payday 3 yeah it s a solid base of a game but that s also kind of where the issues lie the game feels like the rough edges of payday 2 got sanded off even if it ended up making rough edges elsewhere the skill system isn t as deep as 2 s there s no perk decks yet weapons need to level for you to buy and equip mods which is fine i hated it during the beta but now it kind of promotes variety in your weaponry and thank almir s beard for it you level up from doing heists like how it should ve been now the biggest gripes that i m aware of from the community is lack of skill depth the armor system and low heist count the skills requiring some form of buff activation and maintaining those buffs edge grit rush is kind of annoying and weird until you realize that payday 2 also did that system it just was more diverse and unique while in 3 it s been streamlined there s also adrenaline a newly added buff but i ll get to that later the armor system is afaik the most contentious matter of the game your armor is split into chunks with chunks able to be broken once broken you need to use a armor plate bag to recover the broken chunk or if the chunk has only been damaged you can use an armor repair kit one of the three consumables in the game technically 4 but donut worry about it on paper it s a system that makes it so you can t stay in a heist indefinitely in practice most of the active community hates it i m fine with it it s also possible to basically bypass having to deal with armor with the current skills available is it ideal not really but i don t mind the system mostly now the heist count currently as of writing we have 14 heists there were 8 at launch called core heists we were given 3 free heists two remakes of pd2 heists and one new heist and we have 3 dlc heists available soon to be 4 so after almost a year of being on the market the game will have 15 total heists maybe 16 if the devs toss in a sneaky free heist with the dlc anniversary update payday 2 launched with 11 heists some of which were multi day heists which the community also hated which is why pd2 would later drop the multi day heists and why pd3 has none so if there s those three big gripes why do i still recommend the game cause it s fun i poured in hundreds of hours into payday 2 but having done most heists including most except for one or two dlcs some close to maybe hundreds of times i m kinda good with not playing payday 2 again and that s the unfortunate reality of payday 3 pd2 has 50 heists spread across a decade of service patching fixes monetization changes and more payday 3 has crossplay and for the first time the devs might actually maintain the console versions instead of abandoning them like they did with payday 2 twice the game is compromised to hell and back due to it being a sequel on ue4 i haven t forgotten about ovktwd you bastards and probably having some publisher mandates the company as a whole almost going bankrupt and design decisions that feel aimless i still like it though it does evolve some of the ideas and concepts of payday 2 so it is a true sequel and the stealth got expanded upon and is actually a lot of fun to interact with honestly there s a lot of complaints i could be contrarian towards some fair complaints and others being entirely hollow ultimatums that are subjective as heck however the favor system sucks i ll admit that the favor system needs an overhaul i don t want to grind heists for a random chance to make stealthing gold sharke less of a pain in the ass let me buy them for c stacks also the difficulty modifiers are interesting but annoying for stealth specifically uhm yeah that s it a stream of conciousness review i apologize to anyone who may have struggled to make sense of this review but long story short the game is not as bad as the review score says it is ovktwd is deserving of that vitriol anyway get gold edition on sale for the dlcs only the host needs the dlc heists for players to play them so just like pd2
