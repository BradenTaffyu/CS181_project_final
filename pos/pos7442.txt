2022 early access review live laugh sail n n my thoughts story line is fun as there are some creative puzzles on islands that are different from your normal spawn islands beyond the game play though it can get a bit dry but hey your imagination is limitless crafting is realistic and easy to learn graphics and sound is pretty good spawn for trash should align with the amount of foundations or resources used for the raft or else it will be a very loooong grind if you re planning to have a big build like me more automation would be appreciated but i think as new chapters get added perhaps there will be increasing the amount of collectables and or decorations would make the game more hands on with more variety increasing the wildlife that you can capture and or hunt would also make the game more enjoyable instead of hunting and capturing the same animals a lot of these are me just being nit picky and after spending countless hours playing this game it s still 10 10 in my books and worth the grind when you get to see your amazing designs play out
