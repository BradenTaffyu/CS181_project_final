2019 early access review truly an amazing game crash physics are awesome car handling physics traction body roll slight damage to steering components can alter how a car handles are fantastic crazy amounts of mods for cars terrains addons only thing i can see people maybe getting bored with is there s no career or nothing to work towards but if you re like me and could play something like gta driver for hours on end just messing around driving different stuff and making up you re own scenarios etc differently worth a buy feel like iv e waited a lifetime for a game like this using pure imagination
