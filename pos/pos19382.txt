2022 now i see why people hate fallout 4 fallout 4 itself is not a bad game it s just fallout new vegas is simply a masterpiece and that makes fallout 4 looks bad true sandbox rpg game with many locations to explore choices with real consequences you are exploring an interactive world your choices to an interactive world matter and factions people will like your actions or dislike them main storyline is simply outstanding there are so many things which i wanna speak about the main storyline which i could write all day also you can debate about it all day factions and characters have their own goals and desires background character stories being explained with in game dialogues makes you feel like reading a book so much detail about characters you meet and characters you don t meet using the imagination for past events that happened in game by simply reading characters dialogues in detail on how it happened is truly amazing and it is the reason this game exceed my expectations combat is meh crashes exists but not so often as they say on the internet dlcs can be ignored expect the divide p s i didn t use any mods for my playthrough if you are a story type gamer you ll surely enjoy this game at its maximum
