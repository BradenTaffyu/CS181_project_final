2021 early access review i see a whole bunch of complaints about it being unfinished which yes i understand but tell me the truth you re really gonna go back to warband and suffer those terrible sieges and character animations that right there is the only reason i will never go back to warband sure does bannerlord have its problems yes is development taking a long time yes do i care about any of that no why because its still a good game i rarely run into bugs anymore and when i do run into issues with a patch i let the game sit for two months and try again guess what warband isn t a better game you re just being nostalgic 10 10 would butter the princess buns again
