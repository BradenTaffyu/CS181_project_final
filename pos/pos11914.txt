dead cells was never the game i wanted but it was the game i needed originally i got this game recommended by a friend of mine and after taking a small leap of faith and deciding to buy it i could have never been more glad about any other recommendation than this one simply put the game is amazing and with all its different weapons thousands of different builds as well as randomly generated maps it basically has an infinite replay value as you will never ever run out of things you can have fun with progression can be slow and frustrating at times i managed to beat the true final boss of the game after 150 hours or so but sharpening your skills learning from your mistakes and mastering the game up to the hardest difficulty feels like a journey and is a very memorable experience as of right now no other game comes even close to the almost 400 hours of playtime i have put into dead cells at the time of writing it s really a shame that the dedicated devs at evil empire dev studio got betrayed by motion twin publisher studio so there won t be any updates anymore but even then dead cells is the definition of a perfect game and 10 10 100 10 1000 10 anyways what are you even doing here still go buy the game already you doofus
