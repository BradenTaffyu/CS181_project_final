2019 i am so glad they ditched whatever system they were trying to put together in thrones of britannia this installation of total war is absolutely phenomenal with a steep learning curve that is made pretty user friendly via excellent tutorial this game brings city management character management and army builds to a whole new level there s a large gap between the kind of game this and previous historical total wars but this time unlike tob that gap is perfectly executed and fine tuned into a game that has removed my skepticism of future total wars all together now if only we could get them to remake medieval 2
