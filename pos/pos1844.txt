2017 quite literally goty 2017 if not one of the most memorable games i have played in quite some time nier automata sets you in a depressing world where you feel deep grievance through every quest and story as you progress all the while getting cheap shotted through 4th wall breaking humor along the way with a story and world set by yoko toro and gameplay from platinum game studios the blend mixes best together creating a enjoyable experience on a plot and gameplay front just like the first nier which is highly suggested to play first you ll be required to beat the game mutiple times with different interactions and story related events unfolding the more you progress through the world with different sets of characters the soundtrack is also one of the best collections ive heard from a videogame never wanted to skip a track and always happy to hear that familiar sound when i reach an area i really cant express how much i loved this game even with the few flaws it has defintalty an experience you should enjoy also
