2014 i used to think no game could come close to how good fallout 3 was but all my friends would say to me you bought fallout new vegas collector s edition on launch day why haven t you played it yet it s so much better than fallout 3 and how right they are fallout new vegas is a first person shooter role playing game survival horror game developed by obsidian entertainment and is set in a post apocalyptic western united states an area largely untouched by the events of the great nuclear war of 2077 you are a courier delivering messages around the wasteland and have been assigned to deliver a package containing something very special unfortunately you are captured package stolen and left for dead in the wasteland what happens next will eventually determine the fate of the thousands inhabiting the mojave desert for years to come the huge open world of fallout new vegas is well constructed and very atmospheric i found however that it feels slightly less interesting than fallout 3 in fallout 3 you would worry all the time about what is around the next corner in new vegas the landscape at first looks fairly flat and uninteresting is this a fault of the game or is it to be praised for being authentic to the area in which it is set i have friends that have visited las vegas and they tell me yes the area around las vegas is pretty much how it looks in the game which ever way you look at it you ll get lost in the atmosphere in no time the ambience and music gives the game a great western vibe as well at the nicely crafted musical score which also includes tracks from fallout 1 and 2 for added nostalgia the world is also not immediately open to the player going north is pure suicide early on in the game so the player is encouraged to explore the south before venturing north by closing off certain areas to the player early on i found that it really helps to emphasize just how much of a dangerous place the mojave wasteland really is and it increased my wanting to explore those areas later once i got some better gear the plot in fallout new vegas however is a lot more open and is better written than fallout 3 right up until the very end of the game you have total freedom to choose your own path in the world the story also doesn t take itself as seriously as fallout 3 does the characters you meet situations you are put in and overall tone of the game is lighter funnier and doesn t centre around one specific key character you have a world an event is happening in that world get going and help shape what happens the game mechanics are deep very very deep there are almost system shock 2 levels of complexity in this game it keeps pretty much all of fallout 3 s fps rpg elements and statistical goodness everyone has come to expect from a fallout game but also re introduces mechanics from fallout 1 and 2 back into the mix damage threshold and damage resistance are back and really well implemented into the combat i learnt pretty quickly that it is futile to chip away at a creature s thick hide or somebody s metal armour with a 9mm pistol you re going to need the right gun for the right situation which means thinking on your feet guns can also degrade in quality over time and depending on what ammo you use which means keeping your gear in top condition is very important the game also allows you to create your own food and ammunition different types of ammo will require different components you can get from either de constructing existing ammo or finding them in the mojave and will affect different opponents in different ways use 12 gauge slug rounds to pierce through armour or use 12 gauge dragon s breath rounds to set squishy things on fire the game introduces an optional hardcore mode which amongst other things requires you to eat drink and sleep in order to stay alive ammunition has weight to it and getting health from stimpaks occurs over time it will drastically change the way you think about approaching situations and provide you with a more survival horror type experience not only all this but your actions will affect people s opinions of you do good things and people in that region town or faction will like you and will come to your aid in times of need do bad things and expect to be hated shot at and have general abuse hurled at you i ve only scratched the surface of what the game can do here but now it s time to talk about the downloadable content that the game contains there are four packs and they all differ widely in settings and theme but they all tie together cleverly to create one big story to play through dead money dlc holy crap this is one atmospheric ride you are sent to uncover the secrets of the sierra madre and i can t say much more as anything else would be a spoiler this is probably the creepiest dlc out of the four it s bursting with places to explore and things to find anyone who finds that a lot of fallout new vegas feels quite empty and void of small detail in a lot of places will have nothing to complain about here great characters and very nicely paced with amazing atmosphere honest hearts dlc you are hired to travel with the happy trails caravan to utah s zion national park this is the first of the dlcs to give the player an open world to explore the world is once again very nicely crafted with real attention to detail but unfortunately it suffers from being quite boring story wise it s nice to meet characters that aren t your average wasteland survivors though but sadly most are largely forgettable and the story can go out with either a small pop or a whimper depending on what you want to do old world blues dlc this is probably the funniest and most bizarre dlc made for new vegas it was even nominated for a best dlc award this is a real turn around from honest hearts hilarious from start to finish incredibly well written story and characters a new huge open area to explore perfect pacing and the dlc will prove a real challenge for players of all skills absolutely worth playing and taking your time with lonesome road dlc the final dlc and it is something quite special this is really worth playing if like me you disliked the game giving you a character that was both a blank slate and had some kind of past that was a complete mystery this will definitely fill in some of those blanks and make the courier more interesting it s a return to a linear world like operation anchorage but it is so full of more interesting places to see and things to do you will find yourself backtracking to either find all the hidden secrets or opening up new areas but a lot of the time it s worth doing there are cool set pieces which is a must for this kind of dlc and what happens to you and or others at the end is amazingly good a great end to an impressive series of dlc with all of the praise i ve given the game it has its faults bugs mainly there are a few hanging around and whilst they aren t game breaking they can range from floating objects to random crashing to desktop another issue depends on your point of view the game falls into the same trap fallout 3 fell into by letting the player level up too much and becoming too powerful making most of the rpg elements like speech checks largely pointless an rpg isn t an rpg any more when you re good at everything i m already planning my next play through of fallout new vegas and after playing it it makes fallout 3 a very hard game to go back to fallout new vegas is just an all round better game despite it s small flaws and if you enjoyed fallout 3 i urge you get your hands on this as soon as possible hundreds of hours of enjoyment guaranteed recommended mods jsawyer and mission mojave use these to make your game a better rpg and fix over 27 000 in game bugs
