2022 early access review this game is to my wide experience foundational to the understanding of games as both an art form and a recreational activity there is no game that i play that i cannot find something i wouldn t replace with a mechanic or aesthetic from qud there are very few games i would preserve as representational of actual development in the medium this is the number one on that list buy it even if you never play it simply as an act of respect to the artists that have birthed such a wondrous functional work
