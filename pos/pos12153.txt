2015 dont even call it a game because it s not this is a tool for training how to drive real race cars at fast speeds profesional drivers use iracing to learn a race track that they may have never been to in real life yet weeks in advance of traveling there in real life dale earnhardt jr is one of those professional drivers who has attested to having done exactly that iracing is so accurate to real life that the same cracks bumps and grooves that are in the pavement that you can see on t v and see in the famous indianapolis raceway are there in iracing in exact detail down to the milimeter they use laser scanning to make an identical copy of the real track so tracks that maybe have small banking on a 90 degree turn in real life you might race that same track in forza or asseto corsa and be forced to take that turn way slower than in real life thus negatively affecting your lap times and you cannot compare your lap times in whatever car you just drove on that track to the professionals who drive that track in that identical car in real life whereas with iracing you can take a lap time at say daytona speedway in an actual gen 6 nascar racecar or indy car and then compare it to any real nascar or indy driver s real qualifying time on that track in that same car in real life to see how you stack up no other racing game here on steam can make that claim and truely back it up time after time on track after track so i say again dont go thinking this is a game because this if anything is a way for you to develop real life skills that you could take into a real life race car and start a racing career with if you dont believe it look up iracings world champions many of them have done exactly that and used iracing as a launchng point for their real life racing career s so basically if you like arcade style racing games but dont like watching competitive motorsports in real life wishing you could be the guy or girl driving that car at 200 plus miles an hour then iracing may not be for you and the reason i say this is in iracing there is no rewinding time if you hit a wall or something theres no buying parts upgrades theres no cheat codes or turbo boost button and if you dont have a steering wheel and aren t prepared to race the way a real driver would race then you will seriously be having a hard time with it when you rise out of your rookie license s in both road and oval racing although every once in a while people on x box controlers can do quite decently but it takes a lot longer to get good at mastering an x box s joystick to get through a particular turn s apex without missing a beat and to be comepletely honest here most of the people i ve talked to who started out on x box controllers like that immediately went and bought a steering wheel and pedals which despite being a bit of an investment you need to remember you re investing in real life skills you can use every day to drive safer or even take these skills into a real race car in real life so is that worth a few hundred dollars you bet it is one thing i learned early on in my still very young iracing career which was something so obvious i completely facepalmed myself once i truely realized that i was so naive to believe it and this was how i ve been subconciously trained over the years without realizing it that all these movies and arcade style racing games make you think that you can just floor the gas pedal through a wreck and things like touching a wall with the front fender does no damage to the car or driving alongside another car and you bump his left rear fender and nothing happens whereas in real life the wreck that you would cause could be catastrophic to all cars involved and in those games and movies you catch the competition pretty fast if you fall behind because they have catch up speed toggle able or if theres a wreck up ahead you can just floor the gas pedal and push the other cars out of your way and in iracing none of that is true this is real deal real life racing against real drivers some of whom race on weekends at their local track in real life and have years of training over your skills and you must drive as competitively as you can without making contact with other cars walls as best you can touch a wall and spin out and cause damage to your car if that happens you can t just expect to pull a manuever like when playing need for speed and pull back out onto the track and race right back up to first place your damage has real affects on your engine performance wheel alignment and aerodynamics if all of that car isn t in pristine condition you are severely hindering yourself and in most cases a pit in or towing all the way back into the pits is necessary and just be prepared that in rookies you will see it happen multiple times per race where someone will spin cause a wreck with another car and then get back and keep going not realizing that the now damaged car they are driving is slower and now a danger to others as they try to pass that damaged car at high speed now as for pricing there are those who complain about the price but the prices they charge aren t to line their pockets with money like these 60 dollar a game arcade style racing games when iracing charges you the minimum price that they can give you a bunch of free content with your first purchase of the service and even allow your races to contribute to your store credit they do all of that just so after you pay about 40 dollars to get started with iracing you have pretty much all the tracks and cars you need to compete for a few months without having to pay anything else but when iracing charges me 11 95 for a car that i want to race that season 14 95 for a track i happily pay that because iracing is setup to charge each driver the minimum it can in order for our purchases of those cars and tracks to fund the development of future tracks and cars so imagine like me you live on a disability income and since like me you live near laguna seca or whatever real life track near you that you wished you could ve competed at you ve wished your whole life you could get into racing profesionally but like me despite your parents wanting to get you into the sport couldn t afford it for you when you were young now picture for roughly 40 bucks and the price of a decent steering wheel and pedal setup i can take a porsche out on that track and finally live that dream and finally for much cheaper than it costs to drive a real racecar i can learn and study from professional drivers i can even race against real pro s if i keep practicing and get good enough about a year ago a 17yr old kid who won the iracing championship nascar series is now announced plans to get into racing in real life and he s only been racing in iracing for 5 or 6 years and it shows that this isnt some game to go play to unwind this is a severely competitive adrenaline rush inducing simulation of the real thing in closing the rule of thumb you can apply to both real life racing and iracing is that much like real life racing the competitive level is real no other racing game or any video game i have ever played has ever truely given me butterflies just from the level of sheer excitement you get in a rolling start before that green flag drops especially since you are being given the opportunity to drive against people who are just as fast or if not faster than you are no other racing game or even regular computer game has ever been able to truely provide that butterflies in the stomach feeling to drivers and gamers alike not in the way that iracing does and i can attest to it having nearly 200 steam games that despite it being a bold statement it is 100 true
