2014 early access review 7 days to die is one of those games that you want to share with friends who have never played before and let them experience its awesomeness with you it s a voxel based survival crafting tower defense game that touches on gameplay similar to minecraft and fallout 3 at first i was quite apprehensive about this game mostly because of it s poor reviews and at that time the price i nabbed it when it was on sale then learned that the developers had lowered the price indefinitely as i played exploring immense landscapes learning crafting recipies and adapting nighttime survival strategies i began to wonder why this game had gotten such poor reviews i know now that i should have bought this game long ago even at its high price i have enjoyed watching 7 days to die s progress more than any other early access game i have played up to this point i ve found myself on more than one occasion reading players conflicting suggestions and complaints then come next update realize that the developers had actually listened to that constructive criticism and developed a method to try to satisfy everybody you can adjust different settings to cater to your specific preferences and difficulty even after you have started your game if it gets too easy just bump up the zombie spawn rate or vice versa i wouldn t recommend this one to gamers who have no patience for early access bugs don t expect glitch free bliss with this one but the pros highly outweigh the cons judging by what i ve seen the game progress to i have a good feeling that for us patient gamers who appreciate meaningful development the end product will be well worth it
