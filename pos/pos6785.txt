2017 i think it is about time that i post a review for this game hands down this is my favorite game of all time and i just never get bored of it you can just sit down relax and travel across the europe in the truck of your choice with all the hours i have put into this game i ve only explored like 85 of the whole map had 100 but then i bought all of the map expansion dlc s i find this games achievements very interesting and hard to do at the same time as i m hunting for all of them but now since they released the heavy cargo dlc there are even more achievements to hunt it is like a never ending story but i enjoy it alot i wish that scs software did more frequent updates on the stuff that the community has been wanting requesting for a while but they are a small company so i can t bash on them for that i will support their game no matter what we all want more free content and roads to explore for the game but i completely understand why they release paid dlc for the game plus when you buy it it is endless hours of play time i have only had the chance to play the game on a keyboard mouse but trust me it is just as enjoyable as using any other input method can t wait to get my hands on a proper steering wheel for some more fun there is really not much to say about the game it has it s own pros and cons but other than that the game is great i hope you enjoy it just as much as i do best game of all time happy trucking bigyeet123
