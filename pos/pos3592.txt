2021 omori is a psychological horror roleplaying game which should be experienced with little to no prior knowledge of its story it tackles dark topics which include depression anxiety and suicide as per warnings as such this review will be avoiding anything that would be deemed too much of a spoiler past the first hour of the game but i would highly recommend playing the game yourself first what omori does extremely well with its storytelling is the gradual buildup from the foundation up you know that the game is a psychological horror with topics like depression anxiety and suicide but you have no idea how and when they fit into the story while everything may seem cheerful and upbeat in the beginning you will slowly be shown pieces of the other side which recurs throughout the game this leaves a lot of mystery in the beginning allowing room for speculation on what is happening around you however a clearer picture does form quite literally the further you get into the game and leads to a great climactic ending that pays off all the buildup as a story that heavily revolves around the characters present in the game omori does an amazing job at having a cast of characters that you can really care about and can also relate to they all have their own unique personality albeit exaggerated which fits in with the grand scheme of things you will be able to see the character dynamic they have with one another and how they change throughout the story given the situation one big thing omori hits home on is if you can relate to the main character through its portrayal of depression anxiety and suicide the game does a great job revolving around how those topics can have a lasting impact that is not to say that you must have experienced those emotions before to love omori but it can be extremely relatable to those who have the story and characters in omori are brought together by the visual and auditory charm the game exerts all the soundtracks are bangers and fit their respective occurrences ranging from relaxing exploration music to intense boss battle themes that go hard they are definitely memorable especially the ones at key moments throughout the game that will leave you thinking about them in the future as for the artstyle the pencil drawing the game uses has a unique charm to it that really fits with the story and characters in omori it was always great to see it during combat and cutscenes omori s combat is in the form of a turn based rpg which was a genre i was not the biggest fan of that being said i found the combat to be pretty enjoyable regardless as it had a decent amount of variety in what you could do with it there are emotion states for your characters and enemies which added a layer of strategy to plan for and play around this is on top of the various skills and equipment you would unlock throughout the game rewarding you for exploring the world one thing that really kept my attention with the combat was the pencil artstyle the characters and their varying expressions were always a joy to see especially when they were at different emotional levels the attacks you have were also great in that sense like the headbutt s animation if there was one thing to criticize about the game omori it is the pacing issue it has oftentimes i found areas to be drawn out a bit too long especially when trying to interact with everything in the game it can feel nonsensical at times when it is not directly related to the main story but i was personally fine with it as you were introduced to more side characters and soundtracks this will become an issue though if you decide to run the game again for alternate endings and or going for a full completion as the combat starts getting old alongside the pacing issues i really enjoyed playing through omori and it is a game i will be remembering for a long time it has had quite the impact on me through the story it tells and also the message it ultimately delivers and i have been thinking about it the past few days this was a rollercoaster of emotions throughout the game and it was a blast to experience the highs and lows with the main cast of characters i would definitely recommend this game in a heartbeat thank you for reading my review
