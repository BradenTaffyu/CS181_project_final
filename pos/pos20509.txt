2020 after finally unlocking the last of the achievements i m now writing up a very late positive review for this game this game is a classic in its own right it is a very simple tower defense game where you have anywhere from 6 to 5 rows of combat to place your towers nothing more the stages change from just simple grass to darkness with fog to the backyard with a pool this changes the type of plants you can set or the type of strategy you may need but overall there is much fun to be had in this tower defense classic my only gripe for the game is that you can t fast forward to hurry to the end of the level as sometimes once your towers are set it can feel really slow as you await the rest of the level to play out but you get crazy dave a memorable song and still more to do as you get the bonus games and gardens to play with if you ever missed plants vs zombies you should definitely check it out because of the impact that it made to the genre but it is also still a blast to play even after the many years have passed
