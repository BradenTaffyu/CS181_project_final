2018 i have to admit the first time i played this game i was so confused and uninstalled mainly because the graphics sucked then years later i gave it a second try because my friend recomended it to me after playing then 90 hours on a not official gameversion i bougth the game in steam and played another 150 hours the learning curve is great you have totaly freedoom of what you are doing in the game if you play as a woman noone takes you seriously like in real life i like it you can trade slaves which was for me the only source of income runs on every pc costs litteraly nothing nowadays you can get a key for less than 5 graphics are not the best ai is sometimes very bad
