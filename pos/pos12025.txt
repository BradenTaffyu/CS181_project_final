2022 excellent game 10 10 pure gameplay and it s highly addictive and fun initially i wanted to deduct points for lack of story but then i reevaluated my stance on that this game is not about the story or a story it has minimal story it s just pure gameplay and in it s genre it s one of the best that i have played visually it s very beautiful also soundtrack is not too shabby either i saw that the game tries to compares itself to castlevania sotn symphony of the night and it really shouldn t and no one should first of all sotn is one of the best games ever made plus it s not roguelike it s just a solid action adventure rpg platformer with one of the best soundtracks ever composed for a video game immaculate enemy boss designs beautiful story and to top that off it s made by konami which is one of the best developers on the planet with deep pocket for production costs and well it s just castlevania and most likely the best castlevania game that has ever been made so you can t really compare these two games at all it s like comparing apples with oranges but to be fair in it s own genre it s one of the best games made in the last decade or so i have more than 50 hours on it initially i was family sharing it from my brother s library since he had it and i saw no point in paying for it again until i realized that none of his dlcs even the free one are family shareable plus i decided that a studio that came up with this gem should have some of my money so they can have more for their next game s production budget which i will be looking forward to so after already playing it for 50 hours i went ahead and purchased the game the dlc bundle for myself also i want to support this studio so hopefully they can keep churning out games that are at least this good again and hopefully much much better with the larger budget that they should now have anyhow to sum things up it s pretty much a perfect game and it s cheap so are the dlcs one is free so just go ahead and buy the the whole bundle and if you really like the soundtrack buy that too so that these guys can keep making more games like these to entertain us
