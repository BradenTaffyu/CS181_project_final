2022 early access review still cannot believe this game is still early access as it feels very complete and impressively stable but i m looking forward to seeing whatever new additions the devs are planning for us takes a special gaming interest to enjoy this game as it is more of a critical thinking planning type of game especially as you start rapidly increasing productivity rather than an action combat fast paced type game my only issue with the game is the lack of a sense of purpose during the end game phase the final piece of research to complete the game takes only 4k universe matrix and this happens when there s still several hundred thousand matrix worth of research left to do and you don t even need to complete a dyson sphere to win the game it did not feel satisfying when i got an average popup for research complete saying i won the game you go through so much work and grinding during the initial phases and at the end of the day it becomes more of a self driven game where you have to set your own production goals if you want to keep going even though there are still massive technology upgrades to go through during the post completion phase of the game this particular issue could possibly be overcome if the final mission objective could be harder to achieve with a much higher universe matrix count in such a way that you are effectively forced to increase production dramatically using all available tech upgrades and harness power from more than one star system in order to speed things up thinking possibly 100k or even 1m universe matrix other possibility could be add a new gaming system like survival modes etc but that s a much more complicated thing to add so i ll leave that to the devsoverall though game is totally worth it
