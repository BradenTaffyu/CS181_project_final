2017 the short version imagine if fallout 3 was a fallout game instead of a technical upgrade on elder scrolls 4 populated by orcs and extras from mad max sighs ok fine there s a lot more going on in new vegas than just fixing the myriad issues with fallout 3 s story gameplay presentation and challenge scaling fallout new vegas has a lot more in common with fallout 2 and black isle studios canceled fallout van buren than it does with bethesda s fallout 3 while it s built on the same fps rpg hybrid engine utilizing the familiar vats aiming system and generally similar character modeling technology fallout new vegas restores the quality standard of storytelling and world building characteristic of the original two fallout games if you aren t familiar with fallout 1 and 2 in summary a key dynamic of the main fallout series has always been forcing the player to decide how his or her character reacts during situations where two opposing philosophies are in conflict both of which having some kind of valid standpoint conversation awareness exploration and critical thinking are just as vital to progress as strategic combat and character building this is where fallout new vegas really shines as a post nuclear role playing game as opposed to a first or third person shooter with rpg elements not surprisingly therefore fallout new vegas has a curious blend of open ended exploration and structured branching narrative the story centers around the courier the player s character who awakens after being shot and buried alive waking up in a doctor s office in a small town it is left mostly to the player to decide how to proceed making his or her way across post nuclear nevada in search of revenge or perhaps just answers eventually the courier will find themselves as the deciding factor in a conflict between several distinct incompatible but equally valid philosophies and the people or factions who are representative of them this is a very simplified summary of the game s progression because it really is a story best experienced for yourself being that it is built on the same engine as fallout 3 a number of bugs and glitches persist even after numerous updates and patches obsidian studios has been pretty fastidious about post release support even up to the release of the unofficial project nevada modification offering a more extreme survival mode experience but with a game of this scale and subtlety it s impossible to catch everything even after half a decade following the release there s literally no player that i wouldn t recommend fallout new vegas to long time fans of the series will feel right at home players of fallout 3 and 4 will find a familiar but much more full bodied experience complete newcomers can use this as an introduction to an amazing setting and even people who typically don t play story driven games might find that new vegas is the gateway game that will have them craving more the only players i think i couldn t recommend fallout new vegas to are people who have already decided that they prefer fallout 3 or 4 before having played 1 2 or new vegas you guys i got nothing for ain t that a kick in the head
