2022 this game has been surprising i mainly got it for the graphics on sale to see what the fuss was about i didn t like gow3 couldn t play more than 2 minutes of it and in my 40s the whole me god me kill all kind of fell in the same bucket of boring as the film 300 with trepidation i started this game testing out graphics drivers and proton and a ps5 controller i can say it wasn t at all what i was expecting or to be clear it is definitely that same me god must kill all aspect if that s all you want but it s mostly a feeling of a game that has matured with us the son is hilarious parodying the absurdity of kratos it is a very intriguing story not a lust for power or a silly revenge arc at least not so far i can say it work magnificently with a rtx3090 on a 7 year old pc running debian 11 testing using proton ge 7 33 on nvidia driver version 515 76 you can find an easy install guide on a non nvidia blog seriously nvidia why ur website sucks so much just remember to turn on v sync it smoothes out vulkan loads which really only happen rarely in the game gorgeous freaking gorgeous graphics in scenes i showed the witches house to the gf and she was blown away with how pretty the garden was games have sure come a long way since golden axe that s all i ll say i thought i wouldn t play games anymore as i grew older even though i knew games are becoming the next stage of story telling vehicle i just thought it wouldnt keep pace but boy the visuals here feel so much better than any marvel film and the story is really really nice it made me actually enjoy taking down trolls again it made me remember why i used to love computer games so much and to be honest reminded me why i loved research in quantum information for my phd silicon valley kind of was a huge bummer because it s very non fun in its tech silicon valley made me want to quit tech altogether but slowly stuff like this is reminding me of what the real potential of tech is i know it s silly to have a game make me reflect on my life but this game did that it has a lot of self reflection in it wholy recommend it it is a complete game where killing monsters with cool moves while still a large part of the game actually takes the back seat to a great story where gorgeous graphics really make the story pop
