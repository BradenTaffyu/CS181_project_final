2017 so finally completed total war warhammer and i m very positively surprised about this title total war has always been a good series and always did a rather good job but in this installment they truly go beyond what was expected total war warhammer is a grts just as any other total war game and is the first of them that is not based in history but in fantasy working with games workshop they were allowed to make a warhammer fantasy game and they pull it off amazingly i ve played this game for 83 hours at writing moment and will return to it very soon as i ve won with one race but so much more to go and much more to do they are following the warhammer universe perfectly and make you truly feel like the old world is coming to life and make sure you understand a huge part of the lore as well as the factions that you come across graphic and gameplay wise total war warhammer is great and as always the best of the best that ca can provide it is prob also the first total war game that didn t have a ton of launch issues which is a huge thing otherwise total war games you usually stay away from for the first two weeks after release i cannot wait to see total war warhammer 2 3 and all the upcoming dlc as it is all getting merged into one big map that is gonna bring the entire universe with all factions and units alive even tho total war is known for a lot of dlc this is a game where i will pre order every installment and every dlc possible i m for sure recommending this game for any total war fans grts fans and warhammer fans it is a must have for your collection
