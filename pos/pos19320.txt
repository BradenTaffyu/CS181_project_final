2021 the game is great definitely a good follow up successor for aoe2 but a a lot of the features are missing like why can t i zoom out further why is the population capped at 200 and why tf can i not choose my own color in skirmish mode blue gets boring after playing it over and over it might be a nitpick but color change has always been a staple feature since aoe1 fix these and to me this game would be 10 10
