2020 first things first the translation is way better than the steam page suggests and the actual tactics gameplay is excellent from beginning to end troubleshooter is essentially a deep jrpg krpg with coherent and diverse systems using the tactical layer of xcom if that seems like a combo that interests you it is almost guaranteed that you will enjoy what this game has to offer this is honestly one of the biggest bargains i ve seen in a lifetime of videogames it is positively insane how much content this thing has i am at 170 hours of playtime as of this review and i am still finding new ways to build characters and i still haven t played all the scenarios that said you can complete the narrative part in like 70 hours if you laser focus it plus the devs are at this moment adding an entire new chapter with two extra characters for free this is definitely my goty 2020 also devs if you read this review please please please get someone to re translate the steam store page i almost didn t buy the game over the shoddy translation displayed there and i don t doubt there are people who missed this gem because of it
