2017 kerbal space program one of the best sims and game ever to hit the steam store there is so much to do and i ve only got 200hrs and i have only scratched the surface the physics and aerodynamics are fascinatingly realistic although i hate it when the kraken decides to mess up your spacecraft i would recommend this game to anyone even if your not a fan of space you can just mess around the controls are rather easy to get a hang of but using those perfectly takes time effort and mostly persistance in conclusion i think this game is well worth it and you should get it right away
