2019 early access review how much you enjoy this game is imho largely down to how much you are willing to immerse yourself in the fantasy the detailed simulation of car building and maintenance and tuning is unlike anything we ve ever seen before jalopy was trying to be other things entirely a finished game not being among them but there s so much else that you need to do before you can hope to finish let alone start the car that you need to be prepared for the long haul it is very much a love letter to endless summers in the countryside making money interspersed with drinking your way through boredom or doing stupid to amuse yourself it paints a convincing if very odd setting that makes complete and total sense within its own fiction the wider world is known about but everyone in alivieska is so focused on their own concerns that there s no real reason to look outside it s a self contained community and one that you will end up becoming a part of as you play the mundanities of everyday life are all simulated here to perfection having to make a shopping trip and load your trunk up with your purchases and then walk back and forth to the driveway to put everything away when you get home the phone rings and you drop whatever you re doing to run and answer it waiting for a shop to open or just missing closing time waiting at the bus stop having a beer on your deck while your barbecue heats up the little touches everywhere bring the game to life each vehicle is idiosyncratic and you need to learn how to work with each one s controls to get the best results the one automatic vehicle threw me for a loop because i d gotten so used to the game s manual gearboxes i d forgotten how an auto works the truck s suspension can been seen visually rising as you empty the slurry tank the stop request buttons on the bus are placed exactly where you d expect in real life on the panel overhead next to your reading light and vents filling the truck up takes so long you understand why real fuel pumps allow for locking the handle in place even when you pee the final second push to get the last of the urine out is simulated here as a result it s a survival game but one set in the modern world the threat isn t zombies cannibals creepers or aurora crazed wolves it s just the real familiar world for the sake of a challenge your needs have been made more pressing than they would really be once you figure out how it all works these systems become part of the fun as you need to plan your life to ensure you won t be dying of thirst or dropping dead of a stress induced heartattack yes it s still annoying when you have a crash and are left stranded on the roadside and will die before you manage to walk home but you could have taken measures against that so it almost all feels fair earning money feels like real work too driving the vacuum truck around to pump people s sewage tanks is very convincing right down to milling around while the pump works and having a quick smoke chopping wood for sale takes ages as does delivering but the wad of markka you get for your efforts feels well earned this combined with the potential danger in your everyday activities makes your progress and success matter this is especially true of what the closest thing to an overall goal is the two day rally event all those expensive parts you ve been fitting to your car finally come into their own as you fit a roll cage and harness and turn it into a rally car blasting almost the entire way around the map s dirt road as quickly as possible is one of the most hair raising things i ve ever done in a game permadeath keeps you on edge as does the fact that binning it could well result in weeks of expensive repair work on the flipside when you finally do manage it i finally did last night while working on this review and get your trophy you feel more accomplished than after 100 forgettable forza gran turismo dirt races long a source of consternation among players my advice is this take it easy and prioritize staying on the road over going fast go slow to go fast proved itself when both my winning stages were when i was just driving the course fast ish in recon mode not actually trying to win recent updates to the game have people complaining that life is too hard you now start with just your monkey bike tractor and boat for transportation at first as a returning player this wasn t a big deal for me i already knew the game well and how to get around and what my options were your uncle s van and the vacuum truck don t show up for quite some time now i had my car finished before he appeared so please enjoy crossing the lake in the boat or being a proper country boy driving your tractor into town for cases of beer if you are prepared you will have many stupid drunken summer adventures flipping your trailer over with the tractor fork arms crashing into a swamp and having to tow your car out fighting at the disco pissing in the shower discover your inner sisu and enjoy
