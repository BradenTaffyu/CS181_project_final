2021 do you like making things work while trying to make people happy do you enjoy watching things fall to bits while others suffer either way this game does it sometimes i just collect all the plants and animals into a giant zoo garden then i can make a rocket to steal more animals and plants it s delightful 1 year after update spaced out dlc and fast friends gives more critters to appropriate plus you could have a whole asteroid devoted to them space zoo i love that so many people love this game for the immersive science and engineering bits of oni and i m just here for the cute 2 years later there is still nothing like this game replayability is astronomical
