2018 i quite enjoyed dark souls iii although the world is not as branching and connected as dark souls i there are some areas that do have a similar flow to them where one bonfire joins several paths together through the use of shortcuts the gameplay is incredibly fast and fluid in comparison to the first two dark souls games something that i was not prepared for during the early hours of the game i loved the game so much i kept going until i had unlocked every achievement i know some players took issue with the amount of throwbacks and references to the previous games with recurring characters locations and items from the previous two dark souls even demon s souls but i didn t mind at all the original dark souls is the end of the beginning so by the time dark souls iii comes around there is an established ritualistic and recursive behaviour in regards to the fading flame just like in real life where the world is constantly changing each civilisation s forgotten history falling victim to entropy so has the world of dark souls iii dark souls iii is difficult but far easier and simpler game to play than the original player movement is so fluid and the amount of invulnerability offered when dodge rolling is a huge boon to the player it s hard not to view it as an exploit i never bothered with pvp in the previous games but that changed here after overcoming my nerves i found it incredibly addicting to the point where i d stay up until 4am messing around as a mad phantom just to confuse the players i d invade while dark souls iii does have its issues in regards to broken mechanics such as poise not working properly hackers and wonky collision systems it manages to improve on the formula due to some necessary quality of life changes and technical optimisation i consider dark souls iii to be a seriously amazing game a satisfying closure to the series and i hope never to see it revived
