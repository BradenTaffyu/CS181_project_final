2018 short version the best platform 2d roguelite i ve played in my life a bit longer version this game is incredibly addictive although i do not like grind in this game after a few dozen hours i am not bored all thanks to rng very often the game forces you to play some combination of the equipment you just found and you have to learn a different style of fight personally i defeated the last boss after 30 hours of the game i do not remember when i felt such a huge satisfaction from a fight my hands trembled for a minute after the fight and this is just the beginning after defeating the final boss you unlock new levels of difficulty which significantly diversify and hinder the game i doubt i would ever beat this game at the nightmare level but i can have dreams right after dozens of hours of the game the game never got stuck it did not go down the optimization is brilliant i did not even find a single bug one of the few early access games that has been a huge success i recommend this game even to novice players in this roguelite game genre i was skeptical about this title but i took a chance and i do not regret it satisfaction guaranteed
