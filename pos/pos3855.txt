2023 i expected a korean xcom clone but got so so much more troubleshooter feels like someone took several different full featured games threw them into a blender and spent years mixing them until the final result became so uniform that you can t really see that these things were not really supposed to be in the same game but somehow the result is still delicious troubleshooter basically a linear visual novel that tries quite hard to make you care about the characters that are not very deep but are somewhat likable nonetheless but also it s an xcom like game with a couple of twists in core mechanics here and there but also it s a slow paced comfort rpg where there are no real consequences for failure and you can grind as much as you want without worrying about killing your characters off or losing the entire run but also it s a huge build optimization polygon with the number of options that puts disgaea to shame but also it s a pet taming simulator gotta catch em all and train them and summon them in battle but also it s a game about building robots but also it s a loot fest where you can spend hours grinding the perfect piece of equipment until it becomes irrelevant the next time the level cap is increased i guess but also there are various seemingly irrelevant numbers that go up and make you brain release dopamine and feel good because your reputation with this and that npc is now a bit higher so that part counts as an idler too i guess even though it all happens in the background while you do something else this game is just great i ve beaten the main campaign and currently playing through the dlcs and it s just a nice comfort game without any real pressure and there is just always several things to do besides advancing the story and i don t think i ll be done with it any time soon my only pet peeve is the insanely long loading screens that take way more time than the gameplay part during some of the grinding loops no matter how much memory your machine has the game feels compelled to unload all resources of the mission you just played just to spend an eternity loading your main hub which feels like it should take half a second to load to be honest but i guess ogre engine is still a pile of garbage after all these years where you select the same mission again and wait for another eternity to reload everything again i can t even blame this problem on the engine who knows maybe keeping the recently used resources around in memory is hard in ogre for some weird reason since all it would take to fix the issue is to add a replay the same mission button on the victory screen and we do have a replay button if you managed to fail the mission so reloading the hub was a design choice to make loading screens a pain rather than a technical limitation someone there thought that if it takes 20 seconds to kill a boss it s totally okay to add 3 minutes of loading screens before you can try killing the same boss again just so you can look at the interior of a bar where your team hangs out between the missions but other than this the game feels quite polished to recommend to anyone as long as you have something else to do between the loading screens like reading a book
