2017 i feel like i need to put this out here to all haters out there about the dlc policy that creative assembly has put in place with this game this game without any dlc is 10 10 and yes it is completely playable and you can get 200 hours without having to buy any dlc and still being one of the best strategy games ever released and the best total war game ever by far buy it you won t regret it the dlc makes this game even more amazing so if after playing 200 hours you start to get bored get the dlc to get more kick out of the game
