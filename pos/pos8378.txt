2019 i love this game for many reasons the story elements are engaging and well written i wanted to know more about the world as soon as i started playing the words and actions of the people in it are realistic to the events the challenges that arise are not easy to resolve and force you to make choices that actually have consequences the victorian steampunk theme was the perfect choice for this game the art graphics make the setting come alive they create a world that is both stunningly beautiful and extremely deadly for the unwise they add a sense of immersion the gameplay is challenging but satisfying it took me several tries to finish most of the scenarios and many more tries to finish them to my satisfaction after 260 hours i still have achievements to unlock and still want to play this game
