2021 great game but the downloadable content is much too expensive for how little it offers i find myself spending countless hours playing the game but when i want specific things in my game that you can only get from the dlc and not mods it annoys me because i don t want to spend my whole paycheck on a tiny little specific detail that makes a world of difference
