2017 there are so many funny little details that make you laugh even a strategy game fool like me actually enjoys playing it 10 10 edit also great music addion after 154hrs in game those colonists have just become my friends irl i have such a social bond with them that i cry when something happens to them edit arright i ve been playing this game for so long so here s a relatively serious review the game gets boring in the late game you may need mods if you still want the challenge but it s still one of my favorite ones and i still can t play strategy base building kinda games and as i like to say rimworld where organ trade and slavery is legal disclaimer i do not support slavery or organ trading in any sense it s just a meme it s just for the game
