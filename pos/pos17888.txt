after investing 69 hours in company of heroes 3 i find myself continually drawn back to its engaging gameplay the core mechanics are truly satisfying particularly in single player skirmishes and when replaying missions on expert difficulty for daily rewards the game s visual and audio quality has notably improved since the onyx shark 1 7 0 patch enhancing the overall experience whilst i ve occasionally ventured into co op multiplayer it s somewhat hit and miss i often encounter significant skill disparities amongst players and the waiting times for matches can be lengthy the single player skirmish mode however offers consistently enjoyable gameplay that said it would be great to see a wider variety of scenarios introduced over time given the focus on positioning in combat modes such as vip protection capture the flag or siege defence could provide interesting new challenges to force players around the map regarding the campaigns they re somewhat mixed the north africa campaign is quite brief essentially serving as an extended tutorial the italian campaign whilst longer becomes rather formulaic rather quickly it doesn t quite measure up to a grand strategy experience i found myself winning every battle without needing to mount any defences against the ai which made it feel somewhat linear the four factions available offer a good balance i primarily play as the british but i ve experimented with all factions and find them reasonably well balanced one area of slight disappointment is the in game currency system despite 69 hours of play and accumulating 4 000 in currency there s little of value to purchase skin packs for instance cost around 40 000 and aren t particularly impressive while i appreciates the desire to avoid pay to win mechanics the current system renders the free currency rather pointless there s some speculation that the dlc strategy wasn t fully developed at launch possibly due to uncertainty about the game s market performance this may explain why certain aspects of the game feel somewhat underdeveloped in conclusion despite these minor gripes the core gameplay of company of heroes 3 is excellent it s this fundamental quality that keeps one returning the tactical depth particularly in skirmish modes provides a consistently satisfying experience with some refinements to scenario variety campaign depth and the reward system company of heroes 3 could potentially elevate itself from a good game to a truly outstanding one
