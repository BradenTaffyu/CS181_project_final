2016 early access review so i am about ten hours in now and thought i would leave my feedback tl dr buy it moron so there i was in my house i was bound and determined not to use any kind of guide or anything preferring to figure things out on my own i ran around like an idiot for a while checking things out figuring out what keys did what how to use tools and the sauna and whatnot there went about four hours and a large part of my sanity an hour alone was spent trying to start the damn van only to end up figuring out i had it in gear duh proceed to town buy some food beer more beer and some automotive stuff fan belt fluids and whatnot several beers and a two hour drive home later i decided to start tackling building the engine i wobbled my way to the garage and spent another hour being ocd as hell and drunk as hell rearranging parts in the way i wanted them to be and in the order i was going to build i also managed to push the hulk of my car into my garage and get it up on jacks do you have any idea how hard it is to jack a car up while drunk as hell randomly urinating all over your shop outside the shop door and to the left that is my preferred pee spot suddenly realizing i was exhausted and it was dark i went to bed and slept a drunk slumber awaking the next morning hung over as i decided to finish the car come hell or high water i had stocked up on food beer and had also filled my diesel and gasoline cans as well as the van when i went on the store run so i felt like i was in good shape i started the sauna heater and went outside to work on the car fast forward several hours and many many beers later the car was done it was finally put together jesus christ the exhaust pipe and the fuel strainer whyyyy what did i ever do to you elated at my success and exhausted and drunk as piss again i decided to await to try my first startup for the next morning i stumbled my way to bed and passed out sunrise day three the big day excited i quickly ate drank and of course took my morning sauna and piss and went outside to tinker on the car so close i emptied the gascan into the tank crossed my fingers and turned the key with a cough and a roar she barked to life i actually did a fist pump and went yeeah until i let off the gas heard the violent amount of lifter tick and it immediately backfired turned off and would not restart awesome i decided it was a good idea to go ahead and upgrade to racing carbs having isolated my carb tuning as the problem so i filled out the form in my magazine grabbed the envelope and tossed it into the pump truck along with a case of beer and a couple packs of sausages i had spent most of my money on fuel and supplies earlier so it was time to pump some after three successful pumpings i returned home to sleep waking up the next morning i went back out in the pump truck to pump more making my way to perajarvi i had to stop and take a piss as well as drink a few more beers hic and eat some macaroni i was merrily making my way into the outskirts of town when it happened out of gas then as i am in the process of diagnosing why my truck shut off at full speed blind curve i slammed on the brakes in panic but since i had been using them pretty actively the air pressure in the system was too low i shot off the curve rode on three wheels for about four seconds and ended up in a ditch laying on my side in a truck half full of awesome so i did what any responsible finn would do i got out drank a few beers and contemplated my situation it was almost dark i was tired and my truck was laying on its side i grabbed the empty diesel can i had brought with me threw it on top of the case of beer which was now mostly empty and began the slow trudge to town ten minutes later i was at the taven store with the tavern side being open and the store closed since it was now nighttime it had been a day no pun intended i had some sausage and fries several shots and even more beers i stumbled outside onto the patio making my way to the restroom to piss all over the walls and save my game when i passed out stone drunk i slept til morning when i woke up i was beside the road just outside of town obviously haven drunkwalked a little ways during the night hungry thirsty and resigned to a long walk back home to get the tractor i trudged into town to have some food and a few beers i will only have three i swear before setting out lo and behold not only am i out of food beer water transportation and patience but i am also out of money as it turns out yeah i have literally no idea what to do now i laughed and laughed saved my game and came right to steam to write this review the developer was right it s not that he wanted to make this game it s that this game just had to be made i think i am in love this reminds me of college 10 10 would roll truck and run out of beer and money again
