2023 first of all i ll say that regardless of if you have no idea about the pmverse or are a long time fan i d absolutely recommend giving limbus company a try limbus company up to chapter 3 as of writing is pretty good like lobotomy corporation and library of ruina before it there is one very specific thing you need to do at all times after the very easy beginner battles of course pay attention failing to do so especially earlier on and attempting to auto resolve or bunga through every encounter will often result in losses incoherent screaming repeats of the same level and complaints about difficulty which admittedly are sometimes justified but in general if you re using your head and reading enemy attacks status effects and passives the game becomes a good deal easier aside from that the art characters music designs worldbuilding pretty much everything in that regard has a lot of love put into it and you ll of course especially love it if you re already a long time fan additionally if you also like depression good people dying for horrible reasons or just a daily dose of wow the city sucks well this game will supply more than enough of that i m afraid that despite my recommendation the auto targeting for normal battles can t be defended very much when 4 or 5 of your 8 attacks are redirected towards an enemy that s staggered with 3 health remaining it can be incredibly frustrating especially when it gets one of your sinners smashed in that same turn abnormality battles suffer a lot less from this thanks to the fact that you can manually target enemies the only other main issue was that thread was pretty difficult to obtain outside of mirror dungeons but the new addition of the individual thread and exp levels makes this a non issue however i do advise you to keep an open mind as pm are pretty good at improving their games over time and actually do listen to their fans edit and we ve now got a roadmap too oh uh yeah the gacha stuff it s okay rates honestly feel better than they do in a lot of other gachas still if you don t like em might not be your cup of tea and ishmael is best girl do not me
