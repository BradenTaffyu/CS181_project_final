2018 early access review the two best things going for this game are it s momentum and it s brutality while they sometimes cross paths they are usually seperate though amazing firstly momentum there are special doors that you can only enter if you meet a certain time limit the earliest of these give you two minutes this leads to the momentous half of the game a fair amount of equipment mutations perks traits they re all the same things with different names and mechanics greatly add to this sensation of being a force of gravity kill an enemy in the blink of an eye and do the same to his buddies in a short enough period of time and you get a speed boost this launches you even further towards your next target be it the level exit or an enemy find a door you could open it the normal way or break it down with a roll or attack and keep on running before the splinters hit the ground the mastery you have over a mere two dimensions is incredible and gives a degree of freedom unmatched in other games let alone roguelikes don t like a room no need to kill every enemy in it before the doors open just bolt out secondly brutality isaac gungeon darkest dungeon ftl all some of my favorite games though they sometimes have a feeling that you re just ticking away at a box until your enemy turns into a pile or gore or scrap dead cells no such thing almost you can get some bad weapons and suffer from it but the game is usually generous with these well then you ve got plenty of good weapons now you can just plow through enemies right yes and no there is a constant competition with even basic mobs meaning that you are always maintaining a deadlieness on par with them a misplaced roll or parry can result in a sudden inhale through the nose you know the one in reaction to watching a horrific amount health dissapearing at the same time you re no lightweight with the right build and use of combos you can feel unstoppable a single shot from a crossbow on the right build can remove an enemy and his pal standing next to him from that plane of existence a weapon that freezes your enemy may be underwhelming in and of itself but a 175 damage on a frozen target affix can make mush and frozen chunks about almost everything in your way it s like playing on a teeter totter with a live hand grenade rolling from one end to the other these two aspects of the game places it leagues above many other games and competitors and i highly recommend it even in it s current unfinished state
