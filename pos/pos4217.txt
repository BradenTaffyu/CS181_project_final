2017 10 10 game write your own epic 1st game was street urchin of low birth leave first city and head to nearest village asked to train peasants to fight against bandits train peasants village is attacked me armed with wooden staff in peasant robes with 10 other peasants with rocks and clubs fight against 20 bandits in full mail kite shields and longswords die i quit 2nd game i become a bandit hunter in one of the sultanate i hunt desert bandits to near extinction therefore losing my income ask around the villages for tasks that my freemen can do asked to get cattle get cattle at extortionate cost my reward cheers m8 impoverished we head to the next village and are tasked with getting grain spend my last denars on grain for the village my reward cheers m8 party of bandit hunters starts falling apart raid the grain village for food and am caught by one of the sultan s emirs and am challenged to battle so this is how it ends we charge the enemy and are crushed quickly nearly all of his troops are fully armoured knights on horseback mine are plebs with spears third and current game am born a common mucker street urchin i start in the central kingdom the one with red writing my second quest is to collect tax from dhirim for a lord i collect 7300 denars and crush a peasant revolt the lord expects his revenue in due course i flee across the map to the frozen tundra of revachig i spend my money arming myself and recruiting more volunteers for my band of freemen we get fat clearing the roads of tundra bandits taiga bandits and sea raiders this time being careful not to extinguish them entirely i end up assisting many of the vaegirs kingdom vassals in battle against raiders and eventually become a mercernary for one of them my contract stipulates that the stronger my troops the more money i recieve sweet soon enough my commander requires my army for a campaign so i agree to follow his orders for as long as it is profitable he seems weak a low vassal within this kingdom a perfect stepping stone for those who seek to become a sworn sword however my band is free we patrol the tundra for days with no activity apart from one village raid then with a total of 70 troops me having 40 of them the commander orders of charge against a force of 150 i flee faster than a motherf cker the hunters become the hunted my employer is captured no worries i am a mercenary i evade the khanate troops across the tundra until i am safe at revachig and sell my loots my contract wholly intact i then accompany other vassals of the vaegirs kingdom into battle raiding and winning many conflicts until a truce is signed between the khanate and the vaegirs kingdom i now have a band of 60 men it consists primarily of cavalry with a small section of archers and footsoldiers to act as bait for my flanking maneouvres the vaegirs kingdom is peaceful for a time i go back to killing bandits and a month passes i get paid for my services by the kingdom and renew my contract easy money war breaks out between the nords and the vaegirs kingdom and i join the vaegirs in battle not as an assigned campaign but freely someone has to get fat from the war economy i get cocky and attempt a raid on a nord village only to draw into battle by the king of the nords and two jarls a force of 230 men against my 60 my lizard brain says so this is how it ends and my cursor hovers over the charge the enemy option my logic wins and i cover several retreats losing 40 men to the nords and then evade several bands of sea raiders as i retreat to revachig sad i then buy supplies and quickly head to accompany the kings troops in a defence of slektch sletzch castle in the field we have around 4 vassals the king and my band we have 7 engagements back to back in a matter of hours i capture 2 enemy jarls however my troop has to withdraw loot to sell now with 38 men as a few peasants have joined my force i retained much of my cavalry from the retreats of revachig fortunately deep in our territory i stumble across a force of 30 nords with 30 prisoners of some sort i rout them with a flanking move and free the prisoners capturing another jarl the prisoners 30 vaegirs troops a mix of cavalry foot and archer i hire them all without question i am now back to full strength and return to battle around curaw at curaw i attack a force of 64 with my 63 troops as i lead the cavalry to attack the rear of the enemy the song a knife in the dark from the lotr ost comes on 10 10 my axe crushes any skull i see and i am caught within chaos at the centre of the battlefield for a long time wildly flailing until another cavalry charge splits the enemy force into sizable chunks eney reinforcements arrive unfortunately for them they are all on foot my cavalry and archers smash them quickly i capture a third jarl i now am encamped at slektch sleztch castle and await the next chapter i think i want some khanate and swadia recruits to mix the force i keep thinking of starting a good honest business a mill or a brewery but someone has to leech from the war economy one must know his place in the world playing while listening to the lord of the rings soundtrack makes this game 100 better
