2020 tl dr it s an amazing game to chill and appreciate the different european cities landscapes specially with the dlcs i have to admit that way before i had played this game i used to think why do some people like a driving simulator so much if they probably drive daily irl what s the point well that s the catch there is way more to it than a simple simulator to drive from point a to b despite this being the core of the game this game has deeper roleplaying factors and rewarding features that will take you from being a simple unskilled worker up to a full skilled driver and owner of a multinational truck delivery services company there is leveling up and skill points besides the cash rewards for the jobs the more the player dedicates himself to certain jobs and ways to do them bigger and better jobs in the same characteristics will be offered to him offering in return greater rewards one of the strengths of euro truck simulator 2 is certainly the visuals which varies depending on the weather and the time of the day dusk rain storms and dawns are just beautiful and the fact that there are several camera angles to view only contributes to the player feeling these moments in an introspective way or share them on the world of trucks page officially created by the developer so that players share such moments with each other i ve recently found out that ets2 has a really friendly online community as i m over 50 hours into the game but only now started exploring some mods for it and there are thousands of them i stumpled upon a lot of weather climate mods when i was looking for new radio stations for the game yes ets2 has lots of really nice radio stations for the player to listen to while driving it s also interesting to point out that euro truck simulator 2 is a nice example of how not all games need to offer epic stories violence or sex nothing against those games btw to be an amazing experience and to attract thousands of players worldwide it is a rewarding experience to feel like a driver who little by little progresses in his career and becomes head of a fleet of trucks managing his own business while choosing to continue on the road by the end of the day this is still just a game still just a simulation but it does a great job in helping the player relax and reminding the player of a pretty good life advice don t forget to appreciate the view along the way to your destination
