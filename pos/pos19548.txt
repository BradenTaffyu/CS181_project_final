2020 this will go down as one of if not the greatest of the modern fallout games since new vegas i really haven t seen any other fallout title live up to expectations that fallout new vegas have set if you are a fan of first person combat rpgs you are going to spend hours reading terminals for the story finishing every quest or decimating a population for sick entertainment this game has a huge replay value as there are multiple ways to beat and enjoy the game if you came from fallout 4 chances are that you wont enjoy it that much but who knows miracles happen every day 11 10
