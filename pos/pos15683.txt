2023 i started using aimlabs when i first got into pc gaming a few years back my mouse control at the time was very lackluster and subpar i used aimlabs religiously and trained my aim for 15 20 mins a couple days out of every week after a short while my aim started to get much better and i was winning more gunfights in the games i played at the time apex and cod mw i started playing valorant and got placed in silver right after the beta ended and continued to train my aim once i started to get really good at gridshot and sixshot my aim carried me to plat and i eventually hit immortal i highly recommend to train your aim if you would like to be good at competitive shooters aim is the one mechanic that can transfer no matter what agent game you play i also recommend focus on your accuracy instead of speed it doesn t matter how fast you can move your mouse if you are only hitting 80 of your shots happy gaming
