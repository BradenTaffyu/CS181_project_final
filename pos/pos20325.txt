i really don t write short reviews but this falls into the just buy it category for people who like card games or solitaires you just play poker hands and use balatros or jokers to improve its potential to kill bosses it is snappy satisfying with tons of unlockables addicting not in a gambling way makes your brain work since when was that bad except in modern society makes you compute scenarios and is a true roguelike no two runs are ever the same even if you go for the same card joker build at the price tag of 14 this is an easy way to buy a game which you will dump over 50 hours in to get its full potential and actually 22 hours in that might be an understatement now let me tell you about my deck i can make it huge with 60 cards in a single suit or small like 20 cards it grows and it gets smaller the way i want to have it it explodes in millions of points or does exactly what i want my deck to do i can make my deck in any suit or combo i want and wear the exact con cards that i want to fit i can do anything with my deck already over 30 000 people play with my deck it is so satisfying i had only 1 bug until now playing the bus card it reset for no reason without me playing any face card k q j i am quite positive it is fixed by now cause the devs are really quite active which you love to see so yes just buy it and get addicted to it no wonder it is in the top 30 most played games on steam with over 30 000 players and overwhelmingly positive cheap game roguelike lots of replayability and potential in the immortal words of northernlion you love to see it if nobody knows who or what balatro is in ancient rome a balatro b l tro bah lah troh was a professional jester or buffoon in the immortal words of the critical drinker that s all i have for today go away now
