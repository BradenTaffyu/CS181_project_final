2016 definitely the most accessible hoi yet and paradox is finally learning how teach people their game through tooltips and tutorials rather than spend 3 hours looking at youtube walkthroughs hi hoi 3 the production system is simple yet elegant and offers a lot of choice on how your shape your nation the focus trees allow you to customise how a historical you want to be and the first lot of hours in any playthrough are great fun few problems ai is a disaster at the moment and offers virtually no challenge i m sure this will be fixed in future patches but the low base set means it will probably never be great ai the battle planner is also affected by the same issues feedback is pretty terrible i have no idea how much attrition is happening in battles what my bombers are bombing how my fighters are faring except to see how many each side loses each day again something i m hopeful of being fixed but still a pain in my posterior hoop ring late game is generally a chore and the allied ai floods the front lines with mud cretin tier unorganised peasant armies who can t push a front to save black jebus if you can overlook these definitely worth a buy update for 2022 ai is still not great and the points above mentioned are still an issue although some of the frontline border gore isn t as egregious the strengths of this game have gotten even better while the weaknesses are still there 1936 1942 are basically the most fun years by mid late 1942 the game has largely been decided and is just about mopping up and doing for completion s sake
