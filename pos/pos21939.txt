2019 dark souls iii this series means a lot to me i started playing dark souls during a really hard time in my life it helped me forget about life for just a bit by consuming most of my time and making me furious so of course i m going to recommend this game but from a perspective of a new player this is the dark souls game to start with it s pretty easy to pick up and not too difficult and sometimes a breeze once you get the hang of it now for returning players the game ties up a few loose end side stories and lore e g patches and the first flame plus it adds some new gameplay features so it s not just a copy and paste of previous games so in conclusion i recommend this to anyone who s either heard of dark souls but hasn t ever played it and to returning players please play this game it s still worth it s 60 price 15 on sale right now
