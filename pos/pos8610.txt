2017 update summer 2019huge improvement to the game with the addition of truracs and portable hunting stands this game has become such a better game overall i honestly think this could now be the undisputed best hunting game to date my only wish now is for custom maps and a level editor to be released give it a chance i actually refunded this after 2 hours but something drew me right back i have played just about every hunting game since the mid 90 s and out of all those games this has the magic of some of the very best btw you can disable most hud popups and the deer icons are only tutorial don t be like me and think it was a full time feature for an arcadey thehunter as many included myself branded it it certainly does not feel like it when you dig deep it is not a shooting gallery dont expect deer to just wander past you in some aspects its even more realistic than classic for example view distance is finally increased meaning that looking into the distance is actually important now night hunts call them unethical all you want but get out there with your headtorch under the stars the moonlight glowing on the ground and the beautiful sounds of owls hooting in the distance makes it an unforgetable experience i actually prefer to hunt during this time animals actually have a more believable routine wild boar are rarely seen out in the open during the day only venturing out after dusk etc you also have feeding spots and bedding areas which they return to graphics wow honestly i cannot work out how some people have slated the graphics as merely ok because the visuals are simply mind blowing at 4k on ultra it is so inviting you actually want to explore the huge map walking speed also feels more realistic and not just a geriatric shuffle the little things bushes actually make noise now so it effects how you stalk your prey the grass becomed flattened behind you and animals leaving a very realistic looking path an in game mission journal the majority of threatened animals can harm you if cornered animal tracks last longer than a few hours the sounds are beautiful the animations are fluid and there is ample map to explore and discover one of the best things is the sense of progression this game gives you you do not start with all the gear you have to unlock it with ingame money and levelups so there is an actual goal to play towards
