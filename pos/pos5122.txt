2020 product received for free i got this game gifted a while back and stopped right away before i even lead the minutemen to sanctuary why idk everything just went on my nerves the clumsy controls the loadingscreens etc i never bothered to play that game again some weeks ago i reinstalled the game because i was hooked with witcher 3 always thought i wouldn t like that kind of game and i am loving it now and already played it 3 times so i thought maybe fallout 3 can give me the feeling and experience the witcher 3 gave me sadly it didn t the music ist nice but all characters lack of personality the conversations are not really deep graphics are okay the controls are still feeling very clumsy and everything takes soooo long same with the crafting etc i will play this game till the end but i don t think i will play it again in any other mode or with mods therefore the game couldn t really convince me i still recommend the game because most things that bother me are totally subjective to me i know a lot of people that love that game and i can see why it is just not for me
