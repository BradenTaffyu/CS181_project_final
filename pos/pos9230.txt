2018 stellaris by far i would said stellaris simply an amazing 4x strategy game for me it is simple to learn i took around 4 5 hours to understand the mechanics but in order to master it it required some time investment into it okay lets talk from the beginning 1 it might confuse you if this is your first time playing stellaris with too many races different politics ethics different governments different traits which i think these content is the fun part of the game no worries just pick one and start playing it you will know better in the game 2 start off with 1 planet strengthen your economic expand your colony control more resources explore the universe build your fleets make friends or enemies and repeat this game basically based on these contents sound easy but took you many hours to master 3 what made this game so interesting you able to discover the mysteries of the universe good or bad no one can tell and you are the one who making the choices different choice will lead you to a different outcome from early till mid game you willi indulge with a lot of space incidents and mysteries that keep you feel so interested for the first 100 hours 4 in order to win the game it come with 3 conditions either 1 a you individual colonized 40 of entire universe planets b your federation you will create or join 1 colonized 60 of entire universe planets c eliminate all nations among these 3 conditions i only able achieved b you might think a might easier but this game ai ain t stupid dumb dumb they could have stronger fleets better economics better natural resources that crush you anytime and about c i really think this is the hardest option the game ai there is nation called fallen awakened empire which they have massive fleets far higher technology than you we talking about 300k to 500k fleets power you will know what it is when you start playing which mean this make the whole thing harder to achieve however for b with federation you have several nations get together that fight for each other conquering liberating even defending if you manage to joined into a federation with several strong empires you will easily wipe off any other nations that stand in you way but in a federation any decisions you made like declaring war will need to go throught voting sometime you will get frustrated you cant even wipe off the small and weak nation beside you because your federation members have interest with them and would not allow you declaring war on them a lot of politics i know but i love it cons when come to end game the entire might seem in stagnant not much stories and incidents happening you and the other empires will expand the territory into maximum waiting a chance a weak spot to hit in and wipe each other off but this is a long wait i really do hope paradox developers can work this out in fact i trust they will work on this overall 8 10 i really recommending this game its really fun and i still feel so much fun when playing stellaris if you think of which dlc to buy i recommend you could play it without dlcs for first 50 100 hours learn the mechanics of the game during sales you could grab one of these to expand your gameplay utopia or leviathan or synthetics if you like to have robots controlling an empire or rebellion of ai robots in one empire these kind of incidents thanks for reading i hope this is not too long and simple enough to make you understand the game overall so you can spend your money wise enjoy your game iamgamer
