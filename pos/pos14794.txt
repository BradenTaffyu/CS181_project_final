2020 early access review positive teardown is an awesome game with an awesome premise and an awesome engine every physical part of this game is satisfying and fun negative that being said i feel like a lot of this potential is wasted on variations of the same time trial mission type that has so far dominated the game s campaign with most games i end up liking this much i usually have a hard time putting the game down and tearing myself from the screen however teardown very often leaves me feeling fatigued and discouraged after barely scraping by one time trial mission then realizing the next mission is really the same mission just with cars instead of paintings or safes or computers so far i want to say i m around 12 15 missions in i can only recall two maybe three missions that just let you demolish something or do anything other than a timed heist as this game is further developed i would like to see a larger variety of mission types but man it still kicks ass and looks good while doing it even this early on
