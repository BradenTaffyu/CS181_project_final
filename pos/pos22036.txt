2020 when i first saw dark souls 3 i was intrigued by the art style and game play but always maintained that i was never going to play it because it was too hard and i would never be able to finish it then one day i thought why not give it a try and test myself i then realised that the game is only as hard as you make it and you have to completely change the way you play as you will be punished for being greedy when fighting anything take your time be patient and you will defeat them if you die pick yourself up and try again now after completing them game i would recommend it to anyone that has thought about trying a souls game but shied away from them as being too hard as you might surprise yourself
