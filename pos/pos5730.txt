2022 bannerlord for a very long time was a living meme since the game was in the development for eternity with no clear release date at sight to the point there were even rumors if the game exists at all i ve managed to get it very early right after the game was available in the early access and while amount of bugs crashes and issues was higher than any other game i ve ever tried to the point it felt more like early alpha the core of the satisfying gameplay and the reason why it s named mount blade was still there back then i said that it ll be a masterpiece if taleworlds manages to resolve all of those issues and polish those round edges with enough of effort and they truly did today i can say that bannerlord is the sequel to the warband that every fan was waiting for it feels like taleworlds was listening to the players as the game includes all the things that worked creating a marvelous rpg game with very deep world to the point one can really dive and lose himself in the simulation like previous games bannerlord also follows make your own adventure scheme where you have a lot of freedom in terms of what exactly you want to do while the core of the game remains very advanced battle system it doesn t feel like other options such as being humble merchant small mercenary or a ruler of the kingdom were left out i ve put almost 300 hours in total in this game and i could play it for even longer it really doesn t get boring hours pass like minutes and long after midnight you realize that it s monday tomorrow and you re not getting enough of sleep again for every mount blade fan this is a mandatory position taleworlds delivered on the promise and we ve got a sequel that we ve always wanted for people that didn t play mount blade series yet this is a very good position to start as long as you re into deep rpg games with no single plot to follow but rather making your own with a lot of possibilities and diversity in the process while not the best game of all time it s in the strict top for me and i can heavily recommend it for everybody that has even the slightest interest in becoming a lord with his own army during medieval times sure there are things that could be executed slightly better but no game is perfect and the fact that the game managed to resolve my very mixed impression during early access proves that it s worthy to consider especially for people that will play it for the first time if you liked my review you can find more of them on my profile and on my curator page
