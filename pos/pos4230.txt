2015 is this game fun pros amazing singleplayer you could play for years and you would not have seen every possibility gameplay is perfect the mechanics are quite easy to learn not as easy as chivalry but that allows people to actually fight instead of constantly blocking this game can be played alone or with friends and still be fun either way this isnt really a feature or anything but it has a skyrim ish battle feel to the game without the magic and the dragons and what not unless you play around with the mods even if you lack experience you can join a server play team games or deathmatch and not feel like you are being mocked for your lack of skillz thank you lol and cod the community is quite open and while we may not be extremely chatty no one will insult you or call you a noob and if they do than they will most likely feel the taste of the banhammer the countless mods make this game endless want to invade britain in the dark ages go ahead feel the need to join the dark side or help the jedi s be my guestwonder what would have happened if you had been in the romain empire and the list of mods go on and on cons there will always be one naked guy with a two handed broadsword or axe and it ll be faster than your short sword grumble grumble you will never ever be the best player in a game of 50 unless dedicate a lot of hours of multiplayer into this game you will lose what life you hadconclusion yes this game is fun 100 worth the trycheck you have the computer for the game before you buy it but if you do this is probably a game for you ps all aboard the bannerlord hype train
