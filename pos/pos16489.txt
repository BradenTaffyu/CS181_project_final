2017 early access review loving this game there is nearly nothing to hate about it the only real complaints are lack of vehicles in terms of what you can build and varieties to build and the fact we have to save and quit to the main menu instead of maybe resting and saving real quick now what do i have to say the game is a time hog you ll be in it for hours on your first build and it s great the jobs are hilariously good and i love the hilarious insults go to pus y lmaoif you love building creating and living your creations dream this is the game the best part is seeing how durable your car finally is with your own tuning and everything it takes time and its well worth it even if there isn t so much to do right now you always find your self doing something anyway i ve wasted hours just watching the tv and drinking beer for no reason with my hand in my pants in my mind like im al bundy get this game trust me
