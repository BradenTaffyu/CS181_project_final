alright i m not going to sit here and say this game is flawless by any means the game had a god awful launch servers were complete ass for the first few weeks i also absolutely despise the always online requirement that is my biggest gripe with the game at this point another issue is with the stupid stand in a circle and wait objectives however even with all of its flaws i still love the gameplay loop especially the new stealth allowing you to almost complete a job without having your mask on the game also maintains a relatively stable framerate and is very playable for instance i mostly play on the steam deck and the game always runs at a playable framerate the maps are designed well in my opinion and the music is absolutely fire to sum things up this game had a really launch but 5 months later the game is actually really fun i m probably going to get a mob of people who heavily disagree but this is my opinion after a little over 100 of gameplay and reaching level 85
