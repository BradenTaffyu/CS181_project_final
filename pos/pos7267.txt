2016 it s been over 4 years since my original review was posted i think it s time to update it this game is not for everyone but for people who enjoy relaxing trips through the open roads of the united states while hauling cargo from point a to point b in american truck simulator you are tasked with delivering cargo through california nevada arizona washington oregon new mexico utah idaho and colorado wyoming and texas have been announced and are expected to release by the end of 2021 it s a simulation game so while some may find it completely boring and not at all entertaining others find it calming yet fun trucks can be slow or quick depending on the model engine parts and trailer cargo since the original release of american truck simulator the graphics and sound design has seen massive improvements american truck simulator like euro truck simulator 2 supports keyboard mouse various controllers steering wheels i personally use and recommend the logitech g29 head tracking devices such as trackir which i also use and recommend and even virtual reality headsets such as the oculus rift button boxes are also a great option for those who want to really want immersion though the elgato streamdeck also works nicely official multiplayer has recently been added with the 1 41 update allowing for no more than 8 players to convoy together with syncronized ai traffic lights time weather and more for players who want to play with more than 8 players in a session the popular third party service truckersmp is a great option on the table though you do lose ai traffic and have to deal with trolls pros great variety of cargo to haul 9 states previously listed above with more to come in future dlc s map that has been scaled to ensure long hauls feel long 10 customizeable trucks peterbilt 389 peterbilt 579 kenworth t680 kenworth w900 international lonestar western star 49x mack anthem freightliner colorado volvo vnl 300 volvo vnl 730 volvo vnl 780 great customization options for all trucks support for many input devices support for third party modifications support for steam workshop content vast amount of fairly priced dlc multiplayer labeled in game as convoy overall rating 10 10
