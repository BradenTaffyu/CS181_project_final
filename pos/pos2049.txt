2021 i ve been on and off playing swtor since beta having really dug in during rothc and kotfe i am continually impressed each time i return by how much improvement takes place in both drastically and subtle approaches to mmorpgs here s a quick list of key factors that keep me coming back 1 bioware respects players time more than many other mmos whether its codifying your achievements in a legacy system that applies to all characters or streamlining older content to allow for expedite meaningful and educational catch up for new players bioware show that you re time playing is valuable and you should be enjoying 100 of your time playing while you can still find treadmill activities such as daily content it is refreshing to see this tied exclusively to reputation advancement towards meaningful acquisitions cool sabers mounts etc there is opportunity at the end of these endeavors that is worth the effort 2 blended single multi player content over the 6 releases to swtor bioware has carefully shifted the paradigm of general open world game play away from party heavy content to a more robust single player experience largely achieved by rework of older content to balance the difficulty against a player and his her companion while the classic game content has seen its difficulty reduced as a result shadow of revan and all future expansions have seen the addition of a difficulty toggle system aimed at given veteran players a greater challenge at the streamlined story content this has all be achieved while maintaining the possibility of performing story open world content as a group flashpoints operations dungeons raids have maintained their group nature but have increased in flexibility over the years with role neutral and group scaling attributes applied respectively 3 gearing swtor has always had a unqiue gearing system consisting of both static or fixed gear pieces one encounters in most mmos as well as component based gearing which allows a player to customize the particular parts that are installed in the item shell resulting in customized stats what i find particularly wonderful is the legacy component to this gear which allowed an item to be used across any character if for example you have a jedi guardian tank that is well geared nearly all his armor if legacy in nature can be transferred and used by a sith juggernaut this speaks not only to the intricacy of the armor system but also the respect for players time 4 the cartel market most people are usually turned off when micro transactions make their way into an mmo and rightly so in a game like wow for example it is easy to see the rather direct causality to spending money and enhancing your power while the same could be said of swtor it is refreshing to see a studio that doesn t to my knowledge sell game tokens for in game currency but instead offers a wide variety of cosmetics which can be acquired through subscription security key and in game seasonal progression to acquire cartel coins premium currency at no additional cost does this leave room to exploit the sale of cartel market items for credits which can then be used to purchase more enhancements for your gear unfortunately yes and there is simply no way around this the only benefit to this system is that a player doesn t necessarily need to spend money to acquire cosmetic gear 5 community in an mmorpg community is one of the most important elements of having fun when comparing the community in swtor to that of other mmorpgs wow lotro ff14 i am impressed with how friendly and helpful the swtor community is there is obviously a lot of passion for the subject of star wars lots of debates in the fleet chat and very little degradation of noobs for asking simple questions while the population does ebb and flow like any mmo there seems to never be any issue finding a people for group content or for an active guild with similar interest i hope this helps anyone who is on the fence about swtor i am happy to answer any questions directly may the force be with you at its heart this game is a classic bioware story teller with great options for
