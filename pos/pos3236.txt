2017 pros great combat mechanics and a very rich story and lore what blows me away is that it seems like each and every dialogue in this game which has more than 1000 npcs is completly very well voice acted kudos to the devs cons the game has a lot and i mean a lot of sidequests party quests and the game s quest tracker becomes too cluttered i hope the devs include a quest marker for individual quests rather than marking all the quest waypoints on the map together
