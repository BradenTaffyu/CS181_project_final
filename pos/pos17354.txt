2019 total war three kingdoms takes the epic grand strategy franchise to ancient china around the end of the 2nd century the han dynasty has collapsed resulting in a civil war between a dozen characters who all want to become emperor this is the fifth total war game i ve played after shogun 2 rome 2 and both warhammers the good gameplay follows the same format that has proven successful in previous games manage the overall needs of your empire on the world map including recruiting armies capturing territory constructing buildings researching upgrades improving your economy and maintaining public order and then fight against enemy armies on the battlefield in pauseable real time combat involving thousands of soldiers including sword axe warriors spearmen cavalry archers crossbows and mounted archers there are 12 playable factions and each has a unique bonus which influences their playing style for example i played as sun jian who earns heroism by winning battles which can reduce army upkeep cost generals can be equipped with weapons armour mounts and other gear to make them stronger in combat and generals can be assigned to leadership positions in your court to provide empire wide bonuses as well as keeping them loyal to you enemy ai is usually quite good especially on the campaign map they would frequently attempt to capture my unguarded settlements instead of attacking me directly which gave me a few headaches with positioning my own armies the end game which has been a problem in some previous total war campaigns is strong in three kingdoms the campaign victory condition has two stages first you need to gain prestige points by winning battles capturing territory and constructing important buildings this will eventually allow your faction leader to become a king and the capital cities of the first three kings will become seats of power the second stage of the campaign requires a faction to simultaneously control all three cities to be declared emperor it took me 46 hours to complete the campaign the first 10 hours felt a bit underwhelming as i steamrolled over the han empire who had loads of territory but hardly any armies and most battles against basic garrisons ended in less than 5 minutes however when i started fighting against the full strength armies of the main factions the battles had the scale that i expected from a total war game after becoming a king the last 15 hours were really tough being at war with the two biggest factions who were also allied with each other and a third faction fighting multiple battles every turn and even though i won almost every battle there were so many enemy armies on the map that for a while it was difficult to actually push forward i controlled the entire south east quarter of the map but the other two seats were at the far north and north west so i needed to conquer almost the entire country it was exhausting and stressful but ultimately satisfying to finally win i was playing on normal difficulty diplomacy played a bigger role in my campaign than any other total war game i ve played after i recognised that i needed help to break the stalemate i secured an alliance with two other factions and they both sent multiple armies to help me win what became a 3v3 war there are more diplomatic options such as exchanging territories loot and arranged marriages in addition to the usual trade deals and treaties i didn t notice any bugs or crashes my framerate would occasionally dip into the 40s during large battles especially city sieges during winter turns with snow falling however this isn t a problem like it would be for a fast paced first person shooter the bad i did notice one obvious problem with the ai during battles when the ai is the attacker and they have a second army providing reinforcements they will immediately rush the first army forward instead of waiting to attack together this meant that i could usually defeat each army separately even if they outnumbered me overall i guess its because the defender wins if the battle timer runs out when the ai is the defender they will stay back and combine armies but i had it set to 60 minutes per battle which meant there was no need to rush each type of settlement town city farmland mine lumberyard etc seemingly only has one map layout and i fought over 100 battles during my campaign when you re fighting on the same maps over and over again it can start to feel a bit repetitive especially when each faction has very similar units so the same tactics will win most battles it wouldn t be as big of a problem in warhammer where the different races feel significantly different the recommendationoverall three kingdoms is a great game warhammer 2 is still my favourite total war but i enjoyed three kingdoms and i think most fans of total war would feel the same there s enough content and quality to justify a full price purchase my biggest complaints should be easy for the developers to fix if they wanted to
