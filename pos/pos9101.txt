2017 the best 4x space game i ever played it starts you off with your own solar system to explore and as you spread throughout the galaxy it is pretty much like every other 4x strategy game but then it transitions into grand strategy its certainly not as complex as the really big grand strategy games just yet lacking espionage options but what is in the game already is quite demanding once you took your first couple steps into the wide wide galaxy the game slowly but surely starts to shift where you were once concerned with exploration and expansion of your empire you are suddenly tasked with resource management diplomacy and politics balancing the needs of the factions within your own empire with the growing concerns for the security of your empire in an ever growing arms race with the other nations with dlc s adding even more layers on top such as mega structures like dysonspheres and ring world the ability to transform your people from biological to a machine race or mastering the control of the dna genetailoring your population add in juggling the handling of budding empires and species in various stages of their development expansion events such as subterran races incorporal beings traitorous spies or mundane headaches such as astroids on collision course with one of your many many planets you are helped in the task by your trusty governors to which you offload the handling of sectors of your empire which you then have the delegate tasks to decide how much of their resources they have to fork over to you and all sorts of things and as if that wasn t enough if you reach the end game you ll see yourself tasked with defending against robot uprisings ancient evils awakening or enemies from outside the known universe invading some of which you can decide to join to fight against the other races or you become the sole defender of the galaxy or you join together into a federation all you can do at that point is hope your research was up to the task and you build yourself some good ships which components you choose yourself to stand a chance against these end game crisis as if the other regular empires hadn t been enough to deal with with their 5 different government forms and their 16 possible civics from materialist to militarist to pacifist your government can be whatever you want it to be theocratic meritocracy no problem imperialist society ruled by a god emperor no problem even hiveminds are possible via dlc the options are staggering and intimidating at first there is quite a large learning curve to this game but its well worth it its not perfect but its near enough the dlc also adding quite interesting layers on top of an already good base game i definitely recommend you give the game a go if you like 4x or ever wanted to get into grand strategy this is the game for you well worth the price of admission even without a sale
