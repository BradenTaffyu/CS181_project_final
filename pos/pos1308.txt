2019 early access review there is a great game in here almost no bugs very large world to explore development cycle is really slow the devs are perfectionists they dont release anything with bugs in it but updates take a long time there is almost no story line or objectives beyond survive controls ui take some time getting used to camera angle is awkward when you walk around some buildings
