2017 while there isn t a lot that hasn t already been addressed in other positive reviews i feel obligated to address some of the negative reviews i continually see regarding the game s difficulty like any strategy oriented game divinity original sin 2 requires quite a bit of premeditation before entering combat to guarantee success outside of tactician mode anyway more on that later the game expects you to use the tools it gives you in each encounter though the largest issue i ve seen is when you enter a new section of the game before you go exploring to much it s almost mandatory to address the guaranteed difficulty creep by checking out any and all new gear skillbooks potions etc are available in whatever new social area you encounter with the game s economy being what it is having one character geared toward thievery and another set up with a significant amount of barter goes an incredibly long way toward alleviating the need to almost constantly upgrade your gear when entering a new section of the game the point i m making is that the game gives you all the tools you need to address any gear issues you might have the moment you set foot in a new town this goes for skill books as well as there is no limit to how many books you can learn as long as you have the commensurate ranks in the associated skill and sufficient memory slots to equip them anyway the tl dr of all that is the game gives you all the tools you need to prepare for difficult fights so long as you actually use them all that said the ai isn t a slouch it can and will abuse whatever environmental things are to hand and the devs have set up a great many of the fights to favor the enemies this means that as a player the onus is on you to think about the party you want to put together before just trying to breeze through the game there are so many ways to make strong characters in d os 2 that they re almost limitless what you can t do and expect to be successful is to just blindly charge into every fight and new situation with your d at full mast just a turn of phrase no offense intended ladies if that s the playstyle you re after there are a dozen diablo clones or arpgs out there that are better suited to that frame of mind d os2 has a turned based system for a reason and is incredibly rewarding just so long as you apply some forethought to engagements in fact it s easily the best rpg i ve played since the early 2000s in terms of gameplay panning a game for being difficult is a non starter especially when it s only as hard as you make it by lack of planning unless of course you re playing on tactician mode if you re doing that you deserve whatever mental anguish you re suffering from because that is almost entirely designed for masochists who like to sit bare assed on a saguaro cactus if that s you by all means buy stock in razor blades or whatever but i would seriously hope to not see any complaints about difficulty
