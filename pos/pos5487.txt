2015 early access review i stood at the entrance to red rock a forbidding stairway leading down into the dark taking a deep breath i prepared to enter an ow crud what the babboons the apes weren t happy obviously red rock was their home and screeching and throwing rocks they were making this displeasure obvious i readied my carbide sword and attempted to close but no their shrieks turned to ape chortles and they drew back still pelting rocks from every side as consciousness started waning i flicked open the artefact at my belt pushed the button on its spherical surface and threw the world went white my last thought screw you you darn dirty monkeys even a failure in qud is a story and it s been an enjoyable romp so far want to be a tinker exploring the secrets of the past but not being so hot at this fighting gig you re good want to be a mutant shooting flames from invisibility but secretly an outcast yup do able a no nonsense gunslinger well needs a bit of working towards as ammo is rare but there s a lot of stories in this game and while like many roguelikes it s permadeath and at first you aren t going to get very far you re definitely going to have some stories even at this release stage there s interesting things to do and places to explore recommended for roguelike fans and beware not everything can be killed by you in the early game so don t hesitate to run away if things get tough
