2021 so far in the amount of hours i put into this game i have been enjoying it there have been quite a few improvements over the previous iterations of car mechanic simulator i have some pros and cons ill mention pros and also new features added to the game ability to basically walk freely around your repair area gas station outside which is nice this feature was not present in cms18 at all new and added to cms 21 is new fluids such as windshield wiper fluid brake fluid power steering fluid and etc a new car wash station the ability to repair body parts as i don t think this was an option in cms18 besides the normal car parts cars handle much better now with controling them on tracks roads compared to cms18 rusted bolts which you have to spray wd 40 to get them to unscrew added a sandbox mode which is really nice cons really only two so far only 2 bay lifts in garage in cms18 there was an option to get 3 bays to have three seperate cars in your workshop not too sure why this was removed and taken out car wash is not really that interactive and you just click a button and it does it for you which i would rather be given the option to do it myself as irl with taking the hose soap and moving it around with my mouse all in all i would recommend this game to anyone who likes dealing with cars and repairing them and playing around with anything related to how a car functions and works you don t have to be a true mechanic to play this game if you have cms18 i would still pretty much say its worth getting cms21 as well i am sure existing and new mod cars are coming to the new version as well cms21 also seems highly more optimized and runs much better compared to cms18 and its first couple weeks at launch
