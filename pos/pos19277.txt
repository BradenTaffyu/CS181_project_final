2021 i ve been playing the age of empires series ever since i was a young child i recall specific memories of watching my dad play giant free for alls versus the ai and me running away and closing my eyes whenever he was under siege in my opinion age of empires 4 improves upon the multiple systems introduced throughout the franchise s history and create unique gameplay the devs have created an experience that allows for creativity strategy and difficulty only an age game could offer for example in age of mythology the egyptians were a unique civ which allowed their pharohs to buff a resource gathering point thus allowing resources to be gathered more quickly in this game a similar concept is seen in the holy roman empire hre with the prelate this civ focuses heavily on infantry and gold generation thanks to their bonuses when garrisoning relics another great example of unique and divergent gameplay would be with the rus who benefit by building specific structures close to large gatherings of trees the rus also generate gold whenever they kill an animal creating a civ who focuses on map control and early economic aggression killing sheep so that the enemy can t bring them back to their base killing deer and riding away with the carcasses etc at it s core age of empires 4 is a great experience and offers a lot of different gameplay options there is a great foundation for a fun time for players of any experience however this is not to say the game is without fault for new players who wish to play more competitively against others there is little to no in game training trying to show my friends how to do build orders or how things work who have never played has been somewhat difficult additionally the game has a lot of bugs balance issues at launch there were ways for civs like the rus to generate infinite gold with relics after the last patch which solved the aforementioned issue a new issue emerged where the abbasid dynasty can have infinite range on their infantry units i haven t run into people exploiting bugs in my time with the game but the consensus online is that it can really spoil the experience when playing overall i would recommend this game to anyone interested in getting into the wonderful world of real time strategy with enough unique mechanics to spice things up a dev team that is committed to their product and a community that is healthy and growing there is a lot to love just don t let the weird stuff get you down
