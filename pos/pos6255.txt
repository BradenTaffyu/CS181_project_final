as a fan of flight games i jumped into this one with high expectations after logging a significant number of hours as a pilot here are my thoughts arcade mode too simple for my tastethe game offers an arcade mode that s clearly designed for casual players or those new to flight games however i found it too easy and frankly a bit boring the simplified controls and forgiving flight physics didn t offer much of a challenge if you re looking for an adrenaline rush or a realistic flight experience this mode might leave you wanting more realistic mode the sweet spoton the other hand the realistic mode struck the right balance for me it offers a much more authentic flying experience without being overwhelmingly difficult this mode is where the game truly shines providing enough challenge to keep you engaged while still being accessible simulation mode not for the faint of heartthe simulation mode however was a different story i struggled a lot here the complexity and realism are on a whole other level it s definitely meant for hardcore flight sim enthusiasts and if you re not deeply familiar with aviation it can be tough to get anything done visuals a mixed bag on the runway but stunning in the airvisually the game might not blow you away on the runway the graphics seem a bit underwhelming at first glance but once you re airborne it s a completely different story the landscapes are breathtaking the effects are impressive and the aircraft models are incredibly realistic the sound effects also deserve special mention with a good pair of headphones the immersion is next level cost free but you ll be tempted to spendnow the game is free to play which sounds great right but here s the catch you ll likely end up spending money eventually after 300 hours of gameplay i ve finally reached rank 8 jets but it was at rank 5 where i caved and spent money to the snail i bought the a 10a for 60 euros and honestly it was worth every cent it significantly sped up my progress and made the game even more enjoyable considering that you d pay around the same for a standard game it didn t bother me at all final verdict highly recommendedin conclusion i can t recommend this game enough it s a fantastic experience especially if you enjoy flight simulations just be prepared the game may be free but you might find yourself reaching for your wallet to enhance the experience and trust me it ll be worth it graphics you forget what reality is beautiful good decent bad don t look too long at it ms dos gameplay very good good it s just gameplay mehh watch paint dry instead just don t audio eargasm very good good not too bad bad i m now deaf audience kids teens adults grandma they will remember pc requirements check if you can run paint potato decent fast rich boi ask nasa if they have a spare computer game size floppy disk old fashioned workable big will eat 10 of your 1tb hard drive you will want an entire hard drive to hold it you will need to invest in a black hole to hold all the data difficulty just press w easy easy to learn hard to master significant brain usage difficult dark souls grind nothing to grind only if u care about leaderboards ranks isn t necessary to progress average grind level too much grind you ll need a second life for grinding or feed the snail story no story some lore average good lovely it ll replace your life game time long enough for a cup of coffee short average long to infinity and beyond price it s free worth the price if it s on sale if u have some spare money left not recommended you could also just burn your money bugs never heard of minor bugs can get annoying ark survival evolved the game itself is a big terrarium for bugs
