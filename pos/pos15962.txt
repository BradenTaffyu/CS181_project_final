2021 the 20 15 whatever price tag may seem steep when looking at a tabletop simulator but this will be one of the greatest investments of your life there are literal hundreds of big name board games as well as indie options i did the math looking at the retail price of all the games i downloaded from the workshop and it came to a value of roughly 2216 1900 2514 us and that didn t even include all of them considering most big box board games nowadays retail for 40 80 each plus expansions this should be a no brainer that isn t even including the fact that you can play with friends around the world opening these new opportunities to try out these games when you may not know enough people close enough to you to participate a hand full of indie board game creators have even officially started scripting their games on here for people to try them out before buying looking at you don t let it die you guys are awesome the level of the scripting automated parts of the game which walk you through it on the majority of boards is shocking and it is sometimes hard to believe that these are mods and not paid dlc if i were to give some recommendations of games which work exceptionally well on here and for you to get a sense of scale of just how many games are offered concept monopoly trivial pursuit game of life mysterium carcassonne pandemic munchkin scrabble don t let it die unlock candyland guess who sorry ticket to ride exploding kittens uno elixir if you speak french yahtzee any tabletop rpgs this game was basically made for d d as well as hundreds of games that i probably haven t even tried yet myself none of these costed me anything again this isn t paid dlc this is free workshop items aside from certain workshop items which are unofficial to the actual game and usually more to do with shoddy scripting or image hosting not working i have yet to encounter anything even resembling a bug or glitch in this game it s also worth noting that i have absolutely never had any experience in any sort of mod or workshop coding yet i managed to edit an entire deck of cards to better suit my needs and it was so ridiculously easy though long merely due to the number of cards i had to edit the tools for working with these scripts is so simple even an idiot like me could get it lol i cannot emphasise enough how much i enjoy this game and appreciate my past self for investing in it
