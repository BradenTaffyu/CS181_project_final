2017 early access review even in early access d os2 will drop you into a world filled with interesting characters fantastic writing and tough decisions i ve already sunk a lot of time into the alpha playing and replaying to explore the different characters areas and playstyles d os1 was one of my favourite games of the year despite a few drawbacks and the sequel already promises to exceed its predecessor if you want an rpg with a rich deep story and wonderful gameplay you re in safe hands with larian studios
