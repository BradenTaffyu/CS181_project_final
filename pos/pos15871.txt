it s hard to really encapsulate how playing the game feels it s somehow both therapeutic and meditative at the same time the mechanics are so simple you just wash stuff from musty old cars to grimy homes to disgusting fairground rides one only has to look at my whopping 130 hours to see how engrossing it is you get lost in the work listening to the sounds of the water on the other hand there s no music whatsoever and this is probably an understandable design choice we all feel motivated by different things and so allowing us to listen to whatever including the silence is something i m okay with in fact the first few wash jobs i don t think i listened to anything beyond the spraying water the core game goes on a surprisingly long time with all sorts of neat things to scrub clean with your angry jets of water on top of that there s a number of side jobs that unlock as you progress through the main game as well as several free dlc job packs for other square enix the publishers property tomb raider with lara croft s mansion and grounds and stuff related to final fantasy vii the tomb raider one was incredibly nostalgic for me taking me back to when i played the old games back in the day there s also a number of paid dlc packs that i haven t purchased so your mileage may vary with them definitely look at their own reviews and screenshots and see if they appeal to you
