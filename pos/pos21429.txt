2021 best forza horizon game to date especially with the improvements to the graphics and vehicle sounds editing this review for a ton more information hope it s not overwhelming pros looks incredible when everything loads correctly see below vehicle sounds are a huge step in the right direction especially with vehicle upgrades changing things even more to make each car sound unique extremely fun whether it be cruising around the map looking for xp boards or racing along the coast the map is pretty big and all the different areas make exploring incredibly fun lots of things to do i won t be getting bored of this game any time soon cons the graphics have a few bugs such as some pop in and some clay looking textures the online play has been rough but they recently fixed a bug where constant disconnects would happen just wish there was a better system to get together with friends in free roam horizon arcade formerly forzathon live sucks right now it is very hard to find people to complete the events and when you do some of the requirements for said events are extremely hard a few models for the cars are dated s15 for example some accolades require playing eliminator not really a con i just hate battle royale modes d final conclusion the pros outweigh the cons significantly this is pretty much the best open world racing game you can play to date i ve been pretty addicted to this game and have had a blast so far if some of the cons i listed above get changed fixed i can see this game being an easy 10 10 but for now i give it a 9
