2023 are you hungry do you like evolving stories written in the blood of your enemies are you mentally and emotionally stable if you can answer any of these questions you should already be playing rimworld rimworld i m not capitalizing the w every time is a game made by a man named tynan and his cohorts for the express purpose of wasting all of your free time and is one of the few games made to sell a book a soundtrack and a cute plushie but what is rimworld well judging by my meager almost 700 hours i don t know and that concerns me every time i play i black out and come to several hours later with blood on my hands and a pristine prison with very happy slaves so far the police haven t caught me but i m not holding my breathin rimworld you are the proprietor of a small group of nuggets colloquially known as pawns each with strengths and differences depending on their personality divided between a childhood and adulthood depending on your pawn s traits you ll have a completely different experience between groups from pyromaniacs to sanguine mountain lovers to flesh eating cannibals but before you pick your pawns you need to pick your storyteller rimworld is a game that lies and says its a fictional story generator so is the insert disliked political group but we re all just playing games at the end of the day being as such we need a storyteller without glorious mods we have three default cassandra classic phoebe chillax and randy cassandra works in a similar way to the director in left 4 dead she ll generate events that present a constant stress until hitting you with something big then relaxing for a while just because she s listed first doesn t make her easy phoebe while more relaxing than cassandra can still be just as difficult however she tends to leave more time between large raids for you to build back finally the one you ll choose randy random he doesn t care about you he doesn t care about your colony he just wants to send 10 stacks of corn from the sky on a daily basis your storyteller will make the events happen but your response to them is what makes your story after picking randy you can generate your worldyou ll generate a world based off a keyword and you ll have to choose a tile to start on choosing where you start is an artform and just like ai generated art will probably end up killing you some day wherever you choose you ll likely be somewhat close to another faction which will also end up killing you some day while there are many types of faction being near neutral or friendly factions is probably better than raiders however you ll deprive yourself of the easy food source raider corpses are wherever you choose whichever pawns you pick you ll start with next to nothing but the clothes on your pawns backs and a smattering of materials you ll want to start planning out a base ordering your pawns to do productive tasks to bring your colony into existence is a long journey and if you picked cassandra you ll be dead in ten days anyway from the wild pack of man eating squirrels rapidly approaching your location so you better start planning that graveyard too start with a building for everyone to sleep of which will need to be roofed with beds or at least sleeping spots for everyone a stove for cooking those squirrels will help too plan out a growing area on good fertile soil for some crops to have renewable food without having to compete with that brown bear living in the southeast corner plan out the weed farm make a few more buildings for production and research and keep building up when those squirrels finally come for you you might just be able to survive it unlikely but rome wasn t built in a day tending your pawns needs for recreation food and rest are important a happy pawn is a pawn that isn t killing your other pawns because he didn t get breakfast in time however pawns are generally easily entertained they re quite content with missing the horseshoe pin by a mile and stabbing their fingers off with that knife game thing better materials weapons and tools comes with higher expectations so constantly improving your recreation facilities and overall base is a must to keep pawns from the whole aforementioned killing each other eventually you ll experience random events from bandit raids to randy s corn rain to every squirrel on the map going mad and chewing off your pawn s toes prepare for everything and somehow you ll still find a way to fail failure tells a good story just like triumph and you can t buy tynan s book without understanding that however there is a win condition several in fact i ll leave those for you to find however you ve grown quite fond of this place haven t you maybe you should stay a little while longer 200 hours in you ll understand why 20 hours in you thought this game would be addicting after 2 hours much like crack you ll probably want to take a cold shower after you find out the horrible things you did during that brief high at work the next day you ll be unconsciously humming the relaxing music and waiting to get home to play a few hours those few hours will turn to days those days weeks your job will fire you your family will call you and you won t answer because you re watching your crafter build a shiny new bionic leg because your best soldier and your pacifist medic got into an argument about the squirrels and the soldier headbutted your medic s leg so hard it exploded which caused her to take opium for the pain which caused her addiction to opium but we don t have any opium so now she s having a tantrum and her only way to blow off steam is to punch your live mortar shells until they expl and that s how i lost my first colony maybe this game is about story generation that or tynan just wants me to buy his damn book either way i give rimworld my highest recommendation you didn t deserve the lifespan you spend playing it much like myself tynan does however and he ll live forever with them at the end of the day you ll tell some wild ass stories to your very confused coworkers a game so good that i decided to buy it after playing for 200 ish hours along with all the expansions it s just that good my only criticism being its made by canadians whom don t exist a final note while you can definitely tell its a unity game its well optimized and doesn t have those weird audio issues i ve personally had with other unity games it s also very moddable with hundreds of fantastic mods on the smeme workshop and the developer s forums including a multiplayer mod for all you friend havers play it buy tynan s book skip your funeral to play more rimworld repeat the cycle
