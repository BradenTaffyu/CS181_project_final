2020 for fans of sci fi it is an absolutely marvelous game it takes everything you love about science fiction and throws it all into a blender to create many worlds of endless possibilities while some mechanisms might be very generic the fact that you can do pretty much anything that you ve seen in other sci fi movies and games it makes up for it i will say however that it feels like some dlc s feel like must haves specifically utopia and apocalypse they add many gameplay elements and ways to play that may not be all that viable in the base game still though the base game gives you enough to chew and gives you plenty of hours of entertainment i highly recommend
