2019 i had a pet fox named burger burger was my pride and joy some could even say he was my reason to live and he was very fond of one of the colonists she was also very fond of him she was always happy because burger was around i had many pets at that time including a pair of camels that were constantly puking but that is not the question here burger was living a simple life half pet half independent free to roam around the map he stayed with us for many years and i was pretty happy i built him a sweet pillow to sleep on in my colonist s room she was actually kind of depressed and had some weird feelings i think it s because she was in love with another dude who didn t care about her or whatever what an idiot she was pretty nice but burger was always there for her one day i was busy overviewing some stupid and i got an alert burger was being attacked by a warg if you don t know what wargs are they re basically fat deformed wolves very agressive and i hate them he got attacked and by the time i could get to him he was unfortunately already dead i got my guys to execute the warg gangster style i m not sure what it means but let me believe they did and i built a jade sarcophagus for burger my colonist was sad as heck for many many many months i was also genuinely sad like i had to pause playing for a bit and i had to go for a smoke and reflect upon life and universe and stuff i couldn t load the game because i went for a smoke and forgot to pause so the autosave went on and burger was gone forever he had a better tomb than 95 of any other colonist i ever had in my multiple playthroughs and every single year my colonist would go see his tomb light up the torches and cry for burger for a few hours then she would go on her life as usual and frankly guys this got me crying she never ever discussed burger with anybody else it was just her own thing whenever she would take a moment off to go mourn him i d kinda be annoyed at first and then remembered what it was for so i would give her the rest of the day off i won t forget you burger buy this game it s a less autistic version of dwarf fortress but it has incredible depth
