2021 i ll start off by saying rpgs are my all time favourite type of games and i consider them my specialty this game always managed to get my attention and curiosity when first i heard about it before it came out but i confess i wasn t sure my investment would be fruitful now i m happy to say that doubt was easily put to rest this game is a true masterpiece of its genre and in my opinion everyone should experience it it s impressive how the world in this rpg feels so fluid so alive and so reactive you have plenty of options throughout every single thing you need want to accomplish either storywise characterwise or sidequestwise no npc for example is unkillable you can certainly kill whoever you want or at least try to and expect consequences with all your actions this alone is rare these days in modern rpgs and is beautifully implemented in this game the gameplay is as fluid as the world and the game runs very smoothly with gorgeous graphics the sound design music and voice acting are top notch and now that i ve seen what larian managed to do here i just dream all games do the same the main menu music theme is a masterpiece on its own as well and the narrator as well as pretty much all characters does an outstanding job hey even one of the main recurring villains who you can kill during the first act by the way and therefore will change the story in a very flavoured way managed to get me on to her side i really have no words to describe how much these characters pulled me into the world of rivellon the companions you meet and help do feel like real people and you can develop relationships with them enmity friendship or love allowing you to not only have an impact in the story overall but also in their own personal lives for all of this i recommend this game to anyone anyone it s truly money well spent and larian just got me in anything they do now can t wait for baldur s gate 3 to release and the different endings oh my divine are they all fantastic now you may have noticed that i haven t mentioned combat yet that s because i hate everything combat related in this game but in no way does this make the game worse for me i just learnt to deal with it if you wish to know why i don t like the combat here do read on but know that regardless of how badly i write about this i still think dos2 is a 10 10 game right my hate for combat rests on 4 fundamental pillars ap action points armours yes plural environmental effects yeah i know unpopular opinion but the key word here is opinion and it s mine and lastly but not least important initiative i don t think it makes much sense to use 1 entire ap to move 1 inch when it takes the same amount of ap to cast a teleport skill for instance how would a character not be able to cast a spell while moving an inch i think the ap system is too agressive here especially in higher difficulties i m glad bg3 is true to the d d ruleset in this regard secondly i know the physical and magic armours were introduced after criticism of the first dos game and it is a mechanic i welcome despite hating it because it tries to respond to something that didn t go very well in the first game according to the majority however i d give up my divinity not to have to deal with that and have the game balanced any other way in the game s defence it s perfectly playable with how this mechanic works i just don t like it thirdly why in all existence does the floor in every single minor or major battle have to be on fire on acid on cursed ice water venom cursed fire or any other of the bazillion types of floor effects there is in the game seriously this happens all the time and quicker than you can even imagine especially a pain to deal with because your party tends to start the fight all close to each other so they all get hit by the same damned aoe that will remain there for the whole battle it feels like the enemies try to paint every square inch of floor with some type of hazard it s just so much to bear why does every single fight need to be like this i just want to hack some people to pieces oh well now my last point initiative or lack thereof in a way you see initiative in this game is not true initiative because the game forces your party to act in between of enemies turns so if all my characters roll the highest in initiative the second highest will be the third to act in the fight and the third highest will be the fifth and so on because the enemies that rolled the highest on their initiative are being put between my party and more often than not the enemy is the first to act anyways in spite of the massive 40 or 45 you may have in the stat that allows you to act first so you see why i hate combat in dos2 but i know people who love it and it is perfectly understandable the combination of these 4 aspects just doesn t get me excited about an upcoming fight anyways not to end on a negative note i ll say again this game is totally worth every single penny you ll pay for it and in no way shape or form do i regret either getting the game or the collectors bonuses lore art that kind of stuff and although the combat here is not really for me the game overall as a whole truly is don t even wait for a sale if you don t have it just buy it now you won t regret it if you already have it why haven t you finished it yet you have well finish it again
