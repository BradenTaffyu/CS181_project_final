2018 stellaris is my second most favourite paradox game sorry stellaris ck2 takes the cake on the best but anyway stellaris is a grand strategy game where unlike crusader kings 2 or europa universalis 4 you don t pick out of the preset empires or nations you can make your own alien species and conquer the galaxy or be a happy peaceful nation or if you are boring play the pre made empires and do i don t know boring things now this game is pretty great i haven t heard of any other game where i can play as peaceful psionic space snails that are galatic peacekeepers or play as a xenophobic war hungry monkey man and just smash the galaxy into pieces but i give stellaris 7 snails out of 10 as 15nzd for some portraits and 1 new ship type is very money hungry
