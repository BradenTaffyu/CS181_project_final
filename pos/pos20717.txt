2023 after more than two decades of waiting we can finally step into the wizarding world that statement alone might suffice as a review in itself but i m not one to keep things that brief so let me elaborate the developers promised us a game in which we can explore an open world comprised of hogwarts and its surroundings stories and places that may not be actual harry potter canon but they re about as close as it gets i was a bit worried about this before playing the game but i can safely say that they succeeded managing to avoid the blatant kind of fan service it would have been all too easy to land in that pitfall and create a story with an old wise and mysterious headmaster a grumpy and unlikeable potions teacher who turns out to be a good guy a half giant teaching beasts class etc but the teachers you will meet here all feel original their job the only thing they share with their modern age successors the world feels unique and familiar at the same time the aspects that resonate are those tied to hogwarts lore recreated with care notable locations houses ghosts portraits and the like but it stops there you won t be bumping into a kid dumbledore in this game and that s a plus in my book exploration in hogwarts legacy should be pure bliss through and through for any harry potter fan from hogwarts to hogsmeade and the highlands puzzles are also entertaining although i had a frustrating experience when one of them bugged out and became unsolvable until i finally realized that and restarted the quest combat feels dynamic and fun despite being on the easy side this was probably a deliberate choice to accommodate younger players as well as hp fans who may not be hardcore gamers that being said the final boss fight is challenging so you ll want to gear up before going there i recommend playing with a controller as 16 combat spells can be easily assigned and used quickly with a little practice they all have their specific merits but come with a hefty cooldown time so as a result you ll light up the battlefield with a nice variation of spells just like a real wizard would instead of spamming the same move over and over again as it often happens in similar games that use a mana based system i can t say how grateful i am to the developers for avoiding the concept of mana entirely as it wouldn t fit in well with the hp canon after spending over 70 hours in the game fights still feel epic and satisfying to me despite being aware that there is no way i might lose an extra difficulty level over hard would be appreciated perhaps in a future update on another positive note the game is very kid friendly my five year old daughter frequently awaits her turn to take the controller and ride a mount or interact with the cute animals my sons are a bit older and they can play the whole game on their own all that being said some people are apparently less than thrilled with the game and i think i can understand why while walking the corridors of hogwarts students often chit chat but there are no interactions with the main character on occasion unique events unfold which are usually solved by a figure of authority but the player is left without any role to play it s more akin to watching a movie scene than being an active participant these events could have been done differently to allow the main character to make a choice that could impact the outcome of the event and the future status of the same minor npcs like we see in other rpgs now on to the primary point of criticism the story the central plot is passable and the side quests thankfully involve some narrative unlike the kill bring a number of whatevers type of quests often seen in other games when the writers run out of ideas that alone is commendable given the sheer number of side quests none of the characters come across as one dimensional and each appears to carry a certain depth but sadly that depth often goes unexplored due to the storylines simplicity there is no romance in the game which i don t consider a drawback as i always opt for romance free playthroughs myself narrative wise you won t find anything here that lives up to the standards of the original harry potter books but that was to be expected sebastian s side story stands out as both the darkest and the best one of them all and was the only one that genuinely made me ponder over my choices while it doesn t reach j k rowling s heights it does possess the quality of an above average hp fan fiction my only complaint is something i cannot explain without a spoiler skip ahead to the last paragraph if you want to avoid it there is a scene in which sebastian suggests you use your unique ability to help his sister by removing her sense of pain at this point in the story the consequences are not known this should have been explored further giving you the chance to decide whether to do so risking either the consequences or sebastian s anger in conclusion if you re a fan of harry potter there is a high chance you ll appreciate hogwarts legacy however your enjoyment will also hinge on why you loved the hp books in the first place if the plot twists and relatable character interactions were the only aspects you liked you may find the game somewhat underwhelming but if like me you were captivated by the intricate world building and eagerly pieced together the functioning of the wizarding world from the clues the books provided keeping tabs on spells creatures places potions historical events etc then this game is definitely for you go on fulfill your long held dream and have a taste of student life at hogwarts
