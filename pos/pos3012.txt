2020 you are the chosen one ffsi m not sure how to feel about this game on one hand i absolutely loved it there were some amazing moments quests fights on the other hand i hated some aspects which almost ruined the game for me i wasn t a fan of the first game it felt too restricted and all that wall of text without voice overs was tiring to read what i liked the combat is nice all the fights are unique it s not a typical rpg where you fight same enemies every 30 seconds here every fight in unique you encounter different enemies each time i love this i wish more rpg s would go this path instead of forcing you click x to kill same enemy thousand times combat possibilities are pretty wide there are plenty of skills and magic and you can combine attacks to inflict huge amount of damage like for example summon rain and then launch thunder at the enemies you must use your strengths and exploit enemy weaknesses environment also plays a huge role it can work to your advantage or bring you death combat really has a lot of tactical choices the fight are also very long sometimes it could take an hour the game offers few classes and races fane being my favorite depending on which one you choose at the start you ll get different dialogue options each race has its own background but skills do not depend on the race i loved this i like choosing a race i like and build my character however i want divinity original sin 2 is quite humorous game sometimes it s hard to take the story seriously and i m really tired of these generic stories guess what you are the chosen one go save the world but fortunately side quests and its story lines makes up for it these are where all the fun is funny dialogues many surprises and decisions to make the world is really crazy you only see similar stuff in jrpg s talking animals plants and other beings squirrel following you around cows rats sharks cats it s like a zoo simulator only animals can talk the world is full of npc s and each of them has something to say even animals have their names but there s more after some time ghosts appear and you can talk to them there s so many npc s that it would be hard to count and each of them is voiced there are also romance options i chose sebille and that was one of the best romance scenes simple yet so beautiful now what i didn t like sometimes not all the time thankfully unlike in the first game the game lacks guidance yeah i get it hardcore rpg need no guidance hurr durr i don t care give me the option and let others disable it if they don t want that i had a walkthrough open for half the quests i don t want to waste my time running around not knowing where to go and here comes another thing i dislike this game makes an illusion it s open world and you have freedom but it s not it s pretty linear there are zones and each zone has different leveled enemies so basically you can t explore you can t stray from the predetermined path or you ll be dead game doesn t tell you where to go so you go to one place see high level enemies turn back and try to go elsewhere until you finally find the right way it s just waste of time the game is very restricted and only offers one or two paths where you allowed to go there are no level indication next to quests so you open a walkthrough and see if it s worth bothering doing a certain quest at your level why another restriction i don t like is that you re given an illusion that you are free to choose your build however you like but in reality you have no choice but to build your characters as the game requires otherwise you ll have a lot of trouble in combat if your party is not balanced well easy difficulty is a joke just like in the first game it s way too hard the difficulty spikes are insane you die you learn you needed to take that skill instead of another or learn a certain spell you teleport to your ship and go respec until next major fight that s not how it should work i don t want to respec every few hours so yeah i hate these restrictions and predetermined paths there s no freedom the graphics are really good the game is very colorful and looks pretty cute at times a huge improvement over first game performance is great the game isn t demanding at all sound is something many games lack compared to this voice acting is amazing and there are so many dialogues with so many voices and accents really really great job larian i hate reading all that small text i rather relax and listen soundtrack is pretty good too the music never gets boring even when you hear same tune over and over again overall a good rpg worth the price it s long but many hours are spent wandering around figuring things out and wasting your time but even if you take that out it s still pretty long and has tons of content quality content although it s too restrictive and there s not enough freedom difficulty is way over the top but the side quests great combat and beautiful world makes up for it prosgreat voice
