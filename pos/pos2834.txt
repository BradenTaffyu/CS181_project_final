2022 i don t even know how to describe how much i love this game as someone who cannot handle anything that requires instant reactions during gameplay this turn based save scumming game was so very stress free you could literally walk away from the screen mid battle cook some maggi mee eat it and return to continue your fight without worrying about a thing if you re playing it for the first time i recommend that you do it alone without friends so that you can fully savour the game as a whole talk to npcs get dragged into random plots and if you choose particularly troublesome companions get ready to fight persuade your way out of everything curse you ifan your deeply attractive voice doesn t make up for the fact that you re probably the worst companion to have i also highly recommend that you save murderhobo ing for your subsequent replays stat your persuasion and you can get through almost everything once you go lone wolf you ll never believe in the four man party system again i ve replayed this game about three to four times now and i m close to finishing honour mode every time i replay this game there s always some new tiny detail i find i e if you enslave the boat you re hooking up with your love interest in the crappy room not the deluxe suite or items i never realised were in game the whole time e g the faithful armour set in arx or some other awesome aspect i e adding corbin day to the boat and upgrading all your unique items despite the fact that there s pretty much only one main storyline this game has amazing replayability it s a near perfect game i highly recommend it
