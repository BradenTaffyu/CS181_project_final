2017 early access review i ve only had this game for a few days but i m impressed i ll start with the negatives and then go into why i like the game negatives graphics and animations are dated do not enable 3rd person for your own sanity zombie spawns can be occasional bs like spawning in the same house as you that you just cleared water flowing system is janky af some ai movement can be quite goofy circle running gun mechanics are ok zooming seems a little offpostives wealth of content hunger and thirst mechanics that work and the food crafting is meaningful and on point illness mechanics that make sense and make you take important risks temperature mechanics that make sense you need appropriate clothing for the weather wetness mechanics and drying structural physics system means things can collapse if you build them without proper supports zombies are imposing just one basic zombie can wreck you if you are bad at kiting or shooting tower defense zombies can call other zombies to you including hordes so you better build traps and get ready to fight lots of enemy types zombies bears dogs wolves vultures screamers pukers hunting system for food and clothes crafting is on point you can queue crafts in your craft bar and go back ot what you were doing while they buildall in all i would say that i like the soul of this game more than anything it looks like the devs are having fun and making the game they want to make i picked this game up when it was on sale but i would recommend it at its current price
