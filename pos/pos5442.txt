2015 early access review an absolutely fascinating post apocalyptic murder simulator with you either the lucky murderer murderess or as the unlucky victim this game has some ups and downs that will always come with random generation things like if you see white ruin walls don t go there until either you ve leveled up your mutations more or found some kickbutt armor and weapons because they can have things like psychic mutants that explode your head as soon as you get close enough rifle turret machines albino apes and other nasties the greatest thing about this game is the flexibility of its combat system though slightly hampered by targeting and control of your mind controlled allies i m about 50 characters in and i still find some new wrinkle or interesting ability mutation i haven t tried before yet in combination i still have yet to reach the very edges of the map or indeed the second main dungeon the questline but i ve experienced a goodly portion of the main game enough to evaluate it for a review of course there s always the chance that by the time this gets read the game has changed one of the thing you might overlook is the defects don t almost all of them are entertaining and guaranteed to make a playthrough more interesting variety is the spice of life my last character took the defect packrat where you have to carry almost all of your carrying capacity or take damage and you have to wait 10 turns if you want to get rid of something so basically every rpg hoarder ever except with an ingame mechanic taking the defect let me take a 4 point mutant skill i picked a paralyzing stinger on my back just as an example of how it can make your game interesting and different if the game ever gets so difficult it s completely unfun for you turning off permadeath is only a click away in the options menu doing so invites a friendly did you mean to die menu the game is rich and textured though not every game will reveal its secrets only in the first hours it s only after you ve really begun to sink your teeth into the quests find a mysterious man frozen in glass in a dungeon find yourself reloading your shotgun to blast off another accursed thatch of qudzu which has the ability to rust your gear off out of the way beguile an eyeless crab to join you that you might realize you re having a lot of fun watch out for those slumberlings and rifle turrets and fire ants pressing l whenever you see a new creature is always recommended sound there s no sound as of yet i recommend using the steam music player for now the crypt of the necrodancer soundtrack or heroine s quest are good for putting on in the background graphics with a baked in crt scanlines interface the tileset is nicely stylized after a while they won t seem so strange after you figure out what you re looking at they re not top of the line that would probably go to cogmind but they re serviceable and a step above the original cluttered ascii of the free version gameplay incredibly deep no two games even with the same character build will play the same and there s just so many different kinds of ways to play which is good because until you turn off permadeath you ll probably be trying out lots of things writing the writing is very erm unique sometimes a little trippy out there with the descriptions but its very descriptive you won t feel like you re reading a book but there s enough of it that it feels like a dungeon master s lovingly crafted attention to detail of a world they love to write for it s hard not to recommend this game it can really only improve from here one feature i wish it had was more villages villages are really rare making the game feel a little empty sometimes
