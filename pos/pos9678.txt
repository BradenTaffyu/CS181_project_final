2023 i had a cool doctor in my colony but he got old and lost his hearing i decided to replace his ears with bionic ones but i didn t notice that he was a body purist who hated artificial body parts while he was lying on the operating table and recovering from the surgery a huge raid happened the raiders built siege weapons and attacked us with rockets and mortars i managed to fight them off but one of my colonists died it was the doctor s spouse the doctor woke up with pain grief and anger he dug up his spouse s corpse and brought it to the main hall where he laid it on a table this made everyone else unhappy and stressed one of my colonists was a cannibal and he was hungry and wounded from the raid he saw the corpse on the table and decided to eat it this triggered a mental breakdown in the doctor who attacked the cannibal they started a brawl that soon involved other colonists one of my colonists was a pyromaniac and he was also stressed and angry he grabbed a flamethrower and started to set everything on fire the fire spread quickly and engulfed most of the base the doctor had an infection from the surgery and he was bleeding and feverish he was also the best doctor in the colony so no one else could treat him properly he died on the floor surrounded by flames and blood by the time a mysterious stranger in a cloak came to help us when everyone was downed and helpless it was too late most of the base was burned down and most of the colonists were dead or dying the only survivor was the drug addict who had taken all the drugs in the colony and wandered off to a meadow he died there peacefully rimworld is a perfect story generator
