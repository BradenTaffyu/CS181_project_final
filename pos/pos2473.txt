2020 product received for free i m a bethesda fan at launch i was really sad about fallout 76 i woun t ever consider getting the game at launch but what about the updates well after this free weekend i did try to test the game a fix in my network honestly i did like the game it s a lot better than i would expect hm i do think fallout new vegas it s the better fallout yet but fallout 76 survival aspect it s more enjoyable than fallout 4 vanilla the npcs i found while playing the game aren t bad the ghoul mort i really liked his dialogues unfortunely for me i do have some lags which are my end problem not the game fault optimization wise i do think it s good didn t stress my pc and i used a hdd for loading test purpose and loads okish you can actually grind atom points and buy stuff without spend your own money i get like 200 atom points with 1 5hrs and with this i could already buy some skins stuff so i didn t found the daily challenges grind burdensome etc in the end is it worth in sale with a decent network if you don t meet those requeriments i would recommend modding fallout 4 nv instead
