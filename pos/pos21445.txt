2023 reliable review from a player who has played both forza 4 and 5 forza 5 pros bigger map more cars content etc better graphics tires make more smoke when drifting some car engines sound better in fh4 some engines sound too artificial forza 4 pros i felt like drift physics are just better in fh4 for me great britain map feels more interesting to explore as it focuses on urban landscape rather than rural mexican free roam feels just better overall if you prefer graphics over actual gameplay get fh5 fh4 has better gameplay and graphics are also not bad if you prefer urban landscape more fh4 is for you if you enjoy more rural part of mexico fh5 is for you if you have played forza 4 i wouldn t suggest to upgrade to forza 5 wait for forza 6 regardless both games are great and worth their price
