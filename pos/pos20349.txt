an absolute game of the year contender balatro is by far the best indie game i have played in 2024 the gameplay loop is satisfying and keeps you coming back for run after run i tend to like roguelikes even if they re not very good but balatro has kept my attention longer than any roguelike has since enter the gungeon if you have even a passing interest in poker or roguelikes you owe it to yourself to give it a shot
