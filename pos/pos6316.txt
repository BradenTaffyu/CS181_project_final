2021 this game makes me feel lots of emotions i desperately cling on to this game but it is a love hate relationship it peer pressures me to play it over and over and over again yet it causes me so much pain sometimes this game is the worst thing in my life my brain explodes when i lose and lose and lose because of uptiers and tanks that will just steam roll me this game is so but it is so good the dopamine boost i gain is satisfactory and i lust for more every singe target destroyed keeps inviting me to sell my soul to gaijin even more that snail is the love of my life my worst enemy every single gaijined moment is like a slap to my face yet i play it every time my teammates play like absolute brain damaged idiots i struggle to even comprehend how i live my life knowing i play this game yet i play it i must keep unlocking new tanks you should too
