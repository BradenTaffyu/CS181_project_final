2020 to put it short this game is fantastic for gt3 racing first off this game has been compared very frequently to iracing but i believe that its not a fair comparison as its more so comparing apples to oranges acc is currently purely focused on gt3 racing and emulating that while iracing is suited for many different kinds of championships the multiplayer is great in this game the races themselves are fun and there are a lot of open lobbys to join during the day and night what i would like to see in terms of multiplayer being added is a sort of amateur pro am pro competition type servers this would mean that the amateur competition servers do still have a standard of required driver rating to join but would be a step to getting your feet wet into the competitive races another hiccup that i find with this game is that the frequency of these competitive server races is that these are not frequent enough moving on from the multiplayer aspect the physics and tire models are very ironed out and feel extremely realistic in particular when the brakes are cold or the tires you can feel yourself getting more grip over the course of the lap intertwined with this is also the track evolution where you will find yourself being able to take different lines over the course of a race as the track gets more rubbered in the detail in the tracks being laser scanned and the scenery in combination with the graphics makes this game a truly immersive experience and makes you yearn for cutting those tenths off your laptime and improving the career mode itself feels a bit lacklustered not having much depth except for the typical championship race weekend style gameplay but i can not think of how this could be changed seeing as in the essence of it it is a racing game after all good selection of cars and the sound is probably the closest you will come to the sound of a real gt3 car if you dont believe me compare the sounds of a car in game versus the in real life counterpart i would 100 recommend this game to anyone who has a racing rig and enjoys driving gt3 cars the forcefeedback feels complete and i can feel when i am overdriving the car or am about to understeer oversteer if you are using a thrustmaster wheel the ffb settings on default were at 333hz which felt a bit lacking depth and moreso being too rough to get out the fine details after setting it to 111hz it felt like i was able to really feel every bump and surface of the road individually
