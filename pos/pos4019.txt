2019 this is one of those games you can play relatively casually and have fun for ten hours or so just finish the main game as the class that suits you most or you can go deeper and try to complete the real game which requires some preparation and luck then you can go deeper and do it for every class then you can have enhanced ascension difficulty enabled most importantly you ll have fun all the way it s not one of those impenetrable deep games where you have to play for hours to appreciate it anyway it s a card collection game you can call it roguelike cause you re supposed to play without save load and death is permanent you make your way through fights and choose your own adventure events getting cards artifacts and potions that you use in battles getting the cards you want is not guaranteed so some improvisation is needed it also means that even without meta knowledge you can make a decent progress with what you re getting it s even quite likely to beat the game on your first try battles are turn based and remind me of older final fantasy games in that you combine a lot of status effects and ridiculous combos to beat your enemies it s an overall pleasing experience and it s hard for me to imagine anyone who wouldn t like it it s up there with games like ftl or into the breach or invincible inc or desktop dungeons great to play for just several hours yet the systems support greater challenges for dozens of hours get this game
