2022 this is a good successor to age of empires 2 it returns to those familiar roots in some ways yet branches out into new territory for the series it has had some technical issues but i really like the directions they ve taken with this installment the only aspect that feels deficient is the number of civilizations there are only eight currently but they each offer very different play styles it is undoubtedly a difficult process to attempt to balance entirely new ways of playing the game but i m sure there will be more eventually i look forward to them
