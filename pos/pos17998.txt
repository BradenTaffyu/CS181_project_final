2021 the second rome entered the scene as a game of gigantic proportions it takes hundreds of hours to conquer it it took me an estimated more than a thousand hours i don t know the exact time as i played the game offline at work the atmosphere during the campaign but especially the battles is fantastic no the soldiers can t look like from crysis there are not fifty of them but several thousand and the fighting commotion is accompanied by excellent sound as you approach the unit you hear soldiers commenting or shouting centurions not just at the general s opening speeches but all the time the soldiers react to the situation and make a vivid impression of course it is not possible for such a complex game system to remain error free the problem is that the faction does not end with the conquest of the last city the armies remain even though they are starving and trying to recapture a city and if even a small fragment remains of the army the effort to eliminate it may turn into chasing a fly which will not end until you reach it die out or decide to commit the last desperate attack archers urgently need to increase the damage that their opponents can inflict this is probably due to the new system of counting defenses with shields and attack with penetration unless the archers are explicitly against light infantry their effectiveness is far behind the javelin throwers but they will run out of ammunition much sooner the biggest drawback however is that rome 2 is a hellishly large game featuring dozens of nations tribes and groups for example the length of waiting for moves the moment you finish the round you can get up and go stand for coffee no exaggeration as early as around 250 bc i reached a stage where waiting for the actions of other states took minutes the time processing is incredible there is no more fun way to learn history than the total war series ministries of education in more developed countries should consider playing such games in class as part of teaching we are in a modern era 65
