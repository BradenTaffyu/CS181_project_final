2015 early access review this game is quite fun if you play it with friends there are still some serious network issues and connectivity issues depending on who you are playing with and you will be less efficient with your time due to lag longer time to gather pick up items and sometimes being frozen in place while the clients try to reconnect and sometimes disconnection if you get disconnected you get a free light source so you don t die at night but it might be a pain during winter it s always better to split up and gather resources in different areas of the map for a few days rather than competing for the same resources in one area if you dislike this then i strongly suggest that you increase the spawns of resources for your game depending on how many friends you have playing with you one more thing is that if you join public games listed it won t start at day 1 you can end up in the middle of winter with nothing on your character so just be prepared for that and hope that the existing players can direct you to where the established base is it won t always be nearby the portal the only thing missing is probably a don t starve together 6 pack deal or something i really have no interest in the single player campaign so they don t need to inculde that the only thing needed now is for steam to fix up their policy on inter regional gifting so you can actually gift games to your friends on steam instead of going over to gog and getting a code there for them hint some of us don t mind spending more to send a gift this rant is unrelated to the product
