2014 early access review 7 days to die is a zombie survival post apocalypse game where you can build almost anything and destroy everything i got this game and a few copies for guildies thinking it would be a nice distraction from our main games little did i know this would become one of our guilds main games our guild leader is now thouroughly addicted and plays almost nothing else while i have played some on public servers our guild has our own server so this review and my experience will be based mostly on the private server side of the game i have found this game to be really addicting in the building aspect you can make almost amything you can think of and that is a major part of how addicting the game can be you tend to keep saying to yourself ill just finish this little area up and log next thing you know you have built an underground comples hollowed out a mountian for your mine and build towers and fortifications everywhere while forgetting to eat and sleep another good aspect atleast on the private server is we can mod the world and setup game types form group survival to pvp which is very nice the only issue i have seen so far is the new lighting system in update 10 while it looks very nice it really drops your frame rate i was running game on max settings and now have turned shadows and anti aliasing off for better preformance and some of our guildies with older computers and graphics cards are only hitting 3 10 fps after the update so in short wonderful game but having a better comp will help alot especially on pvp servers pros nice graphics fun building mechanics fun multi player having a server is really nice zombies are well done and alot better ai since last update easy to spend hours playing the game development team is doing a good job of updating and informing publicnegatives fps drop since new update fixed real fast so not an issue limited on the differant types of zombies afew more types would be nice some of the stuff in the world you are not able to build mostly cosmetic stuff like beds fridges and things like that really wanted vehicles in this last update guess it was just a rumor
