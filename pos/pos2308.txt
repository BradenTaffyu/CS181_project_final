this game is a lot better than i thought it would be given how disastrous the initial release was fallout 76 is not the most immersive experience ever but if you like games where you get progressively better loot and camp building then you ll love this game i do think the only major downside is the fallout 1st subscription unlocking some pretty important features that should just be part of the base game
