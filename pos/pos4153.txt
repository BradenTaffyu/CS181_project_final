2018 early access review i ve been playing this game since february so 11 ish months and i absolute l o v e it i lost a lot of sleep binge playing it even before the third character was out of beta and much of it was different from what it is now i m pretty inexperienced with video games i m still learning all the lingo folks use but if you re into uhh reads index card rogue like uhhh turn based uhhhhhh deck building strategy games this is for you the art is fab the music haunts my dreams but in a good way and getting a deck so good that you absolutely demolish enemies is extremely satisfying imo the devs are also ike incredibly wonderful responsive people who care most about players enjoyment of the game it s got the perfect ratio of runs that are game breaking vs frustrating down to 1hp if you don t own the game you re wasting your time
