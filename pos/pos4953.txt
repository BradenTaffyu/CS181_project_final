2017 tl dr this is not a terrible game nor is it a great one the game vanilla non modded fallout has been a favorite franchise of mine since playing fallout 3 back on ps3 and finally on pc from someone who s played majority of the fallout games fallout 1 2 3 nv this is the weakest out of the bunch for me because of simplified mechanics uninteresting main story settlement building system and many more the originals 1 and 2 set a great atmostphere for a post apocalyptic game with limited but fun game mechanics for its time 1997 dialog choices were numerous and gave players the opportunity to play a character and form the main protagonist to their liking fallout 3 and new vegas expanded on those and created an open world sandbox to add more depth into an already great franchise fallout 4 further expands on this with more verticality and depth to ruined towns cities and areas for characters to explore and loot fallout 4 made some improvements from the originals but limited or lacked in others the dialog system is broken down into 4 different choices good sarcastic quetioning and a hole this limits creativity depth and meaningful choices compared to the previous titles combat is better and not limited to certain playstyles and use of the vats system fallout 3 noteably had terrible ads mechanics but could be fixed with free mods while fallout nv slightly improved on fallout 3 s ads combat fallout 4 s main story is boring and unintersting making side quests and faction quests more interesting compared to previous fallout games fallout 4 introduced settelment building allowing players to build thier own towns and supply lines this idea sounded great but was poorly implemented because of confusing and frustrating building mechanics lack of in depth tutorial and force in using this mechanic being forced to use the mechanic during non settlement building missions is dumb especially when it isn t fun to use overall the game itself has flaws more than i feel like putting in this review but bethesda knows how to make an open world sandbox feel lively and engaging the company bethesda allowed players to mod thier games adding more replayability and possiblities to franchises like fallout and the elder scrolls modders would create mods and put them on a site like nexusmods for players to download and use for free but bethesda decided to capatilize on this and make mods similar to thier free counterparts cost points these mods according to bethesda were not paid mods but to get these points to acquire their mods required money this is not the first time bethesda has pushed paid mods on thier consumers they originally tried doing paid mods through steam on the steam workshop but because the amount of negativity and hate for this business pratice steam removed it making mods paid content instead of free is shady marketing and business tactics especially when the mods made by thier original publishers were orignally free its a shame the original developers of the fallout franchise bethesda couldn t make a better fallout game then obsidian studios the developers of fallout nv yet resorts to greed by making mods cost money the verdit even with bethesda s shaddy business practices and dumbed down mechanics of fallout 4 i still find this game fun and sometimes addicting as of now i put in 255 hours into fallout 4 and still plan on playing it in the near future i would recommend this game on a sale not at full price because of the dumbed down mechanics and shaddy bussiness practices
