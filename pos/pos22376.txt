2023 the best game of the dark souls series after revisiting this game having played elden ring which i love i was amazed to find how much of the latter s gameplay refinements have come directly from this game if you like elden ring and are waiting for the dlc do yourself a favor and play replay this if you have never played a fromsoft game this is probably a very good introduction although the story may be a bit obscure for new comers the only downsides are some buggy achievements unlocking never had this issue with other fromsoft titles and the grinding required for some covenant rewards if you wish to play this offline
