2015 early access review i ve never played a better early access game than this one it has so much potential and is definitely worth the 25 i would recommend 7 days to die to anyone that enjoys open world survival games over the 85 hours i ve played this game i have never come accross a bug or glitch this has surprised me tremendously and continues to impress myself and friends this game has a lot to it and continues to add more things to occupy the community and multiplayer servers however after you make your perfect base have immense amounts of food and water etc it can become boring and repetitive at times i do believe that as the game develops many more things will be added and that feeling will be no more so my personal thoughts on why i would recommend this game updates the devs are frequently updating this game bugs hardly found and when they are they are quickly removed community servers many friendly people easy to team up with and assist others crafting crafting is one of the many things that make this game impressive and enjoyable the crafting system is unique and has various amounts of recipes would i discourage you to get this game no not at all this game personally has definitely earned its place on my favourites list however please be aware that is game is early access and you may come accross bugs errors or other things that may effect your gameplay but if your okay with that go ahead and buy it you won t regret it
