look i m not going to say this game is perfect but honestly from a control and look perspective i enjoy it more than coh2 does it need to catch up with mod integration and parity of content to coh2 sure yeah but overall honestly at a barebones level i think it s better than coh2 but whatever i just like to play co op vs ai anyways i find it oddly relaxing after work
