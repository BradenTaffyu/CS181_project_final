2018 wow i m writing this recommendation even though i m not quite done with my first run through because i m like ten years late in telling you to play this game already i m purposefully avoiding those quests which seem like they are going to trigger the endgame because i don t want it to end i keep putting them off digging for more side quests it s like that wistful feeling when you near the end of a great book i had no idea what i was missing out on i ve always heard my friends talk about this game but since most open world games i ve tried lost my interest in the first hour i just figured this would be the same deal i was wrong i haven t had this much fun since the hours i spent in hl2 and talos principle the story is great i love the characters the atmosphere is awesome i love the mechanics even the ones people complain about so much detail i m ten years late saying this but holy crap you have got to play this game
