overall 9 10okay right off the bat i believe fallout new vegas is not just the best modern fallout game but also one of the best rpg s of all time graphically new vegas definitely appears to have aged like milk but if you can remember the graphics were pretty dated when the game initially launched despite this the world unique characters lore rich narrative several endings for main and side quests focus on player agency etc all keep players both new and old playing even 14 years later new vegas is one of the most prime examples of an rpg game done almost perfectly at least in regard to narrative the range of possible ways that you can solve all kinds of different quest is pretty insane sometimes and you can literally see the end credits without killing a single person the biggest gripes i hear about new vegas in 2024 is the graphics and general jank of the engine while it doesn t excuse it if you know anything about the development of new vegas then you should know that it at least partially explains why things are as they are this would of course be a more significant problem if fallout new vegas didn t have such amazing mod support there are mods and mod packs that do everything from patching the most basic issues all the way to completely overhauling the game bringing the gameplay to the same quality of the astounding story regardless of whether you think you might have a preference for a vanilla or a 500 mods new vegas playthrough the story and dense activity within this wasteland is simply one that must be experienced by everyone tl dr new vegas is one of the greatest rpg s of all time and despite being graphically unimpressive the narrative and game world make up for it tenfold with or without mods absolutely recommend
