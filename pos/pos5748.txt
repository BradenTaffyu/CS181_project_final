not a terrible game but i definitely recomend to wait for a sale bannerlord has a lot of issues most of them balance related or bugs that need to be fixed also the story elements are really lackluster the devs appear to have semi abandoned the game though even paradox has put more work into fixing imperator since launch than taleworlds has with this title still the battles are an experience you won t forget especially with thousands of soldiers on each side and there is always mods although a lot of modders appear to be too frustrated with the game s progress to put more work into their creations so yeah thumbs up but do yourself a favor and wait for a sale
