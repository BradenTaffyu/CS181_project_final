2022 i am too bad for that amount of hours but i love the game anyway the art style is lovely the background story is sad and the music is awesome it is always exciting to see how far you come this time i have so much fun to play this game with my friends over and over again the bonus is that you get a lot of gifts and events even after all those years the game exists the developers do care about their creation and that is so nice to see it might be a bit hard in the beginning but i still recommend it to everyone who is thinking about buying it even if you suck like me it s still a good game to kill time with it encourages you to keep going and try harder next time give it a try klei deserved the money
