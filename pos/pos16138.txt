2015 early access review tabletop simulator is easily one of my favourite games not only does the game come with inbuilt games of its own which are all great fun but also realistic physics and massive amounts of customisation custom decks of cards tables backgrounds even a tablet to browse the internet or have a movie night with friends i personally find the board games created by tabletop simulator s community to be great fun games such as heroquest and d d can be played with ease and without having to throw out tons of cash for rulebooks not only that but also the community of tabletop simulator is great i have met very few people that were unkind during my playtime and it appears to me that the game has a very tight knit community overall i would say this game is very well made and a very fun game to buy definitely worth the low price as well
