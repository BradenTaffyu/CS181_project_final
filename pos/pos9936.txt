2016 early access review three colonists crash land in a forest young and walsh hit it off immediately and get engaged hun is a hard worker that gets things done compound slowly expands over time including steel buildings completely surrounded by a steel wall we are invincible get a distress call from an old woman running from some angry tribals we save her and kill capture the tribals their bow and arrows are no match for our rifle and pistol she joins us and becomes our charismatic chef get another distress call from a big geologist prepare to fight tribals instead put up against trained soldiers in nano armor and energy weapons find out that we are in fact not invincible hun is killed walsh is downed but rescued by young and the old woman disappears without a trace seriously no idea what happened to her no corpse or anything we managed to down one of the soldiers young equipped his armor weapon and killed a second soldier causing them all to flee walsh gets better and both he and young are fully equipped in nano armor with energy weapons now we are definitely invincible another group of tribals attack they are pathetic and quickly killed outside the walls by my new energy weapons wait what is this the energy weapons set the corpses on fire wow that fire is spreading quickly 5 minutes later the entire compound is lost and half the map burnt down before it finally started to rain apparently those weapons run on jet fuel because my steel walls and buildings were no match for that blaze george w bush would be proud rip trapped prisoners and that group of visitors from the other colony sleeping on my floor i guess sleeping on the floor in the ruins of the compound was bad for morale and the geologist we saved earlier snaps and starts stabbing young we put him down with energy weapons thank god there is nothing left to burn young eventually snaps too and starts attacking her fiancee she is downed but survives and is healed up by walsh thankfully he is a doctor deciding that staying in the compound ruins is probably a bad idea we move on to find some shelter elsewhere what s this some kind of ancient structure well we have nothing to lose so maybe it will make a good temporary shelter break through a spot in the wall get attacked by giant bug robots run around the back and draw them out then swing back around to enter the structure hah stupid robots there is something on the ground looks like it does something to animals maybe it will tame the ones nearby i could really use the help activate device animals go into a man killing rage every single animal on the map rushes to the structure young and walsh go down in a literal blaze of glory as the swarms of animals attacking them are set on fire by the energy weapons 10 10 now i understand why the alien races in movies never trust humans with advanced technology
