2023 i preordered this game on bethesda net way back you could not believe my hype the day todd howard went in front of everyone at e3 and announced this game alongside a snippet of to this day unreleased elder scrolls 6 naturally fanatical as i was about it i went all in and bought the tricentennial edition which included some back then exclusive thematic weapon and power armor skins which are still my favorite to this day but when it first launched it was an unholy desolate mess really it was horrible the servers used to lag something unreal not that they re perfect nowadays but you needed to see how bad it was to believe it and the world was dead empty lore reasons sure but perhaps a gross overestimation of how social fallout players are by the dev team thinking that they could replace npcs entirely by human interaction alone that of course did not work still i played through the initial story hungry as ever for more fallout shortly after i had finished fallout 4 for the first time a game that really really resonated with me despite having its detractors then i dropped it and pretended the game didn t exist fast forward a few years and many debacles such as fallout 1st it s premium membership that i don t mind paying for but back when it released the game was just not ready for something like it and it felt like a massive cash grab at the time they released the wastelanders update that update was insane it made a game out of a husk and a good one at that but it didn t stop there no developers kept adding more and more content and introduced the scoreboards which are really something like season passes which gives you some subquests to complete each day in exchange for a few points but feel generally organic to the gameplay anyway i played through wastelanders and left to play some other games but in the meantime it looks like i missed on some of the best updates this game ever got i m more or less catching up now but in one month i have played more than i had played in all those years before is it still buggy yes is it still clunky wouldn t be a bethesda game if it wasn t but the game has soul and an amazing community i wholeheartedly recommend playing through this nowadays even if you will have quite a different experience from the initial one especially now that there are npcs everywhere still it s good fun you don t need fallout 1st to complete it and play through the endgame but its benefits will become crucial if you venture past the endgame and you find yourself a collector of weapons inventory management is a reality due to the 1200 unit limit at the stash if you play this on and off pay for a month play through it and then cancel the subscription until you decide to return
