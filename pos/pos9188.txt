2018 i ve put over 350 hours into stellaris since i first bought it and picked up each dlc along the way the 2 0 update changed a lot of how the game worked but i think it makes sense and the gameplay smoother can t wait to put another few hundred hours into it no run through is ever the same and i keep running into new and exciting scenarios
