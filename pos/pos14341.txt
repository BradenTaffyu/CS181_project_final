2022 early access review can fly through space can slam into planets at 2k mph barren planet turned into skyscraper city of logistics robits factorio 2 dyson boogaloo dyson sphere builds exists and floats in real time the factory must grow written for 0 9 24 mech customization update listen for the price this game is listed at it s hard to go wrong the logistics system is insanely satisfying intergalactic logic bots hell yeah they improved on a lot of ideas that were in factorio in very welcome ways the belt and loader systems actually make sense just to name one immersion flying through space flying around a planet that s turned into a massive city of production flying through and around the in progress dyson sphere the sci fi nerd inside melts every time cons if these issues are fixed by 1 0 then this game will be a masterpiece tech progression can feel clunky and forced at times especially moving between early to mid mid to late late game is wimpy it is early access but we ll see where it goes as captivating as the dyson sphere is the mid to late game is really just up scaling production and staring at the sphere the exciting upgrades are already mostly done so now you just get to slowly choose what buildings to boost versus factorio for example where now you re making armies of murder spider bots advanced mats are exciting but underwhelming flying a few light years to save on production is cool but resources and power are already so abundant on planets that it s not enticing i d love it if i had to go to another solar system just to dig up a rare resource for powerful items buildings you can t get without them in conclusion if you like factorio without the stress or the idea of satisfactory in space this game deserves its own pedestal aside those two some more content and polish and this game will be a centrepiece for industrial sims
