2016 personally this game is shaping up to be the perfect blend between paradox s normal grand strategy games and 4x civilization types being an intense civilization fan i ve always found the games to lack a certain depth and scale to them being a similarly intense fan of games like eu4 and ck2 i ve always found they lacked the explore and developmental cycles found in civilization games a yin and a yang if you will which caused me to always only partially scratch the itch i wanted to scratch when i played either genre of the game to me stellaris fixes that its combination of 4x aspects along with the grand strategy level diplomacy management and scale finally scratch that itch for me perfectly yin and yang working in harmony does the game have a few things that need tweaking absolutely the ai needs some adjusting to be a bit more involved and logical on its alliance and federation diplomacy and the races traited towards dominance and war need to be a bit more blood thirsty and aggressive for what its worth we re two days into release and paradox has already patched minor issues and is listening to the community to address any further tweaks that may be needed regardless its absolutely worth your money if these types of games are for you having been a customer of paradox for years now i am truly excited to how much further they can and will take this game
