2021 factor rating description gameplay loop 8 this game contains some of the best boss fights i ve seen in any single game ever while there s an equal amount of experimentation sort of bosses there s literally no shortage of a lineup of top tier boss fights one after another making a perfect balance the enemies in the game are aggressive as incentivizing you to finish them off even faster dark souls is one of my favorite games ever and this game did a great job of giving the whole gameplay design lore and style a fitting send off i do have some gripes though in dark souls the act of exploration and finding the boss was just as key to the gameplay loop as fighting the boss itself while in ds3 the irithyll dungeons seemed to the only area that returned that feeling of an oppressive world and that tension to me maybe it s because of having teleportation from the very start or the bonfire placements maybe both another thing with some enemies and bosses i noticed is that their movesets can get so chaotic sometimes that you don t need to learn it at all just spam roll and space out the moveset of my character and the enemies though pretty rarely seem at odds in terms of speed eg sister fridge the mechanics themes and gameplay loop didn t feel as tied in rather lil gamified narrative 7 i ve seen some opinions about this game s lore feeling fan service and i never really felt that way it felt more like a swan song of the whole series getting to revisit old areas explore old themes find similar characters and see how the world has changed or hasn t i did the whole game blind trying to find as much lore as i could but in the end i googled to see what i missed and there was this whole optional area and the boss there was nameless king the banished son of gwyn it felt so fitting to fight him at the end of the 3 as i did his father at the end of 1 so now that i have established that i loved the lore i def felt ehh on certain things like renaming humanity to embers and there being no actual difference really it doesn t have the classic feeling and structure that ds1 has there we know the title is dark souls because everything is connected to the core story of the 4 gods and everything that branched off from their story the undead curse the miracles came from gwyn the pyro from the witch sorcery from seath black magic from nito etc that feeling of each aspect connecting is certainly missing along with some originality as amazing as this game is visuals 8 art design is amazing throughout colors are def drab sooo many details while you walk through the remnants of a world which is coming to an end one issue though is that there are random sources of lights in some areas which come from nowhere in particular those make it look like a shining item from a distance but aren t mechanics 10 the movement is so fluid the controls are tight and the combat responsive it certainly feels like an upgrade from ds1 mechanically i did consider giving it a 9 because i noticed more issues with enemy hitboxes or enemies hitting through walls in this one but i ll give it the benefit of the doubt as bugs instead and take that away from there challenge 10 while i did remark in gameplay loop that the challenge from the oppressive world seems kinda nonexistent compared to dark souls 1 i do think the boss fights make up for it this game has so many amazing boss fights that 10 different people could have completely different top 10s like i do wish there were more beastly kind of bosses as well as we certainly get the 1 on 1 with a warrior kind of battles more often but hey as long as it s good i m not complaining variety 9 i was afraid there wasn t going to be much visual variety in the game s starting few hours but as we progress there s a lot of visually distinct areas introduced all with unique enemy designs atmosphere etc while i don t think the visual design is as varied as ds1 there s certainly a huge amount of enemies to fight with distinct art and abilities and a lot of weapons to experiment with each just as viable as the other game is a little too linear though handicapping a lil player agency otherwise was a 10 mapping 8 the level design of the individual levels are top tier areas like cathedral of the deep look back into each other so well with a very well made interconnected design but where i felt the game lacked was having those individual areas feel cohesive with each other which is what ds1 did it kinda felt like i was going into one video game level after another rather than exploring a whole world at some points having the firelink shrine be a disjointed area from the game kinda pulled me out of the experience constantly and it also trivialized say finding npcs out in the open and it felt as if everything literally converged into firelink spoon feeding you info and being there all at your service the themes of you are a nobody seem at odds with this game y implementation to me personally and this factor kind of seeps into other categories like gameplay loop and lore because of this another very important thing is the lack of player agency almost throughout the game there is 1 path or max 2 that you can take and imo the most special thing about dark souls 1 was how if you re stuck at some area or boss there s usually 3 5 other directions you can go to which also allows for more replay value sound 9 everything from the main menu music to music of the last boss is top tier while there is nothing as memorable as firelink shrine or ash lake musical moment from ds1 imo it is consistently very good throughout the bosses and some bosses have incredible tracks a certain musical callback to ds1 was goosebumps 3 interface 9 there are a lot of qol improvements from ds1 simple things like the options menu going away by pressing b as well instead of having to press options again or the jump not being the same button as roll and run the minimal hud mode is great not being allowed to level up at bonfires itself is a bummer though and as i said the firelink shrine thing seeps into every category one thing i m surprised they haven t done is a recent items tab where i can read the descriptions of the items in the sequence i got them like do it already pricing performance 6 i d say a 3 in performance and 3 in pricing sale while the game runs without any performance issues there s still instances of bad hitboxes kinda frequently and more than a few instances of enemies hitting through surfaces replay value 8 great weapon build variety for replay value less than ds1 due to too much linearity though online not in score 9 best pvp dlc not in score 9 god tier slight artificial difficulty in few instances doe score 8 4 10 full list docs google com not gonna regret checking out
