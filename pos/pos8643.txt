2022 quite possibly the best stealth game ever cotw is a pretty amazing hunting simulator unfortunately the game does randomly crash quite often has some persistent bugs and the base game is missing some key quality of life features like atvs and tents overall though these shortcomings were easy for me to overlook since the gameplay is just spot on enjoyable i can see how many would be put off by these shortcomings and just never give it the time it deserves i originally tried the free copy of cotw on egs and it was good enough to make me want to buy on steam and pick up some dlc because f k egs garbage platform and expansive worlds needs to hire a better qa team to address the crashes and persistent bugs either that or their development team needs to get their heads out of their asses the game is good but stop being content with just good make it great
