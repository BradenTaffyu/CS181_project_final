2018 two point hospital is a humorous hospital tycoon you build rooms hire staff diagnose diseases and cure them diseases include things such as mock star where a pile of elvis impersonators dance together in the corridor until a psychiatrist can get to them and grey anatomy where patients are so despairing that they lose all colour the solution simple chromatography you need to create a balance between the rooms you have and as you steadily progress through the levels the options become extensive your staff and your bank balance patients should leave the hospital before they catch something else your hospital needs to look good and have a decorative rating it needs to be the right temperature based on the regional surroundings no heating needed radiators or air conditioning you have to fulfill patient and staff food thirst and entertainment ratings after all you need to keep these guys sitting in the corridors waiting happily so you need to look after their needs your staff will take breaks and if your staff are on a break when an emergency comes in oh dear one of the first emergencies in the game is a horde of clowns clowns have to be cured in the duhumorfier and you get a clown poster as a reward for that level so that you can slap massive pictures of clowns all over your hospital fabulous just what i always wanted former patients are asked not to haunt the hospital machines need to be maintained and upgraded vending machines need to be restocked plants need to be watered at different frequencies depending on their type and dead patients need to be caught because they re ghosts roaming the hospital and upsetting just about everyone with their spookiness as well as lowing your hospital reputation which can have a knock on effect to future patients and staff options it s just the right mix of frivolity and seriousness premium currency kudosh can be earned through challenges completing the hospital objectives and your career leaderboard allowing you to unlock many new items that serve both decorative and gameplay enhancing purposes for those who enjoy making things look pretty there are a decent amount of items to choose from although i m hoping for more being added in the future as i m a little obsessed with detail these carry through with you and at each hospital with new unlocks there is a real sense of progression ramping up the challenge slowly until you eventually have a hospital that s impressively complex to manage and completely insane there s also an online leaderboard comparing you to your steam friends and giving you bragging rights if you care about that sort of thing please be aware not being aware costs lives the players crying out for a seriously heavy management tycoon may be a little disappointment as on the whole micromanagement is fairly low but this doesn t mean that two point hospital is shallow despite it having an easy learning curve and being accessible to all there are no hard failure states and you don t need to go too in depth with the management if you don t want to however there are a decent array of options that can be tweaked and maps do get progressively more difficult with a three star system where each star has more and more win conditions management options include the ability to set prices for each treatment with consequences to your reputation if you get it wrong the ability to see each individual patient and staff member statistics and change some things accordingly a priority and queue system which you can change for rooms and more staff have inherent traits as well as trainable perks a salary and promotion system you can get hands on and go a bit deeper than theme hospital allowed and it s all done in an intuitive accessible way the one downside for me i hope in the future that the game adds a full sandbox mode for replayability and full creativity as at the current time that s the only thing i feel is really lacking the campaign does offer a lot of content but ultimately you re going to complete the game and have little to go back to without a sandbox even with the challenges and leaderboards i just want to make the most massive and craziest hospital ever without constraints or game dictated goals some patients should be ashamed of their condition you know who you are all too often spiritual successor games are stagnant copies of a once successful world never really bringing that world back to life despite updated graphics and systems the unicorn of the gaming world is a spiritual successor which exceeds our expectations because underneath all the positive descriptors is always a healthy dollop of nostalgia which is way harder to recapture than a rampaging ghost two point hospital nails it it is everything that made theme hospital feel alive and made you smile with modern graphics and tycoon gameplay plus quality of life improvements that will appeal to those of all experience levels it s absolutely not a copy you can heavily feel the influence but it feels fresh and is an absolute pleasure to play if you find the reviews of an old welsh lady interesting please follow my curator page
