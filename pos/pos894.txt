2016 help me i started playing near the end of my college quarter and i can t stop other good games have come out but the peacefulness colorful visuals soothing music and well writen characters make it hard to stick to the promise of just one more day or i ll stop when i finish this day stardew valley is such a well crafted game that it has distracted me from more serious and important things in my life i haven t been this drawn into a game in a long time sure i ve found games i like but not like this this game is hard to stop i would recommend if you enjoy animal crossing and or harvest moon
