2016 i have played every total war game that has been released so far unfortuntely the last tw game that i was satisfied with was rome total war the first one empire total war felt like a prototype rather than an actual game suffering from some nasty bugs silly ai much more silly than normal and horrible performance optimisation shogun tw was decent yet limited in scope and play it s main flaw was limited replay value shogun 2 was popular and score a lot of points with the fanbase but i absoloutely hated its cheating blatant ai which was more apparent this time round and enemy agent spams something that warhammer suffers from at the moment sadly rome 2 total war had to be one of the franchises biggest launch disappointments a lot of the issues got fixed by the time empire edition came around but by then it was too late rome 2 has a bad interface terrible politic mechanics and mundane boring micromanagement features such as the leveling up of your leaders which ended up becoming less of a chore in warhammer the total war series has been on a losing streak since rome total war trying to recapture the magic that the iconic r tw is known for until now warhammer total war has finally taken the mantle as the best total war game since rome and sits loftly on its throne goading and chiding all its previous titles like an angry thorgrim grudgebearer reading through his grudgebook thankfully the reputation for the total war series has been salvaged one less grudge to be concerned about warhammer is not only a solid release minus the few remaining bugs but its also has solid performance and a solid stable multiplayer that i ve been enjoying far too much right away its easy to see that creative assembly have poured their hearts and souls into this title they clearly love the warhammer universe and have done it great justice as a fan of warhammer its lore and a current active gm for warhammer fantasy roleplay i would be the first to jump down their throats if they messed up this title as its very close to the heart and its good to know that they have done it justice now some minor gripes do remain mostly lore ones the colours of most of the state troops are wrong for the various empire provinces as are the appearance of some of the elector counts i m looking at you boris todbringer yet these are just a drop in the ocean and issues like these can be readily fixed by mods and such leveling up skills of your leaders was a complete chore in rome 2 uninteresting annoyingly mundane and full of micromanagement however in warhammer total war all that has changed you still level up your heroes and leaders but the skill tree interface rather than smacking you in the face and shoving it in the mud like the previous total war game here it treats you kindly and you know what your looking at not only that but the skill trees and the tech trees are done really well full of detail and surprisingly full of content with each skill tree becoming different depending on the hero rome 2 s dull micromanagement system and its awful attempt at politics is all done away with for a much more favoured approach of retaining depth and complexity yet keeping it simple to use from the interface to the way everything just feels right tw warhammer certainly earns its place as the top franchise title my only regret is that they didn t call it total warhammer sigh this game also has the most potential of any other previous title as there is so much they can do to not only improve the game but also to expand upon it with two huge new standalone urgh standalone expansions on the way and dlc and flc on the way for the first title this is an exciting time to be a warhammer fan
