2015 early access review alpha 12 review 7 days to die is an epic crafting open world zombie survival game that has a lot to offer from huge cities to endless deserts and forrests and even up to high snowy mountains pros 1 everything is destroyable and i mean it all of the buildings roads mountains and trees 2 physics this ain t nothing like minecraft where you can build a house ontop of a 10 meters 1x1 block tall stack of blocks you need to add support pillars in order for the building to stay up if you don t you re dead if the structure collapses on you 3 crafting you can make a lot of different weapons tools traps mines and other items 4 map is endless you can find a lot of different and cool cities towns lone houses and camps on the way that hold supplies 5 zombies many kind of zombies from fat slow ones to hot nurses 6 wildlife deers rabbits pigs bears dogs and giant hornets 7 sound quality is quite good to be honest i like it 8 survival all in all it is quite hard to survive if you are playing on one of the hard difficulties there are 6 difficulty levels you need to gather food and water to survive and let us not forget medicine 9 combat is not really that great but you can manage it 10 pve and pvp 11 at every 7th night a lot of zombies will come in large numbers and try to kill you and i mean it in large numbers so be prepared cons 1 bad framerate on low medium pc s could use some optimisation as soon as possible 2 graphics are decent enough can be done better 3 some lag might appear after some time of playing 4 some parts of the generated world is weird specially around towns all in all great game and worth buying hours of fun specially in co op 9 10 tl dr
