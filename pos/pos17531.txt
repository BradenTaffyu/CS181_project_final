2017 i m a far too old total war veteran by now i ve been playing and loving this series since medieval 1 i was sceptical at first just as many tw veterans were since i was hoping for medi 3 or something historical i didn t know about warhammer and didn t give a either but hell this game converted me to warhammer fanboyism it certainly has its flaws such as simplified campaign and battle mechanics lacking in strategic depth on the campaign map etc what really makes it a great game a different total war game but still a great entry in its own rights is the very well done fantasy scenario varied factions with very different approaches both in campaign and battle to be honest i don t really care about the price that much beastmen just don t trigger me so i haven t bought them yet otherwise i m willing to pay a price for a good game and some really good work done by the devs just as i expect to be paid for my work i m happy this series of games exist and i m expecting tww2 like no other game this year i suggest you buy this game now and support ca in creating more tw games for the lady
