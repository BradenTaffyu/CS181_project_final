2020 being a former truck driver for 30 years and then going into being a instructor i would recommend this game for those who wish to drive a truck once again its hard to let go because this game allows me to interact like the real deal its fun creative rules of the road lots more if i could i would love to smell that diesel smoke from my pc that would be cool hahahaha for those who want to get into the trucking business go for it this world needs us without it products would not get to anybody as fast check the song out from red simpson diesel smoke he has a lot more songs for truck driving i listen to these while playing the game memories you cannot buy with money driving allows me to talk with jesus pray and be at piece i love the lord he is my best passenger
