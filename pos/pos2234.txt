this game is only for die hard fallout fans it looks like a rotten cucumber has bugs everywhere constant server crashes it feels like a big disney playground you need a subscription to enjoy the game with all its benefits and the extra content is extremely expensive i rate it positively because i m a fan and i have fun with it but i wouldn t recommend it to anyone else especially if you are new play fallout new vegas instead preferably with mods in my opinion it s the best game in the series
