2013 fallout new vegas is one of my favourite games of this generation it takes the fundamentals of the classic fallout games and puts them into the fallout 3 engine giving fans of the original games a true successor developed by obsidian entertainment new vegas was created by a company that houses many people who worked on the original fallout series and whose strengths are writing and solid role playing mechanics and it shows the writing throughout new vegas is phenomenal and no matter what type of character you want to play the game was made with you in mind you constantly feel rewarded for your choices hardcore mode also allows you to play more of a survival game having to get food water and sleep for a real challenge check out the mod josh sawyer lead designer made for the game it takes hardcore mode to a whole new level i also highly recommend playing all of the downloadable content for new vegas since it has the best dlc suite i ve ever experienced each of them is brilliantly crafted expanding the story of new vegas in interesting ways furthermore the dlc is foreshadowed throughout the main game and the dlc can cause changes in the main game as well if you only get the dlc for one game make it this one i can t recommend this game enough
