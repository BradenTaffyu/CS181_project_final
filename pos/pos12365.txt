2022 i can t believe this pink from among us ruined my marriage a couple months ago my wife said she was going out for a ladies night she asked me to take care of my son so i immediately obliged yes ma am i told her after a while of waiting she finally left and i could play my favourite game among us i hopped on my laptop booted it up and my desktop loaded complete with the red sus background and all my among us impostor fan art i was shaking in excitement i slowly dragged my finger across the track pad and watched the cursor as it glided over to the among us icon among us my absolute favourite game of all time and quite possibly the best and most well made game in the entire world as i clicked the button my body twitched with joy at the thought of being the impostor again my fingers drummed impatiently on my desk as the innersloth logo faded in and then out then the main title appeared i immediately looked at pink as she slowly floated across the screen oh how i wish i could feel those luscious soft asscheeks pink is my queen the real woman in my life my wife could never be as sexy as pink is her soft footfalls in electrical as i peek at her curvy form from inside a vent waiting for the right time to strike i could never get close to pink however as if she had some kind of sixth sense she would always leave before i could reveal myself to her as the impostor i press practice to warm up my fingers before my first intense game of among us i hit blue in comms then cross the hall and vent to specimen murdering green in cold blood the thrill of killing an animated character in an online game has never been such a rush i then move towards reactor stabbing yellow in the back and then running down the corridor to the right to access decontamination i move quietly through the halls like a snake about to strike its prey and i see oh no it s pink standing there motionlessly as i face her directly her visor shows no emotion but she knows i can feel it in the air i can t kill her she is too beautiful too angelic the light reflecting off of her pink bodysuit like stars on a voided sky she doesn t run i am moved to tears as i caress the screen kissing it tenderly goodbye pink see you soon it will all be okay i whisper in a soft reassuring voice then as my cursor hovers over the kill button i hesitate thoughts of love go through my head red having reddish pink sus children with pink but i have to as the impostor it is my duty to kill i press the kill button and watch as my character beheads pink silently all i hear is the spurt of blood there is no rush there is only red standing by himself in fuel pink s lifeless body laying on the floor beside him i feel nothing at first then immense sadness like i m at a loved one s funeral my son knocks on the door interrupting my brief moment of mourning he asks dad are you going to make me a snack i tell him to shut up and my voice cracks i break down sobbing i killed her i killed my one true love god forgive me i open the door to my son and he has a confused look on his face i say nothing and walk to the kitchen to make him a sandwich tears roll off my face into the bread as i lay it onto the counter lettuce cheese and meat followed by a sad swirl of mustard on top my son is quiet he sits on the couch and stares at the floor there is a depressing air around us i serve him the sandwich and walk back to my room contemplating life if i killed pink how am i to be trusted around my family i cry for hours and finally my wife comes back she sees me bawling on the bed like a child who dropped his ice cream she then asks me why i m crying and mutter i killed her i killed my only love pink in among us she is filled with rage and slaps me across my face i feel numb she asks for a divorce i don t reply instead i take my laptop and get into my car driving to a nearby hotel fast forward a few months to the divorce it was quick and painless after court i ask my former wife to take me back i can t take you back you ve always been this way i was sus of you from the start real
