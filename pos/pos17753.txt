2023 i ve played the early access extensively so i have more hours on the game than shown here and i m really loving the game i don t really get all the hate this game is getting but i may be kind of bias too i m egyptian know the history very well and have been waiting for a bronze age game for the longest time ca sofia have shown that they re innovative and there s a lot of fun and immersive features people are complaining that some of the features are returning features that should have never been removed but that doesn t diminish from them and they added a lot of new stuff too i absolutely love the campaign customization you can tailor almost everything about the game to fit your preferences there s a lot of faction and unit variety i played a lot of troy too and this definitely isn t a troy reskin the battles feel grounded and fun longer battles and units holding the line a bit better allows for a lot more tactical options the ai still isn t super smart but it s still challenging and feels like an improvement over previous games changing your hero s bodyguard unit is really cool i haven t gotten to the full sea peoples invasion yet but i m sure that ll add an exciting challenge you can change the number of armies they spawn to increase decrease challenge the map and graphics are beautiful the armor degradation adds another interesting tactical element i m zooming in to watch the fighting a lot because the individual fighting animations and the paired combat look amazing the chariots feel good to me and they feel historically accurate they get destroyed if bogged down and their main advantage is their speed and mobility they don t feel too tanky economy and deities are immersive and engaging try the game for yourself before jumping on the bandwagon of negativity obviously i would have loved to have assyria babylon and mycenaeans too and that s my main complaint but what we have is done really well i know a lot of the community wanted medieval 3 or empire 2 but for me personally this is my absolute favorite historical time period and so glad we finally have a total war game in this setting i m really hoping they add assyria babylon as the campaign pack dlc but i m super worried that they ll cut back on the scope of the dlc because of the game s negative feedback which is undeserved in my opinion and actually makes me pretty sad if any of the devs see this y all did an amazing job and thank you so much for your hard work if you re at all interested in the time period this game is a must buy and don t be discouraged by any negativity thanks for reading my rant if you got through it lol much love and hope y all are having fun
