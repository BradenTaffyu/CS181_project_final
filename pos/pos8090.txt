2014 early access review beamng uses an advanced and realistic soft body physics engine which allows full realistic body deformation in a dynamic way meaning no outcome of a crash will be the same whereas many games like to use a preset damage mesh for each vehicle meaning that they destroy deform in a certain way depending on the mesh in this game every slight mistake you make may be the last for your chosen vehicle that s the fun of it ain t no driving away from that a screenshot of beamng drive by steviegoty there are plenty of well designed maps with a variety of environments to test you vehicle to the limit there are also a vast number of scenarios you can complete each with their own unique objectives ranging from car chases to challenging obstacle courses i would definitely recommend this with someone who wishes to fulfil an itch for detailed car destruction
