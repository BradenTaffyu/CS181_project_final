2019 new vegas is very special to me it was my first introduction to the fallout franchise i was 10 years old at the time and when i first played it i was confused by it because at the time i haven t played this type of rpg the only rpg that i played back then was pretty much pokemon and final fantasy 10 2 so i ve been raised with games that have many handholding with probably the exception of grand theft auto and new vegas changed that it gives many choices to say traverse and roleplay it s also the type of game that when i come back to it every year i always finding new stuff and things to do inside the game for example do you know there s a quest called classic inspiration who was given to you a guy named michael angelo in the vegas strip yeah most of you probably don t know but enough spoiling my relationship with the game let s start with the story story world writingthe story takes place in you guessed it vegas you are basically a courier who was supposed to deliver the package to a special someone when in the process of delivering you were kidnapped and shot to the head by a guy named benny hours later you ve been patched up by the creepy glitchy doc mitchell after more hours of creating a horendous character you start to pursue benny and that mysterious package the story starts itself very good you started in goodsprings and the game slowly revealing the mechanics and the faction plus characters to you the first big faction you meet are the ncr which at first they seemed as the good guys but as you play through the game they have a morbid history of corruption the second one being the caesar s legion which yes when you first saw them they re really violent but once you meet caesar and started to talk about why is he doing this you started to see where he s coming from and that s the thing the worldbuilding it s really well crafted and intruiging besides the two there are more factions in the game to meet and greet like the great khans brotherhood of steel and many more the only complains that i can give in this category is the moment when you get to the strip of vegas and the final quest the two are very underwhelming the writing in this game is amazing it has a theme of greed corruption power enslavement and of course being a fallout game is war war never changes and it s very nuanced and perfectly thought out to every character has a motivation like boone for instance who hated the legion because he saw her wife being enslaved by them that s probably the reasons why i still remember the characters veronica boone arcade caesar marcus tabitha rhonda lily raul cass and much more gameplay combatnow if i say that new vegas combat is pretty good than fallout 4 its obviously a lie the combat is to put it simply is not good bullet sponges swaying guns and delayed bullet feedback makes the combat feels unresponsive which is sad because they are plenty of arsenal to be used the only things that makes it being not awful is v a t s and combat overhaul mods but what about the role playing and choice roleplaying choicefantastic you can be whoever you wanted to be wanna be a psychopath and kill everyone you can do that wanna be a diplomatic person you can the freedom of choice is astounding but it s not just about the character you build it s also about the faction that you want to side the dialogue system has been fixed from fallout 3 and it s far better now where as in that game the speech check is by chance and can only be pass by speech skills in new vegas the check is not by chance but how many skill that you have to pass that check also every skill has it s own speech check and there are so many things and questions to talk about that s why this dialogue system has been regarded as the best dialogue system in the fallout franchise soundtrackthe soundtrack is pretty good but it could have been better like the new vegas radio station is just very repetitive because of that johnny guitar song i highly recommend turning the radio stations off it s that repetitious replayability lasting appealvery high even if you have mods like new vegas bounties and a world of pain they are still builds to experiment with and tons to do in the mojave like collecting snow globes planning a heist in the sierra madre escaping the wasteland to a place named zion valley a science fair to see in big mountain mt and walking the broken roads of the divide conclusionthere s no doubt that people regarded this as the best modern fallout game it s not polished because of the bugs and the visuals plus the unresponsive gunplay but for a role playing game it is excellent unlike fallout 4 which is more polished than this game but it s not an rpg
