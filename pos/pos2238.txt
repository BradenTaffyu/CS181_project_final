2021 fun for a while then the story content finishes when it does you re left with repeating missions that you need to do over and over to grind for the best gear or rare scrap to craft the best gear it does feel like a more traditional fallout game in many ways but other players ruin the game more than they add to it with frequent trolling and or stealing your resources and it s not possible to try to offer some resources to lower level players via the in game vending machine because high level players immediately show up and buy everything add to all this almost everything is server side even placing objects while building can be subject to a few seconds delay i frequently used more than one stim pack because i tried to use one thought it didn t register then tried again only for the game to register two inputs eventually with this level of online dependency the game will die if the servers ever shut down installation size 71 gb
