as a die hard age of empires 2 fan for over two decades i wholeheartedly recommend age of empires 4 to both veterans and new players the developers expanded on the aoe2 formula without trying to completely reinvent the wheel like aoe3 did instead focusing on giving us more variety between the playable civilizations the mongols or the chinese now have a vastly different playstyle from one another with much more than just a unique unit or bonus or two to set them apart i think that s a great approach that offers a good variety in playstyles the game looks good sounds good and plays like a smoother more streamlined aoe2 it s good stuff
