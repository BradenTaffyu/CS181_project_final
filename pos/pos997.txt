2023 early access review yesterday i found a woman dead in a living room next to a bottle of half empty bleach i had already been bitten by that point trying to make the most of my time left stashing things away for my next survivor to find i put my weapons outside that house and stripped down for an easy target later while i locked myself in the closet room waiting to turn a small swarm started knocking on the windows of that house as i stood in the closet waiting to peacefully die the constant knocks reminded me of why i was here why i was hiding with no clothes on and that soon i would be torn to pieces i wanted to die peacefully in my closet room but this was no longer going to happen i wanted to have atleast some control of how i would die in this bleak and dreadful world but alas this was not going to happen if the zombies came in now i remembered the lady lying in the living room as the knocks and moans got louder i went towards her corpse and picked up her bottle of half filled bleach i understood what she must have felt in this very moment a desire for control and dignity i drank the bleach and died next to her 10 10
