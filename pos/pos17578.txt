2016 short verdict captures the feeling of the warhammer universe perfectly music art voice acting everything cavalry and army clashes have more crunch to them than they used to if you could run attila and rome 2 you ll run this even better battle ai is better campaign play is better because of optimized cpu usage meaning no more 15 minute turns each faction is very different not only in battle but how they play in campaign i e vampires get to corrupt mortal lands and start up covens to disrupt their public order orcs always have to be fighting or your armies kill each other etc highly recommended long verdict pros five six in custom battle warhammer fantasy armies each lovingly detailed with different play mechanics great soundtrack campaign is extremely accessible perfect for people who have never played total war before campaign ai is more intelligent no more of armies running between two points as you ruin their kingdom they also back off when they see you have a strong defense very in depth magic system gives a new layer of strategy to battles customizable lords and heroes choose their equipment and talentscons environmental destruction and fire effects have been severely downgraded from the spectacle they were in attila no unit formations i e wedge formation for cavalry spear walls shield walls etc no more small settlement battles and therefore no random civilian killing as your army moves in all sieges happen in large and famous cities no options to change the season weather or time of day in battlesmeh sieges are relegated to one corner of the city i m indifferent to this due to warhammer lore diplomacy in campaign is somewhat limited in the kinds of interactions you can have with other factions i m indifferent to this very lore accurate that chaos barbarians and orcs would not come to humans with any sort of trade agreement you can t conquer whole map only the cities and provinces of your nemesis faction again i don t care about this but perfectionists might i do miss the ability to choose ammo types for ranged units having one type of ammo for everything simplifies things however leaving more time to micro for magic first time i ve finished a total war campaign in a while can t wait until they add the elf factions to this game
