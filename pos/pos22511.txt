2015 this game is fantastic it combines roguelike and survival gameplay dumping you in a strange territory to explore forage learn craft and progress on your own terms for the most part the controls and interface are intuitive so it s simply a matter of deciding where to go or what to do the game is called don t starve and hunger is indeed a major theme if you go a few days without food you will die that said there are plenty of other things to kill you a variety of animals and monsters environmental hazards and your own dwindling sanity to battle this you rely on building your own equipment consumables and structures ranging from weapons and armor to crock pots to unwholesome magical devices don t starve can be brutal so you should expect to die but just making good progress is rewarding in itself you unlock new characters as you play each with little touches or specialties to diversify your experience and while there are some pretty powerful or useful items you can make there are still a lot of ways to play and they re all valid which is good because sometimes you don t have much choice if you re bored or frustrated you can change your experience by starting a new game and adding or removing features if you re tired of fighting certain monsters you can just turn them off i haven t messed with this myself as i like the feeling of surprise and playing the game as is but the developers have left the doors wide open for custom play experiences in the same way you can make use of a wealth of user created elements there are a few things i missed for awhile like the fact that you can view a map of everywhere you ve been so far but overall the game doesn t suffer much from lack of tutorial or hand holding you can go read everything on a wiki if you prefer but this is a game where i don t actually begrudge trial and error learning encountering strange new things and deciding what to do with them is a ton of fun even if it sometimes gets you killed a warning at least from my perspective this game is so immersive i prefer to keep playing it for hours on end once i start it s not a game i enjoy having to stop unless i come to good stopping point like dying at the end of a long survival run in fact sometimes i forget to eat for a long time when i play this so yeah irony
