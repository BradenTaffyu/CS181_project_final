2014 the simulator you expect to never like but somehow fall in love with euro truck simulator 2 lets you experience the world of cargo haulage right at your pc and it does it very well for the most part you start with nothing just taking low paying jobs in the quick job menu but gradually you will expand your company until you have your very own fleet of trucks and truckers all across europe great graphics the trucks and trailers in particular are very high quality large map made even larger by the going east dlc and the scandinavia expansion the system of building up your company works well and as you improve as a driver it becomes easier to improve your company it s a very relaxing game and is a perfect excuse to listen to music podcasts or the radio you can play your music or a radio station through the game s menu trucks have lots of customisation options lots of different skills to improve to make yourself a better driver or to unlock new types of cargo the paint job packs are very high quality and in my opinion are worth their price especially on sale plenty of great mods and it s very easy to install mods controls are fully customisable plenty of different cargo types especially with the high power pack and some of the skills you can unlock several truck manufacturers with several truck designs each seat heights lights used etc are all customisable has a photo mode with lots of different options allowing you to take plenty of nice shots of your truck the devs run events which give you the opportunity to unlock exclusive content through the world of trucks website it s easy to progress through the game without taking loans from the bank which is good for players who want to maximise their rewards in game pretty hard to play with a mouse and keyboard but this is more than made up for with the controller and wheel support if you don t have a controller or a wheel you might find this significantly more challenging to play the ai can be pretty poor sometimes ai vehicles almost always travel faster than the speed limit trucks in particular have acceleration faster than makes sense cars will sometimes accelerate into you while you are turning rather than stop major cities do not resemble cities in anyway they are very small and all cities have a similar layout a repair shop two distributors somewhere to sleep and a garage major cities do not have gas petrol stations so you have to rely on service stations on major highways for fuel doesn t have different seasons which seems odd considering they run seasonal events such as the winter holiday event seeing as you had to deliver presents it would seem logical to have snow verdict 8 5despite the game s flaws i find myself absolutely addicted to it and would recommend this to anyone there s nothing quite like the open road especially when you re building a business empire el k
