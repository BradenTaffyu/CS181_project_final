2017 i actually got this game over a year ago as a crack after reading an article about it on kotaku and yeah the one saying people regret getting a crack and actually bought the game back i read that one too and after sinking many hours into the game i got to year 3 and married penny and by then i did feel some regret for getting a crack but i never bothered to get the legit game since i didnt use steam back then so there was no other way to obtain it for me could not use credit card by late 2016 i got steam and stardew valley hovered into view which i stopped playing for a few months after turning back time forcibly and experiencing a bug where grandpa scene replays every day i thought to myself hm i should charge up my steam wallet but when it was on sale i didnt get it when it was off sale i had the funds so for a while i was thinking of getting it or waiting till there was a sale againand well in the end i gave it much thought the game isn t from a big developer say dice or and it would be nice to support the devs for real so i got the game at its full price and i dont regret it one bit the game is open world i guess an rpg with a small town to walk around in you have a plot of land to plant some crops you can fight monsters in a mine you can go down to the beach to fish too think pokemon without all the balls and gyms uhmmmm you can make friends with the villagers you can marry them too one cool thing about this game is that same sex marriage is allowed as well and i think its going to appeal to some gamers i mean if youre like me and you are a bit interested in some yu censored censored censored its quite cozy and both adults and children can enjoy this game if you are not a fan of the ingame character art you can even get anime style portraits to enhance the look i am not a fan of how most of the female characters looked so i did and there are a bunch of mods you can install for it like for example replacing your doggo with a shibe or r2d2 if thats what you like overall stardew valley is a cozy and very loveable rpg where you can do many wonderful things in its absolutely mesmerizing and captivating and if youre in for a casual relaxing game experience this game will surely reward you
