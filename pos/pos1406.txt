2019 early access review we had two bags of cigarettes seventy five cotton balls doused in alcohol five sheets high powered painkillers a bottle half full of disinfectant and a whole galaxy of multi colored antibiotics beta blockers antidepressants vitamins and also a quart of whiskey a quart of red wine a case of pop a pint of bleach and two dozen of sleeping tablets not that we needed all that for the death but once you get locked into a hopeless survival the tendency is to push it as far as you can the only thing that really worried me was the bleach there is nothing in the world more helpless and unhappy and thirsty than a man in the depths of a bleach poisoning and i knew we d get into that toxic stuff pretty soon
