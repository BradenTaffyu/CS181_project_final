2016 quintessentially charming this game had me hooked be prepared to wind down and relax as you start and develop your very own farm in a town full of unique characters with their own stories this game immurses you in the simple life farm mine fish forage socialise it s completely down to you be careful though this is incredibly addicting the fact that you need to sleep to save the game leaves you always wondering what you are going to wake up to just one more day
