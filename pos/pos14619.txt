i got this game on the discount with all of the dlcs i think every game i learn something new and i can play with a different playstyle i can imagine this experience is better with friends but still even against ai it is fun the only negative thing is that i never realize how many i hours i spend on it it s too absorbing regardless it s a great purchase and i am happy with it i would recommend the game to anyone who likes age of mythology and the like
