2023 i wrote this review then seven days later overkill released a significant update it adds two classic heists murky station and cook off now called turbid station and uh cook off it also changes some mechanics and includes a lot of fixes so far the biggest impact i ve found on my review is that in loud the bots aren t made of as squishy material i didn t need to do any bot babysitting when playing cook off but i was only playing on hard and i didn t stick around all that long only cooking four bags so that opinion might be under cooked just to preface all of this while i like playing with friends when our schedules coincide i usually play solo because i don t need random strangers in my life any more than i ve already got much ink has been spilt about the always on aspect and the lack of a solo mode i don t really have anything more to add it s still a thing and i haven t noticed it improving my game in any way i mean the five minute wait to matchmake with myself is a great opportunity to get a drink which i won t get during the game since i can t pause i tend to spend most of my time in stealth i can t help it i feel like there s something in me that says why do in loud what you can do in stealth and so i just restart any heist i trip the alarm on until i get all the loot bags out with nobody noticing i like a lot of the changes to the stealth i love how much you can do without masking up i love how much more precise you can be managing civilians i appreciate the guards lack of eyes on the back of their heads but also their habit of getting bored and fidgeting around in place that said there s some weird changes that seem specifically targeted at solo mains like myself such as the dye packs in the first bank i guess i can t complain too loud about that just try to find the correct computer in the big bank in pd2 by yourself i also have mixed feelings about the moving bodies mechanics i like the removal of body bags but dropping bodies feels very off you can t stuff them places or try to do much anything with them they just fall straight down at your feet if you back up to a wall you can get their head stuck in the geometry which is good for a chuckle at times they ve also made the game seem linear pd2 had crime net and it added a non linear sporadic aspect to the heists you could kind of tell the earlier heists from the later but they didn t have an order i mean there was that story mode menu but who ever looked in there pd3 they have a very defined and deliberate order that then makes it feel like they should progress in difficulty but i can clean out the sharke bank on overkill with only a little bit of difficulty and i have yet to get all loot on the dirty ice heist on even very hard by myself i ve come to find the loud mostly disappointing loud heists in pd2 were fun i had this lovely triple smg anarchist build where i could zoom around the map on dw brrrrping anybody who got in my way and the bots were there to get me up if i stuck my head into the view of a sniper in pd3 the loud action has had both the pace and the body count scaled way down and as far as i m concerned the fun has been scaled down with it i mean it s not awful it s just not fun the battle of attrition against a non renewing amour health pool encourages caution not chaos also the bots go down now all the time in fact playing in loud tends to see me spending more thought energy on deciding to play babysit the bots or wait for the bots to get back from custody one nader or one dozer and there go all the bots again they also don t pick each other up so that s one more tick on the babysit the bots play mode so yeah i tend to not bother much with loud the final word for me is that there is fun to be had here i ve enjoyed my time with pd3 i don t think it s as good as pd2 though but maybe that s how it goes maybe pd2 was a lightning in a bottle scenario and hoping that would happen twice was just wishful thinking on our part
