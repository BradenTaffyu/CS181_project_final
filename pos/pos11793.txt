2018 early access review this is my first early access game and it was the perfect pick for the experience i got it for 12 dollars and it s a steal at this price i ve bought this game 11 months ago a couple of months after it started in ea and my only regret is i didn t buy it sooner the changes and evolution of the game that i ve experienced from 0 3 up to 0 9 currently has been beautiful to say the least the game stayed refreshing and different each time i played it it was the most enriching way to experience the game but that doesn t mean it s not worth getting now it still has at least 2 major dlcs coming one for free the other paid that are promised to have a large amount of content and it now has modding capabilities with more updates to give modders better control over the content so what is dead cells it s a 2d rogue lite action platformer with emphasis on speed and a refreshingly adequate amount of rng and great music the game needs you to explore 100 all areas and locations to get the most out of it the controls and movement are smooth the weapons and items are fun and unique there are more than 80 of them and you need to unlock most of them the enemies are distinct and balanced all the areas have traits design and music that makes you want to come back for more every single time the game has some secrets that blend in a bit too well but when you find them out on your own it would be as satisfying as nohitting a boss for the first time there are as of now 4 bosses with talks of them becoming 6 in future updates tl dr if you enjoy rogue lites this is a very special and unique one to enjoy if you don t watch some gameplay you might like it for the fast paced fighting fluid movement or music and art style
