2020 before the truck simulators why would i drive a truck sim when i can drive a sports car sim just give it a try because driving a full loaded truck for money in a race against time its always a tricky and funny experience europe map is compressed also the time is compressed acordingly somthing like 1 20 1 minute of gamplay last something like 3 real life seconds 1 day of gameplay last something like 1 hour of real life so you can make the most incredible travels in minutes or a couple of hours i got all the map dlcs so i can travel from sweden to italia or from northern rusia to romania in minutes solid graphics some beauty effects and realistic events that looks like real life cons if you miss an exit you will have to drive a long way to the next exit oh my lovely truck take me from the crazy russian roads to the beauties of sweeden take me back from germany to the south of italy
