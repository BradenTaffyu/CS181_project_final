2019 i m a massive fan of the series and rome 2 is the best game out of them all but only with the divide et impera mod available on steam the vanilla game was fairly trash i m surprised the reviews are now positive they used to be very negative of course all the dlc way over priced and whatever but that s just the way the total war series is i always buy most of them i have all the dlc for warhammer 2 which is the best game without mods divide et impera adds factual history and backstories to the various factions i cant stress enough how good it is if your playing rome 2 you really need to get it big thanks to the creators of the mod for making rome 2 the way it should be also if you like history and the time period check out the kings and generals page on youtube the videos they do go hand in hand with the game and makes it way more interesting to play
