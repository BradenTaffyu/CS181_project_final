2021 early access review everything about this game and its developers is a win win the base game itself is great fun both sandbox and campaign its realism is pretty outstanding on top of this the developers allow mod support and have made teardown as easy as possible to modify they encourage creativity and give it a platform rather than shun the modding community furthermore if you d like to create your own maps but don t know how their developers have created multiple guide videos if you re just there for the fun their own maps have so much sandboxy value alongside 100s of maps and mods you can download in game no more restarting your game after installing a mod you can load the mod straight from the menu and get right into it i know what people say about frame rates and how demanding it can be but that can be sorted in settings or with a mod and just depends on what you re doing my pc is 6 years old and wasn t high end not even back then yet teardown works great for me its notable that custom maps with lots of electricity are big culprits for frame drops even on higher end pcs even more so if there s a custom soundfile playing aswell as the full electric setup this game is very much worth the money not only do the developers care about their games community they seem to proactively make this game for the consumers by keeping its price low and the quality of the game incredibly high whatever profit is made from this is well earned awesome game
