2022 early access review this game has evolved a lot since it started and is a good example of the survival sandbox genre done right there is a lot of complexity in the systems and the zombie threat carries weight this is definitely a labour of love for the developers and they are still slowly chipping away at new features like npcs and wild animals with migration mechanics etc some negatives to note are that performance and experience might vary especially in multiplayer and that the interface is not the most user friendly the former is constantly being worked on and the latter is something that you can get used to with a bit of time if you enjoy the survival genre more realistic sim type games or zombie themes this game will likely give you a lot of mileage
