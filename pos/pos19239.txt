2020 when i read many reviews for fallout nv i wondered how many people were blinded by nostalgia while writing their reviews and decided to try the game for myself as i played fallout 4 on my ps4 for a couple hundred hours which was also my first experience with the fallout franchise when i downloaded the game i immediately had problems getting the game to run it was a pain in the ass and a couple hours later the game finally started doc mitchell greeted me i made my character s face and walked to the vigor tester there i selected my stats which seemed familiar from fallout 4 but when doc mitchell sat me down and i had to choose perks traits and tag skills i was overwhelmed at first and ecstatic after the initial shock the depth fallout nv has in regard to your character is something fallout 4 does not even come close to advancing in the game and completing specific tasks or quests further changes your character to suit not only your play style but your role play as well the game runs far worse than fallout 4 but that is no surprise since it s a far older game you can not sprint the animations are choppy and there are many many bugs not that fallout 4 lacks any bugs furthermore i am confronted with infinite loading screens and corrupt save files multiple times which forced me to delete characters who were dear to me leading to much frustration however bad the game may run though even with mods which attempt to patch some problems i do believe fallout nv to be the best entry to the franchise due to the following aspects 1 the story is absolutely fantastic the conflict between the ncr and ceasar s legion and the people and factions caught in between feel extremely vivid from the random encounters to the scripted ones i savored every moment in dialogue with faction npc s to understand the appeal of the story and the characters one must play the game himself but every play through i fell in love with the faction i sided with mainly because of what comes next 2 the dialogue in this game is leagues above the one in fallout 4 not having a voiced character felt very wierd at first but then i noticed i could voice my character myself in any way i wanted different characters had different voices fitting the current play through what s more are the skill checks that make your character feel like he s manipulating the conversation through skill wits or force unlike the simple charisma speech check system in fallout 4 nv offers a whole new depth to the dialogue furthermore allowing for more than 4 options per dialogue opens conversations in ways fallout 4 could only dream of 4 the characters extremely memorable and lovable every time i enter the tops and hear benny go what in in the makes me feel at home with characters i know and love who are intricate mysterious manipulative submissive you name it i can t help but think man i am going to be his friend in my next play through and if a game can make me play my next play through while playing one already i believe that that game has indeed succeeded greatly 3 the setting and atmosphere in fallout nv are stunning nothing beats arriving at the sierra madre or big mt naked and afraid or first setting foot into the strip and feeling truly accomplished sure there are parts where you have to trek through the wasteland with minutes of mind numbing nothingness but you have the musical score to keep you company which brings me to my next point 4 the music perfect i am still torn between the jazzy music in fallout 4 and the western blues in new vegas but without a doubt i can say that the score in new vegas is masterful 5 the dlc in fallout new vegas are the best dlc i have experienced in any game if you have played fallout 4 you may know that the far harbor dlc is better than the base game itself the dlc in new vegas is like far harbor but it does not overshadow the main story but rather it complements the main story perfectly all dlc are tied to each other and to the base game which gives the player a feeling of familiarity and intrigue in fallout 4 the dlc had barely anything to do with what was happening in the commonwealth where in new vegas the lore is expanded upon and tied together revealing secrets and mysteries you come across in the mojave play honest hearts first old world blues second dead money third and lonesome read last for the best experience in conclusion my iron gets big when my boots jingle jangle jingle across the mojave despite its obvious flaws
