warhammer 40 000 rogue trader is everything and more that i ever wanted from a warhammer rpg video game owlcat did an amazing job with this game so here are a few key pointers which i feel definitely helped enhanced the experience for me above the other crpg type games i have played thus far good1 the loreowlcat definitely did their homework with this one the warhammer universe is rich with lore and the way it is translated to the game is one of the best i have experienced so far i genuinely read through most if not all of the codex entries found just to understand how the different factions you encounter in the game work 2 the characterswhile not being fully voiced the game does make up for it with how interesting most of the characters were it has always been a heretical dream of mine to be an eldar sympathizer and you can do exactly just that here in rogue trader i was allowed to be as lenient and helpful to my xeno friends as much as i wanted to with some minor repercussions of course but that s fine by me i genuinely cared for my party members and i was invested in all of their stories what striked me as most interesting is how interconnected the party really was with the events that happened in the game what this means is that the party itself feels more like characters of their own with their own motives and needs 3 storyit is definitely a warhammer esque story for better or for worse world ending cataclysmic things are quite common here it seems so it does not feel like another chosen one trope despite it being exactly that though the main quest does have you making huge changes to that part of the galaxy at the end of the day there is never a truly happy ending to the any tale in the warhammer verse and i kinda appreciated how owlcat kept that part of warhammer true bad1 combat some of the combat situations encounters that you get railroaded into are just nasty on higher difficulties i was never a fan of that in pathfinder wrath of the righteous and boy is it present here too luckily an easy swap in difficulty made it more bearable but i was kinda hoping i did not need to do that just to enjoy the game at a certain difficulty level 2 bugs sometimes characters dont register properly quests seemingly have no resolution achievements not counting etc etc overall i think it is a wonderful addition to the warhammer video game lineup for those who really love the world and lore you are definitely going to like this but just bear in mind that the combat is turn based so it might put some ppl off in that sense if you are not a fan of the genre an easy 7 10 for me
