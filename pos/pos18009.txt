2014 total war rome ii is alright i guess you play as the conscience of a single nation while you coerce them into annihilating anyone who had the absolute audacity to be born different than you just like real life the game revolves around the uprising of the roman republic and empire of rome an ancient nation so unique looking you would swear they fell out of a forgotten realms novel also there are a plethora of other nations but they aren t important because their name is not in the title when the game first came out it ran as smoothly as my grandfather s chest hair which is to say not smoothly at all i got this game at launch from a underground bum fight first prize i would have preferred the wedge of cheese textures looked like mud models looked like mud strangely enough mud looked like water there was also this thing where the a i was so incompetant that my one year old nefew could have out smarted them in a game of build a blocks it s amazing to see soldiers trained for years break out into a mosh pit as soon as a fight starts like a sweet sixteen at the kardashians though i would admit the combat animations are neat especially with the blood and gore mod where you get to watch the roman elite cut down farmers and city folk with sharp pointy swords the campaign reminded me of my high school years where nobody liked me it seemed that everyone had it in for poor little rome to be perfectly fair though we do have nicer hats i would be jelous as well diplomacy was practically useless and you could have probably sat in your chair and remembered all of the embarassing moments in your life like the time you made a mix tape for kelsey in a misdirected attempt to get her to fall in love with you while waiting for the a i s turns to end sorry kelsey call me sometime i ve waited for you but that was the past and you know what they say those who don t watch discovery channel are doomed to repeat discovery channel just like discovery chanel repeats with the emperor augustus update you get a bunch of game fixes as well as a new campaign the new campaign follows the second triumvirate where rome split quicker than the cool kids at a lame party you can play as mark antony pompeii and a bunch of people who s names aren t nearly as cool the game no longer runs like a cripple on gravel roads and you can now keep your units in formation though you could probably do that before in the time i stopped playing this game i found myself actually having fun which is illegal in some countries be sure to check your local laws and jurisdictions with the emperor augustus update should you buy rome 2 i guess you could i mean it s there isn t it just push the button come on do it i dare you i give creative assemblies bastard child four tim allens out of five uerugh s
