2020 as a free to play game i had my doubts about world of warships however the reality has been pretty good until tier 5 6 you progress fairly quickly and can get through without really needing to pay for a premium account after that point the difficulty escalates fairly quickly as you start to face players with a serious number of games under their belts if you learn the ropes you can have some really awesome gamesadvice to anybody wanting to try it is not progress through the tiers too quickly learn the game mechanics around spotting and shell penetration dont buy a tier 10 premium when you first start as your not going to have a good timeother than that enjoying blatting away with he at everything that moves
