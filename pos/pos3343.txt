2017 early access review if you re looking for a roleplaying game with interesting and useful abilities both in and out of combat this game is for you if you re looking for an rpg with a deep involved story across multiple characters this game is for you if you re looking for an rpg where you feel powerful but are also constantly challenged to improve both in skill and level then this game is for you however this game is not for you if you are bored by dialogue this game is not for you if you dislike complexity and having to actually learn how to play and this game is not for you if you you require instant gratification for me this game plays like a western version of a jrpg with many characters to join your party a deep complex story and many ways for you to affect the story the combat is turn based which allows for more depth in the combat system and more strategic options if you haven t tried turn based combat before this is a great way to try it it s like diablo but for intelligent adults each origin character provides with a completely different gameplay experience even if you play them as the same class overall as an rpg i give dosii a 10 10 on a curved scale unparalleled in the modern pc market and preferrable to the most recent console offering final fantasy 15
