2023 early access review project zomboid is not a zombie survival game it is a zombie survival simulator a goal greatly aided by the variety of sandbox settings and the prolific modding community that has sprung up around it while normally i d be wary of suggesting a game that s been in early access for well over a decade the content on offer is already worth the 20 price tag especially with friends and only solidified by semi regular updates and the work of talented community creators that being said the game definitely isn t for everyone you can change things up enough with the settings that i believe it can appeal to most people but if you are unwilling to take the time to learn the fundamentals and tweak the game to your liking the chances you will bounce off are quite high the depth and enjoyment accessible past that barrier earns my recommendation despite the warning
