2014 another awesome game from paradox a great improvement from eu3 but ck2 is still my favourite amazing game that really makes civilization 5 look kind of boring in comparison i m a big fan of strategy games but have always found it hard to find that special sense of satisfaction towards the end game many times conquering or in other ways dominating the world can be a repetitive and somewhat boring process the europa universalis series have been one out of a very few games delivering and with the latest version the team over at paradox has made it easier than ever for new players to jump in that said this isn t a game for the casual player and the amount of information clearly surpasses games like civilization but for me who don t mind some learning planning and strategic thinking it s as close to a pc game blessing as is possible the satisfaction of transforming an insignificant little european country in nowadays germany or italy into the worlds most powerful nation is immense
