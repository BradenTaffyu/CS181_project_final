2020 took a lil while to grow on me but i m a big fan of this title very solid entry by ca and i d definitely recommend it to others first off to address the tw warhammer esque hero generals this can be turned off by disabling romance mode 3kingdoms isn t a straight historical tw as it s based on both the historical three kingdoms period and the romance of the three kingdoms book and the legends on which it is based player s choice for those who may want the more traditional realistic tw experience the main criteria battles characters diplomacy buildingbattles units have access to a strong variety of abilities and formations as you progress so battles don t get stale generals are very well implemented imo they add a lot to battles the wu xing mechanic is also very interesting and adds an extra strategic and tactical layer to battles because not only are different general types are better worse against others but each general type has access to bonuses with different unit types e g only armies with strategists can build siege units but strategists themselves are passive and weak in pitched battle it also gives a nice layer of flavour to everything good mix of units for the most part but after a while the overall roster of units gets a bit samey when you ve unlocked all the generic units most factions field more or less the same rosters so get used to seeing the same units a lot unit design is still good though would just have liked to see more variety and special units and stronger unit diversity between factions the formations are usually good and thank you ca for bringing a proper range of formations back though they can glitch out a bit sometimes ranges from mildly annoying to problematic in fast paced battles easily dealt with by pausing but if you re trying to play without pausing its a pain when your formation click goes wobbly and your spearwall decides to line up sideways to the enemy charge or your group move order causes your entire line to rotate out of position charactersi actually really like the romance mode legendary characters the relationships make sense and feel organic characters can deepen relationships or form rivalries with each other which translate to buffs etc if they fight side by side or vs one another the wu xing general type mechanic comes in both at a battle level and in administration because different general types have access to different assignments different buffs depending on how the commandery province is built and so on you can equip items like in twwh which buff your characters or give access to certain abilities or formations the characters are varied and interesting based on real individuals legendary characters all have their own special buffs and the unique models are very nicely designed diplomacyfinally a tw where the diplomacy is fluid no more clunky menus confused clicking etc moreso than the mechanics engaging in diplomacy is intuitive and well set out you get all the information you need and the ui is lovely there s a strong range of diplo options and special ones depending on what character you play great feature buildinggood strategic map building mechanics commaderies represent your administrative provinces and there is a very diverse range of territory resources building types etc across china again wu xing comes in with certain building types supporting others synergistically unique buildings for different factions are also well done and genuinely influence playstyle strategic map is also v nice
