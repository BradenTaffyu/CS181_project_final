2023 early access review this game is one of the best and most realistic zombie games that i have ever experienced in the field of survival and survivor and it can be difficult for beginners if you are not patient and careful this game can be very difficult for you because it is not like the other games you have played before it s a game of highs and lows its lows can be incredibly boring like sleeping off an infection or get sick taking a real life half an hour to read a book for a 1 increase to skill xp its highs however are incredibly high there is nothing quite like getting your first car running fighting off a horde of zombies with your friends learn mechanical medical agricultural engineering carpentry and or building up the perfect base for the zombies to destroy in some way you never imagined and finally i suggest that you try it and have fun with this game
