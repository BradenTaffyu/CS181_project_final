2016 early access review 7 days to die this is the sandbox set in postapocalyptic times the game is set in the near future where nuclear war led to the destruction of humanity however it is only a small problem because most of the population has been infected with a virus that kills within seven days and turns them into zombies in the game we create our hero that will be male or female creating a character is very well developed and immediately after creation the game crosses us to map navezgane or randomly created world this production has been completely set in an open world that allows the destruction of all objects on the map the big plus is a variety of locations to visit during the game locations such as large cities military bases blocks and other types of buildings depending on the biome in which we find ourselves and there are several burnt forrest a place where there is not much to explore the desert where at the day we re overheats and freezes at night the forest place to build our sanctuary having large amounts of food and very good access to water pine forest is another very good place to survive like it is no different from ordinary forest that maybe the rain or even snow radioactive contamination zone a place that shows borders of the map but also being in this place can be fatal for our hero plain flat place with little amount of trees and animals that could make problems in survival for beginners snowy forrest place for advanced players intense cold can cause huge problems wasteland a place similar to burnt forest so that it contains the huge city with a lot of loot but also quite a few number of very aggressive zombies as for the opponents they differ in many ways from usual zombie to a strong mutant in the game you can also choose the difficulty level or set your own preferences this production is quite a great title single player and multiplayer create and develop your character from scratch a huge world to explore and a lot of other things to do the soundtrack is very good as well as graphically in my opinion this is a very cool production and i had a lot of fun while playing this game the game however is still in the early access and some may not like it but you can probably expect further updates
