2020 product received for free go wherever your heart desires all i do is using the airplanes but had some fun with the tanks aswell i played the game befor any tanks or boats came in to it and always really liked the dmg module on the plane s trying to fly back after a part of your wing or flaps broke off or with a 4 engin bomber that only has 1 left land on your airfield and repair it to only fly back to battle and try it again best feeling in the world the game has some slight balancing issues but once you see the same type of aircraft over and over you will find out how to attack them sometimes you just shud not go head on vs russians or start a dog fight vs once you find out that fly high or go home is the key you will get more and more kills till some one els is flying higher sad to say that bombers are hard to play there are fighters that climb so fast that bombers are not safe at high altitude and can be burst down rather easy this because its hard to balance it out vs gunners on bombers if you do want to play bomber i suggest putting allot of points in to your gunners they keep you safe greetings from the sky apanda
