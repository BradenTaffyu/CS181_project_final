2014 early access review this is one of the best games i have ever played the game is flawless and it only keeps on getting better it is not even complete and it is worth every penny just wait for multiplayer and the thousands of customizable mods and you have a game that will entertain yourself forever i have bought this game 3 times to give it out as a gift to friends because i love it so much please buy this game and experience the best game ever
