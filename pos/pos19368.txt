2021 first take this with a grain of salt because i m not someone who puts a ton of stock in graphics but wow this game is gorgeous the ui is well polished the textures and unit models are great think that trailer is just bloated eye candy think again the campaign cinematic movies are beyond expectations second what on earth are those hotkeys the lack of room for customization is quite a bummer that said it looks like the developers put a lot of thought into the default hotkeys and they are pretty easy to follow in other words i m not sure how i feel about them right now third let s talk about content i know a lot of people including myself were a little bit skeptical when they announced that the game would only have 8 civilizations at launch after playing for a bit and watching some of the internet content made with this game however my opinion has changed the age up mechanics and the scale of differences between civs is quite refreshing if this is how it s going to be quality over quantity all the way fourth it would be remiss of me not to mention the missing features no map editor no mod support and no custom map scripting are disappointing the developers say they are coming early next year though so not a total loss as a curious programmer i went digging into the game files to see what i could find there is a licenses folder containing the license agreement for each third party library framework they used if those licenses are anything to go by mod support should be pretty nice when it gets here
