2023 one of the best city management logistics management games ever made great ost great additions to the classic anno s gameplay formula the opponent and neutral npcs are all extremely charming and have great dialogue the game s artists and animators went the extra mile to make the cities and its buildings feel lived in thanks to a ton of unique animations and assets for things the player will rarely look at for more than a few seconds some downsides though the music might be good but the music player isn t sticking to repetition of specific tracks despite there being a huge variety of music that only gets unlocked at certain stages for no good reason the ui could use some work i don t mind multiplying my supply and demand by the docklands time tables but it s a bit of a time waster that this isn t automated dlc is generally nice but the anarchist dlc feels pretty tacked on and is entirely pointless opponent npcs don t have consistent trade offers either so creating trade routes with them is very unreliable and pointless making their presence in a sandbox run kinda pointless unless you want to shoot at other ships regarding the ubisoft launcher a lot of the negative reviews regarding issues with not being able to play due to permissions are old and don t impact a new installation the ubisoft launcher does create some waste of time and is invasive whenever it updates but it has not stopped me from playing ever
