2021 in summary this is my favorite rpg type game since gothic 2 they basically improved every single flaw that i had with dos 1 and created game that is the closest thing to what i would call a perfect rpg game must play for any rpg fan in my opinion things i disliked most about it nothing major really only slight nitpicks like necromancer costing too much ap slow ish walking and small things like that which are either optionally included in gift bags or easily fixed by mods this game has really good modding support things i liked most about it you can kill everybody including main npcs and even yourself all lines are voiced and it also has really good voice acting if you do good things you unlock unique hero tag in dialogues and bad things give you villain tag you can interact with all objects in the world and even move throw objects around you can even kill people with these objects ex throw something really heavy on somebody and he will die or get damaged interesting story and side quests with very well written lines beautiful diverse world with great graphics and music amazing class system and spells it s really fun to explore all of the different combinations in combination with environmental effect it almost feels endless freedom to solve quests however you want just like in gothic games you don t have to pick quest in order for some npc to appear you can go ahead and explore however you want and if you already found some certain item for dungeon you can go oh you mean this and just end quest right there skills attribute system one of the best in any video game i ve seen so far each point can be useful for all of the classes and you can create very cool variations very big replay value i can see myself replaying this game for years to comenote i didn t even play multiplayer yet but i heard from friends that it s also really good
