2017 fallout new vegas ist still today the best fallout game for me fallout 3 is equally good i just enjoy the setting of the mojave a lot more i find myself playing it with some nice mods in 2017 i could not get myself to replay fallout 4 since it has little replay value for me bad for role playing new vegas is full of crazy stories and feels a lot bigger and richer than fallout 4 i am still finding new things played for 100s of hours before i switched to pc get it
