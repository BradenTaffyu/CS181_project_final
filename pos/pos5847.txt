2023 a true gem of pc gaming i see a lot of similarities with the total war serie from create assembly only here everything happens in fps also i ve been mumbling to myself for more than a decade that tw mechanics are staling i think that bannerlord made the changes that tw would need for the longest time i ve been thinking of a tw where you man a character that would travel the world with his mercenary company and maybe evolve in something more that s what bannerlord is doing actually the game does much more than just that it s an impressive game where many time at least as a new player you will pause your game and ponder what is the best course of action hiring troop is a good thing but you need to know how to make money to sustain the troops increasing your army size might empower you but you ll need to sustain your new army size take care of food party speed movement etc and there are so many turning points in the game where you feel pressure and the need to adapt only you re not certain where to venture to adapt you can craft and sell weapons either by staying small or by going with a pack of mule but at the risk of letting bandits catch up with you you can hire many companions either to train them to fight or as scout or to lead caravan parties etc the possibilities are so many that this is where you shall get lost as a newcomer to the game of course like in every other game and moreover in a game with such diverse mechanics and possibilities there are some formulas starting activities skills to level up way to build your character troops to hire way to make money how to increase reputation how to deal with arena etc etc that work better than other thus experienced players tend to use 2 3 pony tricks to make their lives much easier although i didn t try any yet at the time of writing this review bannerlord is also an extremelly modable game and as such many mods will fix what might kill the fun there and there for some players there are also many notable total conversion mods that turn the game into lotr got even sw and many more huge game with varied type of gameplay mechanics smithing trading fighting arena etc quite beautiful in its own way while the graphics might not the best the scenery with troops clashing on the battle ground is quite astonishing and exciting combat mechanics are guite good and demading we are not in arcadish territory you can shine on the battlefied but it s going to require talent dedication extremelly modable game with already a ton of mods available ai in such a game the ai is put to challenge because troops usually have two weapons so they have to correctly time when to rely on each one they also have to know how to skirmish and to have decent pathfinding they also require to know how to rush to a wall to defend it to mount a ladder to push a ladder with a fork to rush a gate to destroy it to man a catapult etc etc etc in the end it s a mixed bag units will know how to do most of their stuff so that s quite good but there and there there will be bad pathfindings skirmishing units that go charging etc on the store page at the time of writing this review there is a mini gif video where everybody can witness the ineffectiveness of spear troops vs cavalry where spearmen would usually brace to stop cav here it s not really working ultimately it does create a imbalance between certain type of troops control command simply put i highly dislike it it s functional it does the job but if you re like me many times you ll end up giving the incorrect command to the incorrect troop also it s a pain to split your troops into the correct stacks it always depend what you ve in mind some player will probably have no pain with this because they are going to stack with casual sort of splitting but if you re trying to get away form the normative formulas it s going to be such a pain that you re probably going to abort any further attempt and rely on the casual way of dealing with everything because it s vastly easier to handle the unit command is a matter of selecting 1 2 3 4 etc and applying f1 f2 f3 sometimes doubling down to get the researched effect and finally as for the con very poorly integrated key binding from now on i think i am going to go to war with this thing because the more i buy new games and the more i find out that this feature is so poorly designed i simply don t understand why ppl are not equipping their forks stockpiling torchs and make ready to invade forums to dispatch hatred and revolution and torture and pillaging and all the correct thing in the correct amount that would be necessary to deal with this hello ppl we are on steam that means we play on pc and on pc sorry to remind most of you but we have keyboards and mouse and we should be proud of that heritage i always switch w a s d for something else ofc it s only my deal but there was a time when i didn t know a single dude that would play with w a s d and nowadays no one seem to bother bannerlord allows to edit keybinding and it did allow me to get my favored hotkeys to work but it was a pain because there is no auto replace instead the game will block any attempt to rename an hotkey if that one is arleady in use so you have to scroll down all the action to find the hotkey to rename it into something else that again is not taken in order to go back for your hotkey and edit it sometimes some hotkeys will be used 3 times and sometimes it s going to be an issue also there are a lot of hotkeys conclusionthe sums of its pro and con is probably misleading to what bannerlord truly is that is to say a titan of pc gaming a cult classic and something that most of us should get their hands on and try out the fantastic mods and notably the total conversions would probably deal with most nitpicking still bannerlord is not exempt of faults every one of its mechanics will probably hold one or two faults still there can only one highlander and this one is a challenger
