2020 i actually just wanna play this game all day star wars the old republic is truly a fantastic representation of the star wars universe the game is great for both single player enthusiasts and for multiplayer addicts it contains very engaging story lines with some fairly good graphics i recommend cranking it up to ultra the game has single play pve pvp battlegrounds guilds starfighter simulation you name it this game literally has everything you could want from a star wars game sure it s structured as an mmo but if you want to primarily play solo you absolutely can and you won t miss out on anything i think the coolest thing i can say about this game is that you determine your play style i really enjoy the choice aspect of this game and in general playing in my own star wars episodes the adventures are so immersive and with the gigantic library of content and story lines to explore well needless to say i ll be playing this game for the next several months or maybe even years i feel i ve barely scratched the surface yet and i m so excited to live out the many other stories this game has to offer if you love star wars and you love gaming then swtor is truly a match made in heaven 9 0 10
