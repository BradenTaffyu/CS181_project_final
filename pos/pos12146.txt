2020 iracing is such a perfect car racing game that i have been playing for many years on cars racing games but there are something that i really don t like so much is spending all time to get licence or what you call points to race it make me feel i am playing the ps1 in 1995 of the gt game i have been buying cars and tracks but i think is useless for me iracing almost 2 years or more but still not yet with a licence coz i only have try only 2 races to get the points so i am always on the project cars2 actually i am already 68 years old not really in the mood to spend time to get points to start race
