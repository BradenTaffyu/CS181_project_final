2015 early access review a plague simulator with an infectious amount of replayablity the graphics and gameplay are rather simple but the end goal is to dominate the world with those little red circles of infection timing plays a huge role in evolving and deevolving traits depending on the type of infection for instance if your plague is too severe before you attain widespread infection humans will begin working on a cure before you have time enough to infect everyone conversely if you are too wide spread through transmission abilities you might not end up with enough dna to be lethal enough before a cure is found the planet of the apes add on is very interesting i m still experimenting with it but unleashing a virus that makes apes more intelligent and combat humans is quite entertaining in fact things got so bad in china once the us decided to nuke em just to supress the spread of the virus youtube video views 0 menu driven disease simulator of 2015
