2017 amazing great turn based tactical combat love the character creation with 8 races so welcome love multiple non human racial choices in rpgs and so many classes that can be customized you can create one character and then you recruit npcs along the way there is a trick to create them all yourself though see the steam guide custom party creation a guide for divinity original sin 2 by navier guide updated to patch v3 0 141 822 sept 14th release create a fully customizable party with this guide it will give you full control over every character the npcs are well done there are 6 to choose from note when they join you get to choose their class which is a great original idea but their race is fixed later on you can respec all of their ability talent skill point selections if you want items equipment and enemies all seem quite interesting with lots of different stats and abilities controller ps4 xbox support is fantastic and it is fully playable via controller this is now one of my favorite rpgs of all time and best game of the year for sure
