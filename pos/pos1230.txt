early access review i want to write a review for this gem of a game and just express how amazing the base game is and how much more amazing the community has made it with mods the developers give you such a high degree of control over how you play the game i don t know how this isn t just the standard yet do you want to play as a day 1 survivor cool there s an option for that are you unhappy with how many cars you think there should be at that stage cool there s an option for that wanna start in the middle of hoard a year into the apocalypse there s a damn option for that the only thing missing in my opinion is a proper end game however for all you new players it will take you many hours to properly get to that point as you learn the basic mechanics then learn to survive for days at a time then learn how to manage medium groups of zombies then large then hoards and the multiplayer is fantastic if you have some friends who can all set aside an hour or 2 every few nights the indie stone keep doing what you re doing 3
