early access review this game is what makes games great it might not be the best for some people especially because there s no tutorial but that s what makes this game different from others the ps1 like graphics are just a part of the game its identity the absence of a tutorial makes the game feel more real not just look more real there s so little aaa game studio and so much passionate side project about this that it makes the whole game much more enjoyable
