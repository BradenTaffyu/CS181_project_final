2022 tl dr it s better than fallout 4yes now that you ve read past the headline you will be wondering what the hell am i talking about the game that has been the subject of so many memes the epicenter of ridicule aimed at bethesda and todd howard a game so broken at launch that only cp2077 could top it in terms of the backlash it received how can such a game be better than fallout 4 which despite its flaws is still a great game well here s how it fixes the terrible dialogue system introduced in fallout 4 s p e c i a l checks in dialogue are more common just like in fallout 3 and nv being a silent protagonist helps it s the reason why there will be no voiced player character in starfield but i digress huge map to explore by huge i mean proper huge like with different biomes and distinct geographies 16 times the detail was a meme but todd wasn t lying when he said that the world is much bigger than anything they had created before fallout 4 feels too congested in my opinion a serviceable story that has you learning about the different factions in the game without having to side with one and destroy the others this was the biggest gripe i had with the story in fallout 4 aside from the uninspired find your son narrative crafting is both simplified and expanded upon from fallout 4 in fallout 4 it would take ages for you to craft the best versions of your favorite equipment unless you use console commands here since it is a pseudo mmo crafting is actually pretty good if you are clever with managing your resources and know where to farm raw materials s p e c i a l is revamped it s not just choosing any perk you like as you level up here builds are possible and you have to manage perk cards by swapping them in or out as the situation demands now it s time to talk about the major aspect of any mmo like game the grind well to put it in as few words as possible its not great but not terrible either it s true that the best versions of equipment will only be available at level 50 but you also level up much quicker than in fallout 4 because of the presence of teams daily events and the higher number of quests in general level up your intelligence and xp from quests will never be a problem the only thing to keep in mind till you reach the end game is to constantly use weapons and armor appropriate for your level it will not help if you grow too attached to the level 15 legendary at level 30 for example when ordinary drops from fallen enemies will be better in terms of damage output other than that the only real grind comes at the end game where you have to grind treasury notes to exchange gold bullion for getting plans to the best quality equipment that the game has to offer you can only get 800 gold bullion per day from treasury notes plus 300 per week for 6000 caps it will take a few weeks to get all the equipment and upgrades you might want and this is perhaps the only major drawback of the grind in this game so overall i would recommend fallout 76 it certainly got its fair share of hate at launch perhaps justifiably so but now for a new player it s a great experience to hop in and enjoy the appalachia
