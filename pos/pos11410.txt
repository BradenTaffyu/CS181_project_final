2016 early access review i played this game for a total of about 5 hours now and my adentures have been great first my friend thought that you could get gas from hitting a gas barrel and exploded me and my bed it took me about 20 minutes to swim back only to randomly die and have to swim back again we robbed a bank and built a house on the roof then my friends set out on a great bear hunt after much struggling my friends killed the bear only to have one of them run into his own spike and die next we had to prepare for the super wave that comes on the seventh days which basically consisted of us covering the entire bank in spikes and then sitting on our roof at approximately 21 hours the wave washed up against our spikes like the americans on d day and we watched and listened to the terrifying chorus of zombies and mutant dogs crying in pain as the sun came up we saw almost a hundred corpses lying against the spike wall and the few zombies remaining were spinning around having ptsd flashbacks 10 out of 10 would commit mass genocide again
