early access review after 26 days i felt like an unstoppable force my base was a fortress fortified with armed survivors courtesy of the superb survivors mod behind the wheel of my massive van towing a trailer filled to the brim with loot weapons and enough ammo to start a war i was the king of this post apocalyptic world but even kings have room for improvement and for me it was learning how to connect generators i cannot hammer in enough how invincible i thought i was i scoured every inch of the nearby town raiding every store and flipping through every book desperate to find the elusive magazine that held the key to my upgrade and just when i thought i d searched everywhere i realized my gas supply was dwindling with the pumps useless without electricity my gas guzzling van was devouring fuel faster than i could find it determined to solve both problems i embarked on an expedition gathering every last drop of gasoline and stocking up on supplies confident in my ability to handle the zombie hordes i set out into the desolate cities and roads ready to conquer whatever challenges came my way after what felt like days of pitstops and unwelcomed visits to abandoned homes i stumbled upon a trailer park a potential treasure trove in this barren wasteland excited by the prospect of finding what i needed i approached an old survivor s trailer home hoping it held the magazine i sought but as i pried off the boarded up window and dispatched a couple of zombies lurking outside i was unprepared for what awaited me inside when i initially peeked in all i saw were a couple zeds instead of the two zombies i expected i was met with a mini horde swarming me within the cramped home like hungry vultures panic surged through me as they closed in their grasping hands reaching for me with deadly intent in a desperate attempt to fend them off i frantically mashed the space bar trying to shove them away but with each shove my character strained harder to exhausted to push any more it was futile as the zombies overwhelmed me tearing through flesh and bone with savage efficiency i could only watch in horror as everything i d worked so hard for was torn apart before my eyes this is how you died is how the game started i didn t expect these words to ring true so soon heartbroken and defeated i stared at the screen feeling the weight of my failure but in that moment of despair a spark of determination ignited within me i won t make that mistake again i vowed steeling myself for the challenges that lay ahead and with that i returned to the menu ready to dive back into the fray in a new world with a new character of course because in this unforgiving world the only way to survive is to keep pushing forward learning from your mistakes and most importantly knowing when you re in over your head
