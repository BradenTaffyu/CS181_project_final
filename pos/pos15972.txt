this game also allows you to create or recreate things beyond gaming for example when my brother died i created a memorial room with walls of photos to honor and remember him forever within the game the incense is burning music playing videos of him dancing and laughing and everything in the room was specifically designed and placed for him still makes me cry when i load the room and that s just a touch of the magic this game bestows upon you this is not one game it s a massive technically infinite collection of tabletop card miniature games and therefore no other single game could possibly compare 96 positive reviews i think that says enough thank you berserk games
