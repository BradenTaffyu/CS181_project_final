2017 if you re looking for a shooter equal to call of duty or battlefield you have definitely come to the wrong place this game is not about kills and superior aim it s all about tactics and coordination first off arma 3 is more of a platform for multiple games than a standalone game itself you can either play vanilla arma without mods completing the campaign as a soldier or can enjoy the game by playing king of the hill in multiplayer or you could play as a lone survivor after the apocalypse fighting your way through by battling other survivors looting abandoned houses and building your gearstack to be able to compete with other players in exile or you could play altis life role playing as a regular person in the daily life of the people on the arma maps and there are way more arma 3 mods and modes that i can t even list here since there are just too many furthermore you won t really need all the extensions since there are thousands of community created mods maps weapons attachments vehicles and more to just play around with if you are interested in all of this i d definitely recommend you to give this game a try and if you don t like it you can always refund it after all
