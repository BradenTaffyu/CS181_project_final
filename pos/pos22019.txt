2017 i cannot say much of anything which has not already been said about this game but who can stop the provocated hands of a writer i can add scarcely anything but praise which already exists in excess for this game but as a newcomer to the series this review then by default is primarily though not exclusively for newcomers such as myself everything about this game from the gameplay the graphics the vague pvp to the yet vaguer story lore is something intense something which stands apart from the vast array of titles which are paraded onto the digital and retail marketplaces and although everything about this game is intense nothing seems forced the voice acting done is insanely good i mean there are splendid baritones of the men and also the soft lullaby voices of the women it is simply a treat to walk through the world of lothric a land of monstrosities which is a world fallen into ruin not just the visuals but also the music is simply amazing just perfectly fitted for each moment there exists a piece of music for this game dark souls iii does everything well including its silence we are silent we speak nothing we have no voice and it would be a joke to call ourselves the protagonist we are just an undead on a forsaken quest for which we won t be thanked or remembered it brings out the stark and lovely misery in many ways it is much like real life struggle of real life heroes some of the stories nay most of the lore of the bosses and npc s are deeply moving and there exist a plethora of videos on youtube if you want to delve deeper into their sorrow and mull and wallow in sadness the choice of weapons armour is also something worth mentioning you can even don the armour of the bosses you defeat which also plays a part in the greater irony of the world and yet more tragic in some sense is the soul transposition concept with which we can make weapons out of the souls of the bosses we fell but the defining characteristic the thing for which even casual gamers such as myself reach back time and again into the game is the gameplay which is absolutely brilliant it cannot be compared to anything things are indeed compared to the souls gameplay the combat the management and investment of stats rpg perspective the quests you take the friends you make the routines you break each button press each light attack each special move each dodge each and every movement and action that you make the character do is important it is more than a pattern it is not merely repetition it is getting skilled gaining confidence and familiarity and then going in and getting through which fills you with fulfilment and contentment even the abstract lore and story is presented in such a poetic and beautiful way that one cannot help but probe further into it through the sources which the game itself provides stringing together clues piecing together fragments of scraps from descriptions and dialogues but the curiosity which is invoked by the subtlest of hints is something which made me at least become a fan of lore videos which plentifully plague youtube the essence and soul of dark souls iii lies in the way it retains its uniqueness despite everything being compared to it the only con i think is that nothing really can live up to the souls experience and that like almost everything that we truly love is tragic
