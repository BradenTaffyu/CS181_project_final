2020 early access review this is most certainly an early access review and it s possible that half of the things i write here will be rendered moot in the coming months i am also in the process of ordering some new ram for my computer so this game will likely perform better in another week or two with those things in mind i don t want to waste too much time writing a full article sized review instead i ll just start listing off things i do and don t like i love the battles i mean it s the major gameplay loop of the whole game so it damn well better be enjoyable the combat itself is a mixed bag my swings or shots often don t connect when i think they should but that could be a stuttering issue i think the ordering of troops could be done with a smoother ui i m not sure how but there is a hell of a learning curve when you want to start ordering each and every type of unit between infantry cavalry and archers trying to tell them all to do different things before your enemies horse army rides up your anus is a chore and a half and you will eventually have to get them to do other things since you re not going to have a full set of cavalry right out of the gate i found that forcing everyone to charge would leave my dozens of units of infantry behind while my eight or so horse riders get annihilated so there s that i like how the game has immediate mod support there s already a robust community patch and several things available on the nexus website that can certainly attribute to some quality of life simple things like mixed gender troops and reputation gain when you take out looters that mode makes chasing looters down slightly more worth your time rather than just training up unused weapon skills they re not good for much else pretty quickly my favorite mod so far might be the one that allows cleave damage without it all of your weapons only hit one enemy at a time it s saved my ass more than once i love the sieges the mechanics surrounding them have been hit or miss but when it goes well it feels great at one point i was flanking my nation s army i didn t attach myself to his main force protecting them while they built up their siege camp then i decided to hit the castle and wait for the siege to begin but at the last second the main army breaks off to fight some defending force leaving me with the immediate task of fighting off the castle s beefy militia i lost massively i like how you don t lose all of your loot when you fail but you do however lose every single one of your troops i ve had to recover about three times now which is a tedious chore sometimes on the flip side of that i am typically an archery so i helped a battering ram get through by headshot sniping an entire wall s worth of archers i ve been in a single somewhat evenly matched siege with both armies in the 400 s and it was an incredibly intense endeavor knowing that reinforcements are a finite resource makes watching the enemy s bar go down all the more satisfying this is essentially what the civil war questline in skyrim was supposed to be but just didn t have the engine or mechanics to handle it i like how i m not a walking god even with decent armor i can cut down large swaths of looters on my own again thanks to the cut through everything mod but against anything else i actually have to position properly or else i can watch my health melt from arrows the ai isn t the smartest but they re not dumb either i once flanked behind an enemy force but their backline were actually turning around and backpedaling with their shields up making my headshots harder to get even though my superior army was advancing on them what a great feeling to be victorious against an enemy that actually thinks about things like that i like how dying isn t an instant game over at least so far i did uncheck that option instead i m just captured and hauled away before the game gives me a chance to escape and run off i don t like graphics and kind of wish it was prettier for a 2020 game the foliage and sun shafts are nice and all but the models look a decade old i ve failed an escort quest because i couldn t tell who was who in the town skirmish because the clothing and facial features aren t usually distinct enough while i am somewhat indifferent on the xp and leveling system though there are mods to fix that as well i actually don t like the percentages on some of the perks one of the first weapon perks you can get is increasing your damage by 4 that s almost nothing in the early game when you re hitting for 20 s at best a few perks in is only giving you 2 4 points of bonus damage and i know that because the damage alerts in the corner actually tell you that s almost worthless in the grand scheme of things so i wish some of the perks had more meat to them speaking of yes the game is buggy i haven t suffered many crashes but i have had a ton of performance issues which i alluded to in the beginning some of the quests don t function properly and some of the perks don t work without mods like being able to use longbows on horseback again the plague of early access the good news is beneath the problems is a functional and incredibly fun game i don t fully understand what is making me enjoy this so much but i ll have plenty of time of introspection in the coming months as the devs continue to work on fixing things i do not regret this purchase at all and that s coming from someone who has been burned by early access a few too many times
