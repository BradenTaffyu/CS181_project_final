2020 i once had a colony going pretty successfully and had a decent wedding for two of my colonists bob and pearl they were very much in love one day in a raid pearl was killed bob became very lonely and was saddened deeply the colony built a beautiful sarcophagus for pearl and bob visited it often to help with this i had the colony buy bob a companion a dog which i named waffles bob was elated to have a companion with him and while it didn t make his sadness go away i could see improvements in him almost immediately a few days later a bear came in to the colony and killed waffles rimworld is as casual or hardcore as you want it to be the storyteller mechanic allows you to choose how peaceful or chaotic you want your colonists experience and allows you to roll for different survivors on the start of your journey crashlanded on a planet in the outer rim of civilization there is a final mission reach the stars you must build a ship off of your planet but how you choose to get there provides countless possibilities one of the biggest things to be excited about with rimworld is its workshop support and its flexibility with modding thousands upon thousands of mods already exist and there will be just as more to come in the future rimworld is ostensibly a colony simulator there s the gathering of resources and building a base while defending from both environmental and human danger in that aspect the game is well executed as it is but the real magic behind this game is the stories that emerge from all of these parts coming together the dynamic relationships between the colonists and how that can affect the most minor things allows for some truly emergent gameplay it s like the sims but with defense turrets and cannibalism
