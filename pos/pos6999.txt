2019 early access review one of the things i like about raft is the constant need for attention to what you do as a player whether it is easy normal or hard i d recommend it as a mental exercise game and a fill in the hours game for solo play raft party for groups is fun and great if you plan to play hard mode though i think hard mode is great if you want a challenge what i don t like is the lack of interest in keeping current players interested in the game yet wanting to attract new players new players will be interested for the time it takes for them to reach the current soft end of game content there is right now finding the plane the boat and the radio tower are the highlights but the rest is sort of lack luster after a while it is still fun but after a while trying to play is just a matter of gathering materials building up surplus and readying for the next update which at that point will be easy to advance to the new soft end of game content current lore another good point i like the hints of the world having flooded i like the idea of having a journal in game for finds and advancing the lore as to what had happened took a while to update the review chapter 1 was a good update adding in a few clue islands where you can collect a pilot s helm and a captains hat were good additions took a while but i finally beat the bear on balboa and finished the island recently haven t gotten a bee hive yet but have found that petrol can be found in crates occasionally now i got to the caravan isle soon after i restocked my raft with wood and plastic i only use leaves to make rope and additional walls or roof portions when needed my raft has gotten big enough to need 5 engines i expect to need more in time as exploration adds more to the game did have a problem of some of my animals being knocked off the second floor of my raft somehow lost a chicken during that not a big deal find more chickens than goats and llamas now anyway i really need to hunt down another goat or two build a bee hive or two as well looking for the zipline and battery charger is interesting i like puzzles drives my husband crazy though when he watches over my shoulder as i slowly go through caravan isle now he wants me to get the zip line but i am going through the isle level by level found the jumper cables for the charger looking everywhere for parts to the zip line tools i still would recommend this game for those who like time killing survival games once you get self sufficient you can take your time in going through the game s chapters and lore areas it doesn t take long to get self sufficient after you get water and food production just remember put your water and food producers between two platform sections less likely to lose them to shark attack in easy normal or hard modes peaceful is still survival but is way easier and no worries from animals attacking you nice way to explore the game i suggest younger players to play this so they don t get upset as much you will still die from drowning but again no shark boar bear or anything will actively attack you in peaceful creative good place to plan out your raft prior to playing just remember your domestic animals can and will be washed away from your raft if they go underwater while you are moving or they are walking near a fence check them often water and grass i have 4 3x3 plots for grass and auto waterers squeezing planters into a 3x3 area also maximizes potato and flower production i have learned that trees aren t as efficient anymore for self producing wood you will use more seeds than you can get seeds from harvesting trees on your raft good for growing mangos though still use more seeds than you get back from your trees better to find isles and harvest trees from them will update as i get beehives zip line and battery charger i really need to charge some batteries i have a storage box full of them oh and last thing about buckets you collect milk with you get the buckets back apparently when you use the milk now totally self sufficient have explored a lot wanted to get the piano but lost interest after a while probably will go back for it at a later date been a few months since i was last in game i checked out the updated building options paint options and a few of the quality of life additions i m just in a holding pattern until the next chapter is released or some new stuff is added beehives make oil production easier make sure to collect flowers from islands you stop at for the seeds i stopped keeping the blooms themselves i ran out of room for paint and flowers for paint production ran out of room for wood a few times struggling with the plastic still cannot seem to collect enough but i make sure i have at least some surplus for crafting i have so many nets now i am dumping leaves and wood as i don t need them i have loads of rope getting to capacity for metal scrap and stone currently i can keep up with the needs of tools and weapons for expeditions onto bigger islands i ve sort of stalled out looking for treasure on islands i m to a point where if i lose my raft i just go drown myself not worrying about losing stuff on me i have extras and re spawn on the raft good luck rafting my fellow castaways use anchors sucks when you lose a raft when you forget to anchor last entry in this long journey i started when raft was just a cute little test game one raft one shark and wits to gather and craft the basics then they moved to steam radio tower showed up i have a screenshot of that first radio tower somewhere here then things progressed over the years chapter 1 2 gained the start of a story of why where and how now with chapter 3 and the end of the adventure to find utopia i find myself a little disappointed that there will be no more going forward i ll still play revisit a few places given time unlock the rest of the achievements then build the raft for a floating house and farm enjoy rafting my friends good luck in your journeys and don t forget the next adventure is just over the horizon raven saint
