2020 its my favorite historical total war game and i ve played all of them if you into the time period its a no brainer the multiplayer community is still alive and will be until the new medieival or rome total war is released the faction variety is huge in this one unlike some other titles like 3 kingdoms or shogun 2 that just makes the game so much better from campaign and multiplayer perspective if you never played a total war game before get this one if you like history like i do give it ago you will end up liking it it is from 2013 but it still looks and sounds amazing it runs far better then other games like atilla to sum it up buy it
