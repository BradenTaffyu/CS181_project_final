2017 i bought automata a few months back as a promising segue from shadow of mordor s stupidly satisfying combat system what i got instead was a stupidly satisfying combat system with an existential crisis disclaimer i will refrain from discussing 9s to avoid spoilers in nier automata you are 2b a special battle android of yorha make tasked with protecting the last remnants of humanity in a universe locked in perpetual warfare against an alien force that rabbit hole looks so innocent from up here doesn t it the story is profound really no surprise for anyone familiar with yoko taro s oft subversive shlock rumbling underneath the hamfisted dialog and gothic lolita outfits lies a poignant sigh at the human condition and it s bottomless hunger for destruction the reasons for it be it duty justice ignorance or revenge are explored thoroughly in its 17 chapters i admit i regret the lack of faith i had in the narratives at least at first i guess having never played the first nier i felt no priority to care enough about yorha s struggle and instead saved face grinding for loot the chapter that convinced me the story superceded what i wanted automata to be was a simple walk from a to b before time ran out the combat is elegant for a game with such an anti war message i ain t even mad as long as you stay privy to enemy telegraphs 2b s responsive controls complimented by a criminally underappreciated selection of fighting styles and upgrades makes even the most mundane encounter a magical experience not to mention the pseudo bullet hell sequences during some fights which is possibly the most refreshing marriage of genres i ve seen in quite a long time the music goes without saying it s typical for square enix rpg fare to enmesh their music into an extension of the story and automata is no different the world and its inhabitants known suffering over centuries of warfare the soundtrack gives them a voice robot onslaughts for example are lead by a woman howling seemingly in disgust over strings and drum beats or the pacifist robot village with a plucky acoustic singalong whimsy of naive innocence or an amusement park filled with wonder to drown out a darkness hidden beneath am i overanalyzing all of this hell probably my point is almost every song on the catalog feels more than just an exclamation point for the story almost every song if i have to listen to the city ruins theme one more time i will take a sledge to a piano and finally the engine looks like i have to talk about it it is a port yes a squeenix port even it was domestic abuse on my budget gtx 960 to keep the graphics preset on high very odd it handles a modded skyrim flawlessly so i ran it on medium w 2x antialias 40 60fps which in their defense still looked fantastic the only thing of note i would really bother raising a pitchfork at was the atrocious framerate tank during eve s boss fight it would be arrogant of me to suggest it will for everyone else especially with the influx of downvotes but it ran fine for me just fine like everyone else suggests it s highly recommended prep your game and install the unofficial patch by kaldaien until the devs decide to get their together i have 100 ed this game seen all 26 endings had to get plastered for ending n found and upgraded every weapon and bot completed every side quest read every weapon history and almost every bestiary i have played through the greatest hits at least twice not because i wanted the achievements but because anything less in return is undeserved for the journey automata took me on if you feel nier automata might be too obnoxious for you give it two hours grit your teeth past ending a take it from me i went in to punch things this ain t sailor moon this is evangelion 9 5 10
