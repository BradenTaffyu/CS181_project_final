2015 i went into this game hoping for a great and fun experience the fallout series has always been one of my favorites from bethesda and they are great at building a living breathing and exciting world that you d come to expect from a bethesda game fallout 4 is exactly that but some of the changes bethesda tried with this game is very questionable systems like the karma fleshed out dialogue and even the perk system have kinda been watered down that s not to say the changes were bad overall the game is so very fun and intresting and i welcome the changes they have made some of them weren t necessary at all but their is still a lot of fun to be had i highly recommend this game if you re willing to take it easy and have a great time with it
