2023 disclaimer i played this with the divinity unleashed mod the only gift bag i activated was the four relics of rivellon totally recommended by the way while everybody was talking about baldur s gate 3 i came back to finish this spiritual predecessor left unplayed for over 3 years because i was burned out after going through the first one for almost 170 hours as a sequel should be it s bigger 216 hours on my 1st playthrough without finishing all quests or seeing everything i took at least one big shortcut unintentionally and better than the previous title many things are familiar like some spells and skills and there are a ton of new ones besides the reappearance of some old characters like jahan arhu and braccus rex you can play this one without experimenting the earlier title but that s not advised actually if you can stomach crpgs released more than 20 years ago you may start with divine divinity in d os 2 there are 6 origin characters with their own questlines meaning that the game was meant to be played at least twice the developers recommend that you create a character from scratch and choose 3 of the origin characters as companions 2 of them are mages 2 are melee fighters 1 is a rogue and 1 is a ranger i recommend that you create a party of 1 of each of those 4 classes distributing skills and items and levelling up and positioning them on the battlefiled accordingly there s also crafting but you don t really need it don t bother picking everything that you find or your inventory will become a nightmare remember exploration is the main thing here go everywhere teleportation is a must speak to everyone even the animals and search every nook and cranny discoveries abound even though i don t consider this a story heavy title the plot is ok there are 3 main endings i chose the most unusual one and i was pretty happy with the conclusion combat is challenging enemy ai is pretty good but gets easy by the end when you reach high levels i finished at level 20 playing on normal difficulty here called classic way more difficult are the puzzles several of them demand trial and error and thinking outside the box i intend to replay this title one day on vanilla and with tactician hard difficulty the most obvious drawback for me is that this one is less co op inclined than the first sure you can still play co op with other 3 people at the most but d os had 2 characters as protagonists who would debate on what to do and dispute who would have the upper hand even if you played solo and this has only 1 so you can play solo and not even realize that co op was a possibility still this is a great game not a masterpiece though totally worth the full price pro tip like the xcom series d os looks and plays better with a controller if for some reason you never tried to play a crpg with a controller give it a shot and enjoy yourself more than you thought it was possible
