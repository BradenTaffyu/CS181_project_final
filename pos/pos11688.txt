2015 early access review i was a huge fan of the original and free dayz mod i have heard too many unfavorable things about the dayz standalone game and chose not to play it since then one failed clone after another left me thinking that the whole open world survival genre was going nowhere then i discovered this game at first 7dtd feels more like a minecraft mod but it very quickly proves that it is it s own unique experience recommended for anyone who likes open world survival
