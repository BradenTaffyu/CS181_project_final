2021 i ve played hundreds of games over the years but i ve never played anything like omori a friend recommended this to me awhile back so i added it to my wishlist and planned on coming back later during a sale or something once the lunar sale came around i was looking for some stuff to get when i saw omori was on sale by this point i still knew nothing about the game so i decided to watch the trailer and loved it so much i bought it that second i ve played through the game once so far and its amazing gameplay art music characters and story make this one of my favorite games of all time gameplayomori has traditional turn based combat seen in lots of rpg maker games like lisa the painful and suits in the game you have your 3 friends kel aubrey and hero who all have their own abilities and traits that help you get around the area while also helping in battle one cool feature in battle is the emotion system which determines your enemies and parties stats during combat in the middle of combat you can use items or attacks that can inflict emotions on your enemies and vice versa which changes your stats like anger which makes you deal more damage but take more in return or sadness which deals less damage but you also take less as well storythis won t contain any spoilers but i highly recommend going in completely blind for the best experience possible omori follows a child named sunny as each time he goes to bed he is able to enter a dream world where he can see his friends and be happy as you progress through this dream world you begin to see things that are a lot more sinister than what you normally see in this happy dream world throughout the game you will switch from the dream world and the real world as you dive deeper into his dreams and try to uncover the problems and trauma that plagues his mind your decisions truly matter in omori because they will affect those around you as well was what happens in the dream world the story truly is an emotional roller coaster and i ve never resonated with a game more than i have had with omori the game is such a mixed bag of emotions from happiness sadness and anger that will really make you think about the decisions that you have made and how they affected others omori has very strong themes of depression anxiety and suicide so if you are sensitive to these topics go into the game with caution music artthe music in omori is truly amazing with 179 tracks you will always be finding brand new music as you go through the game the music ranges from boss battle music that will have you pumped up during the fight to sad music that will tug at your heart you can really see the passion that went into all of the art with every area you explore and every fight you get into each enemy npc and area all look very different and amazing should you buy it if you re looking for a story driven game similar to the likes of lisa the painful earthbound and yume nikki then this game is perfect for you going into this game blind truly was an experience and i wish i could erase my memory and play it for the first time again with amazing gameplay story music and art you get hours of entertainment for only 20
