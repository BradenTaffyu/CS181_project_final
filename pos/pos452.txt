this was my very first rpg and i m 48 yrs old at first i got a little frustrated because i was playing on a chromebook and using the mousepad for everything including fishing then once i played the game all the way through and met all the achievements and did all the activities my husband upgraded my system to a linux and i was playing sdv on steam before i had to sell my gaming computer i had learned about modding and was running 70 mods and playing co op with hubby fast forward to now and we ve hit hard times so for the last 2 years i played on an old chromebook with 38 mods i learned how to mod on my own in about 2 days the hardest part was sorting which mods were compatible with android now i m running just sdv on a dell laptop running windows 10 pro and i m having to learn everything all over i just installed sdv 3 days ago and i m still learning windows since i haven t used it since windows 7 it s been a very long time since i ve dabbled in microsoft lol i wanted to say all this to encourage new people to try this game no matter how much computer experience they have because if i can do it more than likely they can do it too the ability to mod this game makes it insanely more interesting to me and the possibilities are endless not to mention the fact that concerned ape is fantastic and adding buttloads of new content when he updates the original game i highly recommend you try this game love you all
