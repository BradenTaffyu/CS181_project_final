2020 i have pretty unchill anxiety and depression and this covid 19 has been really rough on that not gonna lie luckily my friends got me playing stardew valley i ve spent 119 hours on this game since the hit the fan and my job got put on pause it s really helped me pass the time and relax i feel really thankful for such a peaceful outlet at this time if you re struggling maybe try picking a game like stardew up it might help the graphics are adorable and there s hours of content if you play without looking everything up online have fun everyone and please take care
