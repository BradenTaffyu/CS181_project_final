2023 not bad it s not necessarily an improvement over civ 5 it is different than civ 5 and does some things better some things worse here are some of the main new mechanics and my opinion on them districts you place these on tiles and they make up most of the buildings you can make in a city there are two main consequences of this new system one it requires significantly more time and effort to play the game in an optimal way since which tiles you place your districts on is very important while i like this in single player it makes multiplayer more tedious two it kills tall builds in a pretty extreme manner while some people complained civ 5 took its pro tall approach a bit far the districts system completely kills tall builds because districts simply have more yields than tiles and they are limited by the number of cities you have it is also advantageous to place cities close enough to make their districts close to each other for adjacency bonuses there is also no penalty to making more cities other than settlers getting more expensive as you build more settlers so there is really only one way to play this game and it s spamming as many cities as possible as close as possible civics culture is now like a second type of science your culture yields allow you to advance in your civics tree similar to how you use science yields to advance in the science tree i like this mechanic it adds more depth to the strategy without being boring or tedious civics can be just as important as techs depending on what you are going for so this makes low science high culture builds possible even in multiplayer you ll still want to catch up in science at some point but prioritizing culture over science is a valid strategy overall pretty good mechanic policies these are kind of part of the new civics system but also a separate mechanic civics unlock policies and government types and you can run a certain number of policies based on your government type this mechanic can feel a bit overwhelming and tedious at first but after a few hundred hours of play i started liking this mechanic too it is also something that adds strategic depth to the game loyalty this is essentially a mechanic they invented to stop extreme forward settling and i really like the idea although there are some issues with implementation the population of your cities emanate an aura of loyalty to your civilization and if you settle a city far away from your civilization and close to an enemy civilization who has a lot of high pop cities nearby that city will flip to the enemy civ while this mostly works well it can feel really dumb on congested starts on deity difficulty where your capital can start losing loyalty already in the very first few turns they probably should have made the capital have higher defensive pressure or something along those lines other than the new mechanics compared to civ 5 i think the new art style is significantly worse and in addition they seem to have followed diversity quotas when choosing the leaders there are some female leaders who weren t of any real historical relevance the soundtrack is great it might even be better than the civ 5 soundtrack overall it s a decent game which has some advantages and disadvantages compared to civ 5 it s probably worth a try especially on sale overall score 7 10
