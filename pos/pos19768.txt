2020 disclaimer this review only presents a single player perspective short version 88 true to its name this is by far the best version for age of empires 2 this decades old gem on the rts scene long version age of empires 2 is one of the greatest strategy games ever created it is not an opinion it now also a fact after all how many rts games do you know that received two re releases since its conception so here we are only seven years after the hd release we have a separate definitive edition some may consider it a rip off but there are good reasons to buy aoe2de the graphics finally everything runs at 60 frames per seconds and in 4k compatibility all units received a graphical overhaul so they now look great no matter how far you zoom out the user interface aoe2de integrates several user added improvements from the past years if you are an aoe2 veteran it will feel difficult to go back to any previous version after these additions the game mechanics there is detailed information on all units and technologies the queue works more intuitively everything is a little better here the campaigns the developers fixed many historical inaccuracies and sometimes replaced entire scenarios they play better than ever and yes this includes the infamous forgotten levels thanks to the three new campaigns we have over 150 scenarios to play for hundreds of hours of single player content still there are issues some of the quirks of the hd edition came over and they teamed up with new ones the map pool it is tiny there are fewer maps than on a modded hd edition which was already behind the map selection of voobly the ai despite the vast improvements it still acts nothing like a human it is challenging yet too predictable the new campaigns they are mediocre at best often with lacklustre stories the new civilisations they are even more gimmicky than the ones introduced in the rise of rajas at least they are still balanced to a degree i cannot comment on the recurring multiplayer issues sorry
