2016 i wasn t sure about this game at first a lot of things seemed really off about it like the fast timer compared to modern hm games but it actually ended up being able to rival even the new hm games and anyone who lacks a nintendo console can just pick this game up and basically get the best of the experiences offered by harvest moon animal crossing fans will also find enjoyment in decorating your house and filling up the museum and rune factory fans will enjoy the mines and subsequent risk to reward gameplay they provide in addition to all this you do not have to make friends with your neighbors just to get tools anymore which is probably the best feature of this game you can basically be a hermit never get married and never talk to anyone and you will not miss out you can even complete one of the two main stories you can choose which one to complete without any socializing like the hm games force on you but if you did want to get married you can even have the option of marrying the same sex which no hm game to date has offered the one complaint i have so far is the way the game saves saving in games today should be a convenient and accessible feature this isn t the 80s when batteries were some expensive commodity and games are a lot more involved than they used to be but this game has a very rigid way of only saving your game between days and you basically have to go through an entire day before you can save again when you re used to hm games both offering you a diary in your house to save mid day or even getting the option to skip saving comes in handy when trying to pray to rngesus for rainy weather this can be pretty jarring and i do not understand why the game is like this all i can figure is the dev prioritized stopping people from cheating over offering better convenience and assurance to the majority of people wh don t and that was a poor choice this isn t a pvp game that is the only time where making design choices solely to prevent people from cheating even at the expense of legitimate play is valid and this being a single player game basically begs the question who cares when someone wants to cheese it it isn t like the ai has feelings
