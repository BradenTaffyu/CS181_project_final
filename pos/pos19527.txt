2016 new vegas is a proper fallout game the lore s there and the story is rich and diverse with many different endings albeit missing a proper post game feature like fallout 3 did obsidian ever the company that is rushed into releasing their products also unfortunately did not have enough time to properly playtest this game and thus expect a lot of bugs some of them quite annoying game s a bit crashy as well thankfully we re blessed with mod support and they fix many of the issues present gameplay s slightly better but never look at this game as a proper fps because the engine was never adequate for it do expect hundreds of hours because although it is set in a desert you d be surprised at the amount of locations it has the dlc can be a bit hit and miss gun runners arsenal adds a few fun weapons but nothing mandatory dead money had great plot but terrible gameplay old world blues was pretty funny but had a few bugs and at times i thought they were trying too hard lonesome road was linear but pretty tight with great pacing and story honest hearts was probably the weakest because zion and its denizens didn t really interest me except for one character not saying who it is but if you ve played it you ll know who i m talking about new vegas is an rpg through and through the characters are original and engaging especially the possible companions you can have their personality trump anything fallout 3 s companions could offer the choices you make impact the game and nothing is ever black and white in this world i recommend it to everyone in a heartbeat games like these are few and far between
