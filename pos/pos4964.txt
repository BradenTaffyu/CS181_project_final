2019 fallout 4 despite being a little rough around the edges as any bethesda game tends to be is one of the best games i have had the pleasure of playing there s always something to do long after you finish the main questline for a post apocalyptic nightmare i find it all kind of therapeutic the settlement building specifically keeps me entertained for hours on end despite taking a bit of getting used to its uh quirks because its just so cool to be able to make those spaces feel more your own personally i ve played mostly with mods on because the base game does feel lacking in some areas compared to its predecessors and the mods add an extra something that being said it s still great fun without if you prefer happy exploring
