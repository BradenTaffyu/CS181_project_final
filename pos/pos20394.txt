the game become more money hungry every new season which is understandable but good dame the amount of time to try and make a new deck with the amount of power creep in the game is hard to have fun lucky for new people you will only face new people and bots for a very long time so there is that i enjoyed the game a lot haven t touched it due to how stale the meta gets towards the end of every season 8 10 for a card game
