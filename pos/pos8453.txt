this is one of those games that will stick to your memory for years it is like the sweet nostalgia when you think about playing videogames as a kid back in the day frostpunk combines many elements to form the game it is it has survival heavy resource management decision making that affect your town and also a law system that further shapes your town or more like survival pit and can affect your people the immersion is outstanding from the world to the ui and a big factor for me the music plunge you in this time critical game where your decisions matter and where there is never enough time to fully prepare yourself to survive what is coming some may consider this game stressful i do too but in a very good way even though the game only has a set amount of scenarios that you can play through and also an endless mode i have never got bored of repeating said scenarios as every play through kept me at the same level of scrambling for time to manage and gather my resources and develop for the upcoming temperature drops worth every penny even at full price however the developers sometimes offer it as good discount as well
