2019 i finally gave into the nostalgia of playing warhammer mark of chaos battle march as a wee bab and decided to buy this note i have never ever played any other total war games in my life before this so my only motivation was that this looked vaguely similar i expected to be disappointed and safely refund it with the newfound realization that it s not the same instead i got exactly what i asked for and more it s basically the same game from my childhood except bigger better harder that s what sh ahem basically there s two ways to play this game the campaign and battles i have only played the mortal realms campaign so far that thing is a whole different review in its own but from what i ve gathered after you pick a faction and a hero you re plunged into the world and tasked with completing a set of objectives with the end goals being either the short game or the long game victories depending on how you play all the while managing relations with other factions and your own finances the latter i suck at royally each factions objectives and play styles can differ either minimally or quite drastically some factions spread corruption others are unable to own towns others need constant battles to stay in power etc when it comes to fighting you can either go into battle yourself or auto resolve them which i find strange i mean why would you buy a game called warhammer and just go nah not gonna do that fam the battles themselves are truly spectacular the amount of units that can be on the field and the whole scale of things is truly impressive the animations and sounds of fighting which can be observed by zooming in on your troops at any time also give it a lot of feel add in the 2 50 euro dlc for blood and gore again a whole different can of worms that one and you ve got yourself something truly amazing looking the strategy layer is also very deep there s an incredible amount of unit types for all factions which can be used for some really devious strats most of them i am utterly incapable of since i have no strategic planning whatsoever that being said despite being a troglodyte when it comes to strategy games i still find this game to be extremely fun and entertaining it can look confusing and complicated at first but the way it s actually played makes it fun even for someone who couldn t strategize to save their own life that s something i can t say for the majority of other games of the same genre tl dr it s good really good whether you re a master strategist or a complete idiot like me this game can still be amazingly fun the price can be daunting but you can find some really good deals if you know where to look or who to ask or if you re patient enough to wait for a sale now if you ll excuse me i need to kill stab stupid elf things for the glory of the horned rat
