2021 early access review i usually don t do reviews but this game is one the best things i ve played in a longggg time got game a few days ago played today thinking i d spend a few hours on it 10 hours later i m here writing this review instead of sleeping game is very addicting and well done especially for early access the good great graphicsvery fun game play with lots to dounder priced very good valuei get to be one with my autistic self and over engineer e v e r y t h i n ghonestly everything about this game is amazing but it s not perfect this next section is me being extremely nit picky the mildly infuriating the english here is very broken it might bother some looking at you grammar police it s funny at times but sometimes it makes descriptions hard to understand conveyors can be very annoying to place at times particularly when going between height levels it s not buggy just needs to be polished music is repetitive after a few hoursmech s walking animation makes it kinda look like it s shuffling or on skates this one is just pure ocd i m sorry overall a seriously well done early access game will update later if i find any game breaking bugs or the game manages to get any better edit removed some of the stuff under mildly infuriating
