2016 american truck simulator is a continuation of scs tradition of almost only truck simulators still ats have little in comon with previous titles like 18 wheels of steel first of all it is beautiful it is a lovely experience to drive even without a wheel since the new steering system was implemented in euro truck simulator ats features western usa currently only california nevada and arizona more states will surely follow as dlcs some mods open up the entire continent but they are unsupported and may cause problems with your savegame some of the community made stuff is really great i remember the ets2 promods scandinavian mod that added the nordic countries to the game and it was very nicely done the game is basically this move cargo from a to b doesnt sound like much fun but considering that you are the one behind the wheel who gets to get the trailer from say reno to phoenix curse at slow drivers drive slowly through the very lifelike rain chose a speedy route around sacramento to avoid the morning rush avoid getting a speedingticket from hidden police cars and eventually detach the trailer at the destination hopefully without having dented it because damage cause a penalty and you wont get as much money and xp as you drive you level up and chose what type of cargo and bonuses you should get so do any drivers you hire but you can control what types of cargo they haul and with that what sort of skill they should aim for when leveling up you can customise your trucks add better engines paint lights etc and as you level up you unlock more things to add only bad thing about ats i suspect like with ets ets2 there is no endgame stuff to buy once you get a truckstop in all cities fill em with trucks and drivers if you do not run out of them like i did in ets2 there isnt a whole lot to do i was sitting on 200 mil in ets2 which was the equivalent of the gdp of a small nation and had nothing to buy right now i cannot see any endgame cash sink features that would put a future fortune to good use this is a small problem though since the game is more about driving around is it worth it well as with all scs truck games buy hint something that gives you a good atmosphere is to find a good internet radiostation and play that in the background and you drive endlessly into the night
