2023 as a long time harry potter fan i must say that this game has exceeded my expectations it includes so much wizarding lore secrets around the castle a huge world to explore that looks gorgeous and an incredibly intriguing storyline i would love to see quidditch included but it s not a big deal with everything else the game has to offer the npcs are amazing and i find myself already loving sebastian and wanting to know more about him as my character gets to know him i m constantly finding out new information about the world that i love so much although i have the books and movies basically memorized this game is adding so much more to it that i m still intrigued by everything that i discover as someone who loved reading books and thoroughly missed the sense of wonder that comes from reading new books this game has brought that back to me highly recommend for people who love the harry potter franchise 3
