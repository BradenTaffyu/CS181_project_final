2021 i m not the type of person who plays these kinds of games until now my taste has mostly been mmos space sims and games like stardew valley action oriented games that involve reacting fast dodging memorizing attack patterns besides scripted raid bosses this is all totally outside my element i wanted to preface with this so you can see where i m coming from this review is aimed toward people like me dark souls iii my first souls game fundamentally changed me as a gamer and enriched my tastes for new kinds of experiences where once i was a carebear even in mmos i now even dabble in invasions and pvp here i even killed an invader once me where once i played video games purely to relax i now have a taste for gaming experiences that make my heart pound where once i would uninstall a game i couldn t beat because i clearly wasn t good enough i now understand i have the potential to get good enough and that the process of realizing this potential is something core to my desired gaming experience where once i would dismiss a game outside of my comfort zone i now eagerly approach a fresh challenge this is all thanks to dark souls iii and its punishing yet fair gameplay this game seeks to fulfill your potential as a player every challenge you encounter is surmountable even if you re me the distances between bonfires where you rest are perfectly placed just when you think you can t possibly make it much further right around the corner you ll reliably find that sweet sweet bonfire dark souls iii rightfully believes in your ability to make it to the next one and it s never wrong the boss fights are an extension of this everybody can beat these bosses the game cultivates your skills by presenting you with enemies with varying strengths and weaknesses and by the time you reach a boss you will have been hardened by the road leading up to it you just have to try and try and learn i can do it you can do it trust admittedly i haven t fully completed it but i m confident i will as of writing i m at prince lothric give me a few more tries this sense of growth and progress permeates throughout every aspect of the game you ll improve both in strength and skill those red caped lothric knight bastards that i used to be terrified of fighting they re now something i casually farm with comfort and ease when i need some embers effortlessly dodging and 3 shot killing from behind those long corridors full of deadly traps and deadlier enemies where i d trudge through sweating at 0 001 mph i effortlessly sprint through and past all the enemies making a beeline to a now familiar destination the game presents you with beautiful vistas that tower over the landscape that you ve just fought through it s often an emotional experience to see how far you ve come in so many ways it seems silly to say that a video game can change who you are as a person but this one did that for me my attitude has changed i can take on any challenge if i truly set my mind to it and i will be happy to do so i now know the glorious taste of a hard earned victory sweating buckets through my palms filled with pride and joy in conquering a terrifying foe that s what dark souls iii is all about to me it s a terrific game but an even more terrific experience you will come out the other side of this game as a different type of gamer if you have a casual carebear background like mine if you re nervous about games like this that s the exact reason you should play dark souls iii it can change you and open you up to a new world of experiences isn t that what life is all about
