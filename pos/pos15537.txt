2023 actually pretty nice definitely better than car mechanic simulator 2018 positives graphics are improvement compared to the older one relays brake fluids coolant power steering fluid might get repetitive later on but i love that they added these better car roster in my opinion cars are much more true to their real life counterparts better dlc for some this might be on the negative side because you have to pay for dlc but i honestly think they are worth it especially if you get them on sale now for the negative sides of the game currently haven t found really anything negative about the game but i do have one gripenegative early game is super slow even compared to cms18 feels like unscrewing speed and screw speed overall is decreased by 50 although this could be only me edit game is overall pretty good not yet finished the story since i have done side quests and mainly did the main quests to get money for restoration of other cars i have already sinked a ton of hours in the span of couple days planning to 100 the achievements in this game
