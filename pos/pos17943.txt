2017 it is still a good game but what i c the community manger s behavior is pretty unprofessional as games become more complex longer lead times are inevitable this leads to greater impatience on the part of the fan base and a need for a longer term view for profits by the parent companies involved unfortunately we as a society no longer have the discipline to wait longer periods between games and companies want a quicker and quicker return on their investment the two sides of longer lead times and societal company investors impatience are becoming increasingly incompatible as i stated before like you and many others on this community i was am deeply disappointed with the state of the game on release i also value the contributions of the more constructive critics on this forum i believe they had a large role to play in encouraging ca to improve the game you agree that politics needs a serious looking at too as do i he would probably agree as most sensible tw fans would on any number of improvements the game needs constructive criticism such as yours and his is what is needed to push ca along greater development of this potentially fantastic game
