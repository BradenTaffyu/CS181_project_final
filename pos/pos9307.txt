2016 the usual paradox attention to detail is in here in bucketloads on the surface it appears to be a simple space rts but give it a few hours and the game opens up into something huge and exciting the customisation options are impressive the graphics are beautiful the performance is as smooth as butter and the overall polish for a release day game is very high compared to what we are used to nowadays yes it has a few things that could be improved in terms of information feedback and map overlays but these in no way fully detract from what is a superb game i am also excited about future dlc that paradox will no doubt release to take this already addictive game to the next level and no i m not a paradox fan boy who buys or supports dlc just for the sake of it i simply don t mind paying for something that is worth it and more often that not paradox deliver simple as on the whole i would recommend this game to anyone with even the slightest interest in rts space games it definitely has that one more turn ingredient similar to ck2 and euiv and two play hours can easily turn into six in the blink of an eye you have been warned buy it you owe it to yourself to experience this
