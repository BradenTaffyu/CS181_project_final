2023 with more reviews than one could peruse in a day there is not much new to add i was a big fan of fallout 1 and 2 back in the day but never was able to master fallout 3 on a console as it turned out i played fallout new vegas with a keyboard and mouse so my increased level of skill with the controller was not put to use having recently finished fallout 4 and falling in love with that game i was eager to spend more time in the wasteland so i purchased this title on sale with all dlc fallout new vegas is a much different game than fallout 4 completely different perhaps due to the involvement of obsidian the graphics are a bit dated and the landscape is really empty at times miles of desert to stumble through in search of points of interest it felt more true to the roots of the original titles and has greater depth in terms of story and characters like fallout 4 there are more side quests and places to visit than you can complete in a lifetime achievement hunters will need to save their game at key decision points in order to experience the multiple endings that are required for 100 there are quite a few achievements related to number of kills of specific targets with specific weapons all in all enough to keep you playing for more hours than is healthy i enjoyed this game very much i did follow the pinned forum instructions for installing basic patches mods to stabilize the game and improve performance this was fairly easy to accomplish but i still experienced a few crashes along the way thus i got into the habit of saving very often i played on easy mode which made the game more enjoyable for me i have mixed feelings about the dlcs some were good and some not so good but all have achievements associated with them and i was determined to finish with 100 once i completed the game i did a speed run on hard mode survival setting that requires food drink sleep etc for the final achievement i highly recommend this game to those with a love of rpgs that have a huge open world to explore and so many paths to choose from for a bit i was able to travel with a robot dog as my companion which filled the void in my game left by the absence of fallout 4 s dogmeat what can i say i m a sucker for a good canine friend
