2022 one of the best aaa games of all time pros graphics are a 10 10 immersive environment that rewards exploration basically zero waste for environment used no dead spots for exploration mechanics were extremely fun and addictive story is a 10 10 over all one of the most complete aaa games ever made tons of side quests that are well worth doing con s combat was not as fluid as the general mechanics would suggest for example 4 5 enemies can chain attack you without any gaps allowing you to block this makes combat appear at times disjointed or sloppy if you 100 complete the game you run out of dialogue which causes too many silent spots i ll explain as you travel around the characters will talk to each other further expanding on the lore environment when this dialogue runs out you feel as if they are far too silent i would like things like this to be expanded in sequels everything i mentioned are nitpicky things summary of the game main story takes maybe 20 hours or less if you do no side quests two endless mission types a fog mist world and a hell world treasure hunt quests save the valkyries quest line most rewarding side quests search every area for odin s ravens all in all this is one of the most polished aaa games of all time
