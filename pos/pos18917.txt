2017 its like civ 5 s older brother that went to college and got a major in european history and a minor in how to make expensive dlc its got the same historical vibe that civ has but without random geographical spawns its got great mechanics that let me fulfill my fetish for colonialism big empires and a world where coptic is the one true faith it provides a challenge if you start as some of the more obscure weak nations like serbia however when the price of all your dlc combined 220 is more than the cost of crusader kings 2 hearts of iron 4 and stellaris combined 120 there is an issue overall i still think you should buy this game because its fantastic but you shouldn t give into the semitic ruse that is paradox s dlc policy
