2017 this is by far my favorite fallout game just after fallout 2 the intro is short and to the point no info who your dad is or your mom or your childhood friends or just about everything that could ruin your character building here you wake up after being shot in the damn face by someone who wants to take the package you were supposed to deliver you then wake up with your personal mission to track down the man who did this and if you chose a female well just do that and choose the black widow perk you ll laugh and while your trying to find that guy you ll probably notice how much nicer the world looks now not as boring anymore either side quests are a lot fun except some usual go to point a now go to point b now go to point a again quests they are a little annoying as they offer no real sense of accomplishment other than some xp rewards and maybe a small amount of caps but you can kind of expect those in a rpg game resources can also be quite rare in this game like stimpacks and drugs if you ve played fallout 4 you ll probably know how common they are in that game this offers a nice feeling of being out of supplies constantly which is always appreciated as finding items now feels a lot better and it also helps the roleplaying and the overall immersion and is this game immersive the music helps greatly and the overall atmosphere in a lot of places just makes you sad seeing corpses and briefcases and their items they had on them before the bombs the atmosphere is amazing here and the leveling is rewarding and all the perks seems very useful which makes it hard to choose oh and also the sense of progression is once again just fantastic when you first start almost every enemy is scary deathclaws are horrifying casadors are poisonous a holes and you just need to stay away from those then at level 20 you can take on the casadors with just a rifle shot or two then at level 30 you ll just go up close to the deathclaws with a hunting shotgun and blow off their faces one major problem i have is the invisible walls they re some of the most annoying things i ve ever seen in an open world rpg they really want you to take specific paths to quests and other areas you re not allowed to find shortcuts by jumping on rocks or anything else that would seem logical to climb which just pisses me off when i should easily be able to pass over a little rock but there s an invisible wall in the way and sometimes they ll literally get you stuck inside them for some weird reason also some quests are bugged to hell and back which was never fixed so i d suggest installing some mods for that here s a list of what is good yo weapons a lot of the quests progression perks dialogues enemies weapon modifications fantastic
