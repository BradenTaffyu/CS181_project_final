2021 honestly it s hard to recommend fallout 4 especially as a fallout game it s a relatively mixed bag with both pros and cons while the exploration can be enjoyable and rewarding most locations offer little in valuable items or story plot relevance the gunplay is a step up from the previous titles but the diversity has been shackled by the weapon mod system settlements are there if you want to go wild i d recommend some mods before you do though the story is absolutely abysmal and the mass effect dialogue wheel doesn t help when the dialogue amounts to hello wow and tell me more quests have been reduced to xp grinders especially with the new radiant quests which i despised doesn t matter much since the actual quests have effectively the same level of writing and deepness as any ai generated fetch quest the new perk system is fine and it works well enough without skills my biggest issue is that the game simply feels lacking and hollow compared to new vegas one step forward and two steps back if you re looking for a deep rich and thought provoking rpg this isn t it but if you wants hours of mindless shooting you could have some fun overall not great but not terrible just mediocre
