2023 product received for free a friend got this for me a few weeks back i have been hooked on it since it s a calm and relaxing game fun to play solo and use it to distress never know what your going to find you can also find entertainment playing with friends and helping them hunt i have also found a few helpful content creators such as ladylegend flinter and so many more i always have the latest information to keep me going for my maps and know what perks suit my kind of huntingi often find myself entertained by the thrill of the hunt finding that next big buck or small quail i do not really mind what comes across my scope as long as it s interesting which it never gets boring i plan to eventually get all the missing dlc there are so many maps and many more to come eventually bigger trophies i hope
