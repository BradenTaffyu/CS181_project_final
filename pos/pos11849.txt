2019 one of the best arcade platformers ever i love platformers since c64 sega amiga 500 this one is super fluid no glitches a lot of discovering weapons good controls and bosses my only bad remark is that it gets toooo hard i can t get over 2 boss cells and it s a pity i can t see the rest of the content most of my gametime is from failing at 2 boss cells so i guess i m writing this review before quitting could be i m getting old back in the day i could complete sonic with one coin
