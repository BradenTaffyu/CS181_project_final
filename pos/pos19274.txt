2022 i feel like with just about any game when you have over 300 hours you know it well enough to write a review most games take quite a bit less this game took me about 100 hours to start to not suck at it while it feels and looks so much like aoe2 regardless of how good you were at aoe2 that doesn t mean you re going to kick ass at aoe4 right after installation the strategies for progressing through the ages are quite a bit different and they differ largely for each civilization ie 4 workers on food 1 on wood or w e with that being said your hard work you put into aoe2 to git gud will definitely help you eventually in aoe4 it is rare that a descendant of an old a game as aoe2 ends up doing any justice by it aoe4 excels here the game is exactly what a 20 ish year later sequel should be modern graphics same gameplay concept just enhanced in a more comprehensive way that adds to the gameplay instead of taking away the key parts everyone loved about the ancestor game the achievements are fun to go through as well as the masteries i will say that being hardest difficulty i found easier on aoe4 than in aoe2 however aoe4 has much more to offer in terms of content despite its early stage alot of times when people hear early stage nowadays with steam games they think that there are an abundance of bugs or not enough content but that is not the case here early stage here means that there are only like 10 civilizations and 4 campaigns the campaigns alone will take you while and are all very unique each of the civilizations requires much time to understanding the tech tree in order to be viable in multiplayer you re not going to just jump on a new civlization in multiplayer and be able to compete you have to practice and understand the benefits of each civilization in order to make anything happen even the more simple civlizations such as the british or the french have so many perks from my experience early on in multiplayer the first civilization i see noobs getting good at is the british normally they build the fuedal age building that produces archers at a very fast rate and push early which can overwhelm other plays that don t know how to counter that this for me was the first obstacle i found how to defeat it s fun now when i see people try that strategy cause its an easy win the 3v3 and 4v4 s are my favorite however there is one map that everone seems to hate this map has 3 huge islands and it just ends up being a race to build a wonder and build defenses while this is a cool twist whenever this map pops up in multiplayer most of the time i just want to do battle not do an economy race overall this game is everything i wanted it to be and they are coming out with more content that is already pretty polished every couple months to keep us occupied
