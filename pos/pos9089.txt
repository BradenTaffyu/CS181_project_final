2021 some 84k reviews around this game so i will express myself a bit differently using past as a measure in the past master of orion 1 and 2 ruled supreme you probably know all about it we old folks never shut up about those games kids these days and all that jazz well that was then and nobody remembers vga planets even if it was the best so lets leave that then came an age where 4x games sucked to be quite honest galactic civilizations 1 and 2 was the one that ushered in the next era that was more mainstream and it was good enough but still sucked good riddance of that gen then came endless space 1 and it was interesting but sucked then came stellaris and with the help of crusader kings 2 success convinced a many player that this shares elements from ck2 but in space or at least so the mental image seemed to be for many well it worked and we got the dlc structure to go along with it and now the game is part of must have selection for a 4x players library i know it has issues and some don t like it but still i am talking about impact here on a 4x generation and here stellaris stands as the king of the mountain together with contender endless space 2 that ishaving played extensively enough both to get a good picture on what each can give you i d say here are the two 4x space games you should own if for nothing else then just to form your own opinion and take a bite out what this generation has to offer that has a mainstream appeal price should not be an issue these days no need to own dlcs to form an opinion these two reign supreme in the current 4x gen in my opinion and while there are other contenders the reach these two has is in it s own class clearly and these two will be remembered the others will do a new vga planets in the history books so get this play and make your own opinion if you find something that lacks then well you might find it in the other one i see no real reason why either one would be critically better than the other as they don t compete that directly with each other as they are somewhat different games built up with passion for the end product and income from dlcs
