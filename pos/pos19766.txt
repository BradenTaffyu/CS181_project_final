2019 i was sceptical when i first heard of yet another age of empires remaster especially for age of empires ii which had previously had a hd re release however after watching some gameplay videos from some notable age of empires community members such as zero empires and spirit of the law i was quickly convinced that this re re release was worth looking into positives gameplay is still very much the same as the original there are no major overhauls of the core mechanics which made previous renditions great improved resource ui which makes villager management much easier during the crucial first minutes of the game the ability to queue both units and technologies simultaneously the ability to indefinitely re seed farms and fish traps if you have the available resources several new units and technologies such as the steppe lancer and supplies to balance existing civilisations and provide new ways to play multiple new single player multi player lobby options such as game speed map pool ai difficulty and type such as the new ai for definitive edition or the hd and cd ai you can use the lobby browser for multi player while waiting in a lobby your multi player game stats are tracked and you can earn player profile pictures from time played number of victories etc improved visual effects such as collapsing structures improved unit models and environmental lighting effects improved sound effects whilst remaining true to the charm of classic age of empires ii units have their original voice lines and so on massive update to ai commanding in single player games you can now use the taunt command system to tell your ai allies to train specific types of units construct buildings on a flare marker attack a specific target and so on several new civilisations with their own unique units several new historical campaigns massive improvement to the tutorial system with new scenarios art of war specifically catered to helping new players deal with managing economies performing and defending from rushing etc tweaks to the scenario editor such as copy pasting event triggers in house mod support steam workshop has been removed in favour could be interpreted as a negative xbox live profile support and cross play a ton of different settings to customise your gameplay experience by tweaking controls graphics sound and so on several of these settings also make the game more accessible for individuals experiencing difficulty from handicaps such as colour blindness etc dedicated servers and private multi player games appear to run much smoother than hd steam achievements and trading cards improved replays and save systems you can save chapters in a replay for players to watch specific events negatives performance can be a little taxing at times especially in multi player with lots of units and or ai playersverdictan incredibly well done remaster that you must own if you are an age of empires veteran initiate or someone who just enjoys historical rts games
