2016 early access review i wrote a review loooong ago for this but now it is completely out of date so after revisiting for a little while last night where i died pretty swiftly with just 2 hours of play death being the actual point of the game to quote the intro this is the story of how you died but coming back and running around with how it has progressed i am surprised i made it that long as has been the case since modding opened for it also wow the mods which are actually supported indirectly by the team have expanded the game beyond the building block with options like the ability to interact trade help some npc survivors find repair drive cars and largely expanded crafting and starter skills and traits read as background its a whole new world the graphics are what they have been since the beginning side down view think classic xcom or fo zooming in close reveals a pixel look but you know what it doesnt matter the game play is fun if your not cheating or setting things to so low well ultimately you will probably die but its not the death that is the thing its the journey on trying not to now there are a lot of things you can learn and do to live a long healthy mostly zombie apocalypse life but the fun is in figuring it out thanks to the devs for a great game thanks to the dedicated modders for expanding it above and beyond
