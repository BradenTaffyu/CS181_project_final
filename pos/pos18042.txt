2015 our men flee the field of battle this is a shamefull displayan entire unit has perishedour general has fallenthe men are waveringthe men are waveringthe men are wavering the men are waveringthe enemy general is deadseriously this is the most useless advisor i have ever seen in a total war but i guess we don t need one since the ai is retarded as and you can kick their ass without effort even if your men are wavering in medieval ii however your advisor actually gives you advice and can help you this however is extremely annoying and only spams saying the obvious things i would not have recommended it at all at release but with the emperor edition and a of mods its actually a decent game but i would recommend getting it only when its a sale for at least 75 off 11 10 would let the men waver again
