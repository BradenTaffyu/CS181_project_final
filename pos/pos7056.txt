2021 as a european having originally played euro truck simulator 2 for a few months before trying this one out i have to say this game feels very different i remember that for my first couple deliveries i struggled to tame the monsters that are american trucks long noses 18 gears and huge trailers but i feel somewhat richer for having managed that it gives you a feel for america everything is enormous and very proud of it whereas european cabovers and cities are more on the point silent and quaint the environments feel like nothing europe could offer not that europe doesn t offer tremendous sights so as someone from this part of the world you will find a lot to learn and gander at i will always be more fond of a daf xf than a kenworth because it s what i grew up seeing on the streets but this game has helped me appreciate american trucks to the extent of furthering a passion which has filled a void in my soul i will always love these powerful beasts
