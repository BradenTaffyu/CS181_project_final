2023 personally this is my favorite fallout game without question as a great fan of the series and having tried nigh nearly every game i can personally say this has some of the best story line and is a great mesh between satire and gritty although combat and the overall gameplay is a bit dull you can certainly improve it with ease with the help of the fantastic modding community personal stats story 9 10gameplay 6 10writing 7 10visual setting landscape 5 10interior setting 8 10gunplay 7 10dialogue 11 10 content 9 10overall don t care gud game
