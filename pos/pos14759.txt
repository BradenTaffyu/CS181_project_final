2018 all the people who are calling this game bad escpcially worse than civ v have rose tinted glasses 6 inches thick equiped civ v is a great game after they fixed all the stabiliy and optimisation which are still bad and released all the dlc civ v was and excellent game but at launch as a vanilla product it was trash not to mention that previous civ games all suffer from the same issue of basically have one good stratagy that you can use to win every single game espcially civ v where you just go tradition into rationalism and build 4 5 cities civ 6 allows for varied stratagies and if you want to win you cannot ingore any facet of the game in civ v for example you could ignore religion can super ignore city states and culture because the victory types they led to were just straight up worse than just rushing science in civ 6 i find myself using wacky strats constantly from getting 45 yeild royal dockyards at england to just building a triangle of cities with all of their districts in the middle as japan or even playing as the kongo and have 4 cities with 40 pop and people said tall was dead civ 6 also requires actual forsight and planning in previous entries where you placed a city center had almost no impact now you need to plan for good farm placement district adjancencies fresh water and acess to the coast as well as if strategic or luxury resoruces existed in you spot also wonders are less op and don t just mean you win games against the ai if you get them looking at you great library wonders are require specfific conditions to be built with a number of them being very powerful but hard to attain everyone can get a slice of the wonder pie one thing that really grinds my gears is the military balance sumerian war carts are cheaper to build than the aztec unique unit desite the aztec unique unit being weaker slower not having immunity to it s counter and being more expensive to build military balance if absolute trash with some units being potentionally game breaking cossacks and redcoats are both potentially crazy in the hands of a good player redcoats can be so strong that they can hold off mechanised infantry if they are in a corp and cossacks are the only unit that can attack then move making them stupid op in the hands of someone with good micro overall 7 10 better than civ vedit people calling the ai bad have a point until they say that civ v ai is better or any civ ai is better for that matter the ai in civ has always being utter garbage almost like making a good ai for a 4x game would be so expisive it would drive firaxis out of bussiness if you liked older civs despite the ai you have no reason to dislike this one other than that you are wearing the previously mentioned rose tinted glassess honeslty i cannot think of any turn based game where the ai is good let me know if one exists
