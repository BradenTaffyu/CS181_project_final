300 hours later i have completed maybe exploring 60 of what the game has to offer here is my review pros1 economic simulation is on point you will have too much fun min maxing to get the best profits trade unions and the specialist that affect production is random and can have infinite variations depending on your plan 2 the start of the game is slow with the right settings which makes it hard as the business starts and then you progress till the point where money is no issue and you are elon musk of the 1800s3 campaign for a new player is nice it teaches the way of the game love the feature where after campaign is completed it just turns into a sandbox game cons1 city building can be improved no provision for curved roads every city looks robotic because of this 2 diplomacy looks weak once you start trading with someone you can forget about them totally everybody just falls in love after some trading even the pirates start sending you money cuz they love you so much thats so funny 3 way too many cosmetic packs not enough regions maybe new regions with different cultural themes could have been explored japanese chinese indian south american cultural regions could have been explored
