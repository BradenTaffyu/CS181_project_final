2016 at 116 hours at the time of this review i feel i can recommend this game both to fans of the tw series as well as warhammer fans who miss ye good olde days of fantasy game runs smooth is stuffed to the brim with content and is generally quite enjoyable and frustrating at the same time the continious adding of content through dlc and flcs just adds to my enjoyment of the game a myriad of mods of various quality being available makes the game even more fun quality and stability of some of these can be an issue but it s mostly solved by disabling them again all in all 8 10 would buy again
