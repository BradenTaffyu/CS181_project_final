2016 product received for free early access review return to the wild world of divinity this time as the source hunted play as any one of 5 4 racially different heretics shipped off to magician auschwitz for the weekend help needy elves recover lost oranges and walk around a prison camp fully armed in platemail without being noticed it s up to you and a maximum of 3 friends who are hopefully not specced the same as your main character to finally learn the true difference between magic and sorcery really enjoyed the 15 or so hours i spent on the game while there s dialogue and more gameplay complexity crafting to be added the game is extremely functional as a demo and worth the support for the final product im stoked to see past act 1 visually the game looks great and theres plenty of improvements that have been made to gameplay parties will open doors and climb ladders to travel long distance and combination classes are more intuitive and natural to skill waypoint distribution is more efficient and zones are visually distinct to make it easier to navigate there s plenty of little secrets and mysteries to keep you occupied while following questlines and i liked coming back to finish off a particular path or attempt a difficult fight at a higher level without feeling like i always had to i often found myself cheesing through battles and puzzles i couldn t win fairly using increasingly underhanded tactics players are free to exploit divinity s mechanics a refreshing change where most rpgs are concerned about limiting your ability to break the game divinity says it teleport that man slip past that locked door beating challenges in creative and logical ways immersed me in the world and was what got me so addictied to os1 quests are easier to follow and plan for than before in terms of following where to go next and what exactly it was that you were supposed to do now dialogue is currently under heavy development but hostile and friendly choices are already there and serve well to give you some influence over outcomes choices are still sometimes nicely ambigious while usually offering a safe way to exit or press for more information about the choice quests make liberal use of previously completed quests conversations and suspicious items to further reward and immerse players tracking objectives on the minimap is more consistent and the menu ui has recieved some much needed improvement combat and skills already feel mostly balanced combination classes seemed much more viable than in os maybe just me and ap and skills have been rebalanced to be more uniform mobility spells that were master level in os are now novice so everyone spends less time walking around in combat basic attack and spell ap cost is no longer the same or higher than advanced skills and spells are priced more logically for their effect no more ap 7 teleports with no technical issues to complain about in my 20h playthrough i can only have issues with the changes to memory slots and master spells instead of skill mastery affecting spell memory for that skill spell memory is now allocated to an attribute stat for people who liked their caster to have 5 action bars full almost immediately bad luck everyone in the party more consistent early on regarding their ability density additionally master level spells now cost rare source points to cast each time and cost an additional memory slot compared to novice and adept 2v1 while i understand that because memory has replaced the increasing point cost system of skills that it has to be relative but no one likes buying slots with attribute points directly also the nature of source as a resource rare necessary to open doors activate shrines progress the story triggers my autism meaning i never wanted to cast source magic lastly the loot system has stayed mostly the same being predominantely randomly generated im hoping hand placement becomes more of a thing as the devs look to put more polish on the game as across both games players tended to collect a lot of crap completing a quest dungeon should mean receiving a unique or relevant item given as a guarenteed reward i often get nothing out of a quest but copped a top tier item from a fallen goon or box tl dr hard game to complain about even in alpha one of the few games worth the price tag in early access
