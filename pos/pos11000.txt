reviewed with the economic 2 0 changessince the economic changes came into place i can say that im enjoying the game quite a bit there appear to have been other changes introduced as well with pathing as the traffic issues dont seem as extreme as they were previously i personally enjoy more than just painting a city i like to know the changes im putting in are having a positive effect and one of the ways to determine that is through the economic health of the city some have left negative reviews stating that its now too hard i strongly disagree yes you need to carefully plan your city and tune your budget but its not complicated im currently at 15k citizens have a 500k year surplus im hoping there are yet more challenges down the road to creating a stable budget as in reality making sure a city stays in the positive is a very real challenge great changes i can finally get some enjoyment out of the game
