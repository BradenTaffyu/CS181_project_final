2021 i can say i had a really really great time in this game both in singleplayer and multiplayer incredible maps views and textures but before buying this game you have to know these 1 this game can not be played like battlefield or call of duty buy this game if you really want a hunting simulation because you have to hide be silent use scents callers and pay attention for the wind as a real hunter should 2 patience and knowledge is the key to success in both single and multiplayer don t sprint after animals around like desert bandits chasing farmers explore the maps as there are some specific areas you can find specific species 3 perfect single player but some maps or species are not fully optimized perfected for multiplayer for example i hunt about 40 60 geese per hour in singleplayer but whenever we try that in multiplayer we don t even see a single goose for hours and when they appear they don t land even though we are all hiding properly in the bushes using callers and 15 24 decoys per field etc they said they fixed it in 2019 but it still occurs when i went to hunt geese with another friend who owns dlc we got 12 of them in an hour but that s nearly 1 4 of singleplayer 4 perfect maps for multiplayer yukon valley vurhonga savanna silver ridge peaks and te awora national park 5 there are some bugs in multiplayer for example sometimes only the host can see animal tracks not always happen and not a deadly problem as host can track and find animals though things will be far better if you and your friends have proper internet connection consequently i will give this game 10 10 in singleplayer and 7 10 in multiplayer
