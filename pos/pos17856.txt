pre ordered this game this game started rocky but has improved not to dog sega but it really started getting better after they left the picture 2024 happy to give it thumbs up campaign linear african campaign is classic rts fun the narrative parts provide an interesting human touch to a lesser known wwii campaign strategic total war esque strategy takes getting used to but is more replayable it takes me back to the dawn of war dark crusade strategic maps multiplayer pve bots the bot ai gets updated and is pretty challenging at max difficulty it is a strength and it gives a nice break from pvp pvp can still be very fun your mileage may vary when it comes to teammates there always seem to be weaker factions and battlegroups that are pretty niche but fun if you know what you re doing glhf
