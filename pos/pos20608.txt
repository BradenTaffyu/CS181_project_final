2023 not too long ago i 100 ed this game and oh boy this is truly a piece of art from one long continuous shot with no cuts fades or wipes to the dynamic of kratos and atreus you get fully emotionally invested in the exceptional storyline and unique gameplay when they showed the gameplay for the first time i was skeptical about it and thought that a story about father and son wasn t in gow style and oh boy i was proven so wrong the only downside i could see about god of war 2018 is the lack of boss fights compare to previous games my rating 9 5 10
