2021 i consider fallout new vegas as one of the best games ever made and my favorite of the fallout series the world design is brilliant with definite progression in travelling and with unique areas that fit specific reasoning the dlc expounds on this with exceptionally well made additions that make the game even better the dlc is definitely recommended the story is more enjoyable as it does not feel rushed nor overly complicated or simple i felt more freedom in my choices in this game than in the other fallout games where it felt i was being told one way is good and one way is bad in fallout new vegas i was able to decide what is good and bad and not shamed for my discernment for instance in fallout 4 siding with the institute brotherhood railroad or minutemen had definite story angles that would feel like judgement from the developers there is none of that in fallout new vegas while having many choices still available to explore and different endings to experience the creatures are unique to the fallout universe with some more that are unique to just fallout new vegas including the dlc creature development is fun and interesting dialogue felt natural and added to the game without feeling forced giving communicating to the creatures and npcs added enjoyment to the story and world design the graphics are still pleasant and stand up to many games to date i can see how a remake with modern graphics would be nice but do not trust the current developers and publishers to not do more harm than good in short this game is a treasure and highly recommended i recommend all of the dlc as well
