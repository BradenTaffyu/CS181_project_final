early access review there s a lot of talk on if this version is worth getting or not i mostly notice a lot of smaller changes and differences between evolved and ascended but overall those small changes add up to make it overall in my opinion more enjoyable they added baby dinos which are cute and easier to tame if you can take out the parent s they took away electrical cables outlets and irrigation pipes to make it easier to hook up now you place a generator and it has a range that it will power when you place a water intake it will also have a range that you can connect a tap to a good amount of building pieces are now all in one and you select what you want to use as you place it for example all doors and windows are 1 piece a stone wall is also all door frames and the window frame pieces connect a lot easier and you can also shuffle through the different areas within range that the structure you re trying to place can connect to you can pick things up at any point on evolved you have a timer and once that time is up you have to destroy the item vs picking it up on ascended you can pick it up at any time even 5 months later this is not all to mention but it s a good amount to consider and overall i would say that if you enjoyed ark survival evolved a lot you will enjoy this one too just be sure to find a stable server because some of them are prone to crashing and other bugs as well i almost gave up because i thought it was a game error and it turned out it was just the server i was playing on now that i found a good server it s incredibly enjoyable
