2015 early access review i can honestly say that had this been in existence when i was younger turned 42 today i would have been able to fullfil my dream of being in space i know sounds corny i m sure but this app and it s game play takes me back to my youth where astronomy and space were most of what i could dream think and talk about roll ahead a few decades and this game gives me such a sense of freedom accomplishment and challenge sure it s geeky nerd stuff but honestly what isn t these days madden 2015 sure geeks playing pixels of sports greats they can never be like so i guess it s not far off lol this game as they call it will teach you things about the science mathematics and common sense problem solving that could help you in your life i m sure by this point you re saying but how will an orbit trajectory to mun help me and how is knowing the dv to escape the soi of kerbal going to help me and you for one would be right these while still teaching the literal effect in game also teaches you about solving sometimes complex puzzles or math problems or those how could i even do that types of questions from the first launch which in itself is not easy by any stretch of the imagination to the 100th 200th and several thousandth launch later you want to do more and push further into space it s those types of feelings that mold and lead those younger generations to wanting and wishing they knew and could do more much like an aging dreamer who at his younger years had always dreamt of getting the chance to leave this floating rock we call home game is great you just have to dream a little more want a little more and do a little more tl dr game is stupendous and anyone interested in space space flight and rocketry with a keen sense of having fun all the while doing math physics and all that wonderful science stuff without really knowing you are can will icky
