2023 early access review all it takes is one bite at first i was skeptical about this game for no real reason at all when i started playing it was difficult to get a hold of what i was doing and what i should be doing the first couple deaths are inevitable and are ultimately learning experiences after losing a character that i built up for a while i was furious for about half a minute then i immediately loaded back in with a new character because this game is just unbelievably addicting at first i secured a house and felt like that was all i needed to do then i secured a commercial building and had plans to make it into a steel fortress then i realized that all the skill traits and character building had a purpose and i set out to build my first real base while currently in the building phase for this base i am learning more and more every time i get on this game also worth noting the workshop for this game is filled with mods to make your experience more enjoyable or more difficult i still have much to learn but this game is very rewarding once you get past the initial learning curve i highly recommend this game to anyone that is into isometric games as well as hardcore realistic survivals this game will test you but will keep you coming back for more
