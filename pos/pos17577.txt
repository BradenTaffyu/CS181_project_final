2017 introductioneven after all these years the title still ticks me off why not just call it total warhammer as skeptical as i used to be about a fantasy total war entry from developer creative assembly in 2016 they stunned both myself and their dedicated community of armchair generals by all accounts some players almost expected the warhammer fantasy setting to flop so that we can focus on historical titles once more that didn t happen even if there was a rocky road ahead publisher sega had hit a jackpot by securing the licensing from games workshop almost six years old by this point the first entry in the total war warhammer series has aged gracefully and presents itself as a proper introduction towards its direct sequels you also need this one for the subsequent expansion into the mortal empires scenario that features the biggest map for a total war game to date despite having to combine three games for that feat it s still impressive nonetheless i ve been playing creative assembly projects almost for as long as i ve been gaming on pcs 2000 s shogun total war is a far cry from contemporary games which eschewed historical simulation in favor of fantastical warfare deeply rooted into mythology you will notice many similarities between warhammer s old world and our own geographical and cultural boundries the symbol of chaos eight pointed star itself predates warhammer s inception by two decades numerous themes are drawn from history and philosophy as well storyeuropean fairytales met a far more gritty scenario than even the most twisted folklore penned by the brothers grimm could have imagined that is the old world in a nutshell pay close attention to the total war warhammer narrator since he s not just a kindly man looking to advise nations and steer them towards survival and progress total war warhammer a screenshot of total war warhammer by un0w3n he seeks violence and war for an ulterior motive you just have to open your eyes nothing is what it seems in this story deceit is a central theme for this dark tale which coagulates better once you dive into its dlcs the base game factions still paint a pretty clear picture doom is coming and defeat is almost certain without alliances the ruinous powers of chaos aren t a mindless horde which can be bribed away like in a previous total war entry such as attila they are here to destroy you unless you can stop them dead in their tracks survival of the fittest in such a cruel world will still enable technological advancement you shall role play as a faction belonging to the brutish greenskins orks and goblins restless vampires intrepid dwarfs or the ever greedy humans war shall arrive on your doorstep whether you seek it or not best prepare for the chaos invasions well in advance it s not like your immediate neighbours won t desire a chunk of your territory already constantly expanding should be tempered with building up proper defenses and reserve armies gaining a victory means nothing if you can t control the outcome of a war graphics creative assembly s proprietary warscape engine powers warhammer tw and its future iterations ironically the performance for the first entry is far more stable than the sequels partially because it relies on older tech and can dispense with the bells and whistles introduced by warhammer iii in 2022 also don t bother with the beta dx12 rendering it s a waste of time ol reliable dx11 was perfect for stability and a high frame rate until you dish out armies numbering thousands of troops on each side then you can scream in frustration that your cpu doesn t have more cores you see for as long total war titles have been rendered in 3d they became one of the main reason strategy fans buy expensive processors the graphics card isn t stressed out nearly as much as the cpu in this franchise s case disabling the hud with the press of a single key k has allowed me to capture over 200 screenshots there is plenty of eye candy if your system can max out the details just make sure you don t end up playing at 30fps or less even when you re not zooming close on the battlefields campaign and battle maps are as different as their strategic subgenres turn based and real time respectively total war warhammer a screenshot of total war warhammer by un0w3n audioexcellent voice acting on par with the soundtrack the full aaa experience lore appropriate names with an almost flawless pronounciation not much i could nit pick here there seems to be proper diversity in the line delivery as well players who tried more than a handful of rts tbs will notice how units begin to speak the same phrases or words over and over again as you select and move them around warhammer tw avoids that in most cases gameplayconsolidating newly acquired provinces can be an easier or more difficult task depending on how you shall treat the conquered cities as well as a corruption mechanic which in the base game gets represented by the vampire factions vampiric and chaotic influences can sway and literally change the look of a war torn province consider it a step forward from the cultural and religious mechanic of previous total war games an extra layer of challenge do no rely solely on the imbedded garrisons for settlement defense unless you re willing to sacrifice a city and regroup yoyr forces somewhere else by the mid game and late game phases you will realize that it may be wiser to allow chaos to advance within your empire enough to spread them thin and disperse their doom stacks total war slang for massive armies over a larger territory it s crucial that you fight them on your terms before pushing a counter offensive imagine the wehrmacht after operation barbarossa they bit more than they could chew out of the soviet union only a matter of time until the eastern front collapsed once the right conditions were met you can t rely on the weather and cannon fodder to save you in total war warhammer though chaos will fight to raze your settlements to the ground but they also temporarily weaken themselves in the process use that to your advantage all base game factions have their own unique quirks and features make sure to try them all out before even thinking about buying the dlcs the one exception i strongly recommend you purchase at once is blood for the blood god don t get me started on the fact that gore and blood effects had to be sold separately i don t have anything nice to say about this practice just buy it unless you want a gameplay experience closer to a pg 13 rating weak sauce total war warhammer a screenshot of total war warhammer by un0w3n verdictonce you overlook the many dlcs trust me you ain t seen nothing till you check out warhammer ii s store page the main portion of the game is quite enjoyable to veteran and new players alike fantasy naysayers were quickly silenced and i m certain that total war as a series will still flourish from a historical standpoint warhammer just proved once and for all that creativity and the rts tbs hybrid formula can remain enticing no matter the topic of choice the incendiary pigs from rome total war truly had the last laugh and chaos was there to join the party strong points superb strategic hybrid gorgeous graphics and sounds steam achievements trading cards replay value through multiple factions weak points blood effects locked behind dlc paywall no naval combat this article was submitted for imperial reviews following my curator page will help me keep publishing new reviews as soon as i can thank you for your support
