2023 i lll be really honest here the game is very fun if you end up in the game that makes you feel good and strong but be prepared to grind a lot this can have a fast farm but once you end up in a tank that makes frustrated by either it is so slow that you don t contribute to a fight so even in a win your exp gain is pure trash or you end up in numerous time unfair matchmaking with tank 2 tiers above yours tier 7 is a nightmare in my opinion to farm since you always end up in games with numerous tiers never a full tier 7 only game i d say i recommend if you want to put a lot of time in it and be competitive do damages kill you have to pretty much play aggressive there and be prepared at tier 5 towards the 10 you can end up in an abismal row of defeat sometime
