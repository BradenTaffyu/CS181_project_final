2023 honestly i don t know what all these other reviews are on about roaches gacha story blah blah blah all i know is that when i boot up this game i am greeted by faust s angelic voice it soothes the very depths of my soul i could be going through the most grueling and agonizing day i could suddenly be hit by a wave of misfortune lose my home and break all the bones in my body have no choice but to lay and sleep through the bitterly cold rain but as soon as i open limbus company these troubles cease to have any meaning for i am graced by her presence her beauty is immaculate but compares not to the amount of knowledge she holds she sees all and i can do nothing but bow down before her superiority yet at the same time i hold no fear nor envy the only emotion that fills my heart is gratefulness towards project moon for allowing me to come into contact with such perfection so forget about the combat forget about the bugs you must play this game in tribute of faust
