2020 don t kid yourself nothing is included but the dupes you have to build it all yourself survival is all on you in this insanely fun colony base builder game i started playing at the beginning of early access i have only ever been about as far as mid game but my current run will hopefully be the one where i reach the surface that s because this game has multiple systems power atmosphere temperature gases etc for the gamer to build and operate within a base and these systems have been added on throughout the early access process so what you see now after release is this beast of a colony survival sim that may look like child s play but could stump your average adult on multiple levels but the thing is most things can be accomplished by either automation or by brute forcing the task this means that the game is perfect for gamers of all ages and knowledge ability levels much of the fun is in watching the duplicants the little sims cope with their little hole underground in some asteroid their facial expressions are adorable scheduling the work schedules and assigning tasks and making meal plans are all part of the game you get to manipulate everything in their world and it is all great fun i highly recommend o not included just keep in mind that oxygen is seriously not included your dupes will die if you don t have a plan fortunately that s the fun of this simulation planning your colony s reach for the stars
