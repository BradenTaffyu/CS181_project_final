2021 early access review this is a the sleeper hit of 2021 didn t see it coming at first i thought hmm this looks interesting a game from a chinese developer that isn t a gacha money grab and also happens to be one of my favorite genres i ll drop 20 bucks on it no problem just out of general principle but 20 hours in and i m having a lot of fun it has a good mix of complexity for beginners about the same as vanilla factorio it has the three dimensional aspect that satisfactory brought to the genre except the perspective is much easier to play with you can have the epic 3 d spaghetti bus systems that you ve always wanted as a huge improvement over satisfactory it has a very strong sense of grid both horizontal and vertical and getting things to align is literally a snap the grid is spherical which means you can have some awesome design options can t wait to make a ecumenopolis or a death star with this grid diit also has the multi planet management system that the newest expansion of oxygen not included is trying to do except that it feels much more accessible and not overwhelming at my stage of development it also feels like sim city the belts feel like roads the little commodities feel like cars the center of my development is actually growing taller over time organically kudos to the game designers for figuring out a way to make this work storage and science production and consumption centers stack and the awesome buildings are huge i just plopped down my first interstellar logistic tower and it feels good it s feels like plopping down an arcology or a landmark in the tall downtown center of one of my sim cities this game is not just factorio with 3 d graphics it is legit a 3 d factorio it s still in early beta so there are some things that annoyed me not being able to rebind keys is huge especially since you have to hold middle mouse button to rotate camera this is annoying as when i jump back into ff14 to raid i accidentally hit middle mouse button instead of right click which screwed up my rotation costing me dps and since it was farm night no redos bad parse i see the devs are on top of these problems and already mentioned they will fix that this week not having a borderless full screen window was a problem but easily fixed by putting popupwindow in the command line option when running the game with steam other early access headaches have already been patch fixed and i assume the rest will be solved over time the core of the game is here and it is solid i already see nexus mods for this so the potential for a thriving mod community that extends the life of the game is also there it would be nice if there was multiplayer but that may be something the devs may be able to put in once they get some development cash juice from this release excited to see where this game is headed my big concern is how it will run once i have an interstellar empire really going it looks like it was made in unity and i worry about optimization and updates per second issues but so far it has been smooth
