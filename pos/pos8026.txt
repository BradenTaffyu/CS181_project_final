2017 early access review this is the game i respect the most no microtransactions not expensive not overpriced no other payments no unlockables everything is as it should and as advertised if not better the realism is astonishing ive been following and playing this game since its first release in 2013 i remember playing the demo on first release long before it was on steam this game has and always will be amazing i kinda want multiplayer but i fear it may cause greed and ruin what i love about it i hope it doesn t the devs are very active consistently updating the game and do listen to their audience they have always delivered nothing is rushed or abandoned unlike nextcargame which came out not long after this and was good to begin with i do feel it is missing sirens on emergency vehicles and could later on impliment proper air travel as well not just as flimsy mods not made by the developers i have watched this game grow from day 1 and always loved it exactly what i want from a game it can be very relaxing to drive around in what ever i want freely however i want and very exciting when i crash or fall off a cliff and turn my car into a box of splinters 100 10
