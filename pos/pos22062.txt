2016 after having tried different builds characters and playtroughs the best way to describe dark souls 3 is to consider it like the perfect baby between all the souls it has the awesome feel of demon s souls and its hub the lore and the parry system of dark souls some of the improvements you re not forced to go ng and the lenght of dark souls 2 and finally more characterized weapons and a slightly more fast paced combat system from bloodborne i would say the same on the level design with a central hub and many huge areas connected between them slightly more linear than dark souls but larger than bloodborne and waaay more complex than dark souls 2 wherever you go there are plenty of secrets and treasures without considering the amount of creatures npcs and missable quest it s the perfect conclusion to a great saga i hope namco will not milk it p s now my beloved from software can you please make me a new armored core tenchu possibly on steam dp p sin the comments there was concerns about the lenght of the game so the first playtrought last around 40 60 hours after that you can easiliy speedrun it like all the souls you can also respec your character for free and don t proceed to ng so it s easy to test builds
