2021 you know what let s try a serious review this time so i ve been playing this game on and off i also have it on my phone and i own all the dlc so practically it s just a rogue lite game where you have perm progression and things to unlock right that s the where fun begins gameplay is very fast paced but also suitable for slower methodical gameplay styles with certain colours and mutations monster variety is good weapon variety is superb biomes are usually fun with their own twists you can be a maniac that kicks everyone to death or you can rain death from above with certain weapons you can feel like a wizard or someone with a full automatic assault rifle while lore part of the game isn t the strongest asset of the game it s still enjoyable and decent soundtracks are quite nice only bad thing about the game is grinding for certain things that will take ages but gameplay is so fun that you can just keep blasting things around and it ll come to you eventually as for difficulty don t think you have learned the game after you beat 0bc both 0 and 1bc is the tutorial level for the game about learning the core mechanics synergies going with the runs flow and late game planning but i d still say that the difficulty levels are well designed it used to be way harder before 11 10 would buy it on switch too and gift every friend of mine that loves such games if i could have sex with a game i d have sex with this one
