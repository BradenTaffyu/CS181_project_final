human trauma turned into a horror themed gatcha video game about bickering goofballs i got kroomer d as a kid so i am in a prime position to back the writings authenticity besides the good narrative the combat is serviceable and the gatcha is at least more generous and thus more tolerable than usual for the genre i do wish i had to slog through less braindead auto battle chapters and get to fight more chapter bosses since thats the only times i d call the combat fun
