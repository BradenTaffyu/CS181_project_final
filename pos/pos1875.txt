2022 you might be wondering why on earth would someone with so few hours logged into this game write a review on it surely they can t be serious well star wars the old republic launched in december of 2011 but it wasn t on any platform like this origin came out earlier during the same year however this game never required it and still doesn t i ve actually been playing sw tor on and off since june 2012 and just haven t used the steam version until recently i have 10 characters in the game 1 at level 75 1x65 7x50 1x34 and my total playtime spread across them all discovered using the played command and tallied up tells me i ve put almost 772 hours over 295 of those hours spent on a single character into sw tor at the time of writing this review this is excluding loading screens and such i ve experienced practically all the story content this mmo has to offer and i ve played both as a subscriber and on a free account but i ve only dabbled in pvp if you don t believe me then just look at the 167 steam achievements sw tor used to cost a full game s price plus a recurring fee after one month of play when it was first released in 2011 but since late 2012 bioware and ea have adopted a free to play model for it with an optional subscription this means that you can download the game from the official website or here on steam and play it for as long as you like without paying them any money however free players have a number of restrictions placed on their accounts so if you want to play the game for a month or longer it is actually better to subscribe in order to remove those limits and gain access to plenty of extra content it s also just much more fun that way as some of the constraints placed on free accounts can be quite annoying furthermore once subscribed you also gain preferred status which grants you unlimited access to all the story content currently available to you even if you cancel your subscription as well as removing some of the f2p account restrictions playing with a free account you can experience the base game level 0 50 with all 8 class stories and side quests across many planets as well as the first two expansions galactic starfighter for expanded space combat and galactic strongholds for player housing when you subscribe you obtain the rise of the hutt cartel and shadow of revan expansion packs both of which you get to keep even after your subscription runs out which also extend your level cap to 60 the next expansion a story heavy and singleplayer focused one called knights of the fallen empire increased the cap to level 65 and was released on an episodic basis with 16 chapters made in total this model was kept for the subsequent expansion another episodic story titled knights of the eternal throne with 9 chapters after this came onslaught and finally this year s legacy of the sith bringing the new maximum level upwards to 80 if you were to subscribe now you d get access to all the stories available thus far you keep them forever and any future chapters released during the time that you re still subscribed but as soon as you stop subscribing you will no longer receive any new chapters until you subscribe again now that we got the basic info out of the way let me tell you more about why you should probably try this game when sw tor was first announced in october of 2008 i was disappointed sure i was hyped for another star wars tale and i loved the old republic era thanks to the kotor games however it was precisely due to my adoration of kotor that i felt a little betrayed what happened to the good old singleplayer rpg storytelling of old why was this online multiplayer functionality forced on all those who wanted to see where bioware would take revan s galaxy next why not just release a third knights of the old repubic solo title instead of killing star wars galaxies when i finally got my hands on the game though excited yet cautious it was unlike any other mmorpg i had played before or since the gameplay is quite standard it has been referred to as a world of warcraft clone that moniker might not be entirely fair but there is certainly much truth to it i liked what little i played of wow so the combat and exploration of sw tor was more than good enough for me no what really shined here besides the high budget visuals and sound effects that come with official star wars licensing and funding from a big publisher like electronic arts was indeed the story each class was more than just a different playstyle in combat like that of the dungeons dragons ruleset or countless other rpgs because each class gave your character an entirely unique background with its own three act spanning plot the writing and dialogue was of great quality but most importantly it was all voiced not only the main class and planetary quests but every single side mission too in 2011 when sw tor came out it was minus marketing costs the most expensive video game ever made in early 2012 it was officially recognised by guinness world records as the largest entertainment voice over project ever with over 200 000 lines of recorded dialogue in good bioware fashion the vast majority of quests in the game allow you to make choices that can decide the fate of not only random tertiary characters but the lives of your companions or even the outcome of interplanetary conflicts it s this focus on storytelling that really makes sw tor the best mmo i have ever played but your mileage may vary depending on what it is you personally look for in a game of this genre there is plenty of diversity here though as each class story can be quite unlike the others from the classic star wars hero epic of the jedi knight to the spy drama of the imperial agent content becomes a lot more unified starting with the first expansion rise of the hutt cartel as the story is more or less the same for all players going from there still little flavours based on your class species gender remain and quest conclusions can be affected by player choice too each in game exchange is basically an interactive cutscene with a mass effect style dialogue wheel including light side and dark side conversation options with romanceable npc party members to boot so fans of the classic bioware rpg formula will definitely find lots to like here initially the spaceflight available in sw tor was only on rails combat it was pretty to look at but not particularly deep and it got old quick the end of 2013 brought us galactic starfighter which added free flying dogfights between players to the game as a much more entertaining variant of space combat though sadly even now in 2022 you still cannot fly around a star system completely freely like you could in the cosmic sandbox of star wars galaxies in fact in many ways this game is a theme park with sandbox elements including much more engrossing open ended plot and dialogue as opposed to the sandbox with theme park elements of the good old swg even the planetary environments here are not true open worlds but more like a series of interconnected wide corridors like that of the dragon age series or the first two wied min games that the player can traverse between at will overall star wars the old republic is a fantastic game that just keeps getting better and it could give any fan of star wars potentially hundreds of hours of fun especially now that levelling and companions have been streamlined so that you don t need to go through as much grinding to experience the best of the story content no other mmo out there has the quality or quantity of the narrative bioware offers here if you like star wars and enjoy the wow formula mixed with mass effect then you will most likely love this
