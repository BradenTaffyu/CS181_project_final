2023 with 400 hours on record and 100 achievements i feel bad because i cannot find any game that would be close to this one a great roguelike roguelite deckbuilder with lots os flexibility in play learning curve seems to be pretty high at the beginning but with trial and error or some wiki you can get grasp of all the nuances in the game very fast every new run feels similar to the previous one but is unique in itself 100 recommend i think that this game would be worth it even if it would cost twice its price
