2018 update finished the main scenario took 20 hours and i saved 696 people note i didn t rush anything so ymmv concerning game length the final moments were so incredibly exhilarating i had to remind myself to keep breathing while i micromanaged my city s people through the coldest winter imaginable can t wait to jump into the other two scenarios 10 10 would purchase again original review below six hours in and damn does this leave an excellent first impression will update my review after i complete the main scenario bleak yet powerful visuals audio and narrative strategic mechanics are designed and presented in a way that makes the game truly unique and addictive exploration is an absolute blast the name frostpunk doesn t live up to the seriousness and maturity of its content not an actual negative to take seriously just one person s opinion which may change over time others have mentioned that the game is currently light on post scenario content of which i ve been told takes 10 20 hours given the exceptional quality of the main scenario as well as the devs committment to future content i m fine with letting this point slide for now
