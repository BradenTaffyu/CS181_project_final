2020 i think with almost 200 hours in the game i am able to give my honest opinion on this game i haven t been much into trucks before i started playing but ets2 has changed it all now with almost whole europe added to the game with iberia being announced this game almost comes to an end if scs decides to stick to only europe and not further unlike ats there isn t much more room to grow i could only think of ukraine belarus and the balkan including greece however it is still an amazing game and i would recommend it to everyone who likes trucks or even just a bit of simulation in addition to the scs team being an incredible developer there is also the amazing and active community that is actively contributing to keep the game experience refreshing in form of new workshop elements whether it being a few tools to improve your game or just simple paint jobs the achievements that are currently in the game are also making me play fairly often compared to other games as they require a lot of time and patience however they re not impossible or incredibly hard to unlock they re just time consuming that s all tl dr 10 10 a must have for simulation fans
