2020 tl drthis game is a modern masterpiece not designed to be for everyone even if it tries to be everything great visuals for a 2017 game responsive gameplay with tight controlls with a rather easy learning curve music and sound is just chefs kiss phenominal story with good pacing runs like hot garbage without far modas most will say you came here to make your d cry but instead leave with ending d and you re the one who s crying nier automata while not vast in scale when it comes to the open world or even the total amount of side quests to keep you occupied for hundreds of hours delivers an exploration in the minds of those characters that inhabit the dystopian earth and the world itself the visuals are absolutely stunning albeit keep in mind that the gameplay is locked to 60fps cutscenes at 30fps while you can unlock it it s not recommended as it will break certain events that are tied to the fps being locked to 60 citation is needed on that i ve read that the far fix s built in frame limiter does not disrupt the ingame physics but do so at your own risk nonetheless it is essential that you install far fix automata resolution for an overall better ingame performance there are other mods that are vital depending on you gameplay preferences like naoim for mouse keyboard and reshade for an even further improved visual that aside the soundtrack is the life and spirit of the game without it such a story would not feel as impactful as it is i wouldn t say that every track is made of equal because ambiances and town tracks usually carry no inherent weight to your journey as you ll hear it ad nauseam at times but the tracks that you will hear like certain boss fights story points and well even some overworld tracks will crawl under your skin they re good enough to say that your small journey until that point has been all for that decisive moment while the story progression is linear sidequests that you complete feels so much more impactful as they reveal how each character lives or has lived or even further down to important story details that otherwise would have gone amiss if you just play the main story part you ll be reward greatly with lore and riches as for the gameplay elements it s a complete mess when it comes to genre mixing but focusing on the main part of the game it s perhaps one of the easier action rpgs to get into and quite easy to get the hang out though people who are unfamiliar with hack slash action rpgs should set the game to normal or downright easy to get a better grip on the movement options until they feel more comfortable with it there are ingame plugin chips for those that play on easy that help with various combat related scenarios such as auto aim of your pod but for the most optimal gameplay experience hard is without a doubt highly recommended the other genres within the game as aforementioned i will not get into detail in but are present and want to mention is a 2d 3d multi directional shoot em up some focus on 2d sidescrolling with platforming traces literally only like 20 30 minutes of light visual novel and some moments of top down birds eye action controlls feel snappy and responsive the overal maneuverability of your player character is fluid you have a lot of options to engage combat and the selection of weapon types and the combination of such makes it the more personalized there are no real bad weapon types and the weapon themselves are balanced enough that there is not a definitive bad weapon except of perhaps one cypress stick which is designed to be that way every hit of each weapon type feels the way it plays light swords being fast perfect for combos but weak and not as weighty as a greatsword which you feel every hits impact aswell the high damage output just to name an example continuing the gameplay part the combination to rack up damage slowly with your pod and fight airborne enemies with it make even missing every hit of your melee not as punishing so you ll feel engaged in battle even if you re not face front with them pod programms which you will unlock a few variants later also offer a good amount of help in combat they re focused on utility like shooting a focused beam of light that deals damage down to a barrier that deflects ranged attacks as per the longevity of the game as you ll have different endings it s required you play the game a few times through to see them all there are a total of 26 endings but to fully have seen it all it s only necessary for you to achieve 5 main endings and 1 additional one i wanted to focus on the more technical side of the game rather than what the game makes you feel except on the music department i love this games music as plenty of other reviewers have done so to a much better extend that i could ever do
