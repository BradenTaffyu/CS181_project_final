2023 i quite enjoy this game more so than its predecessor two point hospital which shows that they have made improvements both tangible and intangible since the first game i also bought it on sale as well so that factors into my value for money enjoyment as you can imagine you are in charge of starting and building a school to produce quality students and also money for you which you can then use to further improve the place either through staff training better equipment for your classrooms or decorations to make the place look more pleasing to the eye i struggle and continue to struggle on getting the attractiveness of the place up especially when it rains frogs or there s some other kind of natural disaster so it would be good to have the ability to turn this feature off along with the temperature moderation which means you have to put radiators or a c units all over the place which is a bit of a chore one of the things i do like is that you re not pigeonholed into how you set up your school yes there are some campuses where you need to meet certain requirements in a specific subject but that doesn t mean you have to solely focus on that subject looking at one campus i have one doing archaeology v r and robotics whereas one of my online friends is doing archaeology and cooking another is doing archaeology only and someone else is doing archaeology and clown school so you get the idea there are tool tips to help you complete your requirements but some of them are a bit vague and so you may spend hours doing year after year of classes but not attaining them which is rather frustrating you can look on the help section on steam but i m at 3 5 million in the black have played 12 years on a specific campus but still can t get the final star to complete the level this is not an ideal choice for 100 completionists because you have to buy the dlc to get the remaining achievements which is rather annoying the dlc content looks like a fun extension to the game but i won t buy that until it goes on sale
