early access review this game is fun and it s good it s got a little jank here and there but it does what it should do it s a loot fest of a game meaning the biggest and most important thing you can do is clear out homes and look for all the skill books no item is useless or trash they all play an important role even the small items that look like garbage ended up having an important role later in the game which made me regret not grabbing every little thing i saw on the ground i first bought this game in 2013 i was in high school it just came out and this game was terrible since then it s come a long way and i can tell the developers do love their game and want to make it worth while the game takes an absurdly long time to progress i absolutely recommend turning everything up as much as you can when starting a new game such as xp gain loot bonus etc and even then the pacing is pretty slow ultimately i recommend this game for the amount of fun i ve had with it and it is one of my favorite games out there i don t recommend it due to its very very slow progression unless you re willing to spend dozens of hours in one world
