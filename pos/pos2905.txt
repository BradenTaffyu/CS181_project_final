2018 i spent a huge amount of time with this game and am glad to say that i did the virtues well realized combat system with all sorts of hilarious ways to get through tough fights you can stack up 50 oil barrels around a bad man you can block doorways off with boxes and empty chests you can teleport people into burning lava anything goes and the devs clearly aren t shy about opening up avenues to let you with their world puzzles by the same token can often be screwed with in hilarious ways towards the end there was a really complicated pipe dream thing where you had to get three flavours of holy water into some pools the entire puzzle could be skipped by teleporting the garbage over the pipes and into their stupid pools that was just glorious the story is compelling and balances light hearted comedy with dark fantasy pretty well the problems following along with the storyline is pretty much impossible in multiplayer you probably shouldn t do a first playthrough with friends my stash disappeared in act 3 and never came back overall a worthy purchase
