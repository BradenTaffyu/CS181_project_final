2017 even aside from the warhammer franchise this is the best total war game to date and i say that having played every single game since the first rome this tw has the best gameplay and interface best strategy each race plays remarkably unique instead of just different skinned units and buildings like in previous tw games hugely recommended if you like total war warhammer or any action strategy type games
