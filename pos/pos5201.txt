2016 definitely i m female too and not in my 20 s or 30 s anymore haha d this is a game for all genders and all ages in my opinion it all depends on the person i d like leveling up my character to be a bit more rustic technical myself but i love the game i do get confused as to what i am to do as i m trying to not use walkthroughs or mods i like achievements mods won t allow them or so the screen said so i disabled them to try them later a person died from electricution as soon as i entered the room he had a full name i can t help but wonder if i d entered the area from another angle if he would ve lived but my quick save was right when i entered the room blah could i have saved him idk i did die so i wound up there a second time and i see nothing i can do expcept try to run and take the damage myself if that d even work making the electrical current draw to my metal armor anyway i like to keep dogmeat with me he s not as annoying as i d feared he doesn t go around barking all the time he makes hints and signals to you if you pay attention to his reactions he s very helpful if you sneak he sneaks haha love his belches screenshot haha crazy dog love it i fear this game might be similar to dragon age with your actions having that type of impact taking along the bot instead of dog having an advantage in certain areas but not others i don t know but i do fear that may be the case but i keep the dog with me at all times now i may have another playthrough to see or check the walkthroughs and guides later after i finish it to do another go round that s my experience i can t tell you to get it each person is different but i think many types of people would enjoy this addictive game that i can say with all honesty
