2018 this game helps me cope with my depression it s such a sweet and wholesome experience and i love just hanging out with groups of wild slimes and watching them jump around i recommend it for anyone who wants something chill and happy the slime variety is good and i love making hybrids the devs are attentive and do update frequently as well as including fun events where you can get rare items also love the music especially the song that plays in the credits if there was one thing i could add it would be the ability to interact more with slimes in the original game like in the vr version i would kill to pet a tabby slime it totally is deserving of full price and more i can tell a lot of love went into this creation
