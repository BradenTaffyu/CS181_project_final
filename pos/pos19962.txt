2017 a good rpg with some minor flaws you really need the ultimate edition to truly appreciate the whole story stuff i liked interesting characters my favourite characters veronica christine mr house father elijah and ulysses runs really well on modern systems which helps maintain immersion i disliked the long loading screens in fallout 4 well written dialogue much better than skyrim fallout 4 well designed dungeon areas overall the dlcs are interesting more so than fallout 4 s stuff i didn t like main storyline is too short you can literally complete it in 2 3 hours if you ignore all the sidequests i preferred fallout 4 s story to new vegas the repair system is interesting but things break too fast can t continue playing after you complete the main storyline skyrim fo4 allow you to dead money dlc has arguably the best characters and story but the gameplay is not fallout like at all felt more like playing resident evil silent hill minor bugs like saves not loading luckily there are workarounds other stuff i got to be very good at blackjack because one of the achievements involves winning a lot of money from different casinos i actually started this game in 2013 but never got past goodsprings the graphics felt very stale compared to skyrim the only bethesda rpg i d played then i only came back to this because of friend recommendations and after i completed fallout 4
