2022 fallout 76after a rough launch the game got better but the process to make it the game that is now took to long they added a lot of quality of life updates and some bad ones but they did make it good i can gladly say you can buy the game in the state that it is cause it s like fallout 4 which is good i wanted to buy the game on launch but i waited for reviews and gameplay i like playing the game with my friends it s fun the graphics are the same as fallout 4 so they are good there are bugs cause you know is a fallout game made by bethesda which means that the bugs are a feature the combat is great just like fallout 4 ones again the game is just fallout 4 but online try it on a free weekend to see if you like it and if you do buy it s great but in the end the game is really fun after more than 100 hours i can say that the game is good they did improve it a lot and still add content give it a try you can get all of the achievements if you try so go ahead and get them for your perfect game collection
