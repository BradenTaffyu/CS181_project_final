2014 early access review alright first of all i do not know why i am writing this it won t probably get noticed but if you are reading this and are thinking of buying it listen up do you like left 4 dead if you do this game isn t similar to that at all this is a game where you create a story create a character and try your best to live his last days or weeks or even months if you re skilled enough this is a game of patience you have to slowly experience your character to his limits you have to teach him how to fish you have to teach him how to build a fort and you have to teach him how to fight the greater evil be careful though this isn t a story about how you suddenly met 100 zombies and went full rambo on them and now you re the old man telling your grandkids these tales it is a story a tale on how you survived against the dozens of hordses what came around when the mankind fell this game this game is the one where you can prove your point with your friends in the argument of who is the one of us to die first or who will last longest this is the suitable game for that they are even going to add advanced npc s soon that are going to function just like a normal player spooky aint it now back from the character the music is extremely good let me give you an example of an interactive music demo from ingame music click on the link and read the text and try to live the story you don t have to listen to the whole song imagine the violins playing when you ve fought your last battle and got bitten you know you have a few hours left and decide to take your stuff and leave you wander off to the city the city is quiet but suddenly zombies appear around every corner you ready your shotgun your panic increases when you put the bullets in the barrel and you become slower every second you dropped a bullet accidentally out of panic there s no time for more reloading you equip your shotgun and stand still for a few seconds to aim correctly into the horde a few zombies fall but it doesn t hinder the movement of the undead you take a few steps back and you fall you get up as fast as you can you can hear the zombies growling a hundred feet away you arrive home your last moments are near you open the drawer and find a picture of your family dead a long time ago your tears drop down the picture and it gets wet after 30 minutes of crying the tears start fueling your rage you are after revenge you return to the horde you walk slowly and wait until the zombies hunker near you you have your trusty machete in your hand as the zombies come you slice them up and roar like a predator from every slaughter as you work your way through all of the zombies they start to increase in numbers suddenly when youre swinging the blade into the skull of the last nearby zombie the color of your sight starts to disappear you now see only in the colors of white and black you try to retreat but eventually pass out this is how you died the game will become even more masterful when the seasons the medical overhaul and the other survivors arrive just wait i love this game you should try out the demo if youre still considering but i have a few things to tell you enter houses through windows holding e when you are trying to access them the doors are rarely open you also have limited time because the character youre playing as has got bitten it gives some taste what the game is like i have no idea how outdated it is what so ever oh its an early access game the devs are the most active devs i ve ever seen they are very systematic every monday there is an update of what they are doing was it big or small its still there every week they are also open for suggestions as they added a brilliant mod to the develop scheme a few weeks ago what introduces seasons i would reccommend this game to anyone and soon you can still play it alone with no friends because of the npc s you can literally team up with them and arrange them to loot for food and such
