2022 early access review this story is based on real events that happened in a multiplayer game night 3 and 4 at the mall i was making great progress in the mall it started to get quieter and i started to feel safe clearing it with that shotgun and ammo that i found was so satisfying thought it did nearly get me killed my shotgun jammed just as i was going to kill a zombie at point blank range luckily i could hit the zombie in the face with it and distanced myself again while i was looting the bbq store i found the holy grail that we have been looking for quite some time it s the magazine that teaches us how to use generators in my enthusiasm i radioed back home shouting with joy ch anvi and peet were chuffed and told me to rest there one more night come dawn they were going to head towards me and fetch me by car i was exhausted but exited to see my friends again so i went back to my tent i made sure i barricaded the storage room i was camped in and put the shotgun next to my sleeping bag i actually slept really well since the first time in ages the next day we all were chatting and laughing on the walkietalkies while they were heading to the mall for the very first time in ages i really felt alive anvi souped up one of the cars making him drive like a speed demon it was funny but also nerve wrecking to hear him nearly kill himself while swerving out of the away from the zombies while racing the rest of the crew when they arrived the mood was still joyful perhaps i was too optimistic and gave them a false sense of security we put the magazine and some supplies i gathered in the trunk of the car we decided to do a quick look before we left we all to separate parts of the mall trying to find some more valuable loot it wasn t long before we could hear screaming and shouting coming from the south side of the mall it was anvi he got boxed in on the escalator and was panicking and screaming for helm i ran there as fast as i could and readied my shotgun just as i walked around the corner i saw that my friend was being mauled and eaten by the undead i was filled with rage and started to blast them perhaps i could still save him the zombies around him were dead though not much was left of him i couldn t bare the sight so i turned around and tried to find the rest of my friends i heard another groan and looked behind my shoulder it was anvi he was shambeling towards me while almost tripping over his own intestines i couldn t shoot him even though he turned into a zed i started to run to my other friends and saw ch he saw my grim look and didn t ask any questions just as we made eye contact we heard more screams of pain before we could react and figure out where he was they stopped we eventually found his eaten corpse with his duffel bag just behind the counter with the popcorn machine the zeds were no where to be seen we fled to the car and drove back to our base we didn t say a word during this ride i felt terrible and very guilty it s because of me and my stupid idea of living in the mall that my friends are gone i shouldn t have stayed there for so long and shouldn t have said it was safe i m going to drink that bottle of bourbon i found and hopefully drown my sorrows tomorrow will be another day in this hell infested world and i cannot let it consume me too
