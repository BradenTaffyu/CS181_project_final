2019 slime rancher is my favorite game i have loved it since i got it some years ago from the art style to game mechanics i love it all this game is perfect for beginning gamers because the controls are easy to remember and are perfectly formatted hold right click to vac and use left click to shoot the fact the game is so mellow and chibi are just great if you want a break from first person shooters this is definitely a game you should try
