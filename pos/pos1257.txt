2015 early access review when somebody sees this game they might think it s just another early access zombie survival game most of which being awful however this game is not another game where you play as the rambo of the apocalypse shooting every zombie in sight crafting better and better weapons instead you play as the average joe who somehow managed to not become one of the hundereds of zombies occupying knox county instead of having some crafting table where you can build a castle right off the bat you need to find everything needed to build the walls just to protect your garden the loot system works pretty well you find stuff where you would normally find it houses have average loot including food bats golf clubs and the occasional gun or case of bullets warehouses will generally have crafting supplies police stations will have guns and ammo and so on you will find the occasional out of place item like a gun or bullets in the elementary school you need to debate doing anything in the game since one slip up could spell certain death there have been way too many times where i decide to go loot a building by the highway and am ingulfed in zombies the dev team the indie stone have done a superb job at creating this game and every update makes the game much more fun realistic and of course difficult you will not find a better zombie survival game out there and i more than reccomend it
