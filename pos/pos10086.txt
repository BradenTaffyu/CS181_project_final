2019 so finally after 110 hours i ve managed to win a game rimworld is quite difficult to describe its a sim that just when you think you re doing alright the game throws you a curve ball to make you know you re never truly safe the strange thing with it is there is no proper story yet stories come about from it just down to the random occurrences in my winning game i felt quite comfortable at the beginning my colony grew to about 12 people lots of food banked raw resources quite plentiful then some toxic fallout occurred so everyone was trapped inside to avoid getting sick all the wildlife dies no more free food stocks getting low but we re surviving whats that volcano dust in the atmosphere crops grow more slowly due to lack of sun quickly set up some internal farms struggling for power to keep sun lamps running food is low can t go outside still sorry sheet but we re hungry and your pet is the only way for us to get meat we got past that but towards the end sheet dies to a large invasion of mechs and albina who had been dealing with a heart condition for 3 years finally had 2 heart attacks the second killed her just 3 days before we got off this godforsaken planet thank you for your sacrifice
