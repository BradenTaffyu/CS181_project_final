2020 alright i m gonna have an unpopular opinion i like it it s a solid 7 10 with friends i ll get back to this in a bit i will admit that i used to be on the hate bandwagon for this game a very long time ago when bethesda was pulling their bullsh t and a lot of my friends were of a like mind recently however i had been hearing about wastelanders and i had talked to people and we all kind of agreed that the game itself wasn t that bad but bethesda s actions were not good with how they treated their customers in my opinion it looks like bethesda is trying to fix the game i can t really compare the game before wastelanders because i didn t play so maybe my view is colored by the fact that the holotape recordings arent the only ways to get quests anymore and i really like the npcs they ve added that said i do like those i do like following a paper trail or i guess a cassette trail whatever for those who would go calling me a bethesda shill simply don t you re wasting your time and frankly i dont have the time nor the willpower i ve been a big fallout fan since my first introduction to the series fallout 3 fallout 3 was often judged by many as a bad game despite doing many things new vegas did if not better fallout 3 was a mixed bag of a weirdly made and not super well written story and a boatload of excellent sidequests and generally good gameplay that said i also loved new vegas i even liked fallout 4 that s something of a sin these days too was i excited when fallout 76 launched no i knew exactly what was gonna happen and i was calling it accurately call me nostradamus i could see a mile away that a new multiplayer game was gonna be problematic they almost always are these days i was telling everyone to not buy the game at the time and you know what i think it was the right call then now things are different the wastelanders dlc adds a lot to the table there s more product there for what you re paying as far as value to the consumer if you really hated the dialogue in fallout 4 but you re more of a fan of new vegas or fallout 3 style dialogue the wastelanders update really does raise the bar in that regard there s a lot of choice i can lie which locks me out of dialogue options i can be a jerk and call people out on their bs i can be just like ok what do you need done i can say no there s not as much railroading like there seems to be in fallout 4 where every dialogue option is yes sarcastically but yes no ask a question and that s all you get however this isn t a review of the wastelanders dlc the game itself the shooting mechanics well they are just fallout 4 if you liked fallout 4 s gunplay and the way that handles then fallout 76 is nice for that as for the optimization i m not super impressed with this the game looks fine it actually looks really good on my geforce rtx 2070 and ryzen 5 2600 system doesn t run bad for me my friend on an older i7 7700k and gtx 1060 seems to have some problems with lag from time to time i think the worldspace being so big and not segmented like it probably should be is partly to blame fallout 4 has similar issues in when going into boston so it might just be an engine thing when it s attempting to render a lot at once again that said the game being a bit foliage or object heavy isn t a problem for me and it would probably run just as good on my radeon rx vega 64 but buyer beware as far as that goes i ve played a few hours of it so far i ve built a nice cabin overlooking a river valley 10 10 on the map design but that s expected given bethesda and their experience crafting interesting worlds now remember when i said that the game is fun with friends i dont know if i could play this by myself but then i often feel that way about fallout 4 which is why i usually get one of the companions in fallout 4 the game does feel a little empty players are usually far apart so getting some buddies to play this with is a must in my opinion if you have no friends or you aren t social or dont want to travel the wasteland with friends then this game might not be for you i dont think this game was designed to be played alone initially i think they tweaked the difficulty so that it was possible to do alone but i think the game was intended to be played with friends the markings of that are all there there s a lot of benefit to teaming with friends they earn caps if i complete a quest i earn caps if they complete a quest i can easily fast travel to their camps and we can all just hang out speaking of the player base of the game as far as i ve determined is very chill so if you re worried everyone is a raider or something then i would say don t worry too much i literally set up a workshop for like half an hour at the tyler county dirt track a player ran by did nothing didn t try to claim the workshop or steal my junk hey back off this is my trash heap or whatever the line from deacon is in fallout 4 would be fitting right about now jokes aside this game is a lot like rdr2 in that the online experience with other players isn t toxic though your mileage may vary all in all 7 10 the gameplay is actually pretty good my experience has been largely bug free aside from an issue i had where i was lagging a bit when playing with my friend in germany if you want to solo i dont think this game does the solo thing very well it all depends on you however i m probably just not a very solo person
