2022 if you re a car fanatic like me what are you waiting for click that add to cart button and enjoy forza horizon 5 in my opinion has been the best forza game to date now the gameplay is still forza at the end of the day however playground games make up for this with the amount of effort that they have put into this installment of forza seriously though all new reworked car sounds that sound almost 1 1 to their real life counterparts a whole bunch of unique cars which are still getting added and probably won t stop getting added till the end of the game s life and the graphics are a nice step up from the last game the new landscape is quite alright better than the uk but not as good as horizon 3 or 2 in my opinion overall a really fun racer to play alone or with friends
