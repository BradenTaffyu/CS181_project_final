2020 i really was sceptical at first i ve never played grand strategies from paradox and usually i prefer pre generated factions with developed lore and i thought that stellaris is some boring game with complex and hard mechanics and it s not for me oh my god how i was wrong this is a beast i only bought an original game to give it a try and do not feel sorry if i have spent money stupidly i gave the game a slow start really reading every tip and descriprion and starting with small steps and stellaris is really started to open itself as a magnificent strategy with so much fun and with so brilliantly made mechanics i just keep thinking of it every day since i guess i fell in love lol and that s only a beginning i imagine how many more things will be there when i will buy every dlc on this planet earth and at the moment of writing this review necroids are introduced i feel so hyped right now jesus and imagine that for many years to come this masterpiece will get at least twice the amount of dlc s it s astonishing beyond belief give this game a try don t make judgment too fast and you will be surprised
