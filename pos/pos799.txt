2018 this game is more than just a farming game it s full of lore and beautiful stories each character has a unique personality and backstory some backstories pretty deep but that s for you to find out speaking of which it s full of mysteries and has tons of things to discover and do i m absolutely in love with the soundtrack and the aptmosphere that this game gives is mesmerizing the only slight bother i have is that the map isn t that big i d like to see an update where they add a new area but i think that all of the content inside balances it out in a way stardew valley is so heartwarming and definitely a favourite if you want a nice relaxing game to curl up and play with this is definitely ideal
