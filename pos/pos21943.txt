2017 q give me a tl dr version a buy the game and git gud q i heard the game is hard is it good for causal player a yes q is it good for skyrim player a yes but you ll need to learn new mechanics such as parrying and roll timing q is it a good game for family friend etc a yes the game has a password feature to co op with friend i think the game is educational for children as it teaches people to not give up and overcome hardship q is this game full of rainbow and candy a no it s closer to a horror game especially in some later areas even prettier areas are infested with monsters the atmosphere of this game is very grim and grey ish q tutorial a check the signs in the first map you can check the keyboard controller maping in setting the first map has mooks a mini boss and a boss for you to play with the tutorial boss gundyr teaches you various evasion technique q is there a mini map a no but since you might die a number of times you ll get familiar with the map there are many shortcuts q is there an easy mode a it s called greatshield you can get one in the second map but need some levelling up to use it starting as knight default also counts as an easy mode in early game q i don t like invaders a start the game in offline mode you can change this in setting you can still play with npc phantoms but cannot co op if you are online stay unembered prevent invasion but you cannot co op if you are invaded you can also run toward the boss fog gate edit you can join way of blue in the second map that will lower the chance of being invaded as well q mooks attack 100 times in a row a try spacing q mooks gank me unfair a try looking around this game is known for enemy trolling you every corner lock on feature will spot enemy above q bosses are too fast a it s kind of counterintuitive but you sometimes need to roll toward them check youtube if you have trouble don t worry dying to boss is a learning process q what s the main strength of this game a best video game soundtrack q what s the weakness of this game a too short compared to ds2 not enough armor weapon spells q should i buy ds1 and ds2 instead a ds1 is more noob friendly imo and a better defined story ds2 has many different mechanics better pvp but terrible pve ganking it s completely up to you q will i feel confused by the story when jumping directly into the third game a the story is always vague so it doesn t matter check youtube lore channels for better understanding q i ve heard that npc questlines are hard to complete without guide a just talk to people and do what they say check the shrine to see if there are new dialogue one thing you need to remember is that progressing in rosaria s finger a guild you cannot equip the guild item or offer the leveling item will end another questline also the magic merchant will leave if you ignore your promise q i m a completionist what if i miss some gear a you need to reach ng for 100 achievement so feel free to look online for checklist in ng
