2017 this is from the perspective of someone who has been a huge fan of thehunter classic for many years and have quite a bit of time and money invested in it call of the wild is a beautiful game environment and solid hunting mechanics which will feel familiar to veteran classic players and not too daunting for new hunters to the series i ve seen a lot of people ask if this is anything like cabela s i would have to say that cotw is far superior to cabela s but still maintains a casual hunter feel to it there are still a few launch issues and bugs however which really should have been ironed out from the beta before retail release including some issues that aren t dissimilar to what has or is being experienced in thehunter classic specifically mp issues pros gorgeous graphics great sound design reserves are very well designed and visually interesting dynamic weather system is well implemented smooth animations and weapons feel like they have weight players can jump this might sound ridiculous to put on a pro s list but it s one of the biggest features i wanted in classic stalking animals is much easier this could also be listed as a con progression system with xp money and weapon skill that will keep you striving to improve massive hunting reserves similar game mechanics to classic that makes the game familiar for veteran classic players good tutorial and hint system for new hunters much further render distance for all the long shot enthusiasts cons a few ui issues unable to click some elements or non responsive elements experienced a couple of crashes due to entering the system settings menu work around is to change settings then restart the game another suggestion is to disable cloud sync in steam animals aren t as hard when it comes to spook range and flee distance from weapon firing mp has a few issues most noticeably with desync shooting animals that aren t actually there joining an mp game can spawn you out of bounds or with 0 health this isn t game breaking from my experience as it respawns you near the host can t quit to main menu only to desktop can t progress your characters environment lore tower unlocks in mp no in depth stats tracking and weapon skill progression compared to classic progression flow is a bit off receiving missions and being advised to use specific callers which you can t yet unlock due to level or money requirements no truracks system some may find the game too grindy to unlock new weapons and itemsall in all i would still recommend this game in spite of its launch issues if you can tolerate a few bugs if you are expecting a 100 flawless release then perhaps give this title a miss until the developers have ironed a few creases out i ll happily update this review in the near future to accurately reflect any developer changes to anything listed above or anything new they introduce i hope this helps
