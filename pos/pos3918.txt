2022 i don t think i can say enough good things about the game i m terrible at it but i enjoy it so much it s not x com and you re doing the game a disservice thinking it is it s a turn based game with an interesting story there s tons of missions and if you enjoy turn based battlse and don t mind experimenting you ll love it especially mastery crafting masteries are the key to getting the most out of your builds highly highly recommended
