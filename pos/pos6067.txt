2022 the sims 4 is a more optimized somewhat more customizable yet emptier sims 3 very simply put this game has a lot more to do yet less to spend in what do i mean it may have more skills and more jobs maybe on dlc but i m positive it s fairly low on the base game but all you can do with your skills are basically either just essential skills for jobs which outside of them just slightly improve your everyday life like sport skills allows you to do more exercise not lose hygiene etc they can also help you with enviromental things like repairing and painting for some nice decoration or basically just for money like learning to play instruments what s wrong about them nothing really they are basically centered on improving the enviroment of your sim saving money by repairing yourself broken items getting your own ingredients from your garden to cook have better mood from decorations you made or overall sell things like paintings books and fruits and vegetables but once you have the highest quality items you sim needs you re set you can now only spend money on decoration or making your house bigger to have more space to keep buying things which can be invalidated with the traits that prevents the needs from depleting thus no need for beds toilets showers etc so if you manage to improve most if not all skills and get said traits the cycle will become work rest work repeat but hey you can socialize that s the main point of it yes sure you can but it ll get tiring to the point you ll have kids with the whole town and still get bored what only i do that nah i m sure i m not the only one that has reached this point of boredom right right is this game good enjoyable yeah just try not to spend so much time in one session or maybe try some mods or events i haven t so i can t really talk about that
