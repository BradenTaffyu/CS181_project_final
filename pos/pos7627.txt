2023 i wish there was a neither nor option for recommending because i recommend it but i don t recommend it at the same time basically i keep playing it because i m trying to do different things to try to like it because i want to like it i loved 2ph and have like 200 something hours in it but 2pc is just missing something i don t know what it is missing but i can t find it maybe i keep playing it because i m looking for the thing that s missing it is super repetitive and redundant and i m not even sure how to give examples because i don t know what it is i can t put my finger on it i ve already played it from start to finish 2 or 3 times and only in 60 something hours imo that s kind of terrible it s too short too easy too few things to do you would think that being able to build all the campuses would make it better but it really doesn t because the builds just keep end up being the same because all the items always get unlocked in the same order so if you look at my builds you can see exactly when x y z got unlocked if that makes sense it s no different than 2ph where you have a designated place to put the things you unlock except now you have to build it yourself just always at the same point in time the only solution i ve found is to bulldoze the entire map and rebuild from scratch but can t do that til you ve accumulated the funds to spend and then by that point the map is almost completed so what is the point loli don t know i am sad because this was the one game i was looking forward to and then i got it and finished it and was like ok
