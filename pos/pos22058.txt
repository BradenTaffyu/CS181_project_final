2020 dark souls iii is definitely a slow burn if it s your first souls game ever like me at first i was mighty nervous to wander 10 steps away from a bonfire and many of the game mechanics remained a mystery until they were explained by veteran friends and a fair amount of wiki browsing i nearly gave up entirely but pressed on since i had heard such great things eventually though i too fell victim to the intense stockholm syndrome this game infects in its players after 15ish hours i was no longer afraid to explore every corner of the maps and the more intricate mechanics became second nature i now wander into pvp areas with excitement rather than fear common mobs became minor roadblocks instead of epic battles i ve finished up to ashes of ariandel and look forward to ringed city with great anticipation the bosses are amazingly designed it s an odd game too in the sense that some of them seem excruciatingly hard for some people and other players beat them on the first round this game represents a different playing experience for each one i for instance had more rounds against the cursed rotted greatwood than the nameless king it s got a huge learning curve for sure but once you get the hang of it you start to actually enjoy it it s become one of my favorites at that do yourself a favor and give it a shot you won t regret it though be aware that you ll probably screw up your first playthrough and that s okay since many of the character quests depend on ridiculous triggers in very specific points in the game also the jailers can suck on my ashen one
