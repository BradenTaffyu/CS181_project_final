2020 dont starve a really intriguing game with a gameplay that can appear at the beginning of the usual where the goal is to survive graphics could make the picky ones turn up their noses but believe it or not in the long run not tired and is very cool the exploration within the game is infinite being the huge map leaving out the various caves and biomes within it one of the main points of this game are the monsters it is possible to meet any unimaginable creature from giants to mutant monsters the gameplay presents a huge variety of possible crafts that can allow you to build huge and creative bases in addition to this you will also find several protagonists with skills that will allow you to vary your experience the fights are quite simple as soon as you get carried away they are quite schematic that is they attack themselves and expect the enemy to do the same repeating it until it dies so it might seem boring but the atmosphere and the monsters you meet will not disappoint you in expectations survival within the game is really tough in almost all biomes especially during the winter and summer not to mention when it rains to conclude i really recommend this game to survival lovers
