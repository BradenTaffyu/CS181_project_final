2018 disclaimer this review is not made with casual players in mind nowadays everything gets progressively dumbed down with this fallout is not any different it s simply inferior to it s predecessors but even though bethesda s games are known for being a poorly developed mess they are also known for having a great modding community with mods and only that way you can actually make this game not suck ass if you want don t like the dumb voiced protagonist as it ruins role playing remove it you think the dialog text not showing precisely what the character is going to say was a stupid idea change it the perk system is casual garbage there are mods for it sort of you ask yourself where did they come up with the stupid changes to survival mode like save only on sleep tweak it and you probably want to go even further anyway cause you know bethesda so in short as long as you mod it until it becomes a different not baby difficulty game then it becomes a somewhat decent game although you should keep in mind that certain things can t be fixed by mods like the complexion of the dialog system of the previous games and how it related to your special and skills stats and sometimes even with perks that depth is gone forever that said if you want the game for the mindless fun since it s all it has to offer i suggest you get it with a discount bethesda doesn t deserve your money or just play new vegas instead you know it s your choice but maybe you don t even need to bother paying more for an inferior product
