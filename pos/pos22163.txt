2020 i don t know what to say about dark souls 3 that hasn t been said already the game has an incredible atmosphere and coupled with the soundtrack it creates a very impressive play the gameplay is probably what most people vouch for and they are right it is really challenging and very rewarding i would definitely recommend the game especially if you have friends who already have it
