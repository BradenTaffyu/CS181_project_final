2020 when you hone in on one thing it is easy to miss out on something else this is painfully true for nier automata because besides the main story the game dosen t tell you anything else its probably the best part of the game i love the most nier automata goes out of its way for the sake of world building but it dosen t shove anything in your face the beauty of nier automata is that everything is so silent and muted unless you willing dig deeper you won t find the answers that you want and if thats not your thing the game respects that underneath the surface it has such an incredible world to offer nier automata has a clear structure to it unless you turn your head and look what is around you you won t notice the splits on the road along the way but the beauty of it innier automata is that it still works instead of forcing anything that is not the main story onto you it lets you know that there is more exploration to be done only if you wish to do so even the smallest ingnifisicent side quest can add to the overall world but you don t have to do it i don t think you can judge the game s story ending unless you have gone through all the five main endings of the game nier automata is not for everyone and that is a good thing it clearlyis a game that is not afraid of upseting its audience which is something i have always appreciated atmosphere grpahic issues are non existance the frame drops were minimal considering the worlds large scope but they never played a part in getting in the way of the game the overall tone of the game is very melancholic although its still very peaceful character designs are monochrome but also intricate the enviroments are dreary but also stunning these contrast are super obviousthroughout the different areas you visited throughout the game and it does a great job making you feel that you are the last hope the world has around down the abandoned earth nier automata has fantastic soundtrack composed by keiichi okabe not only is it breath taking and beautiful but its also varied and has a future ristic feeling story regardless of either you are a fan of jprpg s or yoko taro fan because of his story telling in nier automata i can say that you definetly won t be able to predict how the story is goingto end the theme of killing for the sake of your own beliefs has been a theme throughout nier automata it can look like a cliche journey about life and death and love and they are allpresent in the game but the most important one is the journey to finding your own purpose after finishing your first playthrough its up to you to dive deeper into the story or not bygetting all the 5 major endings in the game which i will strongly encourage you to do so the story is wonderfully twisted and unnevering and a very intreging one the game has mutiple endings which can be obtain through mutiple playthroughs in each one you learn more and more about the world which will affect the way you see each character gameplay looking at a gameplay perspective for the most part its a absolute joy to play considering that it was developed by platninum games the combat silck fast paced and fun i never gotbored of mixing and matching different weapons and plug in chips that does different effects platinum games really understand what makes combat feel both fun and satisfying both thecharacters a2 and 2b work simillarly considering that they are combat androids although they have diff move sets once you start playing as 9s the hacking mini game gets introduced consideringhow powerful his hacking skill is and how often you will use it it can get a bit boring sometimes because he is a scanner android and not a combat desgined one the game is very understanding its not too difficult and not too easy it has simillar triats of any jprpg game side quest weapon upgrading etc pros very good story touching sad and depressing in a good way cried at the ending and certain scence combat feels slick and is fast paced and fun sound track breath taking and beautiful but its also varied and has a future ristic feeling characters all the characters are very well designed and have very different personalities and different playstyles cons poor pc port best played with a controller game get a bit boring as 9s due to the constant mini hacking games
