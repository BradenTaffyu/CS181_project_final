2015 early access review to be perfectly honest this is the first voxel based open world game that s grabbed my attention since minecraft and as a former developer at mojang that says a lot the graphics are magnificent the audio is the perfect blend of realistic and creepy and the crafting is something that other games shoudl take note of i m enthusiastic enough about 7 days to die that i run my own server for my friends overall the only negative worth mentioning is that the updates are few and far between and it doesn t seem like the fine pimps concentrate on bug fixing which can make things awkward at times
