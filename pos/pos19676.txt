2019 simply one of the best video games not just of the 2010s but ever period you re put into this beautifully deep and dark post apocalyptic world in an alternate universe and are given the freedom to do whatever you want seriously kill everyone or save the world it s all up to you across all my consoles ive played this game for a good 1000 hours and i still discover something new about it every time i start up a new game if you haven t played this you seriously owe it to yourself to give it a go dlc is essential at least to me if you wanted to play without it you can but once you get a taste of the world you ll want as much as you can bite off not even the other fallout games have matched up to this yet and i m not sure anything ever will seriously cannot reccomend this game enough to any and everyone
