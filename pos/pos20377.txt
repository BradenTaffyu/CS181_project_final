2022 early access review good game that flips the p2w f2p mobile ideas on its head and succeeds it s totally free to play and actually encourages playing to improve over buying other mobile developers should take notice especially if it still makes money through season pass and cosmetics i m buying a few passes just to support their f2p model it also helps that the game is fun and addicting there s always a one more game feel
