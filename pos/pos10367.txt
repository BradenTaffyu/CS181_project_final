2020 update this sim is primarily responsible for my upgrading my gear bought when using my trusty g25 2k later and the performance and immersion increase is chalk and cheese and yet i need more stuff a 3dof motion platform is now a serious consideration so be warned i read the analogy someplace in the reviews section about crack for sim racers well looks like i m expletive good as a sim gets at this point in space and time if you want a true racing experience help me very impressive gt3 simfinally a good tyre model that is realistic to use gone are the shonky use of tyre pressures to gain unrealistic performance these tyres have specific windows for premium performance go outside the windows and you will suffer the approach taken on the setups and telemetry is quite new and will take vet sim drivers awhile to understand if you use the same method approach used in other sims you will wonder what the hell is happening again the cars have operational windows step outside those windows in set ups you will go backward there is far to much to list here best spend some time on youtube to get up to speed the tracks are the best ive seen so far in any sim the new standard is laser scanned tracks the bathurst track is incredible to behold i praised racerooms version of mt panorama and this is even better the sensation of the altitude drop climb is superb the transitional weather and lighting effects are too good a decent pc is required mostly when there are other cars on the track compromises will have to be made in a field of 70 cars online or single playerthe gt3 sounds are perfectly suited to surround sound and offer so much depth to the driverthe driving is outstanding and is more important to be consistant over a blistering one lap guys go to fast to0 early end up binning it or burning out the tyres destroying brakes etc this is elbow to elbow racing the cars are extremely close in performance and all have their little pros and cons some suit a specific track and some dont some cars like the 991 are very tricky to set up and requires a new approach on different tracks motec is supported and if you are a half decent driver engineer you will need it as it will help you understand what the hell is happening in your set up i ve tried and competed in many sims over the years and this one is clearly a superior product even if its limited to gt3 4 i cant think why you wouldnt want to give it a shot just leave your old helmet at home and bring anew one as the learning curve will take awhile to sink inonline driver swaps and 12 hour races are impressive and well implemented if you want the real thing no complaints with this one lads9 10
