2016 early access review i played this game with friends and solo mostly the latter and i found that both satisfied me enough to keep me going alone makes the game hell of a challenge especially to past the first horde night 7th day and yes you will die alot and give up alot but every time you play it is never the same experience playing with friends makes surviving harder due too food water depleting fast without good water sources eg lakes rivers and good hunters the team wont last long more food more cook more heat more screamers will attackpros alot of content alot of ways to play every playthrough is different fun in both solo multiplayer levelling system is good challenging enough new updates arrive oftenlycons no auto sort button for inventory chest
