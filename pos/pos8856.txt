2022 i recommend stellaris without hesitation but i want to set expectations realistically stellaris is a complex game and it doesn t have an effective built in tutorial i tried i almost gave up immediately don t do that seriously consider cuing up maxthecatfish s 2022 stellaris beginner s guide i found it on youtube and playing alongside it ideally with two monitors or a second device expect to rewind and replay expect to take two or three hours to figure it out and make big mistakes in your first few game starts it s like a board game the first bit you get mired in mechanics and it doesn t feel fluent but you will absolutely figure it out and the interface will melt away and you ll be immersed in directing your empire stellaris is to the best of my knowledge not an adventure game and not really an exploration game either don t expect in depth plot arcs or quests there are some very interesting diplomatic research archeology and broader thematic technology arcs but they are not adventures you can really lean into individually but lend depth to the overall experience this may be different with dlcs i m on the core game only stellaris isn t a much more elaborate escape velocity it s a totally different game it s played from the empire perspective not the individual perspective the battles are automated mostly so while it is technically an rts you will be watching beautifully animated battles and calling targets and movements at a fleet level not the vessel level don t expect starcraft but with space battles stellaris isn t that the game is surprisingly forgiving i freed the vassals of a much more powerful race and they closed their borders and left me alone after reclaiming the vassal s systems i eventually got surrounded by that race s own protector s who closed their borders and locked me into a few systems i got frustrated and declared war in an attempt to break out of the encirclement they destroyed everything i had including occupying my planets and starbases then they declared me in their protectorate and left me alone i was able to continue from that position and still have an enjoyable game i look at stellaris more like a board game you win some you lose some the point is having an interesting experience i haven t played online but i expect that to be challenging unless i do it with people i know all in all stellaris is less than i expected in some ways and much more in others it s better and different than i expected and i had high expectations going in
