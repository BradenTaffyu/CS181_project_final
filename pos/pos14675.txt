2020 follow our curator page alexander s club curations if you like and want to see more reviews like this one to stand the test of timewhen many fans think about civilization they re usually thinking about their favorite civilization there are similarities amongst all of them differences amongst all of them and at release all them seem to create some controversy civ5 created controversy when it moved to hexagons from squared map tiles and only allowed you to place one unit per each of those tiles and more recently civ6 s mobile game art style and city districts have caused an uproar amongst other things we ll get into through the years we ve ended up with a heralded pillar of the video game world divided up between six different iterations more if you count spin offs most of these iterations are playable today how do you choose which to play and just because you prefer one over the other does it make all others inherently bad sid meier s civilization vi a screenshot of sid meier s civilization vi by solaire bro civilization vi for whatever reason never seemed to catch on and win the fans over as others eventually did despite some holdouts i know of one person for example who still plays civ4 and refuses to leave with 10 000 hours in i m beginning to believe him does this make civ5 or civ6 bad games no they just aren t his game his civilization is civ4 in that respect sequels to civilization don t work the same way as they do in other video game franchises you don t simply move on to the next once you ve invested so much time so many turns learning the game s systems forwards and backwards it s hard to move on and that s okay you don t have to civilization games are designed so well that there s never a reason to leave pick your civ and stick with it if you want civilization ii to this day remains my favorite no one forced me to move i still have the microprose disc ready to go darwin s voyagethis game uses the same ideas as those that have came before take your civilization and stand the test of time and now not just your civilization but also your cities there s characterization that goes into each them city planning is emphasized in this generation with the advent of the district mechanic the game asks the question what do you want this city to be and from there you re going to be managing each city created based upon that question will this city be a bastion of science commerce industry faith culture once decided you will build subsequent districts that reflect that from there the macro goal becomes guiding your civilization through time the micro goal is managing each city to align with your guidance ultimately your choice is going to come down to which victory condition you want to achieve oddly the victory conditions sap some of the fun out of the game it s almost more rewarding to enter a game of civilization without a victory condition in mind simply play and figure it out as you go along of course this is much more problematic on higher difficulties however victory conditions aren t why most people play these games anyway it s all about the journey not a three picture slideshow on your diplomatic military cultural or religious victory what diplomacy sid meier s civilization vi a screenshot of sid meier s civilization vi by solaire bro ai and diplomacy almost require modding without it the game is partial to other civilizations over the player why are people blaming me for winning a war i didn t start if montezuma invaded my lands pillaged them took my border city and tried to ruin my reputation without provocation what s wrong with me doing the same thing to him or more the game doesn t consider the fact that some civilizations behave like psychopaths particularly if you have access to resources that they want they will betray you to get what they want if you don t keep a watchful eye on your borders and if they can t beat you they will hate you out of jealousy for it and always side against your interests the latter part i don t mind we see that kind of thing going on in the real world but when it comes to war eventually you re always the bad guy no matter how justified you were you are a warmonger even if your warmongering real or imagined happened ages prior civilization is a celebration sid meier s civilization vi a screenshot of sid meier s civilization vi by solaire bro what keeps bringing me back to the civilization franchise is the simplistic celebration of humanity s accomplishments and shortcomings it s never a deep dive it s surface level nationalism that doesn t come with baggage a playful exchange of differing cultural achievements under the guise of a video game and it s always done with a cute undercurrent of silliness it s honestly just exciting to create the pyramids the great wall the eiffel tower and the statue of liberty amazing to develop radio flight super highways and spacecrafts it s bizarre that we need alliances and borders terrifying that we build battleships and nuclear weapons and important that we all have our own civics and government to take all of that the good and the bad and shake your head at how remarkable it all is because it s actually real we did that everyone and civilization vi does a pretty damn good job of exploring that while also recreating however simplistically the personality of each peoples whilst time moves on through the ages i on however rudimentary of a level identify with teddy roosevelt i am american after all and when that emotionally manipulative american prairie music plays it s tapping into something it s nice that there was an honest attempt to capture the personality of each civilization and it s fun to see exactly what they come up with and how each civilization s personality meshes with the game s mechanics for example scotland doesn t like you fighting with civilizations that you share land with if you do that you and robert the bruce are going to have issues and it doesn t take a historian to figure out why this was placed in the game most people know that scotland has an actual history of warring on their own lands thus they don t like it and there are over 30 counting the dlcs civilizations meaning that there are 30 different examples of this in practice any base level history nerd will have a field day here conclusionis this civilization vi going to stand the test of time probably not by comparison there are presently several other civilizations sadly not 2 available across steam right now and each one of them is viable and unique in their own way occasionally in a better way that doesn t mean this version is bad or the wrong choice to play it s more of a question of which is preferable for right now i see myself sinking more hours into civilization vi and i say bully for me mr president 8 10 great additional details played on rtx 2080 super runs 60fps in 1440p expect to play at least 20 hours before having a solid understanding of systems playthroughs vary in length usually 8 15 hours per playthrough with very high replay value good game for newcomers has several different difficulty levels to accommodate all
