2021 early access review quick hitter review i will update it as i get deeper in the game so far this looks very solid it s a blend of factorio and satisfactory its easy to see the influence of both the difference here is the scale of it all imagine your factorio factory linked to space shipping lanes to supply and drive a whole universe the scale is awesome and a bit scary to be honest the graphics look very nice up close though like factorio being zoomed in close is an early game thing later you will be looking at planets in the way you used to view a basic mining smelting setup for early access this has a very polished feel the english translation is actually pretty good as well i plan to update this review as i delve deeper but from what i have seen of game play videos and my experience in the game this is an easy game to recommend update 4 14 23 ok after a couple more hours in 200 more nothing has changed if you like this type of game its easy to make it a member of the three must have games factorio satisfactory and now dyson sphere program
