2014 early access review with alpha 11 being the newest update for this game i can say that this is easily one of the better zombie survival games out there the crafting system is nice and zombies actually pose a decent threat when in a horde looting is always rewarding and the building mechanics are noteworthy as well overall the game is pretty good for what it is and if you want to play with friends you have the option to do that also
