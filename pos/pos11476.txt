2023 early access review i bought this game 6 years ago and while it has changed many times since my initial purchase it has remained an old faithful when i want to play a game with some friends i have never quite experienced a zombie survival like this your survival is entirely dependent on your efforts building fighting crafting the feeling you get after surviving a hoard of zombies with your friends is liberating i would say it s the game s main appeal it only falls out of favor when survival is no longer a threat you beat the game without even realizing it all that s left is an inconvenient hoard every 7 days there is no longer a point to playing i would like to see a goal besides survival something that could entertain past building fortifications perhaps escape or finding a cure a boss fight something to work towards and fill in the end game much like the forest does with it s storyline it s a great way to have closure regardless 8 10 worth the buy you wont regret it
