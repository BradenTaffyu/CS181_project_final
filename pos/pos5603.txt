2023 so i have a decent amount of hours 838 at the time of this review been playing this game on and off since the day beta came out at this point in time everyone who played the original has already bought this game so this is for those who have never played warband this game is the epitome of ignorance is bliss once you learn how to play it it is no longer fun your first 10 20 hours in this game will be amazing without any mods needed you will be running around with a little band of misfits trying to kill looters and bandits waiting for when you gather enough coin to actually take part in some serious conquest and siege some castles you finally get enough coin under your belt to gather an army large enough to take part in wars and this is when the game starts to fall apart if you could summarize bannerlord in one sentence as vast as an ocean as shallow as bird bath this game starts out as an amazing sandbox but then you realize quickly the game was actually not designed for an end game scenario by the time you start having actual battles you have figured out how to cheese the economy and now there is no issue of money anymore and you easily smash every kingdom without trying and you are stuck in a perpetual loop of run around the map chasing down enemies to steam roll their armies time after time there is no reward or satisfaction in it by the time you start your the major battles the game is on easy mode no matter the difficulty if you don t want to destroy the entire world without trying you have to handicap yourself there is no ai character interaction the world is lifeless the gameplay is souly this form a band of soldiers run around and smash everything this can be fun for a time but gets boring quickly interactions with enemies are bland they added some voice lines but the issue is there are 3 possible outcomes to every encounter i will not explain them as it would ruin the appeal for first time players interactions with every npc is even less limited you get a wife congrats all you can do is play a board game against her or wait in the town she is in and have children which serves absolutely no purpose that s it your entire option for interaction is a board game mods do not increase the longevity of this game mods are nearly non existent taleworlds has made it their main goal that instead of adding end game content or content in general they instead make every update break every mod and have made the modding community give up you can go look at the workshop right now and see hundreds of mods just scroll to the comments every mod s comment will be broken please update or does this work in 2 xx if you find two mods that look amazing chances are they only work on separate patches so you load version 1 7 for this mod but in order to play the other mod you need version 1 93 and the mods will not work together due to this issue for example you want some muskets and napoleon gameplay style people made those mods because that sounds insanely fun just like napoleonic wars mod for warband the two mods that were created with muskets are both dead because the creators got tired of taleworlds breaking their mods every 2 weeks and the largest issue is taleworlds is clearly expecting the modding community to make the content for them there has been no major changes since release it s the exact same form your army smash everything repeat with no content since the beginning any time a mod tries to add quality of life taleworlds makes sure to bring an update to brake the mod and the updates do nothing for the game seriously an update will break every mod and talewords only changed the caravans income growth from 2 years to be profitable to 2 1 years the most asinine changes that no one cares about breaks every mod in the game the multiplayer is stale and bland welcome to the game of ping is everything you have ping higher than 10 congrats you will lose majority of your battles despite your skill with the combat system so choreographed it makes ping the deciding factor for example with a proper swing and moving your character you can make a swing that takes 1 10th of a second to hit instead of the 1 4 second its supposed to so you have a ping of 40ms this means you have 60ms to to recognize the attack and it s direction to block which is superhuman reaction time a ping of 100ms means anyone who knows how to fight will hit you before you can even have an opportunity to block the multiplayer is dead and boring so again great game if you want to play it but once you learn the game it will be boring this game does not reward learning it the second you learn this game is the second it is no longer fun if you like the concept of this game and do not care about graphics get warband not bannerlord it s 20x better than bannerlord the world is more alive the mods are immense the character interactions with it are far more in depth and the end game context exists the game would be amazing but talewords does not focus on endgame content and has a weird sadistic obsession with breaking any mod that comes out for the game so why do i recommend it despite hating the game i loved the part in the game where i didn t understand what it was for the first 100 hours of the game it was amazing the next 700 hours has been chasing the dragon that doesn t exist all taleworlds would have to do is make end game content a thing make is so when you get big and strong companions you didn t recruit start to ambush you in cities and try to assassinate you that nations will form up together in coalitions to take you out or even just make some npc interactions i do not need voice overs i am completely fine reading a wall of text but make the end game world have some life in it
