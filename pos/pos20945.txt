2015 this is basically an interactive point and click story based choice and consequence game it s a mixture of gone home and the walking dead it has a captivating warm lightening system bloomy atmosphere and beautiful soundtrack with amazing story twists overall very beautifull game although i m not a fan of this airbrushed textures but it somehow fits the vibe of the game 9 10 because of the bad lip syncing already can t wait for the next episode i really wana know what is going to happen
