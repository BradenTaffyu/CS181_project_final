2019 the most calming beautiful and well designed game i have yet played even a vegan could enjoy walking the trails through the parks taking photos of the animals animal behaviors feel natural and animations apart from a few flukes are extremely smooth some of the shooting mechanics are a little rough i d like to be able to adjust windage and elevation on my scopes but that s a small complaint most of the firearms are beautifully modeled and feel real though limited capacities 3 shells in a full length semiauto 20 guage are unnecessary and annoying the story arcs are emotional and thought provoking especially those that touch on environmental concerns the only thing that could make this game better is the occasional bigfoot peeking at you from behind a tree
