2020 i absolutely adore this game i was lucky enough to not buy the game in the early days and i have sympathy for all those who feel cheated from the initial promises but i feel that f76 more than lives up to everything it promised to be and more the new perk system works astonishingly well too so much so that i immensely prefer it over the original gunplay is sayisfying and the game always seems to throw new surprises my way it s worth a purchase for sure doubly so when it s discounted
