2017 this is the game you ll never finish it s really not even a game but a platform for endless content within the provided settings it takes a decent machine to run well but if you put in some effort there is nothing like arma out there if you re patient and willing to learn then this should be in your library if you re expecting 200fps and everything handed to you and games make you rage look else where dlcs are optional but worth it if you don t want them no problem 1000s of mods to get the experience you want if you can t find the mod you want make it your self
