2016 a white phantom invaded my game while i was fighting some enemies he watched from afar clapping and lying down as i ungraciously beat everything around me to death once i was done i approached the phantom he bowed and two handed a shield i bowed as well and two handed my greatshield we fought using only our shields nothing around us but the sound of clanking and tiny blood spurts as we slowly damaged each other in the end i was victorious but i will never forget you kind shield man
