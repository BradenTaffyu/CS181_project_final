2021 early access review though teardown is early access as i write this review i ran into no bugs that i can recall i sunk about 25 hours into the current campaign mode the old building problem through flooding i have score of 100 objectives completed i m missing 6 objectives from villa gordon missions and 1 objective from hollowrock island i have maxed all my tool upgrades the game has been both fun and challenging to get to this point there are two basic mission types destroy a thing and steal the things steal the things missions come in a couple different flavors but the most common flavor is that each thing is tethered to an alarm which will give you 60 seconds to complete the mission if you steal the thing there are also a few other miscellaneous missions that don t fit the destroy a thing or steal the things modes my favorite misc mission was the racing challenge there are a lot of vehicles to choose from but after i figured out what i was doing i was able to get down to 15 seconds and change blowing away the 30 25 and 20 second objectives it felt good when i cracked it that s a recurring theme the missions are puzzles there are some obvious approaches which either cannot succeed or you won t be able to get all the objectives coming up with clever solutions that can knock out every single objective is incredibly rewarding when a mission is completed there will be a little top down replay drawing your path from when an alarm went off until escape it can be mesmerizing to watch between missions you go to an old warehouse safe house which slowly gets restored as you progress in the game exploring the warehouse the farm on the property and the changing landscape of vehicles tells a story without words there is a story with words on the tv telling of your most recent escapade it seems like the exact report depends on what you did during the previous mission for example each mission that i used a timed explosive charge the report noted neighbors hearing loud noises it s a little bit of flavor that adds a lot to the experience after an hour or two of sandbox i found out i can bring the games framerate to about 5 or 6 fps it was an intentional choice to blow up a very large 3 4 floor hotel into the smallest pieces i could manage i didn t see any noticable fps hits during my actual game play tl dr the game feels solid the missions are clever puzzles with good level design the destruction is deeply satisfying the safe house is a nice place to kick back and explore i look forward to the rest of the mission content the developer could easily release teardown now with the current level of stability they could either patch or dlc the future missions into the game later it sounds like they re going to stay in early access until the full set of content is built and released
