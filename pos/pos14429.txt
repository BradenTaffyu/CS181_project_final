2023 early access review having a blast with this game the gameplay is really fleshed out so it is hard to believe it is still in early access the user interface and tutorial information seems complete it is fun making the production chains and the artwork is beautiful even down to the conveyor belts at night the game is slow paced and after 50 hours i am still trapped in my home solar system it s a great chill base building game with no time challenges dexterity challenges enemies or even much puzzle solving i created a planet wide factory on an ubuntu linux desktop computer with steam s proton compatibility software the game requires a lot of computing power and my system sometimes had trouble handling the graphics while flying between planets otherwise i had no other technical issues really happy with this purchase and i feel this is totally worth the price for those who want to tinker on virtual machines
