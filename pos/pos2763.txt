2018 a masterpieceit took me around 100 hours to finish the game the world of rivellon is both big and alluring it was a joy to explore every single corner of it each battle was challenging fun made me use different tactics and i never got tired of fighting the game balances roleplaying and combat perfectly in some rpgs the combat is fine but the story and characters are what keep you playing however in original sin 1 i didn t really care for the story while original sin 2 kept me interested at all times it really improves on the lore roleplaying and combat it s definitely a good sequel and one of the best games of 2017 i only have two complaints romance had no effect on the ending and the amount of puzzles in the game it would have taken me a lot more than 100 hours to finish the game because of the puzzles now don t get me wrong the puzzles are all interesting and well executed there are some simple puzzles moderate and very hard ones i just don t have too much time to play video games and since there are so many puzzles in the game i had to resort to using google way more than i d like to admit now the romance and with it some minor spoilers ahead i decided to romance lohse at the end of the game she asked me if i would like to travel the world with her and i can t answer her all i can do is end the conversation and in the final cutscene the narrator tells me that she spent the rest of her life traveling rivellon alone just dissapointing but what is the game about what s the story like you have the ability to use source a powerful and outlawed magic magic used by the gods themselves it s what gives them power the game starts with you being captured by magisters who hunt and imprison everyone who can use source they take you to an isolated prison island while there you make new friends discover an unbelievable truth about yourself and make interesting alliances while trying to escape the island you will meet dragons witches paladins underground fighting arenas demons trolls ghosts and much much more you will also uncover conspiracies and astonishing secrets will you be the new divine the game itself plays alot like the recent xcom games it s basically a turn based roleplaying game not to worry tho you can still create a custom character and choose their stats race gender and origin story or you can simply choose one of the pre made characters there s a wide variety of classes to choose from as well all your favourate melee ranged and magic classes are there it also has steam workshop and modders have made some really interesting class mods that are worth checking out however if you enable mods you are not able to earn achivements this in my humble opinion is a bit foolish it s a singleplayer game and i should be allowed to have my fun however i want the trainers still work and it has no leaderboards in it so i don t really support disabling achivements for mod users it s a minor complaint but a complaint nonetheless the game is well optimised and ran at a solid 60 frames per second at all times i did experience two crashes during my playthrough but other than that i really didn t notice any other bugs or issues visually the game is lovely to look at and the soundtrack is marvelous don t go into it expecting remarkable next gen graphics though it s a game i most definitely won t forget any time soon i want a sequel and i want it now a must play for every roleplaying fan and fans of the turn based genre should give it a go as well well done larian studios well done
