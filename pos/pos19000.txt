imagine being limited to an 18 month dev cycle and still producing something that s several magnitudes better than bethesda s own fallout entries which were given a much longer and more lenient time to develop it s no coincidence that this game is the only genuinely consistently good fallout game to release after 1 and 2 considering obsidian had some leftovers from the teams that worked on those two games
