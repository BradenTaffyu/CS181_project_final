2021 this is a really fantastic crpg and a must play if you enjoy that genre of games it has taken the solid foundations laid in dos1 and built successfully on that to make a really enjoyable game while i enjoyed dos1 initially as it had a strong start i never finished it as i found it got weaker as the game progressed and i lost interest dos2 on the other hand manages to stay consistently good throughout the game it has a couple of frustrating sections and a few difficulty spikes at different points but it mostly manages to maintain a good level of quality as you progress through the combat in this game i feel is one of it s strongest points it is a turn based style of combat where you move your characters around the combat area to take out opponents a lot of games have this type of combat but dos2 just kind of blows them out of the water there are environmental based hazards that can be already present or created by your characters and enemies through spells grenades or flasks it adds a whole new layer to the combat and clever use of these hazards can turn the tide in an encounter for example you could destroy an oil barrel near your enemies and then ignite it with a fire spell to damage your them and force them to move or throw a water balloon and then hit the wet patch to shock a group of enemies there s loads of possibilities and it adds a whole creative level to combat the character development is quite fluid and you can easily spec characters to what ever build you like there s even a special mirror that becomes available early in the game that allows you to respec characters if you want once you develop your characters and learn new combat skills it makes the combat a lot more fun as you increase the options available to you in combat skills are useful out of combat too for example using a teleport spell to teleport out of reach objects closer to you which gives you more options to be more creative in how you explore and complete objectives i did really like how this game fully leans in to allowing the player to be more creative with their solutions the quests are also fantastic and most have a variety of ways to complete them as well as several outcomes outcomes can also affect later quests you do it s worth talking to npcs or hunting out notes on a few occasions i would find an inconspicous note left on a table or floor that would contain an important piece of information for a quest of course you could completely miss that note and go on to complete the quest another way it s kind of impressive how intricate the quest design is the maps in the game are also great and every area you visit is worth exploring as much as you can you might find hidden treasure a new quest or a secret entrance the map environments are often colourful and beautiful which is nice as i ve played quite a few crpgs that go for a more dreary drab environments if there were a couple of areas to criticise then inventory management would be one of them there are attempts to ease this a bit as you can autosort items and filter them by weapons or magic items for example but despite this i did find managing my inventory to still be a tedious task at times one other criticism i have and it s something i ve noticed in both dos games is the disconnect between your main character and the rest of your party when initiating conversations with npc s there is no input from party members you can actually switch control to another party member and initiate conversation with the same npc and they just start the conversation as if speaking to that character for the first time again interactions between your character and party member is limited mainly to when your doing a quest specific to that party member the one benefit is that if you fail a speech check you can just retry with another character i guess this disconnect is a consequence of making the game playable in co op but it sort of feels a bit odd when playing singleplayer this is just a very minor criticism though overall though i think dos2 is a fantastic game as someone who ended up bouncing of the first game i was hooked on this one and thats because it feels like a big improvement and just a really good game overall i would definitely recommend giving this a try
