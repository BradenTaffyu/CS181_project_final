2016 tl dr below the good meaningful and plentiful choices the quests and stories especially the main one actually made me stop and ponder for a while what i wanted to do so many things to talk about with so many characters the role playing system the environments are pretty nice the dlcs are amazing and worth playing many interesting and engaging characters you get to be the mailman who delivers death the lack of level scaling an ending which didn t infuriate me unlike fallout 3 and to some extent fallout 4 you can get a house with various appliances that talk to you including a seedy machine that seeds soil using seeds moddable perks perks perks companions and their provided perks ed e is the best the physics are hilarious at times many things to do the world and all the interesting stories you can find note that almost all the problems listed below apply to fallout 3 as well strange eh biggest issue in the game the karma system is really bad i really wish they had opted for scrapping the general karma system and instead only had faction reputation you may encounter the brotherhood of steel bos while exploring the wasteland if you find their bunker through sheer coincidence even they will demand that you surrender and will put an explosive collar on you to put you on trial if you resist they turn hostile and will try to kill you killing them in responce will incur negative karma i find it strange that the creators of the game create a situation where they as a some sort of objective arbitrator of right and wrong say defending yourself against this action is wrong additionally say you murder the entire bos chapter that s what their groups are called be it through another faction demanding you do so and you abiding or because you decide to you may incur some severe karma loss for this action however you can repent how do you repent by killing more people that are deemed evil by the game s creators such as fiends humanoid always hostile and feral ghouls monsters what murdering 12 13 bos members and letting the rest die in an atomic explosion in the bunker incurs karma penalties that can be undone by killing 7 members of the fiends additionally this makes it really hard to play a evil character by the game s definition of evil character as you may have to fight enemies that give you positive karma for killing them this game would ve been better off without this system just like the mass effect series other major problems crashes lots of them may be caused by me modding the game however i didn t run too many mods i had 10 3 of them graphical 7 of them minor gameplay changes other wasn t too much of a problem as the game autosaves all the time while the dialogue system is extensive and great i really wish there were some more options to speak out against authorities in the respective factions when you re on their side to influence them a bit more glitches all over the place including some rare ones that makes your game get stuck playing through as legion yields very few quests minor problems the ai can be kind of bad sometimes things like these happen occasionally this npc is stuck behind an open door won t close it a screenshot of fallout new vegas by tzer0 other problems include characters not following you through doors if you re supposed to go somewhere with them always let them go through first companions running in front of you during gunfights lily is very prone to this somewhat annoying as she goes invisible if you re sneaking and enemies have strange reactions to stealth attacks such as not responding to the fact that someone next to them transformed into a red mist and associated bits of flesh and bones on the floor graphics are somewhat dated while fallout 4 is accused of being a superhero simulator fair accusation you can sort of get the same thing going in this game quite easily as well certain combos when creating a character gives you a truly godlike character compared to the alternatives one of the keys is to go with 8 endurance and get a 9th point through lonesome road early game you can take a lot of hits late game you get 1 to all special stats passive regen and additional damage threshold but you need 8 end or waste perk points through investing in intensive training to do this slightly better balance could ve been achieved if the number of implants you could get wasn t determined by your end you can t hotkey turbo or implant grx both give a slow motion effect without a mod and sometimes during combat you can t bring your pip boy up i want the hear the stealth suit s voice but i don t want it to apply med x or stimpacks automatically got a med x addiction because of this the only solution was to install a mod that disables the voice completely some design related issues this holds true for at least non hardcore mode stimpacks are disproportionally better than everything else healing wise they heal insantly and they do not weigh anything at all food weighs does not heal instantly and may also give you some rads rads are mostly a redundant as a mechanic except for one place in lonesome road that is optional and for characters with some perks that may choose to incur radiation poisoning on purpose the crafting system is meh the physics may do strange things like this physics a screenshot of fallout new vegas by tzer0 all of this is frozen some invisible walls here and there some items labeled as things you can only steal an action which incurs very minor karma loss when they belong to an opposing faction one final very minor problem poorly placed outpost a screenshot of fallout new vegas by tzer0 this outpost is one of the worst things i ve seen if like three enemies with some grenades and maybe a grenade launcher attacked this place from the position i m standing in everyone would be wiped out in seconds more screenshots can be found here in some ways but worth the playthrough as it is a lot of fun
