2017 what does it mean to be human this is the central theme of the game nier automata shows the flaws and good sides of humanity in an universe where machine lifeforms reign over the earth and an army of androids in form of the so called resistance and yorha try to take it back for humanity in an universe where you only hear about humans and humans ultimately take the backseat machine lifeforms and androids are the only protagonists of this game some topics which are adressed in the game some more in an abstract way some more obvious religion bonds existential questions the hardship of finding a meaning in your own life inability to deal with emotional pain social pressure beauty ideals misconception of beauty bipolarity of humanity being cruel to each other in the most horrid ways but also being affectionate to each other selfishness the pain of losing someone dear and the consequences on ones state of mind the delivery of messages in this game is exceptional for nowadays videogame standards for me nowadays most videogames are very unmemorable becoming mere consumables which can easily be replaced by other newer games of the same genre nier automata though knows how to use its own medium to its full potential i didnt get emotional about videogames in years but this game pushed alot of the right buttons for me it created situations where i could relate through my own life experiences the game has its funny cute sad and shocking mind boggling moments the presentation of the game is also quite stylish the combat and charming for instance 9s helping you in configuring and explaining you the game settings you can clearly see that the devs had fun in creating this game one thing i also really like is the switch between different playing styles sometimes the game switches to bullethell segments which brings a new flavour to your rpg experience also the music is amazing next to its predecessor the original nier nier automata has my favorite videogame soundtrack the dynamic music is also wonderful for instance the music in the the intro chapter broken wings was also the reason why i kept going and didnt give up it took me 3 hours on hard to finish it and you kinda guess how frustrating it must have been for me dying over and over again but there are also some problems i have with the game i wished they had fleshed out some characters some more giving us more background information or letting us interact with them some more overall the game is really tight in a good way but some characters could have been more meaty in the story department some characters feel more like side characters then actual important characters which they should be storywise because of their role in the game also the scaling of enemies is kinda funky imo at some point in the story the enemies should actually be always scaled appropriately to your own level you become easily overleveled on hard by doing all the sidequests which is kinda disappointing also being able to buy a ton of healing items dumb the game down and make it too easy at some point because you can easily spam healing items especially late game it becomes a problem when you are at such a high level that there are barely any enemies anymore who can one shot you a better design of the healing system is a thing i would have wished for also a thing which really bothers me is the horrendous pc support of se and platinum there is still no official patch out not even a hotfix which fixes the whitescreen problem and resolution problems its embarassing because the modder kaldaien fixed these problems in a few days big thx to kaldaien for his far mod it really helped me enjoying this game more and fixed the glaring performance issues i had with the game i could play the game with silky smooth 60fps most of the time the least i ve got were 55 fpsmy system specs win 7r290xintel xeon e3 1230 v316gb ramthe link to the steam thread where you can get the mod which improves the performance of the game far modtldr the game is really unique and you shouldn t miss out on it best game i ve played in years with alot of interesting themes if the game is too expensive for you at the moment get it when it becomes cheaper its worth every penny
