2017 early access review to be honest fps games aren t my fort i am unbelieveably awful at them so at first the fact that slime rancher itself was a fps game almost steered me away from playing it boy i m glad it didn t though because as i played through the game i soon realized that slime ranchers didn t require the percision or have the pressure that other fps games have which was incredibly relieving it was like playing harvest moon or stardew valley which i consider to be relaxing games aside from that the soundtrack is great and there are a lot of opportunities to explore in and outside the ranch especially since this is an early access game and there will be more to explore as the game develops
