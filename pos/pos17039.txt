2020 tl dr new player learns you can pause during campaign battles to learn proper movements formations i m a total noob when it comes to anything that resembles a civ game after watching so so many how to videos on youtube and several hours reading unit cards i m finally starting to get a hold of this game from a noob perspective trying to learn the army controls the best advice i can give a fellow new player is that you can pause during campaign battles just fiddling around with army formations hotkeys reading spells on the fly every thing can be queued up and ready for the ensuing battle all the pressure of learning the game while learning the hotkeys and proper mechanics goes away pause helped me learn this game instead of always feeling pressured into making decisions the more i learn about the game the more i love it i ll be playing this for several hundred more hours to go can t wait to do all the campaigns let alone all the multiplayer when i get to that skill level
