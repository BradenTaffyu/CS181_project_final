2019 now don t get me wrong this game has fantastic graphics simply superb handling and physics great realism like engine and gearbox damage and overall just feels great to drive but and there s a big but it s disheartening to go to the vehicle screen and find a vast majority of the cars locked behind a dlc paywall and i mean vast the website shows all the cars and has a disclaimer that and i quote directly please note that some of the models listed below are available as additional purchasable dlc how about please note most of these models are available as additional purchasable dlc that would be far more accurate for some manufacturers only 3 of the 10 listed cars are available in the base game and this is the normal state not the exception to the rule i d assume most of the people reviewing this have bought the deluxe edition because very few mention this at all now i don t mind some dlc in fact i recently bought project cars 2 deluxe with all the dlc but at least the base game there had a heap of cars available to use so let me re iterate this is a fantastic racing game let down by an egregious dlc paywall for the cars i d still recommend it as a racing simulation but just beware of what you are getting yourself into
