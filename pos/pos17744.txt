there are plenty of good reasons to be mad at creative assembly but i don t think this is one of them coming from a longstanding fan of classical total war titles pharaoh honestly surprised me everyone told me this game sucked until i played it and got hooked honestly one of the more stable and balanced launches of any total war title to date and the studio seems to be quickly fixing many of the issues and imbalances that marred its launch tl dr try it yourself and give it a chance most of the hate is coming from people who are just mad that creative assembly hasn t made medieval 3 yet
