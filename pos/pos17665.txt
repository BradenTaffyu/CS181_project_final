2018 i m not a big fan of historical total war series a fan of civilizations though but this game made me really love ca and total war in general great combination of tactical tbs and gorgeous rts fights with various warhammer fantasy units tons of fun to play for each faction solo and co op yeah there are dlcs with new playable races and some people don t like that personally i d rather pay even more if it helps to release new great content faster i don t regret a single dollar spent for such great experience and many additional hours of playing in conclusion if you like warhammer universe or 4x strategies in general and ready to play real time massive gorgeous lotr style battles now and again you will like this game i m sure total war warhammer 2 has been released already but for now first game has more content than second part alone it has mortal empire campaign though that basicly merges two games together if you own them both so if you ll squeeze out all you can from this one it will transfer all content that you already have to the next level with even bigger map new ways to play the old world s races and fight against enemies from the new world as well really love to see that some developers still support their products for long term goals such as constantly improving world newly released really well done playable races new features for old ones some good content is avalible from flcs as well and there will be total war warhammer 3 too with the same merging system so replayability is improving exponentially for me it s really great singleplayer and even better co op experience if you have a friend to play with thereby i can only recommend this game and hope that you will have as much fun as did i
