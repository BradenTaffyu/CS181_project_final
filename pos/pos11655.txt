2018 early access review i have played this game for 309 hours at the time of this post i have owned it for 2 years and i think this is a great game sure there are ways to say that people could make it better and the devs could release a17 sooner rather than later but i loved this game since a15 up to now at a16 4 the crafting is great and you can make it as easy or as challenging as you want it to be my friends and i play on a private server i run all the time the best part is if we get caught in another game and we come back to this we can just start playing there isnt a trying to figure out how to replay the game phase seriously a solid 10 out of 10 in my eyes i even own it on ps4 now ps4 could use an update but it s still a great game
