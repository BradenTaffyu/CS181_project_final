2017 definitely a chill game but perhaps too chill the sounds and graphics are superb the physics seem pretty well done and the scenery is fairly authentic i m sure if you become a master to the point everything is stupid easy a cdl beyond the cost is not tricky to get to make a career being a transporter raking in the money however this is where it might be generating some false hopes if it s anything i could complain about is the missed opportunities galore the weigh stations the rest stops the cops nothing really happens besides affecting money time stats even when you wreck there s no visible damage which really breaks immersion the most immersive part is being tired hearing the yawns and dimming light i end up getting tired in real life but i don t even get to use the back of my sleeper cab besides look at it from the driver seat i don t even get to load my stuff onto the trailer and check straps and locks electric and pneumatic connections etc and the danger that ensues when you don t bother i just wonder why there s a total lack of drama beyond the little sound effects of siren and losing money besides the base game shortcomings here are just a few examples the game should be able to entertain in some kind of expansions cop stops and their inspections a running record of offenses after making a hard turn the doors on your box trailer fly open and all of the cargo flies out creating chaos at the intersection and otherwise volatile cargo that can explode or dump slick oil or liquid nitrogen etc getting stuck at rr crossing the skeezy greasy spoon diners and bars blaring old country the horses 4ss bosses that you have to report to some overpasses that have low clearance that can smash the top of your trailer offa gang of truckers looking to box you in and run your hind off the road because you didn t give them the proper respect they think they deserve answering making call to significant others to let them know you re still alive and will be back in time for christmas etc blow you re offered to smuggle to make next months rent for your baby momma choice of buying meth from some dealer to stay up an extra 30 hours but you didn t expect hallucinating the machine elves crawling up all the power poles a couple dozen deaths from jackknifing on the highway and all of the medical expenses you re going to get sued for doped up hooker hitch hiker trying to wave their knife in your eye after you ask them to leave some top secret load you re not told about and you end up getting involved as an expendable in some black op missionwhatever else that makes for good bar storymaybe i m being ridiculous and stereotypical but surely we should know these types of things would really make the game explode as there is plenty of real life examples happening beyond where all anyone ever cares about is just going from point a to point b in certain time without certain damage i would just like to see some missions story mode ability for mods workshop to expand upon not necessarily made only by the devs that more closely resemble the trials and tribulations of a humble truck driver trying to make a living in a rough world beyond maneuvering a truck and otherwise allowing for taking a crack at those high stress scenes in those movies and news stories we ve all seen involving trucking i give it a thumbs up because it s definitely not a bad game especially on sale price for 5 7 or whatever it is but there s a lot more potential to be had i wouldn t mind picking up some dlc that went more of this direction than simply truck and region options which there s more than plenty of
