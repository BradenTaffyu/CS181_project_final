2016 don t really understand the negative reviews for this game i guess most of them come from fallout veterans but being an absolute newb to the series i played ten hours or so of new vegas but that s not really much is it i absolutely love fallout 4 the only real gripe i have about it is how it s not really optimized for pc when it comes to things like crafting within settlements but after some getting used to it i didn t even mind the kind of crappy crafting system much anymore everything else graphics music story companion characters feeling as if your choices in the wasteland actually matter the unique feel of the various weapons voice acting character building everything else is most certainly up to par i can t wait to go through the game with multiple characters so replay value also totally there long story short fallout newbs come on in and get this game veterans sorry some of you were disappointed but plenty of us enjoyed the game just fine
