2018 i played theme hospital on playstation and later on pc back when it was the big thing ocassionally returning to it over the years because it was an enjoyable game i have previously tried some theme hospital inspired games but nothing really pushed the same buttons as the original game enter two point hospital i pretty much just fell into the game and landed on my feet it s a whole new game but very nostalgic at the same time it feels like a true sequil to theme hospital and i would recomend it to anyone who played and enjoyed the original game i would call this the sequel to theme hospital we ve all been waiting for at the same time while recapturing the feel of theme hospital the graphics and gameplay have been modernised to the point where even if you didn t play theme hospital but enjoy playing simulation type games i would recomend you try this game
