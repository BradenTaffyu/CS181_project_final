2019 i get apocalyptic visions playing this stardew valley allows the player to enjoy the life of a farmer without the drudgery of actually comitting to all that a life of soil entails it is the synthesized experience just at the cost of all the heartfelt extrasensory stuff that would otherwise make said toil worth it there is no fresh air for you the player it is implied the food you grow to enrich the community and pallate is processed and cooked instantly but hardly of use to the player the same way as it would owning a real farm jean baudrillard describes in simulacra and simulation 1981 how an emulated experience can and will supersede the reality of what it simulates if said reality is good enough at filling the same needs gaps in our hearts souls hours in other words there is might not be any real loss loosing the dirt under the nails authentic experience of farming if we are provided with a simulation that properly pushes our buttons and we were really into it not for the extra sensory rewards of say fresh produce in the first place synthetic experiences are by their very nature more pure and efficient even as they remove and reduce the experience they simulate by removing sensational outliers be they good or bad stardew valley is in this way perhaps better at fulfilling the fantasy of farming than real farming could ever be all the same however it is only a simulation and poor in lasting experiences real farming life would be rife with with all this the same question keeps rolling over in my head on and on why am i so satisfied with this you denominate and play as a person traveling to the countryside to enact change in their lives to breathe clear air and to do something meaningful with with themselves in the game you get your lot in order begin farming and perhaps some light animal husbandry while getting to know the locals and integrating yourself as part of the community none of this actually put fresh air in the players lungs allow them to befriend new people or even eat fresh produce the sense of accomplishment for this is left however perhaps stronger than it would be in real life as the achievement of weeks or months are destilled into hours of playtime the simulated experience can take liberties with the less favorable parts of the lifestyle caring for animals is reduced to petting and harvesting cutting weeds is done in determined swoops talking to your neighbors in the jrpg fashion where listening to short snippets of their life removes any chance of the small social mishaps so common in reality is that enough is the context of video game simulation enough to settle for this over the real thing this is what has me worried often today we are asked to make concessions of quality to manage to eke out enough catharsis to survive week to week or even for some people day to day much of the way modern life is organized is directly harmful to both our physical and mental health the enivronment and long term survivability if context is all it takes to become complacent then there is nothing stopping us from creating rationalizations for similar concessions of function or form part of baudrillard s discussion of simulacra is specifically that a simulation can become reality if it is good enough enough settling for less if the cut out bits are unwanted is in fact more robotics similarly to the stardew experience allow the owner to keep the best parts of a labour force while also cutting out the extraneous awkward aspects that makes for a less effective work environment a robot does not want need rights currently and does not complain about or demand better working conditions in such an instance the ratio between human ingenuity problem solving and flexibility and effective uncomplaining perpetuity becomes purely economic scaling away the human elements of a workforce is in fact good economy as it more effectively produces the dopamine of the economy ie money the goods quality is perhaps not inconsequential similarly stardew valley is a good game but again quality needs to be weighed against the ratio that produces the most dopamine meaning that trimming quality real air real fresh produce can and will be the most effective alternative when or if the goal is to experience the most painless route to the goal stardew valley is perhaps better at farming than actual farming from a pure dopamine perspective just as cocaine is better at having fun than taking the time to do enjoyable things and robots are better than humans at working and making money and that scares the living out of me
