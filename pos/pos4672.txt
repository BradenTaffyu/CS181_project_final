this isn t exactly a controversial opinion among fallout people but here goes bethesda s fallout 4 is a super fun open world sandbox aaa title and a terrible fallout game if you re still on the fence about it or want to know more i ll try to outline both points below fallout 4 the terrible fallout gameif you re a die hard fan of the cain sawyer and avellone fallout trilogy comprised of fallout fallout 2 and new vegas let this is a terrible sequel be your primary takeaway where those games are characterized by a breadth of robust and consequential roleplaying choices excellent character writing and a coherent vision of what a rebuilding society would look like after a nuclear world war fallout 4 pointedly lacks all of these things the player character nate nora is fully voiced and characterized meaning that the dozens of alternate dialogue options from prior games have been pruned down into i agree i agree sarcastically i don t agree but actually i agree and i ll agree later the hallmarks of every post bioware action rpg with few exceptions most notably the excellent robot detective nick valentine the characters are underwritten sporting exactly one played to the hilt note like gumshoe newsie or baseball guy this is when the game bothers to give its characters a complete concept at all in particular at least two faction head characters preston garvey of the minutemen and father of the institute feel like they have no meaningful guiding philosophy beyond a loosely associated aesthetic which is inexcusable when these are the big good and the big bad of the entire story respectively fallout 4 s equally terrible storythe aforementioned story begins when nate nora a vault dweller has his or her son kidnapped by a mysterious organization called the institute he or she ventures out into the wastes in search of their son and in so doing discovers a four way faction conflict with four associated endings the first faction the player has the opportunity to join is the minutemen who have no characterization at all beyond dress old timey and are the good guys the other three factions are ideological rivals over a central blade runner esque are robots people question the mysterious institute you see likes to murder people and then replace them with synths lifelike robots why they re doing this is never answered coherently within the entire text of the main story multiple institute characters have voice lines stating entirely different reasons for this pod people plot one insists that it s for a captive workforce another for political compliance and a third that it s for genocidal warfare in case you want to fight for a cause that not even its own adherents can meaningfully explain to you though you can join the institute in any case despite the synths having no compelling reason to exist in the first place the brotherhood of steel is here under a new edgy leader and their answer to the synth question is complete robot genocide this may be shocking to players of fallout 3 who expected the brotherhood to be the good guys but is mostly in line with their prior jarhead douche characterization from 2 nv opposing the brotherhood are the railroad as in the underground railroad this faction seeks to end synth slavery the game never confronts the metaphorical problem that african slaves unlike the synths were not pod people who murder and replace their originals before you can join the faction leader makes you swear that robot lives are more important than human lives and you d kill yourself if it meant a robot could live i m thoroughly unclear on how laughably unreasonable the writers intended this statement to be because this is bethesda fallout the story always ends with one or more of the factions getting a nuclear bomb dropped on them and fan favorite robot liberty prime shows up because why not with one exception you re better off ignoring the story of this game that exception is the brilliant dlc far harbor which has a nuanced antagonist offer what the main game lacks an extremely compelling and well written argument for the institute s villainous motivations this is especially bizarre because the institute does not appear in far harbor fallout 4 the super fun sandbox gamein strong contrast fallout 4 is probably bethesda s most fun and engaging world since skyrim and maybe even morrowind the environment artists combat designers and sidequest writers the unsung heroes of this game have immaculately captured a compelling vibe the vibe is comprised of two halves a dense aesthetic understanding of what makes fallout look and feel fallouty and the sort of absolute reverence for its geographic location that also characterized fallout 3 although fallout 4 is weirdly missing the boston accent its boston is rich with new england history and culture and it s very clear that the whoever designed the world was having an absolute blast taking colonial americana and finding out how to blend it in with the jetsons esque 1950s retrofuturism of the fallout verse in a lot of places actually in all of them this makes no sense why is the city still comprised exclusively of mad max bottlecap bartertowns built onto recognizable boston landmarks when this game is the furthest into the future and thus the ostensible rebuilding of society that fallout has ever gone why are the super mutants here beyond a handwave about errr uhhh the institute also made super mutants for some reason why are the enclave still showing up albeit in a cameo capacity when they ve been completely destroyed in like three games now why are all of the mutant animals still recognizably west coast animals rather than anything indigenous to new england the answers to all of these questions and more are the same it s because of the fallout vibes this is fallout at its most purely aesthetic it s the best looking and best sounding fallout game by a landslide and not just because of its graphical bona fides or its art design because the roleplaying and story are so terrible the game had to put its budget into fresh mechanics and boy does the gunplay feel good for the first time in arguably the entire history of the franchise the leveling system allows you to level infinitely absolutely throwing to the wayside any of the struggles of building wrong in the prior games in favor of letting you become an unstoppable endlessly improving god king of the wasteland lastly the power armor in this game totally bops unlike in previous titles you start the game with a highly customizable suit that you tinker with like your personal jalopy all game long on top of that if you re not content with the highly aesthetic mad max gimmick settlements that the game already has there s a robust system of rust or ark style player housing that allows you to build your own themed scrapyards and populate them with npcs from the ground up some of the dlcs add automation and switchboard features so you can even turn your fallout 4 into a kind of inbred sibling to factorio if you really want in conclusionin short fallout 4 is fallout as a theme park it s a curated selection of thrill rides and clap because you recognize it kids brand iconography that will keep you entertained for dozens of repeat visits if you let it it s not tolstoy but did you really expect that this is bethesda fallout it s the best bethesda fallout but it s bethesda fallout it s fun and dumb
