2018 i had missed all the controversy surrounding this game recently as a history buff i must say i still dont care this game is great and so what if they keep updating it it shows that they are still willing to work on a game with several other successor games on the market the progress this game has made has made me very happy i have had experienced this game from day 1 and to throw all the fun away because of some pr statement or in the name of accuracy is a silly thing do not kill your joy over some odd female generals and a psuedo insult that didnt even seem to be intended by a couple shmucks running pr in corporate we are all assumingly adults here lets take what we got and get the most joy out of it 10 10 my favorite game by far and the changes have only made me enjoy it more even after 500 hours ty have a good one
