2015 overall i would say i enjoyed the game however i do feel it was somewhat of a let down in terms of rpg elements the dialogue choices don t really have a huge impact the companions aren t that great either imo i ended up using nick valentine the most just because i hate hacking computer terminals more often than not though the companions just got in the way also there was a part in the main quest where due to the factions i was a member of i was able to walk through a major battle without being an enemy of any units involved i simply walked through the middle of it towards the objective kind of poor story planning imo this happened again with a quest for the institue i was on i was to meet a synth and complete a mission with him during the mission a random brotherhood of steel squadron moved in and started attacking the synth i couldn t talk to the synth to complete the quest i ended up having to wipe out the bos squadron to complete the quest another major gripe i have is the guns i ended up using the gun you get from paladin danse pretty much the entire game i only switched to a different gun when ammo was low and towards mid to late game that becomes a non issue i felt the whole legendary item system was very borderlands esque not something i cared for the armor abilities were pretty cool but most of the gun unique abilities felt underwhelming besides the gun you get from paladin danse i would like to see the endings for the other faction main quest lines but i am not starting over from the begining atleast not right now i spent the first 25 levels of the game just exploring i didn t go to diamond city to start the main quest until level 25 in my random exploration of buildings however i did run into some named enemies that i believe were for quests they were instantly hostile towards me and i feel that in my killing killing them i may have missed out on some side quests the building of settlements feels very tacked on and rushed and the fact that the game lacks any sort of tutorial on how to build settlements was frustrating you shouldn t have to go online to learn the ins and outs of a game mechanic it should be explained in a tutorial in the game i do wish that atleast with sanctuary the settlers would continue to repair the town and fix all the houses so it doesnt look horrible instead the settlers just farm plants all day some of them act like they are fixing that one house in the center of sanctuary but the house doesnt change in appearance at all lastly in the 76 hours of play time the game did not crash once impressive for a bethesda title i d give the game a 70 100
