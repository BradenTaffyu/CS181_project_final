early access review its doubtful that the devs will read this however i feel it must be said the amount of love and care that has gone into this game is insane i remember it only having one map and the resources were all patches you had to go and find i remember there were no vehicles of any kind and meat smell attracted zombies now there s cars and traders with quests don t even get me started on the rpg leveling i m happy this game has continued to chug along and more importantly i just wanna say you guys have done some amazing work here i look forward to what ever comes next
