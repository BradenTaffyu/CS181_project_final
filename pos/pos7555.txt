it looks amazing had very particular mechanics and took me 40 hours to earn three steam achievements though that is not by which i measure my life it is a guide to see how well i m advancing and understanding i could never understand the ship or shipping aspect of the game which is a big part if i could wrap my mind around that maybe i d enjoy this slow burn game more i m considered detail oriented if not obsessive but i spent hours trying and just can t do it bon voyage
