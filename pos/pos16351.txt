2020 early access review 8 10 my reviews tend to be long the short version is the game is great and although it has been in ea for about 4 years it is continuously updated and the bugs that remain or pop up with every patch are actively worked on for the price you are getting a deep and immersive game from a developer that pulls no punches he tells you the game is hard and it is but when you fire up the engine for the first time there is a real sense of accomplishment there are a few issues like the true pain of lining up the cherry picker with the engine well to install the engine but they are minor compared with what you get well worth a try especially since there are mods available for the game search for them on the net also permadeath is an option you can elect out of now for story time let me start with a few basics as a young 20 something american i lived in helsinki finland asuin m kel nkadulla in the mid 90 s and later in life was a dealership mechanic for 10 years while in finland i learned finnish i earned a finnish driver s license and had a permanent residence visa i also love the country and the people especially their grit sense of humor and love of life i only left because the us army called me back i still fly a small finnish flag in my window at home next to old glory am i biased towards all things finnish probably but the game does a great job of giving you a glimpse of life in finland in the mid 90 s why is this germane because i can honestly say this game captures four things really well 1 finland in the mid 90 s which was in the middle of a horrible recession 2 the amount of detail it takes to build a car from the frame up 3 the peace and solitude of the finnish countryside along with a small country village 4 the amis culture of young guys getting cheap cars and tricking them out as best they can the game is a challenge in all aspects nothing is easy you will have to hustle to get money you will have to ensure the timing chain is installed correctly you will have to adjust the distributor and carb once you get the engine started the electrical installation can be a nightmare parts and tires wear and you still have to take care of yourself you have to eat sleep shower and yes urinate all these things take money you also need to pay the phone and electric bill you have to pay for gas and diesel you can get drunk and black out or get into a drunken fist fight you can gamble on a finnish slot machine in the bar you will drive the car and parts will fail which forces you to tow the car home and troubleshoot the issue the car has a manual transmission that you will need to to learn how to drive if you don t already know i play with a decent steering wheel set up with a shifter and pedals which adds to the fun and challenge the game can be played on a controller as well so don t worry if you don t own a steering wheel the depth and humor in the game is also worth mentioning as it adds to the atmosphere of the game you can import songs and have them play on a cd player you install in the car or on a radio station you can tune the radio to as for the type of humor a great example can be found in the screenshots on the store page for the game screenshot 9 of 19 you see a car in front of a store the name of the store is teimon kauppa or teimo s store shop but the a is kinda rubbed out which infers kuppa which is finnish for syphilis leading to teimo s syphilis it is the little things like this that permeate the game and add to the immersion and fun all while building a budget hot rod you can buy glasspacks and hear them roll while the fuzzy dice sink back with the torque if you are looking for another car mechanic simulator which i have and enjoy this is not it the build is much tougher there is only one car you can build you can drive others however the detail in the build can be a lot even for a seasoned mechanic you have to choose the right wrench or socket for the bolt and there is no manual once you build the car there are upgrades to buy and install a rally and drag race to compete in and the general enjoyment of driving around the finnish countryside as a side note i was able to teach my son the theory of how to build an engine in real life that said there are a few issues as i mentioned in the short version using the cherry picker can be a pain there are a few clipping issues when trying to install some parts this becomes exaggerated when trying to install the electrical system you can accidentally touch the car while in the garage and flip the car frame over getting it back in position is almost impossible a few times i had to quit and restart to recover from a glitch but these issues are minimal compared with the depth and fun i have had and are long forgotten after i hear the engine fire for the first time just writing this review makes me want to start a new build for the price you are getting a fun challenging humorous and all around great game that really highlights the efforts only a developer who loves their product can produce there are mods available for the game you will need to search for them because there is no workshop yet if you found this review
