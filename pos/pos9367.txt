2017 solid realistic and intense driving simulator i have bought this game right at the same time i bought my g29 racing wheel this is my first ever driving sim experience at first i was struggling to even complete a single lap of the infamous nordschleife i spun out on almost every corner i couldn t take a proper racing line and overall i was i didn t really like the game from the beginning because of its simple graphics and blandness on the outside assetto corsa looks like a bland simulator in which only hardcore motorsport enthousiast would be interested in but on the inside it s not the case after a few hours i had realised the mistakes i made i was trailbraking braking in corners delivering too much gas when exiting out of corners not counter steering etc once i began taking corners properly and going breathtakingly fast i started to enjoy this game so much every race i participate in feels like a workout my body is sweating every time after completing just a six lap gt3 race on mugello and it feels awesome after about 100 hours i had mastered the nordschleife my best lap is a 6 43 in a pagani zonda r see i had completely no understanding of racing before i played assetto corsa now i am glad to say that i am a motorsport fanatic because of it this game made me appreciate and understand the passion behind motorsport i have even visited the nordschleife recently with my own car it is so fascinating how a game or simulation if you prefer has taught me the difficult art of racing so if you are interested in learning how to race i highly advise you to try this game out edit 1 i ve nominated this game for the most fun with a machine award
