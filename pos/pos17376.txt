2019 after the failure of britannia i was worried that 3k would be another failure but it proved to be a solid game with many new or returning features in the series that set the level of the title high this game makes you care about your characters and how you level them up the diplomacy received a buff that was sooooooooo much needed and tech tree and how it interact with the world is a nice new optic families are back from day one not year 3 and the game it self follows a solid difficult campaign with the plus that all factions play style is different few cons of course as some crashes autosaves end of turn so you do not loose anything except of course a battle maybe but they range from 10 20 minutes anyway also very good rework on the autofire of ranged units and i nominated the game of course for 2019
