2022 tl dr highly recommend 10 10highly configurable sandbox colony sim with strong modding scene incredible replayability rimworld as a standalone game is a strong example of a good and difficult colony sim with a lot of customization options and choices built into the base game starting with your choice of storyteller start scenario and start location from there it is a freeform colony sandbox where you fight to survive against a variety of events large and small while recruiting and losing colonists along the way whenever i buy a colony sim and i buy many of them the first game i compare it to is rimworld and i can very easily tell that many colony sims that came after rimworld were inspired in some way or another be it visuals or mechanics and then theres mods to avoid writing a 100 page thesis in my opinion rimworld s modding scene is second to none and is single handedly responsible for this game s longevity and long standing popularity without mods rimworld is still good and is still playable for a fair bit of time and the dev still updates it and drops new content on occasion however with mods the game is without limit rimworld in essence is like skyrim or minecraft where the game is completely customizable to your whim based on the mods you choose and you can effectively create very different experiences and fine tune your own game exactly how you want it luckily the game s creator is very open and accepting of mods and tries to minimize the amount that updates impact the mods and this means that the community is able to quickly update and maintain most mods as long as someone is willing in my opinion rimworld is worth full price and if you want to get the game it is not worth waiting for it to go on sale because the game rarely goes on sale and as far as i can tell it only goes on sale when steam mandates it and its usually only 10 off so if you want the game or want to try the game i just recommend getting it then and there i recommend abstaining from purchasing dlc until you decide that you want the dlc for some people they get the dlc because it is a pre requisite for some mods for me this factored in but i also just wanted to see what the dlc offered i personally recommend ideology royalty simply based on the content of the dlc however for the purposes of meeting mod pre reqs many mods require royalty moreso than ideology i recommend playing through the tutorial and a bit after without modding so you can get a grasp of the game and once you get a feel of what you would want then i recommend grabbing a few mods from the workshop and testing them out and going from there learning how to mod is important because load order matters and some mods are quite incompatible in short if you like colony survival sims i highly recommend rimworld if you are new to the genre it is one of the harder games in the genre and it might not necessarily be a good first pick however if you do pick it as your first you are in for one hell of a ride and you might find it hard to enjoy other sims that dont meet the same level as rimworld it is worth noting that rimworld is a slow game with a slow buildup and often your many small decisions can determine your colony s ultimate success or failure this isnt to say nothing occurs in the early game in fact on the contrary your early game will be quite active and may just be a short and brutal life depending on the events that transpire regardless of fast or slow when hits the fan it can do so quite quickly your colony can die by one thousand cuts or it can die from one single event such as a massive raid or a meteor dropping on your single colony doctor right after a raid if you cant handle or appreciate slow games then this genre itself is not right for you most colony sims are about the long haul
