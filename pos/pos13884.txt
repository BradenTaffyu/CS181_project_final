2018 arma 3 is an absolute blast and i totally recommend it the game always has something new for the players playing multiplayer is so much fun especially with a scarce amount of people who troll the only thing i dislike about arma 3 is the boring campaign every mission in the campaign just felt like a small skirmish i would often play the campaign for a while get bored of it come back after a few weeks get bored play again and so on the campaign in arma 2 is the complete opposite with a campaign that has action everywhere despite the campaign the game is awesome you ll have a lot of fun even just screwing around in the eden editor or just simply messing around with your friends
