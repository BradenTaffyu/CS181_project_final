2019 how long have i been on the road when was the last time i ate no that half eaten sandwich on the dashboard does not count it is not real it can t be if it were it would surely be covered in mold by now there is a cat sleeping on the passenger seat next to me is it alive it s not moving it has not moved in weeks meanwhile i have never stopped moving what would happen if i did i m not in a hurry to find out i do not dream anymore i close my eyes now and then and everything goes black sometimes when i open them everything is still black i turn on the lights but they only seem to make the surrounding darkness even more pronounced i think about closing my eyes again and sinking back into my dreamless slumber but then i feel it death s cold breath making each hair on the back of my neck stand up as if it was getting ready to pluck them one by one with a pair of contaminated tweezers i resume my journey out of sheer terror voices speaking in an incomprehensible tongue keep me company for a few hours the radio begins to crackle then it dies a barely legible sign tells me i am approaching knjazalovac i do not know where knjazalovac is but it s safe to say it was never the center of a high civilization the ruritanian peasants living here at the height of the austro hungarian empire were probably not even aware that they belonged to one for some reason the denizens of this god forsaken country demand fish at least that is what my trailer smells like i once stopped to have a closer look at what i was transporting i vowed never to look again some hundred meters ahead my headlights reveal a silhouette of roughly humanoid shape i slow down to a crawl who is this furtive creature a fellow stranger to society no doubt i check the dashboard clock 03 33 nary a healthy soul awake at this ungodly hour as i get closer to our mysterious nightwalker i notice he s not wearing a jacket for an instant our eyes meet his loathsome stare betrays a mixture of savage animosity and utter disappointment i am going far too slow for his purposes a moment later i have forgotten everything about this cursed insomniac everything except his face i have seen that face many times before too many times i see it every time i look myself in the mirror but then practical considerations inevitably get in the way who would drive the truck the cat it is useless even thinking about it maybe one of these nights one of you could stop my truck for me in the meantime i have no choice but to stay on the move i must keep moving
