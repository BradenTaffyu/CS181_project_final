2013 if you haven t played this game yet on pc than what are you doing with improved gameplay and dialogue desicions that make it vastly superior to fallout 3 but also the exploration didn t feel as tedious or boring due to enough variety in the locations to make each area unique and feel part of the mojave wasteland even though two out of the four main dlcs are actually quite solid honest hearts and old world blues the modding community has helped to make this games lifespan survive longer than what obsidian ever could do with new weapons some inspired by other games texture packs quest lines and new areas to explore it means that their is much more to do in the land of the mojave fallout 3 was my childhood rpg but new vegas is my personal preference of a role playing game where your character is actually the main focus on how the world changes around you would recommend a solid 9 5 10
