2020 early access review when i first downloaded this game a few years ago i only had a gamepad and i just didn t get it i didn t take the time to set up the controller and didn t really understand what the game is but i love driving games particularly rally sims rbr dr2 0 wrc9 and physics simulations so i spent a few hours on it and figured i d revisit later after quarantine started i got a wheel so naturally tried every driving game i own with it beamng drive was by far the biggest surprise and has quickly become one of my favorite games most of the cars handle as i d expect and i was impressed by the force feedback it took a couple mods to get me addicted pseudo random tour seems like a perfect mod for this game and shows off how much content and potential there really is here but as a rally fan what really got me hooked was the pace notes mod pace notes core and the configuration suddenly it s a rally sim and in my opinion a really solid one finally we have a game where the physics feels right cars handle believably and damage is realistic enough to make every risk a calculation i don t really know how driving on tarmac compares to other games but if you re into dirt rally wrc or rbr i d definitely recommend checking it out the off road experience is exactly what i d been wanting my only fear is that it could be hard to market a game like this and grow an ecosystem around it this is a fantastic physics platform just begging to have a deeper game experience built on top of it and i really really hope they can create that i ll be doing time trials in utah until then edit i m using a t300 rs gt with the sparco r383 rim
