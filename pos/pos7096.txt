2017 ok i am not going to lie i thought this game would be lame how much fun can it possibly be to just drive a truck from point to point i bought it on sale thinking atleast i can get some cool screenshots and view some eyecandy as i ve seen plenty of nice screenshot come from this game and it was 50 off so what the heck so i proceed to install it and then spend nearly the next 16 concectutive hours play it without stop listening to my 80 s hair band radio rumbling down the open roads of america getting countless speeding tickets in california because of thier absurdly low speed limits sleeping in truck stops and living the good life all while riding upon my diesel stallion this game is far from lame this game is pure unadulterated freedom
