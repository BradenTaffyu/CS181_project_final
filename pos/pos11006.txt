2023 i got early access and put in over 150 hours in vanilla if this game was bad i would not have this much time put in such a short amount of time i ve not had this much fun playing a city builder since sc4 the frame rates are better than cs1 and i cannot go back after using cs2 road building tools which makes anyone who ever struggled making intersections in cs1 feel like a pro and it s not cartoony i m looking forward to when modding begins which i believe will take this game to a whole new level if you liked cs1 you will love cs2
