2020 a very good freeform game that i don t regret buying at all many years ago i mainly played with my real life friends but i can imagine that online servers would be just as fun there are endless replayable possibilities for fun and countless laughs to have no matter if you want to do prop hunt murder ttt or just mess around and do tag and shoot balloons as shrek you really can milk the game and find whatever you want to find because someone s already made it simply put 100 recommended to play this with friends but solo play is still fun too there s definitely a reason why this game is played so much and has so many good reviews
