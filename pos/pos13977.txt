2019 this is a problem solving game except there are often several ways to solve each problem need food you can either try to cultivate the indigenous plant life or you can plant your own farm or you can set up a ranch for meat or you can just eat dirt which won t make your colonists happy but it s there too much heat in your base you can either super cool a gas or liquid and pump it through all your walls or you can redesign your base to redirect the heat or you can send rockets into space to retrieve special potted plants that absorb heat or you can come up with some other solution that no one has even thought of almost every problem has multiple ways to solve it with each solution having its own pro s and con s you also get to completely design your base from the overall layout to how each room looks and functions to even the type of material to use in the drywall trying to design your base to both function well and look good while doing it is a bit of a game in itself one downside to the game is that it s not clear what each machine or object does you have to either google it or use trial and error to learn how certain things function for example the machine that cools piped liquids will cool it by 15 degrees per cycle but that isn t stated anywhere in the game the machine that converts steam into power requires a certain temperature to work properly but that too isn t stated anywhere in the game there are many examples like this but once you learn the in s and out s of each machine and object it s pretty fun to put them together in different ways to achieve a goal this is an excellently made game with superb game play there are relatively few bugs considering the number of ways things can interact if you like problem solving then definitely give this game a try
