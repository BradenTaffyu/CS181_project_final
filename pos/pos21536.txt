2023 the actual gameplay is great and really enjoyable customization is fun and isn t complicated or difficult to understand however the load times are atrocious i have to wait at least 5 minutes just for the game to open a more personal issue i have is the story as you cannot skip the boring cutscenes overall though it s alot of fun and i d recommend it if you enjoy other instalments in the forza series
