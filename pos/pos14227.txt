2021 early access review bluf my first save of the game was titled what time is it background i play a decent amount of different city building games plus a few space exploration ones like elite dangerous no man s sky etc i was interested in factory games like factorio but the 2d perspective and overwhelming complexity was a bit of a turn off dsp looked like a bit more accessible version of factory genre plus a nice dose of space exploration so i took the plunge things i especially liked aesthetic design and scale really beautiful universe with many scenic screenshot worthy moments the slightly cartoon ish art style really helps make the scaling a bit more believable understandable the scale is really well thought out things feel really big when they are big but not so much so that it takes eternity to get anywhere very satisfying gameplay loop the progression of starting with your mech doing everything to creating a giant interstellar factory is very satisfying very easy to lose track of time as you expand from your panet to your solar system then the entire star cluster unlocking buildings and items as you go finding rare resources and exotic stars and planets is really cool especially when they are useful in your interstellar factory very few bugs i can t remember the last time i ve played game at release that ran so smoothly and had so few bugs much less an early access title a few placement issues with buildings and belts but very minor one crash in over 135 hrs of play excellent dev support fairly responsive and interactive development team regular patches and definitely a commitment to excellence notable neutral point mission accomplishment is in an odd spot at the risk of some minor spoilers you don t actually have to build a permanent dyson sphere structure to beat the game only do a specific research that requires resources gathered from a star since there a couple different ways to get this resource you don t actually have to finish a structure to beat the game a slightly odd choice but i suspect is was done this way because it can take a really long time to finish a sphere see more details below and giving the mission accomplished before the long grind sets in is probably a good thing things i especially disliked no blueprints or way to rapidly place multiple buildings or attachments for a game about automating large scale production it s a bit surprising that there is no way to automate the rapid construction of buildings and the sorters required to interact with those buildings this becomes more and more of a problem in the middle to late game when you are making dozens of the same structures over and over again mods like copy inserters and multibuild are an absolute requirement to save you from clicking yourself to death and this is coming from someone who generally tries to avoid using mods endgame suffers a bit from repetitive tasks and automation scaling as a matter of perspective of the 135 hrs i ve spent on one play through almost half have been after mission accomplishment just waiting on my sphere to finish building yes you can make your factory bigger to speed things up but scaling up your dyson sphere component production takes a lot of repetitive factory building and a bit of resource whack a mole there is nothing that is challenging from a problem solving perspective just a matter of how much repetition can you put up with it would be really nice to see some higher level automation available like some ai that you can command to go setup xx metal extraction at xx planet and bring it here or something like that navigation is unnecessarily difficult it can be surprisingly frustrating to find a particular star or planet in the sky and fly to it a marker tag or something like that in the interstellar map would be an easy fix a route plotter and a display of what your current warp range is would be nice as well graphics settings are limited very few options to control the graphical fidelity to help performance on lower end machines conclusion highly recommend one of the few early access titles that i would be mostly happy with if it was released as is at 20 it s steal for the amount of content and gameplay hours provided adding a blueprint feature and some more late game features aids would be nice but definitely worth checking out in it s current state
