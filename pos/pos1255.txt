2020 early access review don t let the name confuse you this isn t about zombies or survival it about freaking boundless open world hoarding zombies are there to entertain you interaction literally aids character s mood survival is there to give you a reason to hoard everything else is but an infrastructure expanding and securing your base to build more containers to stuff more loot or natural resources fixing cars to be able to move more loot from far away grinding skills to be able to process loot and zombies harder better faster stronger mods to add more loot and places to loot pros hoarding and resource management tile based building isometric view tons of mods of all colors fine tuning of gameplay although quite intricate and it might take some time to find both challenging and rewarding combination enjoyable car mechanic rp together with booze shady garage and all extensive character management easy modding cons controller support is to be fixed sometime not now lack of objectives or progression true sandbox and zombies are pretty much all the same no bosses or otherwise interesting targets but mods are helping to some extent
