2020 combat at first turn based combat never appealed to me but this game has completely changed my mind on that aspect once i picked it up and overcame the learning curve divinity turn based combat requires you to think and to strategize to weigh your options limited to how much ap you can spend on each turn whilst leveraging your environment and intentionally attacking specific enemy weaknesses to deal high damage combat includes both status and environmental effects that can be used strategically based on the enemy you are fighting the situation you are in and the location where you are standing there are also scrolls and potions which can be looted around the world or purchased from traders and consumed during fights which can give you sneaky advantages at difficult times the game includes an entire plethora of different enemies big and small each having their own distinctive classes strengths and weaknesses there are different environments and strategically placed items in these environments such as barrels oil spills water puddles etc that can be leveraged in combat by intentionally combining elemental effects that can produce an outcome such as electrified water explosions when throwing fire on oil etc which means no one fight is the same as the last finally throughout the game you will find yourself coming up against a boss who was foreshadowed in the first act this in my opinion was an epic decision larian bravo story there are many times i became confused about what was happening in the main storyline having picked this game up out of the blue and never having played the first instalment of the series i found that if you are looking to enjoy this game s story it is essential to read up on the plot and the lore beforehand as it will not be presented to you from the start instead you will be thrown in head first as it assumes previous understanding keep in mind i haven t yet played through the first instalment so this may be different for players who have skip the next paragraph if you want to avoid reading the plot beforehand the premise is that living beings on rivellon have a form of energy known as source and individuals called sorcerers can manipulate source to cast spells or enhance their combat abilities lucian known as the divine was infused with a collective source power from the seven gods to use his powers to hold back the void lucian died before the start of the game thus weakening the separation between rivellon and the void the void are drawn to the use of source and so an organization called the divine order is persecuting sourcerors to prevent the void from wreaking havoc on the inhabitants of rivellon the weakened veil also weakens the gods and so the gods urge the player the godwoken to become the next divine and hold back the void to regain tranquillity the process of getting there is intertwined with separate acts and each act is assigned a different map to traverse and complete to which you sail to aboard the lady vengeance in each map there are a great deal of side quests and hundreds of different npc s to interact with which allow you to take on brilliant and unique adventures this is where i gained the most fun from this game despite due to the games nature it s lacking guidance causing player reliance from personal experience on the game s online wiki to complete some side quests i thoroughly enjoyed every second of my time in this game it elicited many laughs it made me break through challenges and solve difficult puzzles and think through difficult combat situations this game does an incredible job at providing replayability in both solo and co op playthrough simply because the main objective of the game is kept as simple as possible to the naked eye it is light hearted it is fun and therefore it can be approached in a multitude of different ways you can get your friends involved and start a new game with different characters without the repetition becoming too taxing and i think that s very difficult to achieve and they have done a great job characters and soundtrackthis is where the life of the game lies larian have done an amazing job at distributing dialogue to each and every character in the game an absolute mammoth of a task seemingly the dialogue is frequently comedic sometimes pompous looking at you red prince often intelligent and always full of surprises it is extremely well done adding life to the world making the environment seem more full and less lonely i really hope that bree is holding up okay the soundtrack to this game is enchanting there s just something so magical about standing on the lady vengeance and rivellon starts playing music makes combat more thrilling it makes adventuring more delightful it makes the game more memorable right in the feels man moreover the addition of an instrument to character selection was genius and works wonders in both co op and single player playthroughs providing commemoration throughout the entirety of the game and identifies characters actions and achievements within your party youtube video rivellon extended 30 mins divinity original sin ii views 652 295 a 30 minute loop of one of the most popular songs in divinity original sin ii when starting the game you are provided with a choice of 6 playable characters to choose from each having their own distinctive race human lizard dwarf elf undead and each being as memorable as the last with their own unique backgrounds stories history and interactions with the world and it s inhabitants you are also provided with a blank slate to create your own character from scratch which can result in hilarious role playing within a group of friends the character development in this game is complex but in a nut shell tags help define who a character is and how they interact with things and people in the world each character has a class which are merely templates as you can ultimately be anything you want as you can adjust your stats as you level up throughout your playthrough and can change your characters attributes at any point using the mirror located at the bottom floor of the lady vengeance but classes do dictate starting stats and skills so it s a good idea to choose correctly from the get go abilities determine your proficiency and your ability to interact with npcs and finally talents provide variance in their effects some introduce new game mechanics and dialogue options pet pal in particular and some can be completely game changing lone wolf for example conclusion this game will not hold
