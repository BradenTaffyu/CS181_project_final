what a game it looks like an indie but so much in it it s like stardew valley but with a bunch of non gender specific mini games and boss fights it was a true gaming experience than non other everybody must play it one negative it needs the gyao game to start more early it is boring at the end of the game to skip days to wait until they grow up and die
