2017 early access review i m 80 90 sure the people who made this game are clarvoyant i have done so much stupid crap in this game made so many weird bizarre builds and somehow they all feel balanced they all work and they re all perfectly acceptible ways to get through the game so i m getting creative i want to break this perfect system i m sure there s a crack somewhere next goal the wall build build a character who can hold a lot have them drop it all in a wall formation use that to hold off melee attackers wait every class has a teleport skill of some point and the melee class sets things on fire when they use theirs curse you lahrian studios i didn t mean it big fan as of my first time this game still in early access and all calm down guys
