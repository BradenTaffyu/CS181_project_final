2018 early access review i love card games of all types i grew up playing traditional card games like crazy eights solitaire and uno i later got into bridge rummy and poker until magic the gathering mtg consumed my life for years these days though its hard to find people to play traditional card games anymore and magic the gathering and other ccg s are way too expensive to keep up to date with a few years ago i discovered physical deck building games like dominion thunderstone race for the galaxy and many more i had a ton of fun playing these but again it is hard to get a group together on a consistent basis so i turned to the pc several of these games have pretty good pc versions but they are still restricted by the fact that they are based on physical games there are often clunky mechanics that really slow things down that s fine when playing with friends at home but over the internet or alone against an ai it tends to get old pretty fast there have been quite a few digital card games recent years that are great but most of them are based on card collecting and those can rival even magic the gathering in cost if you want to stay up to date with the best cards then come slay the spire a game it took me weeks of hearing people talk about before i finally gave it a chance this little weird looking card game has somehow managed to tap into so many things i love about card games and video games that when people ask me about it i struggle to even say anything about it because there is so much i want to say drawing your cards the reason i love card games today as much as i did as a kid is for the simple feeling you get when you are dealt your cards you pick them up and see if you have a good hand that rush of excitement at the possibilities of what your hand has for you never gets old its why i got so heavily into magic the gathering since apposed to games like bridge or rummy you get to draw new cards constantly this is also true for deck builders and even more so with slay the spire than many others since you play your hand fast and don t have to worry about building your deck while you re playing it this brings me to my second point building the deck slay the spire has done a genius move by taking the deck building aspects of a deck builder away from the action of playing so when i am in a fight i don t have to think for 2 minutes about which card to get like you have to do in dominion style games after a fight is over you are rewarded with a selection of new cards and only then do you have to make decisions about what card to pick and that choice is always informed by how the last battle went so you know what your deck is missing before you pick your new card i really love building my deck as i play with it its how i used to tinker with my mtg decks back in the day and the reason why the physical deck building games appealed so much to me slay the spire has the incremental building of a deck builder but without the constant stop and think style of play which slow those games down this makes the pacing of the game much more interesting you have an action phase followed by a thinking phase rather than jumbling them both into each other playing the cards all this would be for naught had the game not been fun to play thankfully the cards are interesting and have a ton of cool interactions with each other there are many different types of decks you can build and they can often change and adapt as you play if you find that one rare card or relic you can build a whole deck around this makes the game extremely re playable more so than any other deck builder i ve played while games like dominion and thunderstone have a lot of different card combinations for you to play i simply find myself enjoying what i can do in slay the spire more it also plays very fast it flows a bit like heartstone in that sense unless you have very complicated deck combinations which requires some forethought or specific play orders best of both worlds since slay the spire is a digital card game rather than a physical one it is not restricted to the laws that govern how a regular card game plays this means they can do a lot of stuff that simply isn t possible or takes too long for physical games each fight is against one or several monsters who before your turn indicate what they are going to do over their heads which usually is either attack block or apply some buff debuff this means what you do on your turn is informed by that if the monster attacks you block if it blocks or buffs itself you attack having this kind of ai interaction in a physical game could be possible but would require a lot of dice rolling or boring set up between rounds as you play the game more you start to learn how the different monsters work and develop strategies for each of them making each game a little easier than the previous its not just your deck that s getting better its your ability to play it as well the game also has a lot of statuses such as buffs and debuffs kind of like how mtg works which is one of the reasons why mtg can take forever to play but with the game being digital all this is taken care of in the background the digital version of magic the gathering handles these things for you as well but since its rooted in a physical game it is a lot slower and more cumbersome than slay the spire just one more turn i am also a huge turn based strategy fan civilization being my favorite game of the genre that genre has the ability to captivate me in a way that makes me just play on and on one more turn at a time even though i know i should have stopped hours ago slay the spire does the same thing for me each game of slay the spire consists of 3 floors with multiple encounters with a boss at the end of each floor if you die or win you get some experience points towards new unlocks and you can start again on a new run it plays similarly to a rogue like in that way a genre that i ve always been fascinated by but never got very deep into but slay the spire got its hooks into me very hard it took me quite the force of will to say no to another game so i could take the time to write this review i can t wait until its over so i can try out the latest patch which reminds me early access the elephant in the room in my opinion is the fact that the game is in early access that to me is always a huge red flag there are a few games though such as factorio rim world subnautica prison architect oxygen not included and others that actually listen to their community provide regular updates and already have a game that is worth playing as it is slay the spire in my opinion joins the rank of these great games without question the technical aspects of the game is top notch it plays smoothly there s a ton of content and it has received multiple significant updates over the few weeks i ve played it with a clearly defined roadmap that promise more content in a game i feel already has enough content to justify its price 5 times over i have no doubt that the game will be finished and even if development stopped today i would be more than satisfied with my purchase finishing thoughts this is a game i am going to be playing for years to come and while it already has enough content to justify that today i can imagine limitless possibilities for it in the future more game modes such as infinite restricted cards special relics or modifiers new cards more monsters new characters etc i feel like this game has managed to do one of those things that you don t really see all that often it has taken the best from many different genres combined it in a new way and created something greater than the sum of its parts i think slay the spire is a game we will be talking about for years to come as a genre defining game it has my full recommendation
