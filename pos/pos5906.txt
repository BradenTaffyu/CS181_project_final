2020 early access review pros looks great feels great far better quality than most early access gamescons functionally just a reskin of warband at the moment no longer the ability to for you to automatically block an attack im bad so i liked this in warband why is there varying armors present in tournaments i dont have good armor and get recked by imperial veteran every time cuz he shrugs off my hits
