2018 review based on base game mods experience i hardly ever played just the base game the game is awesome deep and gets tons of love from modders community it is hard to not recommend it as a game pros great story driven grand strategy game each playthrough can be massively different great mechanics one more year syndrome anomalies can be very engaging some quest lines are totally brilliant tons of mods game is still pretty much alive with developers giving it huge updatescons ai is stupid as hell because of the above game is either ridiculously easy or unplayably hard if you buff ai advantage in too many respects you can still overshot them by far if you avoid direct conflict and game becomes easy again paradox dlc policy is disgusting they take the better mods make them obsolete incompatible and release them as a new shiny pricey dlc that s an advanced level of arrogance but at the very least that means the former mod is better integrated into game engine game is badly optimized forget about playing smooth late game on huge galaxies especially with mods some of it can be blamed on modders but engine itself struggles with large scale battles and huge universe all of that cannot be blamed just on modders for reusing the same triggers for their events
