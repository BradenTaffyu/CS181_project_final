played since beta i have more hours off steam its a really good co op rpg to play with friends class stories 10 10 agent sith warrior jedi knight bounty hunter this alone will give you hours of content atmosphere 9 10 they nailed this part you feel like you are in the old republic from the start you also see the age of the game as soon as you start not a deal breaker for me but might be for others planet stories 8 10 some are better than others none of them bad some feel a bit long in the tooth though combat 7 10 standard tab target stuff with decent animations if you play wow you will feel at home character customization 7 10 not bad could be better having custom outfit designer is a huge plus but game could do with some better in depth sliders considering its 2024 also since our characters talk the whole game let us pick a voice class diversity 8 10 this has undergone many changes over the years the biggest change was allowing us to use any spec within any class example a jedi knight can have the jedi knight class stories but the abilities of a sith warrior force users can use all force abilities non force users can use all tech abilities good change i wish it would go deeper and have force powers be based on alignment but again that s just me each spec has a bunch of abilities but i m not going into builds or metas any of that just know the option to play how you want is there now pvp 5 10 ehh this used to be fun but it breaks far too often prob should avoid to keep sanity pve 8 10 pretty good bring friends for laughs crafting 3 10 people actually do this i mean its there i guess end game 10 10 star wars barbie cost free or 14 99 usd i say play your first character for free hours of content there for the cost of free99 if you like the game support the devs managing the game now that would go a long way in helping ensure we get new content game obviously used to be at bioware but they have since passed it off to broadsword so the future is still in question but for what s there right now its absolutely worth the 14 a month to see it further developed again hundreds of hours of content for free i would love to see this come to consoles it would do crazy numbers on xbox 7 10 overall the game is not perfect but fun if you play it with a few friends as a co op rpg
