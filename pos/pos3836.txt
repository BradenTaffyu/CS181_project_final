2022 this game is insane the sheer amount of stuff in this game puts fullprice games with 5 dlcs to shame and the best part is that it s good stuff that actually enhances the game basically imagine that firaxis xcom and a korean rpg had a baby and that baby then got addicted to tradeable card games that s troubleshooter a tactical squad game held together with rpg story and a bonkers amount of stuff to collect and every piece you collect gives you more options on how to skill your characters to give you some points of reference it took me 130 hours to play through the game including the first dlc which is free btw on hard and i still have not seen 35 of the almost 290 enemies i am still missing 90 of the 730 skills that you can equip onto your characters to customize them i still didn t discover 120 of the 380 combinations of skills that unlock further bonuses in the 150 hours i played the game it constantly offered new stuff to me it didn t get stale along the way even once and i could still play for another 50 hours and still constantly find new stuff how insane is that for a game that costs 20 bucks and is actually good i am a huge xcom2 fan i spent 4 years playing and modding that game fanatically if you are aware of a better advent and the related mods that s me troubleshooter has all that stuff in it that the modding community put into xcom2 over time varied character classes oodles of skills varied enemies along the way it also solves the alpha strike issue that xcom2 has by making defenses equal to offenses i genuinely enjoy the tactic layer here more than in xcom let me be fair and list three things that troubleshooter doesn t do as well as xcom it doesn t have permadeath for your characters so it s missing a good deal of that xcom style suspense as a korean game translated on a shoe string budget its english translation is shaky the missions are fixed and not randomized there s some minor variation in some of the missions like being able to choose one of 4 entry points but the lack of randomization is certainly a negative there you go that s literally everything i have to note on the negative side oh and i didn t even talk yet about pets constructable robot minions the crafting system random diablo style loot buddy systems and some of the other extra mechanics this game has you know all that stuff we modded into xcom2 after the fact frankly this game has too much in it didn t think i would say that about a game but here we are it s the gloomhaven of video games and this was put together by 6 people in korea eat your heart out 2k this game deserves awards it s a 10 10 for me and i am eagerly awaiting the next dlc whatever dandylion puts out next is going to be an instant day 1 buy for me on principle alone
