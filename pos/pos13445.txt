2015 i started playing this game during the beta and it quickly became the greatest game i ve ever played and still is i ve played 600 hours and i ve hardly scratched everything you can do in this game i can easily say without exaggeration i ll be putting another 1000 hours if not more into this game games these days seem to go onto the market at 60 120 if you include all the dlc or pre release shannanigans for about 4 5 hours of enjoyable gameplay 20 hours if your lucky with kerbal space program they re not even charging 50 with a guarantee of continued free updates i can not express enough the level of enjoyment anyone with any amount of interest in space exploration will get from this game if your like me you ll get hooked on this game and before you realize it you ll have put in 100 hours of gameplay and be working towards setting up mining operations on any number of distant worlds complete with orbiting space stations and or colonies did i mention you can capture and redirect asteroids then do whatever you want with them yes that does include mining and or building bases on them what you do in this game is only limited to what you can imagine and build to get the job done unless you run your agency into the ground first of course beware the kraken
