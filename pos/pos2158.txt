early access review it s alright you can get really into the game and have fun but keep in mind the developers seem to be in a never ending cycle of making wide sweeping changes that will absolutely make or break your experience this season they nerfed fighter sprint so its hard to justify even playing the class anymore over other options since speed has become the name of the game they also are prone to make the same mistakes over and over again which is baffling to me ultimately it s a unique experience you can t really get anywhere else so that s why people play it at the time of this review the biggest issues in my mind are class balancing and time to kill once in an earlier play test they did an item squish where the best armor was only slightly better than the worst it was a fantastic experience where everyone had a chance to win regardless of gear but people cried on the discord and it was reverted in 24 hours it is fairly obvious that they want gear to be the deciding factor and not skill expression you have no chance of beating someone with a even slightly higher gear score going from greens to blues is like a 50 spike in armor and stats let alone blues to epics etc there are bugs in the game since the first play tests such as the skeleton overhead chop it is still almost impossible to block due to its hit box not reflecting the visual of the attack it is really a diagonal attack but shows coming from top down all that being said i recommend just don t get attached to your gear as you will lose it either from a server shutdown or being in the wrong lobby at the wrong time with classes that counter you and or players that out gear you if you really enjoy the game you can always pay to experience the shared stash selling gear and more than one class also watch some youtube videos on how to fight all the mobs and dodge their attacks
