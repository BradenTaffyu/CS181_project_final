2017 i decided to write this review after all the negative reviews and comments i read i really do not understand why most of them seems to originated from old civ5 players that compare civ6 vanilla with a civ5 that has been retrofitted 2 times with 2 massive expansion packs well this is not fair if you want to compare civ 6 with something you will compare it with the plain civ5 thus with a game without religion great works of art and a silly unit upgrade system with which you end up with lots of melee units that had 2 or 3 useless for them ranged unit promotions but even if you decide to compare it with the complete civ5 the game have all the elements and less flaws of a fully developed cv5 it has religion great works of art and also have interesting new concepts that vastly improve the game concepts such as districts districts with their adjutancy bonuses bring a whole new way of city planning consumable workers no more idle worker at the end of the game an improved great people system taken from the founding fathers of colonization i still remember myself laughing with picasso appearance in ancient era in civ5 the ability to create armies and armadas a lost civ4 concept and more to be honest the only new concept that i do not like is the way roads created in the game so even if you decide to compare the civ6 vanilla with the civ5 including both its expansion packs thus compare a game that has 1 year of development with a game that has 6 the verdict still goes to civ 6 sure there are bugs all games have them sure the ai is silly it was more silly in civ5 when it first released but all those can be corrected in the future so if you see things with a clear mind civilization 6 starts from a better position and with a greater potential from all its predecessors it is more complete and it has lots of new elements that bring a fresh approach to the series some people just wanted a civ5 with new graphics well thank god firaxis did not listen to them
