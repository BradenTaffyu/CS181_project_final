2016 early access review tbh not owning this game is the original sinall nonsense aside though i really like this game although there is only one chapter available at this time there is a big island to explore with hidden secrets like treasure and hidden caves the combat is deep and has a nice tactical twist to it and definitely feels more smooth compared to the first game however before buying this keep in mind that this game is still in early access for at least half a year so there is no voice acting yet some sound effects will be missing you might encounter quite a few bugs and glitches and most important of all there is only one chapter available at this time you still get 8 15 hours of gameplay from this plus there is an online pvp arena if you don t mind the lack of content and if you are a fan of a bit more slow paced rpg this game is definitely something for you
