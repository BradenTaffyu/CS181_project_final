2016 early access review this game is by far the best game i have played in a long long while it s 100 percent self aware and is the perfect combination of frustratingly difficult and proper gameplay that i personally enjoy from a game it s incomplete and shows but i don t care graphics aren t very pretty but again i don t care too many games today are pretty but incredibly hollow when it comes to actual gameplay and replay value this game has massive ammounts of replay value there is no tutorial you are thrust into the bachelor life of a finnish man who appears to be the local handyman hilarity usually ensues the highlights of my first 3 to 4 hours with this game include wake up in a home with nothing but a pack of sausage and a case of beer explore the garage containing a vehicle that has been torn down to it s basic components that i am tasked with re assembling notice my hunger is rather high and must fetch nourishment from store get in van fumble with controls and promptly become lost in the finnish countryside stumble upon an abandoned runway and turn around drive the opposite direction and eventually find the store but it s closed as it is now dark go to the pub next door where i can at least live off beer and pub food untill morning eventually the store opens and i purchase supplies load them into my van and set off for home fatigue meter redmake it back home put away food and sleep wake up to phone ringing it s a drunk man at the pub asking for a ride home load van with case of beer get in and drive to pub pick up said drunk who promptly falls asleep in his seat i keep driving and proceed to roll my van on a dirt road less than a half km from home i decide the best thing to do is to drink all my beer i don t have enough to black out and respawn i wobble down the road towards home to fetch the tractor to rescue van make it to tractor which runs out of gas within sight of van i have given up all hope and just restart the game all this had me pissing myself laughing as it happened and i m not the slightest bit upset restarting 10 out of 10 great game
