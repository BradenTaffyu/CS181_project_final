2022 i ve owned this game for a couple of years but never gotten around to playing it until now i m glad i was able to go into it relatively blind even after all this time my first playthrough was something that will live long in the memory having to balance hope discontent resources people the weather objectives and my own sense of morality while not knowing what was coming up was thrilling every decision felt important at one point i contemplated starting over with everything i had learned but i m glad i didn t the game is at its best when things are on a knife edge after that first scenario hooked me i played through all the other scenarios including the dlc none of them quite match up to the main story but most are interesting in their own right i particularly enjoyed the different perspective in scenario name story spoiler the fall of winterhome some of the alternate scenario gimmicks work better than others though the music is excellent and the visual presentation across the graphics and ui is one of the best i ve seen i m a big fan of grid based games in general and frostpunk s radial grid offers a unique twist on it that looks fantastic the expedition map screen is especially pretty and really helped reinforce the feeling of surviving against the odds the sights and sounds of the city story spoiler gradually changing as you adopt new laws is testament to the attention to detail that went into this game i have only a few minor gripes suggestions the ad for frostpunk 2 being the very first thing i saw when i launched the game it seems to go away after a few hours of playtime but considering there s also a plug for the sequel on the main menu it felt too much for a game i hadn t played yet every scenario seems to have that one resource that will prove the biggest bottleneck although i said i enjoyed not knowing what was coming up that relies on being able to react when the situation changes but there is at least one scenario where it s borderline impossible to get the best ending if you haven t started stockpiling the resource way before the game tells you to i would have liked more automation options for example there are three options for steam hubs on 24 hours a day on during regular working shifts and on during extended working shifts i often changed a workplace from regular to extended shifts or vice versa but forgot to change the nearby steam hub why not have an option called during work hours that automatically adjusts i d also like for workers to be added back to the employment pool when their workplace is switched off rather than having to do both each time it s possible to game some of the mechanics to your advantage for example working an extended shift causes discontent around the clock even though it s only four hours of extra work a day solution only switch the extended shift on between 06 00 08 00 and 18 00 20 00 doing this every day gets very tedious but it is optimal the game should be smart enough to only apply the discontent during those hours or alternately to apply it based on the actual hours a person has worked that day rather than whether the setting is toggled a little more explanation of some mechanics wouldn t go amiss for example one of the loading screen tooltips says that people need to sleep but they ll still walk the length of the map to build a new resource depot at 3 am without so much as a grumble will they miss work to make up for it automatons can build too but as far as i can tell there s no way to assign a specific building project to them this is particularly relevant when the temperature drops and i want people to avoid spending time outside in real life laws are amended and repealed all the time in frostpunk once signed laws are immutable for all time i m sure this was a live with the consequences of your actions design decision but it doesn t make much sense that citizens can ask me to shut down the house of pleasure effectively nullifying a law but i can t do it myself story spoiler even after becoming a fascist dictator or the voice of god i guess that list took up most of the review but i m better at offering constructive criticism than i am at saying why i like something frostpunk is a really good game that i ve been addicted to since i first played it even if you only get one campaign out of it i d say the experience is worth it
