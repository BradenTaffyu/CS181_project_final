2016 2021 update game is better than ever the dev team put in a lot of work to make this a very capable engine that lets you play and customize boardgames of all sorts controls are still complicated but this is the best tabletop related game app there is god this is amazing even if the app started sort of like a joke it has and still evolves into a serious platform for all your boardgame needs there s still some clumsy things like handling multiple objects at a time you will definitely need to skim the documentation to learn some control stuff doubly so if you want to get into the really advanced things but with a solid foundation and the hard work of hundreds of modders there is no better way to have an incredible collection of boardgames right there in one place true at the moment each mod is incredibly vulnerable to being abandoned and lose assets as their web hosting fails but with any luck you will still find or be able to make even versions of whatever game you might want to play there s very little automation so rule keeping still falls square onto the player s hands in the vast majority of cases for better or worse and the legality of each mod is a complicated thing the community is not enormous so it can be a bit complicated finding new players for the more obscure games but still even with all the blemishes and all the fact is that there s nothing else quite like tabletop sim out there at least not yet addendum and since tabletopia is out and terrible it doesn t look like this will change anytime soon
