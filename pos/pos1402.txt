2016 early access review development yeah it s slow it s also early access by buying you re acknowledging that it may never be finished i did i like to think that i got my 15 worth and will get more than that with every update regardless of the time it takes the team to get the updates out i have the utmost respect for the devs putting up with all the crap a lot of folks are putting them through in terms of how long updates take by now if i were tis i d go the route of say interstellar marines and just leave everyone in the dark to shut most of them up so i could work but instead each week they put on their gloves and get ready for the that gets slung their way because they choose to keep us in the loop now that i m done with that on to gameplay even in its current state in the off chance of zombacaylpse i ve learned a lot from pz stockpile water in anything that can hold water turns out the people that keep the water running stop going to work after the world ends keep some books and toys handy the toys may be part of the hydrocraft mod i m not sure boredom is nobody s friend stockpile food obviously non perishables don t grow on trees unfortunately and besides you re gonna cut all the trees down to make walls and other things perishables perish shortly after the power shuts off too learn how to grow food it s a marketable skill during the end of the world and when the animations update arrives you re probably going to want several changes of clothes rather than wearing that one sweat shirt and that one t shirt for the rest of your life blood stains and all i think it s worthy of the something in my eye award because you will get attached to your character and all the progress you make with him or her you ll have killed lord knows how many deadoes and then when you least expect it the sound of your flesh being torn open by a rotting hand or a decayed jaw you suddenly aren t long for the world you spent so long trying to ride out the storm only to become a part of it you think back to the first one you killed then the first building you cleared staring in horror at that first house you saw boarded up filled with rotters trying to break out and devour your flesh fast forward to the lights going out or the water shutting off and wondering how will i survive now and finding a way and for however long you kept finding a way beating in heads looting the homes of the deceased fortifying your home whatever or where ever it may be and now you flash forward to just a moment ago as rodney rot face there just took a bite out of your arm you are not long for the world now and with this realization and perhaps a tear in your eye you can decide to hole up and wait to die or you can take revenge on the world that did this to you
