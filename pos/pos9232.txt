2016 if you re a fan of civilization i absolutely think you ll be a fan of this game a couple differences from the main civilization games that i particularly enjoy 1 build your own race civ complete with positive and negative attributes2 real time instead of turn based never be the one holding a multiplayer game or the one frustrated at others for holding up a game 3 the game has a lot more depth than any civ game i ve played down to weapons load outs on ships leaders for multiple research queues and ships planet side production and population maintenance etc etc4 the game takes place in space and involves a plethora of alien species to play as or against i really just like the setting a lot more
