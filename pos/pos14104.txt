2018 early access review this game is still in beta but the playability is amazing the re playability is incredible i still suck royally at it after 120 hours which i like it makes me want to play more and more until i m actually good at it if you like simulation style games that require lots of focus and micromanagement this is your game there are bugs of course and they will likely frustrate you but updates roll out often enough where they tend to be fixed quickly if you re into testing out new features and dealing with bugs while helping the devs create an even better game you can opt into the alpha rollouts of each new update generally released two weeks before the public release truly it s a really fun game with endless possibilities and it just keeps growing
