2017 there have been a few negative reviews in the recent past because paradox apparently forces you to use a paradox account to play multiplayer don t let this fool you in believing that this game is not a masterpiece since you can find enough reviews of the game s actual features i will point out a few things that are not as obvious frequent free content patches the last update got criticised for a broken multiplayer experience i can not confirm this at all and i have played this game in coop over the last few days without any problems whatsoever besides that stellaris gets upgraded with new mechanics balancing updates and ai upgrades frequently overpriced dlc this is the flipside of the previously mentioned point while i agree that the dlcs don t offer enough by themselves to justify the cost at times i am gladly throwing my money at them to support the developers so they can keep popping out those free updates good balancing yes stellaris doesn t have a flawless balancing expansionism is still more powerful than building high because of how naval capacity is calculated but there are many ways to counteract that and even though there are many ways to play the game it s hard to find a playstyle that really sucks in terms of balancing ai empires this pains me a bit because the ai acts very well in many ways but i think that the diplomacy is very flawed at the moment you can play a pacifistic empire which has the goal to create a big federation that s until you realise that every ai empire is super racist against everyone that is even slightly different in terms of ethics do you lead a federation and one of the members is spiritual too bad now you have to make war with your materialistic neighbors who are old friends of yours because they hate your federation at the moment the game can t be won as pacifist just my two cents overall it s my favorite game of 2016
