2019 i think this game is amazing fun gameplay beautiful music and a compelling story make for an awesome experience before you play i highly recommend reading up on drakengard 1 3 and playing through the original nier be aware of the two region based versions since these games canonically lead up to nier automata there are themes character references that appear in this game that you may miss or disregard if you don t know certain backstories for example when you upgrade weapons in this game they tell snippets of stories that are reflections of events from past games be aware there are issues with this port to the pc resolution scaling and framerate misbehavior that have yet to be addressed by the devs but fixes have been made by the community out of love for the game the main character is cute too
