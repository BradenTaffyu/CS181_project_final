2016 this game has the potential to be great but only if 1 you have the patience to give the developers the time to mould and hone it the complexity and scope of this kind of games require it it s simply not possible to get it right at the first try you need the feedback of thousands of players to make things work the game is far from perfect at the moment but it would be unfair to start blaming the developers right now if in a couple o years the game will still have major issues then we ll have every right to be angry but at the moment i m perfectly satisfied with what i ve got i m having a lot of fun with it and i see that the developers are listening to the players feedback making changes that they believe will improve the gaming experience 2 you do not approach every new game with an i ve got to win attitude but more likely with i will do my best in the situation i ll find myself in winning may simply not be possible if you get unlucky with your initial hand but it doesn t mean that you can t have lots of fun even in the worst situation in the end maybe you ll be crushed by some fallen empire get stuck in some remote arm of the galaxy or simply conquered by a stronger opponent so what it s part of the realism of the game i expected it i would have been disappointed otherwise 1 6 update after playing a campaign with 1 6 patch i still feel we re not there yet i love playing diplomatically in my strategic games and i still feel there s not much to do on that front in stellaris diplomacy still feels rather hollow and simply not a viable way to successfully play a campaign hope that will change in future patches loved the mega structures though 2 0 update i m writing this after almost completing my first 2 0 playthrough changes are huge no question about that only hyperlanes ftl new way to claim sistems new war system plus a load of other stuff it feels like another game entirely but is it better than its predecessor i ve got no doubt that it is limiting ship movement to just hyperlanes feels castrating at first moving a fleet from one edge to the other of your empire takes ages well big suprise there space is big like really big moving around takes time and also it adds a new strategic level since you need to be extra careful while positionig your fleets yes fleets plural finally and it makes wars more manageable since you can finally understand and predict how fleets move around the galaxy you can plan a war strategy feeling like you re moving pieces on a chessboard before the update i really couldn t to claim a system now you have to build a station there no more dinamically changing borders i like this since now expansion is more strategically planned and no longer a crazy rush to claim the best systems as soon as possible in conclusion after a disorienting start everything clicked into place for me i like this new stellaris a lot more than the previous version now i just hope they ll get to work on that diplomacy since it really needs a major rework same as the war systems did p s the expansion is definitely pricey but you know what i believe that most developers would have taken this huge quantity of work labelled it stellaris 2 and have you pay full price for it paradox chose not to taking a big risk in my opinion so kudos for that
