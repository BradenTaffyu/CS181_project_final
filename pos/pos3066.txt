2020 it s a fantastic turn based tactical rpg with satisfying combat environmental effects that can be combined to help or hinder you a dense story a wide variety of solutions for different problems limited only by the party s skill set and your creative thinking and plenty of choices to make it s so much better than its predecessor but still does suffer from a handful of frustrating and tedious fights thankfully that might be only 3 of the game the other 97 was joy without a fort i would honestly suggest skipping the first one and just playing d os2 this game had so much going for it that i ended up finishing it after 100 hours the first d os had too many problems and some really questionable design decisions with some of their quests and voice acting looking at you lore dump imp d os2 has better pacing with its exposition the combat also feels smoother the whole game really it s also extremely accessible with a wide variety of difficulties i played on explorer easy but they have a difficulty tailored for people that don t play crpgs called story mode which buffs your party and debuffs all the npcs probably not a bad choice if choosing to co op with someone completely unfamiliar with the genre anyway i just wanted to say a little something about this game and give it its well deserved thumbs up i hope baldur s gate 3 is very awesome i like what this studio has to offer especially if they keep on improving oh sir lora is kinda weird didn t mind him but he sticks out
