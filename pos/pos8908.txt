2021 stellaris is the story of one space empire at the beginning of the game you can either choose from ready made and randomly made empires or create your own all possible empires have biological psychological and sociological traits that determine what kind of crowd bursts out of the pipe it makes a huge difference between playing with democratic and peace loving birdmen very religious and collective space mushrooms or catwomen who hate strangers and crave the county the features bring with them both good and bad variables that determine a lot of the direction and style of the gaming experience for example closed and homogeneous peoples are united and harmonious but they find it difficult to integrate people from outside their society once your own outfit has been created the game generates a very different playground for each family the structure and content of the galaxy is of course created new for each game but so are its inhabitants and that s where it is in the middle of a great emptiness home planet scientific research ship and construction ship in its orbit there are dozens if not hundreds of systems all around waiting for their discoverer and researcher one of the fundamental sins of paradox games is that they are difficult to learn the flood of information is huge the interfaces are poor and you can wrestle with basic gameplay not to mention learning the secrets of the game stellaris manages to avoid this pitfall with some miracle constant without losing that depth and complexity of paradox games at the beginning of the game you can choose what level of tutorial you want in the background of your game then learn by playing if desired the game will explain the operation of each function view and feature at least superficially on that page it then distributes tips on what to do next stellaris also cleverly gives the player missions that subtly guide him to explore the surrounding space and spread his influence to its corner sometimes expeditions can come across miraculous discoveries secrets of space or ruins left behind by ancient peoples which can explore not only a variety of commodities but also open up a variety of mission chains the completion of which can lead to surprising results the first hours with stellaris are absolutely fantastic there is plenty to do on many fronts as the player refurbishes his home planet explores new technologies and slowly spreads along space the world of the game feels really mystical and interesting on that side you also really start to create within your head that story of your own people s stages this is aided by a variety of random events that can confront the entire nation or the generals scientists and politicians who serve as its leaders pros nice tutorial the atmosphere of exploring the vast cosmos tons of possibilities cons weak trade system mid game grind stellaris stumbling blocks are not uncommon in the world of strategy games as the game s biggest problems are with artificial intelligence and interactions with it stellaris diplomatic system is versatile on paper and contains many fine details such as the spontaneous migration between the planets and the resulting separations between the natives and the newcomers there can also be some kind of cooperation with the neighbors from the opening of the borders to the military alliances stellaris is by no means a bad game let alone irreparable its body is already extremely fascinating at its best it manages to strike the perfect balance between a great strategy and a fun this is my story vibe 8 6 10
