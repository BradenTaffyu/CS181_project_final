2020 having been and grown up with masters of orion stellaris was a coming back home experience and continues to be my go to massive galactic strategy game 700 hours is nothing compared to what i will more than likely pump into this game create your own species rule the galaxy how you see fit through peace or war and everything in between all dlc s and the addition of mods are a must absolute content overload snag it for super cheap during the sales bundles and other offers oh and the music is absolutely beautiful
