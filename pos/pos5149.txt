2015 for many years friends were telling me to join that fallout thing but this never happened early fallouts were great at their time which has passed fallout 3 new vegas were visually gloomy sometimes even dark and represented the same dead and creepy after the war world as the first ones but fallout 4 is a breakthrough it s not about the concept of wasteland but about the post nuclear real world you can speak a lot about how cool the visual design and environments are but in one word the world is finally alive new dialogue interface is clear simple but dialogues are still fun and interesting never skipped a bit action shooting and weapons were also a great surprise you never expect such coolness in this area from a game with an open world games like gta v can only dream of it crafting creating workshop approach is truly done right and really adds a lot of sense to loot and exploring areas there are many fun and interesting side quests but the main storyline is blowing for the first time in many years i felt like i m totally involded in the game decisions and its characters many people and fallout fans want the old days back i m not a fallout series fan after all i can only say i m a fan of fallout 4
