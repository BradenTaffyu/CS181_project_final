2017 it s been over a year and i m still returning to this gem of a game the systems involved with time management exploration and crafting make this game intensely enjoyable i can still remember this game getting its hooks in as i discovered that the townsfolk have their own storylines albiet quaint ones within the game i wanted to collect all of the museum items build a massive farm that ran itself and catch all of the fish i am still working on all of these goals and i don t regret a single hour spent on the game
