go get it the end how i wish i could submit such writing and call it a day but this will not do it any justice even after 8 years this is a treasure to behold hugs pvz my preciousz what is plants vs zombies about pvz is a single player 2d tower defense game basically you plant plants towers to defend your home from the waves of hungry zombies that s it pvz offers players adventure mode story mode 50 maps day garden night garden pool pool with fog day roof night roof mini games 20 maps puzzle 20 maps survival 11 maps on top of that you get to plant 3 types of potted plants 3 maps day night water that earns coins for you and a map to plant a wisdom tree that grows up to a 100 feet you get all that variety of game modes in a fraction of what you would normally pay for a aaa title even after 8 years and that s not even the best part yet visuals audio controls let me start off with the easy part first the controls uses mouse nothing more everything you do in pvz uses the mouse digging planting collecting coins suns audio normally i don t give audio much attention but in pvz its well made it s very distinct anyone who has played pvz will know that tune if they heard it in the middle of a supermarket it s become a trademark lol every action you make has a feedback sound every zombies that appear or animate will have unique sound to them even blowing up the zombies with your potatoes sound so satisfying or the comb rocket of death kapow i mean kaboom music is well made it s kinda soothing actually and it add s to the tension of the game it changes when the horde comes with higher tempo notes credit to the audio team 1 visually its simple cute child friendly very colorful depending on your day night setting it s flat coloring so not a lot of texture to see the main hero for pvz is in it s plant and zombies everything has been crafted beautifully every plant and zombie is unique and wacky exploding potatos exploding cherries wallnuts pea shooters plant eating zombies pumpkin armour bungee jumping zombies a zombie that resembles mj a mining zombie snow sledge zombies zombies on a vehicle lobbing coconuts a yeti zombie wt lol yup character design 1 to the team kudo s great job on the overall product with the visual audio animation and story wise i nearly forgot crazy dave crazy dave as his name suggest is kinda crazy he s your neighborhood buddy his role is more or less the narrator the person that ushers you from level to level and he sells upgrades pots to you the introduction of crazy dave to the story mode is really interesting and lightens up the mood from time to time you never know what crazy thing he s gonna put you through from bowling zombies to tiny zombies and more 1 another point to the team writing department game mechanics your goal is to protect your house from the zombie invasion generally as you progress through the game in adventure mode story mode you will earn other types of plants some of them however you will need to purchase from crazy dave the game add s a little twist to the environment day night water roof each setting has consequences and forces player to rethink their strategy because of the different zombies availability of plants i ll give a quick example day time sun flower generates normal sun energy where you will use the sun energy to purchase your choice of plants night time sun flower will not be able to generate the normal amount of sun energy you have to use mushrooms the shroom that procudes sun energy for you will start off tiny producing half the normal sun energy you get but after a certain amount of time it will grow in full size and give you the normal amount of sun energy what this makes you do is to change your concept strategy for night games because of the lack of resources if you want to use a day time plant in a night game sure you have to have a bean that costs 75 sun water levels pool has some water plants and introduces some crazy zombies riding on dolphins the most distinct water plant is the nine tails awesome you need to play lily on the 2 water titles the rest are land so this is a combination of land and water plants there s a lot more to say but i fear steam word count limit so i ll sum up the game mechanic as creative innovative design that turns tower defense td game fun crazy my personal thoughts i have completed pvz many many times since it s launch i ve never experience any performance issues crashes or even bugs it took me many years later on to purchase it on steam blame the other steam games xd this is one of the few games that successfully innovate the product with creativity wackiness to deliver a memorable fun product i wish there were more games like this on steam for those who love td games this is a must to try i haven t covered the mini games or puzzles yet there s just so many variety of games to keep you engaged in pvz of course the ultimate battle would be the endless waves test your skill and put your best plant combo to see how far you can go and earn steam achievement while doing it i nearly forgot a must mention you have a boss fight it s epic there s a twist in the level and with what the boss can do smash your plants with a truck x x you are in for an epic fight the reward an epic song featuring all the plants and zombies my summary with that it s time for the finale i would like to gather all the plants and zombies for a group photo if possible i would love to have a group photo with the devs too i ll hang them in my bedroom the hallmark of a great game in 50 years time i ll pass this photo to my children and tell them eat your veges i mean if you have not played pvz you haven t lived your life to the fullest don t you dare go kicking the bucket without trying this drums please sun flower drum rolls so on the scale of 0 10 my personal rating for plants vs zombies is a crazy dave in golden blings blings worth 9 10 pvz exceeds all expectations of a traditional td product it is one of the few great games to date in the market definitely must buy i ll be waiting for pvz 2 to come on steam even if it makes me wait for another 8 years xdit s been a long hard day for me lets go home buddy hopes on gargantuar and listens to pvz credits one more time
