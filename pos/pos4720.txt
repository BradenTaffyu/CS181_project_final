2018 as someone who really enjoys fallout 3 in particular at first i felt quite put off by 4 without spoiling any plot details i ll tell you that fallout 4 is not quite as open ended as 3 or even new vegas you end up getting railroaded ha ha throughout most of the game and forced to choose between a few factions about halfway through in addition to this you cannot be the bad guy since it would break fo4 s storyline and depending on which faction you pick chances are the other ones won t like you very much not only that but every faction in the game besides maybe the minutemen who are run by you anyway has at least one or two distasteful goals the end result is that the story sucks in a lot of ways and is mediocre at best this creates a problem where fallout 4 forces you into this weird state of gameplay and story integration which can feel wrong for an open world game in fallout 3 you could be the antagonist if you really wanted to and in new vegas at least there were clearer options and understandable consequences when picking your faction s however this is a positive review most of the negative stuff is out of the way now so i d like to move on to what i did like weapons and armor are 100 modular now meaning you can create your own parts from materials and attach them onto your base weapons to suit your own tastes in combat style there s at least one mod for every single basic weapon in the game also there s no more weapon durability so that beautiful gun you modded to perfection will always function at peak performance and never break power armor has been totally overhauled they now consist of a power armor frame different armor pieces for the head chest arms and legs and now need a power source called a fusion core in order to operate the individual armor pieces can be customized not unlike your weapons to do different interesting things all power armor pieces have separate durability which is shown in your hud when inside the armor pieces that get damaged or completely destroyed can be repaired later provided you have the materials to do so you can now cook your own food brew your own beverages and make your own chems at proper crafting stations the karma system has been replaced with certain characters liking you more or less based on your actions which feels more natural than an arbitrary rating on the good evil scale this includes all of your companions except dogmeat most of the named characters in the game and the game s factions themselves the only problem i have with this is that it s harder to remain neutral or stick with all of your companions throughout the whole game but the way the story is built you pretty much have to alienate factions and companions anyway so at least you have a choice in the matter fallout 4 also keeps the same open world elements we d come to expect from a bethesda game you can go anywhere you want almost anytime you want but the further south you go the tougher enemies will get to the point where progress is prohibitive without better gear and experience this confines you to a smaller area at the beginning of the game but gradually opens up later as you become more powerful so you will still have a challenge personally i could argue on either side about this mechanic but in a way it helps keep the game fresh so i like it the entire perk system has been overhauled instead of choosing between 2 or 3 perks every time you level up there s an entire chart that you can pick from perks are now based on your s p e c i a l stats the more points you have in any given s p e c i a l stat will determine what perks are unlocked for you on the chart you can also put perk points directly into your s p e c i a l stats instead of getting a perk which will in turn unlock more perks for you to pick later the best part no level cap that means you can theoretically max out every single perk in the entire game and have max s p e c i a l stats need i say more finally like all open world bethesda games the modding community is absolutely fantastic the rule 34 of bethesda games goes something like this if you can imagine it someone has made a mod out of it yes those mods too normally i wouldn t consider mods a selling point of the game because typically speaking the game itself has to stand up to the developer s standards and the players expectations however bethesda has a long history of not only allowing mods for their game but also inviting and encouraging the modding community to make them modding is accessible to everyone with the g e c k the modding tool that bethesda includes in their fallout games the nexus mods website www nexusmods com has tons of user created content and mods for you to tailor the game experience to your tastes overall fallout 4 is a great game i was skeptical of it at first i ve come to like it a lot more maybe even more than fallout 3 it s stayed faithful to the series made some new innovations and despite botching a few things still provides a great experience for fallout fans and action rpg fans alike 9 10 i highly recommend fallout 4 to just about anyone
