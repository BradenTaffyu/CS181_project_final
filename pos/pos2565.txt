2023 product received for free how to use a battlepass business model after making your past prequels a popular hit and telling your fans that you are taking a casual stance of development without telling them you are taking a casual stance towards further sequel development financial motive aside limbus company can be considered a side story that intends to fill up the remaining missing lore from its past 2 prequels utilising ruina s combat system with new approach as well as delivering more theorycrafting possibilities via loadouts as a consequence to integrate itself towards the gacha industry to hope that gacha whalers fills up pm s revenue quicker than the first day of lor which it did the game may have suffered a bit of a reputation check where i would say it did a 5 6 dice requirement vibe check fail the sacrifices were that mobile integration shows poor optimization as if pc code were just a copy paste onto an emulating converter onto the mobile network environment where phones can become lavanite used to cook eggs the benefit though considered applicable solely with pc alone is that by being a gacha game aside from getting gacha whale community s revenue the game allows itself for fluid constant update with the utilisation of battlepass as it develops its content a very general business model that relies on loyal subscription to keep its revenue flow which usually out ranks most traditional pc game without a battlepass model and solely do steam update patch fixes like one of those typical indie survival game that said theres not much monetization thats truly applicable towards the aspects of p2w either with no challenge ranking or pvp bracket reward that separates its community for favoritism the packages offered diverges in 4 6 options besides the battlepass where all of them offers items that can eventually be obtained under rational pacing as well as rationally reflected requirement to climb that pacing through the game s difficulty purchasing all the packages gives you a quicker progression than other players but that does not really shine in anyway when taking account of its past 2 prequels series the package is there to let mostly rich players to spend less time to get over 90 of the deck with slightly better combat outcome for leveling and progression the time cut short does reflect the price of the packages a bit below my rationalized standard opinion its a game worth to followup if you ve played its past 2 prequels especially when its free but it definitely won t cater to a majority of the gacha players the hype that lasts almost a year onto the gacha community is not something i can represent and apologize for given how people can be desperate to cope and keep their favourite game alive but that favoritism towards this genre isn t as flexible as you think project moon s niche shines at where their story and lore are delivered through the right and wrong troupes where if you think about it most gacha adopts to with their typical amnesia main protagonist pm is just one of the korean indie devs that adopted to it since way back what distinguish itself from this aspect is the lore that does not simply stick to the typical post apocalyptic or generic fantasy setting but the concept revolving around the city each of its nest across the 26 districts with their own bizzare culture demographic determinant constructs and survival practices to follow through strictly due to the existence of abnormalities which stresses humanity for absolute control and consequential thoughts to mostly disturbing if not dark and gorey conclusions if you re a casual gacha players that prefer graphical cheerful generic post apocalypse or fantasy cool representation of cinematics and whatnot limbus company is not the place to do so there are better place you can spend your precious time on which i respect if you re a project moon hardcore fan feel free to hype and keep sharing the game s development and process like a normal player does while supporting the game if you re new to gaming world and just wants to try out free game limbus company might be a small gacha that can be considered a tamed practice ground to understand how gacha works though with very complicated combat system you won t find in many many many other games mobile or pc alike waves at grindblue and fgo if you re a rich whales by all means no one can doctrine the way you spend feel free to keep supporting the game and make pm fans happy in the future outlook the gameplay may not cater to your preferences by a tons as i personally assume but i will respect your whaling behaviour regardless of whatever games you ve experienced out there i am just an ordinary gamer that plays everything and anything taking proper perspective on spending vs quality as commendation or critics alike and limbus company is one that falls at 7 1 10 considered as a stepping stone at this early stage perhaps i am just coping and hoping it is but it may not be where limbus company may as well be an end instead of a side continuation most of the scores are carried by the fact the game recycles from its past lore and conceptual art as well as the combat gameplay delivery which may be considered difficult for new project moon players who thought it d deserves more though in terms of new perspective in immersion and uniqueness it is non existent the rest of the negativity scoring revolves back to its gacha integration delivery which is a given based from 19 of the mobile gachas i ve played from experience and i refuse to offer any bit of review on that when it comes to gacha
