2023 what s funny about this gacha game is that rather than using luancy the in game currency to pull gachas it is actually more worth it to burn lunacy for stamina and grind mirror dungeons which gives you enough shards to choose a character you want the optimal way to play this gacha game is to not pull the gacha how ironic but i still pulled the gacha anyway cuz project moon just give away free lunacy like it s tap water story is amazing gameplay is interesting combat is satisfying the character design and their story building is one of the best part of this game and above all else the memes are amazing the odyssey had a purpose
