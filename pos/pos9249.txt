2018 i played endless space 2 for months now so i decide to try stellaris while i find endless space 2 much easier to get into stellaris for me shown already that it can be played repeatedly without getitng boring which endless space 2 fail to do for example in endless space 2 you have only established factions including the minor factions so you know how to react to each faction by the end of your first succesful campagin meanwhile in stellaris the ai factions are randomly generate so you always have to be on your toe in my first 2 hours of playing as the united nation aka earth i have the luck of trying to learn the mechanics of the game and being an idiot i am i didn t pause the game at the fastest speed too as much as i should have so with my luck in paradox games the first ai faction i met were lovely insectiods who adore slavery and war let say my meager fleet of just 5 corvtes couldn t stop humanity from being enslaved only after their first fifty years in interspace travel
