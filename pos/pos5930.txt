so far the game is a huge improvement from last year s pc version alot of new features and has been running very smooth haven t got to test playing park or rec yet but the my career games have been fun so far and the city looks great the only thing that s missing is crossplay with console hoping to get more time in the game to get a more in depth review but so far i m happy with this years version last year set the bar pretty low for pc
