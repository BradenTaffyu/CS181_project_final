2017 up to level 4 iv ships the game is fun and you feel like you accomplish alot once you get that iv level ship you have to decide if you want to start really grinding the problem is the difference between a level iv ship player and a level v 5 player is that a players will get put into games with high level v all the way to low level iv or even iii if you are a iii or a iv and come up against a level v player you are toast they can snipe you from distances that you can t even detect them from and if they hit your ship 80 or more of your hp are gone in an instant if you want to grind past iv be prepared to run away from level v ships a lot or get extremely frustrated if you are okay with grinding like a mother after level 4 then go for it however don t be surprised to find all the enjoyment and sense of accomplishment you were getting before to vanish once you hit level 4 ships one thing to consider is this game is always being adjusted and tweaked for example before the last patch a destroyer dd basically a fast but weak ship with torpedoes could reliably fire off a salvo of torpedoes at the ai with about a 70 to 50 chance of at least 1 or 2 of the torpedoes hitting the ship if you played correctly however the ai now seems to have a 6th sense and immediatly knows when you launch torpedoes at them and can counter them i have recorded two instances where i was less than 100 feet 30 yards from a ship broadside launched torpedoes and they magically where able to twist their ship to miss evey single torpedo lanuched i had launched six in two sets of spreads so you need to understand what worked good for you this week might not work at all next time you log on not so much an issue on lower tiers but when they expect grinding and even money from you at higher levels that shouldn t be a thing now this isn t really an issue in pvp as the players lucky don t have ai subroutines that cheat but the ai is clearly cheating to a point after the latest patches mid dec 2017
