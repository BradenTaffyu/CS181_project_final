2023 i m a 56 yr old gamer i ve played aoe since it s first game all those years ago i like how aoe upgraded their ai and added to the gaming experience i m half ways through the game but i can t wait till the mongol missions i really like the khan missions in aoe 1 2 so i am excited to see how they play out in this new version of aoe and their way of making it more true to the history more nomadic no castles aoe iv has a new vibe to it but as an old school aoe player i m really liking it
