2018 this is my first steam review for a game and frostpunk is so good i had to leave some feedback tldr amazing game with free content updates for 30 is a must buy summary frostpunk is a city building survival sim that takes place in steampunk late 19th century the world is suffering from a new ice age forcing a mass migration to equatorial countries this effect has caused massive food shortages violence and overcrowding in the remaining warm climates betting that surviving the cold is a more likely option england has established and supplied a handful of arctic cities based around a massive central generators as large coal deposits are still present and the wildlife is more acclimated to the already harsh environment you are tasked with keeping the generator running to supply heat and survive the ever dropping temperatures while workers and engineers produce food harvest building materials scout the surrounding area for supplies and survivors and research new technologies keep civilization alive by passing new laws to deal with the harsh reality of your new environment manage the expectations of your citizens by raising hope and quelling discontent or they will banish you to the arctic waste setting the steampunk setting is beautifully designed and animated and has a very industrial revolution feel with some advanced technology you can find and build automatons that will work your buildings on a 24 hour shift at a slightly lower output per hour these brilliantly animated machines are amazing to watch work build and refuel as they traverse your city the arctic looks and feels real with giant glaciers protecting the city from harsh winds this combined with the constant snow and sound design actually makes me feel cold while playing the main theme and background music are brilliantly written and orchestrated and never left me feeling like it was overplayed as a scenario ends the music comes to a crescendo that adds a whole new level of tension as society teeters on the brink of destruction gameplay you will have to first gather basic materials from the refuse left behind during the generator s construction to even construct tents to live in building and researching new ways to pull coal wood and steel from the environment is the next order of business to keep the city expanding set up hunters huts and cookhouses to keep the city fed while you improve the economy build and staff medical posts to treat the sick and amputate frostbitten limbs build a beacon to scout the surrounding area for additional survivors that were separated during the storm and expedition north and search for the other established cities upgrade your generator and build steam hubs to combat the ever dropping temperatures the populations attitude is displayed as two bars on the bottom of the screen discontent and hope if your living and working conditions are too harsh discontent will raise if too many people die or too many promises are broken then hope will fall if you mismanage this they will banish you to die in the cold and elect a new leader these bars can be managed by passing laws such as extended shifts and tighter food rationing to stretch your resources even further institute fighting arenas and pubs to keep your population distracted from their terrible fate and legalize dueling to resolve conflicts and allow people to blow off steam decide whether you would rather put the children to work or send them to children s homes during the day are you going to build a cemetery and properly bury the dead or are you just going to throw the bodies of your friends and neighbors into a snow pit at the midway point of the first scenario the population will suffer a terrible emotional blow at this point a new set of laws can be passed will you look toward order to build guard posts and designate formans to hold society together or will you seek purpose from a higher power and establish churches and evening prayer take either of these choices too far and you may become a fascist dictator or an unquestionable cult leader who uses force to keep the population under your rule based on the laws you pass and choices you make can determine whether you get a good or bad ending story the game is primarily based around four scenarios the story in these scenarios is amazing and the realizations and twists while playing kept me engaged and caring about my people and their fate all content can be played on one of four difficulty settings with an optional iron man checkbox a new home to preserve civilisation from the chaos of its own downfall we have fled to the end of the world we will have to adapt to survive who will we become in the process the arks as the brightest minds of oxford and cambridge we have been sent to save priceless seed and plant specimens from the eternal winter do we have what it takes to keep the seedling arks safe the refugees the safety of the generator was reserved for the wealthy we seized it so we could build a city where people are equal but can we accept everyone who comes to seek shelter new free content updatesthe fall of winterhome we ve built our city to survive the long winter now we have to fight against time to save it and our lives from impending doom endless mode comes in two flavors and three maps one is a relaxed city builder with infrequent storms that lets you design the perfect city and the other is a brutal survival as you struggle to gather enough resources to make it through the frequent storms and random negative events final notes i was unfamiliar with 11 bit and picked this game up at release after watching twitch streams i was completely blown away with how good it was while you could reasonably finish all four current scenarios in 20 25 hours i just kept coming back for more i never gave a damn about achievements but the additional challenge in unlocking them is great in this game the developer has released 2 major content updates for free i am so used to paying 10 for a portrait pack in ck2 and stellaris that free was a foreign concept i can t say enough about how good this game is
