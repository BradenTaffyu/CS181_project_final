2013 early access review if you ve ever watched read a zombie thriller and thought that you yourself could do better than its characters at surviving a zambo apocanips here s your chance p zomboid offers what seems to be the most complete zombie survival experience with graphics there is by providing a huge amount of elements that range from putting yourself together on day 0 and scavenging for supplies to stabilishing a fortified farm house months later everything in between included a sandbox mode allows you to create your own apocalypse to survive by permitting you to edit the zombie lore and behavior along with map conditions despite being far from finished the game is very much enjoyable in its current state and has a fair amount of big features yet to be impletemented such as online multiplayer npc survivors interactivity along with many more crafting options having been in production for years along with getting an engine reboot the development has been picking up a faster pace in the last few months and doesn t seem to be halting anytime soon with its ample modding support project zomboid just might end up being the next big thing one that is definitely worth picking up at its currently discounted dev price 15 there is also a demo of the current build available which is worth checking out special thanks to gangan for being such a charitable brassknuckles wielding monk
