2017 as a steam member since 2004 and with over 450 titles registered to my account the fact that this sits as my most played game in terms of hours shows just how good i think this is an excellent colony sim that manages to make you care for each individual in your colony like they are family not only the humans either your husky called brian will touch you in a way you never thought possible until of course he gets shot to death by a cyborg centipede because you forgot to tell him he must stay inside you then go to bed in tears and your wife will think you are about to ask for a divorce but that s another story the graphics are charming and work really well for the title is it battlefield 5 running on the frostbite engine no but it was never meant to be i do get some frame drops however when a colony has a large number of family members around 15 but this isn t the kind of game where every fps matters and it is not detrimental to the games enjoyment the vanilla game should see you happy for around 60 70 hours but allowing workshop mods was a masterstroke from the dev grab a few of these for another 50 hours of fun when it starts to get a bit samey go looking for some new ones and repeat the cycle does not really get old there are some issues with ai routing at times and micro management is required to combat these but personally i kind of like being in control so its not a big problem there is also a steepish learning curve for new players and the wiki will almost always be required but stick with it once you get over the initial what the hell am i doing phase the game is a true masterpiece an absolute 10 10 cannot recommend it enough a big thank you to ludeon studios for making the best game i never knew i needed
