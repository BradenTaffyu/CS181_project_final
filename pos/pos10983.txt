2023 game is already starting to feel more stable after the second patch cs ii has a surprising and impressive level of detail and nuance the cities really start to feel very alive once you get going definitely a lot of fun even coming from the original a couple of things i ve learned when you see rent is too high you generally just need to up the density of the zones seems obvious but it took me a minute to figure that out parking seems to be very important for cs ii if you start zoning medium or high density residential commercial it s very important to make sure to have some extra parking lots cars will just drive around aimlessly for hours looking for parking if they can t find any education is pretty important make sure to build the elementary schools high schools and colleges as soon as they are unlocked income will massively increase once citizens start to get educated especially at the college level garbage works a little bit differently in cs ii the incinerators still seem to be a bit buggy but it s not gameplay breaking co has acknowledged this apparently the next patch will fix it just zone a landfill and expand the zone for now it ll work fine service range seems to be a lot better in cs ii no need to plaster the map with crematoriums and incinerators anymore just one or two will usually do massively improved over cs1 make sure to check the air pollution map before zoning industrial wind direction impacts where the pollution will go the traffic ai is pretty advanced cars use all available lanes traffic accidents happen in congested areas and cims even get lost sometimes really neat to see the depth of the simulation although do note it takes a little bit of getting use to some of the strategies that worked for cs1 might be different for cs ii i m still learning how to manage traffic it s definitely different in cs ii you can still get the nice avenues with trees in cs2 but you need to go into the road tools and add them from there by default they re built without the trees but it s still possible to get them they look pretty nice once they have them of course the downside is that you lose parking on the road by doing this so make sure you have extra parking lots in busier areas the game still has some bugs it s not necessarily perfect at this point in time but i also definitely didn t feel like any of the issues were remotely gameplay breaking after the second patch the game is a lot of fun and definitely feels like it s going to be a great successor to the original especially once you get familiar with how cs ii does things
