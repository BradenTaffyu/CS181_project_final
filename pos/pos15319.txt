2021 great game perfect for solo and multi player although i recomend playing it with friends it makes the game more interesting don t starve together loves to throw unexpected stuff at you the first times you play and because of this i recomend playing without guides and seeing how far you can get eventually you will have to look up guides so don t feel discouraged in doing so i guess the only downside to this game is that there isn t any tutorial in game you are just thrown in the world to survive it s a lot of trial and error but once you get accostumed with the game mechanics surviving becomes super easy and new frontiers of challenges open like the end game boss fights and such the variety of characters is really nice too even having mod characters on the workshop don t feel scared to try any character even if you think the disadvantages are too much sometimes the risk is worth it tldr definitely recomended a lot of trial and error but really fun to figure out great roaster and overall a great time with friends and or alone
