2017 yet another great total war game which makes it a pretty nice run for developers ca now following the excellent attila and first warhammer game the vortex campaign provides a welcome change from the generic domination campaigns from game 1 at release though it has to be said the later dlc campaigns for that game were far superior even when compared to this vortex story which can still become a bit of a slog towards the end but i m being picky this is a warhammer fans dream the four factions are lovingly created with only a few units from the tabletop game missing the battles are a real feast for the eyes you must zoom in at times to see it in action and appreciate the level of detail that cas artists have managed to cram in i would love a unit painter though just a thought as a tabletop gamer who was disappointed to see what warhammer fantasy battles has become games workshop have basically hit the reset button wfb might as well not exist anymore it s heartening to see the old model brought to life here the ai is passable but total war fans and most average strategy gamers aren t going to find a challenge on normal mode it s too easy to give yourself an economic advantage in the campaign mode which means your armies are always going to be far superior when you get to the battles now personally i like to win all the time and feel like a boss but maybe hard will be the sweet spot for the rest of you overall another fantastic total war game if you love total war you won t be disappointed if you love warhammer this really is your only option on pc edit yeah i ll vote this for the labor of love award since they keep adding more and more awesome stuff
