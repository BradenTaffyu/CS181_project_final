2021 early access review take the best parts of satisfactory add the best parts of factorio and add a planetary annihilation feel to the interplanetary possibly inter stellar i haven t gotten too far at the time of this review yet travel that s dsp even though its early access right now it feels pretty solid i experienced no real bugs no crashes there are some localizing and language issues for now but that will obviously be flushed out on final release pros if you like factorio satisfactory or the feel of planetary annihilation stop reading this now and just buy it it s calming and just feels good cons still early access so some language in the settings are a bit off this will obviously get fixed as production continues expect this game to take a long long time to master it s much bigger than factorio and there s far more things to do at the sale price it s currently at this would be an automatic buy
