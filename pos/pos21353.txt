2019 early access review i have been waiting for this game for ages and when i saw it was early access i immediately got it the gameplay is so much fun the game does crash a lot but that s to be expected for such an amazing game also the game does lag if i put down too many units down but i do use the worst computer in existence anyway the game is so much fun also i see they did an update so maybe it will stop crashing cannot wait for more updates and if the update made the game stop crashing then that will be the only problem i had with the game gone i totally recommend this game if you want to have some hilarious combat also there is actually some strategy involved and that is my review for the game i hope you found it helpful and it makes you want to buy the game yourself edit alright so i just posted this review and then played the game and i just want to make a suggestion please nerf the crows they one shot every single unit also the update did fix the crashing between levels for me but for some reason it crashes sometimes when i press the quit button i don t know why but it just makes quitting the game when i get bored take longer but keep up the good work love the game another edit alright so the crows don t one shot every single unit but they kill them pretty darn fast another another edit omg dude this new update is amazing ok so i got all of the secret units and ok just trust me put a ton of cheerleaders with mace spinners just trust me it is cool last edit ok so the freezing when i tried to quit the game turned from a mild inconvenience to a huge inconvenience i just tried to quit and it made my entire computer freeze i had to sign out to get it to work pleaase fix it
