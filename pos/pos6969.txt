2019 early access review pros amazing gameplay decent graphics fun and addictive easy to play lots of optionsoverall it is an amazing game with without friends and you can easily spend hours on it i personally don t think as an early access it should be priced 15 00 but on the flip side of the coin i think i have had 15 00 worth of fun out of it cons some cons of the game is that there is now official end for some players this would be ideal but for some other players this would be a pain as you have no main goal to complete after a while the game kinda starts to feel like the same thing always having to watch your hydration and hunger which can get a little boring and tedious loading time it might just be my pc but sometimes when joining someones raft i get a bit of lag and a long loading wait which is annoying requests shark variety that every time you kill the shark it didn t respawn back the exact same one and we could have maybe have 3 different variants of shark e g different colours textures shape and size also maybe the different sharks could do different amounts of damage to the player do i think you should get the game if you are into survival and base building games i think you will like this if you enjoy games like rust ark survival evovled and possibly even minecraft you will also like this game because the are very similar multiple rafts you could have a mini port or docking station on your raft and then there could be an option to craft a much smaller raft so you could anchor up your main base and then go exploring islands with the one you crafted also you would not be able to carry the raft once you placed it and once destroyed you would only be able to recover a few materials back i also think it would be good if the shark could also bite the craft able one too shark trap you could craft toxic shark decoy that would be quite difficult to make as it would be very powerful the reason for this would be to throw it in and the shark biting it thinking it was the usual bait and getting a nasty surprise and dying so you could dive down near an island and have lots of time to gather resources to make it more difficult you would not be able to get shark mean or a shark head from the body dogs to possibly have dogs to act as guards where they would be found on an island as a puppy you help it grow until it becomes a dog and then you can let it out and when the shark attacks your boat the dog will proceed to attack the shark back and on your command sit when dogs hp is low character customisation when you first download raft you should be able to make your own character i e skin tones hair style and basic clothing because at the moment customisation is very limited copper tool set wood stone copper quicker stronger copper spear would do much more damage to the shark and a copper axe would gather more resources compass and map a map that shows you were friends are and when a friend needs reviving the map could pulsate in the location in which your friend is in so you could go rescue them and a compass would be helpful to locate other rafts new game mode public servers where any raft players can join and you can build your own raft and either team with fellow rafters of attack and steal their items for yourself steam engine away to travel in raft faster i think it would be good if it wasn t craftable and you had to recover it from a shipwreck and you could place it on your raft and you would have to gather materials to repair it and then finally use it carryable ladder climbing gear when exploring islands it would be so handy to be able to scale boulders and cliffs and you could carry the ladder and lean it up against what you want to get to the top and if the rock face is unsuitable for a ladder climbing gear would be ideal inhabited islands when visiting island it would be cool if there were people on there living in shed and tree houses and the could all act differently some could be aggressive and you have to capture them or kill them and then raid their village once captured you should be able to put them in a crate on your raft for them to stay in and they could help you spearing the shark water plants and much more some islanders could be friendly and they could help you and maybe give you hints on what s on the island
