2017 you know those games that are just a few tweaks away of greatness the original original sin was that kind of game it had modernised crpg mechanics great combat lots of choices on how to get on with the world wonderful crafting yet cumbersome ui and a muddled story even with the enhancements later released original sin 2 tries to rectify all those mistakes for my detailed review check this out starters it has a more straightforward and darker storyline and writing the ui has been refined and is a lot more accessible character creation customistaion companions are all great general gameplay is still solid packing deep environmental interaction in out combat fun crafting and exciting turn based combat with good animations classes are varied and many and balanced very well pretty much all lines are voice acted and they do a decent job same with the soundtrack challenging tactician difficulty in which the game should be played normal being too easy game master mode for pnp rpg simulation and co op is fun as always game looks great with a more grounded art style this time around mod support i felt the streamlining of rpg attributes and skills from the first game is a bit of a let down although they allow less trial error playthroughs the crafting seems to have been downplayed this time around they have taken out the skills related to crafting and some fun recipes normal difficulty is way too easy at least in the first chapter tactician mode felt cheap in some aspect like when it gives enemy ridiculous amount of physical and magical armor in the first game higher diffiiculty meant more enemies and smarter a i tl dr orignal sin 2 easily takes it s place as one of the greatest crpgs ever along with baldur s gate fallout wasteland planescape torment etc and at the same time possess mastery over it s technical aspects something the afforementioned games never did possess
