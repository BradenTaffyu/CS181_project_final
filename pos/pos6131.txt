2020 base game 9 out of 10 but i m dlc biaseddlc great gameplay but absolutely destroyed by price 5 out of 10for full package game collectors hard 4 out of 10 readme if you have this with any dlc on origin so i have an odd special review for people in the odd predicament where they already have this on origin with a ton of the dlc already if you have it on origin and you already have a collossal ass ton of dlc on there you can actually buy the base game here on steam and origin will add all the dlc you do not have to buy the dlc twice if your wanting to go from origin to steam only the base game the price of the base game has nothing against the price of all the dlc as i m sure you may know as it currently stands half my dlc is from origin and the other half is here on steam so i know it works you do gotta tinker a lil ignore my playtime by the way as i ve played a bit on origin if you do do this i recommend on the sims 4 store page here on steam clicking the dropdown arrow on all the dlc you already own on origin and click ignore which greys them out on steam to kinda indicate to yourself you already have them on origin it really helps any confusion and keeps you from accidentally double dipping dlc lol as far as the game review itself goes it genuinely is a really great game but stupid stupid stupid expensive if you want the whole package with all dlc while i recommend the game and dlc i also at the same time cannot in good conscience say that the price involving the dlc is at all fair not even close not even a teeny tiny bit i am honestly as appalled and disgusted by the price of the dlc as i possibly can be it literally doesn t get worse than this just putting that out there xd if you must and are r zy like me for the love of gaben wait for the dlc to go on sale as low as it can frikkin go if your a game collector that seeks the full package from your games then ea developers are gonna bend you over and buttfk you with an xl spiked strapon no lube if i could make a neutral review i would gameplay alone is great but its extremely difficult to ignore let alone forgive that eye sore tacky bright pink polkadotted elephant in the room lol steamsalty
