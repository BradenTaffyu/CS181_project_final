2021 i have always been a big total war fan i played the original rome total war back in the day then enjoyed playing medieval 2 total war rome 2 continues providing me with hours of entertainment the only real suggestion i have for anyone who hasn t played this game yet is this wait for it to go on sale rome 2 total war is not worth it if you re paying full price for it especially if you re buying to the ridiculously up charged dlcs wait for it to go on sale
