2020 i think wastelands has made all the difference to this title i am now addicted and cant stop playing i am a little disappointed that the developers are giving in to the qq community and removing the negative effects of not having food and drink so moving the game away from a survival lite experience to a complete survival free experience i just hope they do not give in to the same whiners who want no lootable junk drop on death and even bigger junk storage thus removing any further challenge to the game at the moment the game is rewarding if you invest time to learn its mechanics
