2017 american truck simulatoramerican truck simulator is rather like euro truck simulator 2 but put in america what do you do you start off simple you start off driving other company trucks and deliver them at a slow rate of income eventually you can keep doing so as in quick jobs and keep earning money or if you re rather impatient you could start taking either a loan for a new truck to increase your income by hauling with your own equipment you ll earn a lot more and level up for new perks then you can eventually expand upgrading your garage and hiring drivers and so on now as i ve stated american truck simulator is like euro truck simulator but placed in america as start of the game you can only drive through 3 states that are included without dlc california nevada arizonanew dlc new mexico oregon washington utahalthough the progress scs have been made the game is still lacking on what it can hold understanding the issue scs is having is adding new trucks due to licensing they need permission to put them in the game i m sure at some time we ll get new trucks to purchase in game as i continue to wait until this very day although only a few trucks are available for the moment there are still a lot of customization just like in euro truck simulator 2 also note if you ve purchased the wheel tuning pack from ets2 you get it free for ats is there mod support if desired scs has allowed the steam workshop to be compatable with american and euro truck simulators so you can simply add mod s such as trucks configurations and so on final verdictoverall i ve spent hours within playing this game i still come back to it each time they update it i can say that the game does however feel like an early release i feel like they ve released ats too early then it should of been but still this game right now is just marvelous wonder landscapes the cities are well done so far overall the game will be limited just starting out and will require extra money for states
