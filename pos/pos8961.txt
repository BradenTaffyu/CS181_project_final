2019 read this section only if you are unaware of the option to revert to previous versions or think it no longer exists otherwise skip to the next section of this review ok first and foremost many of the negative ratings happened recently compare recent views with all reviews the reason for this is that the le guin update 2 2 has left a sour taste in a lot of people s mouths because it makes several of the dlc s extremely nerfed i e robots do not reproduce as quickly and devs even admit to making robots specifically more powerful when coupled with organics so it clearly makes synthetic dawn a completely useless dlc since there s no way you can compete with organic based empires even for the ai it s impossible in all of the games i played with 2 2 the robot empires are always destroyed within the first 150 years it also nerfs the apocalypse dlc from what i understand i actually don t own it so i can t confirm it myself anyways a lot of people don t like update 2 2 i like it myself though i do like the fact they made syncretic evolution and mechanist civics basically more powerful due to the economic changes it makes it necessary to have more than one species on your planet so that one can specialize as specialists and the other specialize as workers at least that s what i tend to do that said whenever i do want to play a robot only empire sometimes i just really like the idea i revert back to an old version thing is it seems like many of the reviewers here do not realize that yes you can revert back to an older version however it can t be done in the old way due to new rules from the eu it has nothing to do with paradox except for the fact paradox is based in sweden so it has to follow laws passed by the eu paradox has always been about allowing you to revert back to older versions the process for doing this is a little more complicated than simply right clicking on the game and looking at the list of betas unfortunately as that will be empty so you have to find a password to allow you to go to a previous version but paradox is completely open on sharing those passwords here s a link on what to do yeah don t let 2 2 ruin the game for you if it s not your cup of tea just revert to a previous version man the game is absolutely great imo i ve never played a better space building exploration game before and paradox is a great company i own probably 80 of the games they ve made and they are always cool about mods and allowing you to revert to previous versions they re always very mod friendly and consumer friendly most of the complaints i see about paradox shouldn t be there if they knew it wasn t their fault i see some complaining about not being able to revert to old versions but that isn t paradox s fault and they do in fact explain in the above link on how to revert it s the eu that is behind this be sure to try it out before giving the game a bad review just because 2 2 isn t your cup of tea although i see where you re coming from because that version does seem to nerf several of the dlcs read this for my overall ratings of the game in different sections otherwise skip to bottom to see a rating of the general game ok stellaris is a great space exploration economic strategy game i ll go ahead and give ratings 1 10 on various areas attention to detail 9 10 honestly there is so much detail in this game from being able to see lights of cities on the planets to complex movements of space ships and a strikingly beautiful galaxy map that can be zoomed into with great detail the only reason i do not give it a 10 is because there are mods that improve these things even further if it wasn t possible to improve this further i would have given it a 10 but obviously i can t rate it perfect since those mods have proven it can get even better with the mods such as beautiful universe planetary diversity and several others that make ship movements and strategies even more complex it is easily a 10 so you can make the game perfect when it comes to detail with such mods graphics in general 9 10 it really kind of goes along with attention to detail graphics again would be perfect with beautiful universe mod though user interface 5 10 this is where the game can get really confusing especially for first time players honestly there were things i realized i missed even being a seasoned player some stuff i just discovered a month ago and i owned the game for like 4 years you gotta get used to all the tabs and the vanilla game doesn t show you majority of the options in a tab everything is too enlarged this again however is improved by mods i recommend ui overhaul 1080p economic strategy 4 10 early versions 8 10 latest version prior to i think the 2 0 update i was very disappointed in how the economics portion of this game was done in comparison to other paradox interactive games it was far too simplified to me hearts of iron victoria all of these games were far more interested economics wise victoria i d give a 10 10 for economics with hoi probably a 9 10 early stellaris was so boring economically i couldn t stomach to play it that long i went an entire year with a break from it because i enjoyed other paradox games far more it might just be my opinion that the economics portion matters maybe you don t care for that but anyways economics used to be handled by simplistic pops there weren t really specific job types like there are now if i recall correctly it was also far too easy to become economically strong trade was lackluster i don t believe there was trade value in the previous versions honestly i don t recall all the things the earlier versions didn t have but i remember it just being boring but the 2 0 update really boosted the economics aspect of this game it s the reason i came back to it military strategy 7 10 early versions 9 10 late versions as i recall the early versions of this game didn t have technology specifically allowing how your ships act in battle so it was a little limiting in that regard the newer versions improved the ability to make different ships specialize in one type of strategy over others there are also mods to improve this from a 9 10 to a 10 10 too by the way comment if you want to know them roleplaying 9 10 honestly i feel like i spent half of my time in this game doing species creation it s far too fun to create different empires and species i almost feel like it s half the game lol could just be my opinion though not everyone enjoys having to create species over and over and then it s fun to deal with other empires in a way you believe that species would this is something i suppose that is all up to you on whether it would be fun again there are lots of mods out there which can give you more options too particularly some that give you realistic government forms ones that actually exist or have existedthe only paradox game i d rate higher for roleplaying is probably tyranny but that is certainly understandable considering its intent was to be an rpg and i d probably put it on a different scale when comparing other rpg s to tyranny diplomacy 7 10 this is no europa universalis that s for sure eu was the best paradox game for diplomatic exchanges but this is still better than hearts of iron when it comes to diplomacy which i would have rated at a 5 nonetheless there are quite a few ways to deal with other empires such as technology sharing forming a federation insulting them forming defensive pacts protectorates etc general ratingi think that covers it for most areas so here is my overall rating of the game for v2 0 or later 9 10 prior to v2 0 probably a 6 10
