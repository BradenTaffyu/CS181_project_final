2022 if you like the games this draws inspiration from especially ogre battle march of the black queen then you ll probably be happy to see this entry in the subgenre easy to learn hard to master fair class selection with some additional unique characters advanced play will find you using a lot of the small mechanics that exist within the game in an interestingly wide array of applications without it feeling like it s shoehorned in offers permadeath mode and non permadeath mode to suit your preference most of the things you do feel rewarding being able to combine an increasing number of unique leaders into very powerful individual units as the game progresses is a cool option to steadily unlock stefan raskuja and narima makes for an insanely strong offensive ambush unit for example decent item variety and great item relevance some story points hit with emotional depth a la tactics ogre well thought out map design on most maps some story beads seem genuinely stupid cliche or both simultaneously characterization is generally cliche in my opinion but it s not all bad only playable large classes characters are dragon rider s playable monster diversity is sorely needed some specific things that happen in the game and grant the player more combat options should probably happen earlier getting every tech by the end of a playthrough ultimately homogenizes your tech choices rating 8 10 really like the game after first playthrough i started skipping all cutscenes gameplay is great if you ve been looking for anything even remotely like this you will probably be as happy as i was while playing it
