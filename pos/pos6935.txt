2020 for months i ignored this game misjudging it as a cheap copy of subnautica but boy i was wrong while subnautica makes you go underwater this on keeps you on surface raft duh but the game keeps the surface survival as challenging as any other game in the genre no thanks to that f g shark its a very fun game takes sometime in getting used to once you get the mechanics its easy sailing there after another thing i like about this game is that it runs well on almost all system my potato gt 1030 keep this at 80 fps at normal setting since the game is still evolving no complaints here it s 2022 and the game is still awesome
