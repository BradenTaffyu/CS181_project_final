2020 this is easily one of the best games i ve played the story is a true masterpiece that takes place over 3 play throughs each from a different character s perspective the game has 26 different endings one of them being the 1 true ending which will leave those who are deeply invested in the story a shocking end one thing that really surprised me was how awesome the soundtrack is i m not someone who cares about soundtracks in games but this one is definitely an exception it s amazing the combat system on all 3 characters i enjoyed a lot and while i didn t really care at first for the hacking feature in play through 2 i ended up really enjoying it as there was more to it than i originally thought while i am giving this game well deserved praise i need to mention that there is an issue with the resolution when you start up the game but it always corrects itself for me after a few minutes and the other con is unfortunately cut scenes only run at 30fps there is a well know mod that fixes both these issues which you can find pretty easily with a google search as a fan of drakengard on the ps2 this was an epic conclusion to the series i really hope that they port over the rest of the series to steam this is by far one of the easiest recommends i ve ever given
