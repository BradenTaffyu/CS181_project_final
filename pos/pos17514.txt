2016 before anything else i should say that i have been a total war fan since shogun i and i have played every single total war with the exception of attila total war warhammer is the most fun i ve had playing a total war game by far since release 3 weeks ago i ve put aver 100 hours into the game and have finished the dwarf orc and empire campaigns before this i could probably count on one hand the number of times i finished a total war campaign the factions in previous total war games mostly felt the same so you would play one or two factions and have a pretty good idea of how the others played in this game all factions have totally unique units and play styles when i first heard that the game was announced i was skeptical i m a big history nerd and while i m a fan of some fantasy i was not really into warhammer at all but creative assembly proved me wrong total war and warhammer were made for eachother the fantasy setting makes things seem so much more epic and the dread and constant warfare of warhammer is a perfect setting for a total war game when i saw my stout little dwarfs go up against barbarous orcs and huge monsters i felt like there is a much more desperate life or death feel to the combat kinda like i m the romans holding back barbarians from taking over civilization except i think being ruled by huns would be much more preferable then being eaten by an orc i also love the hero system you really grow attached to your heroes and your armies whereas before each general in total war more or less felt the same i encountered no technical issues and the game ran surprisingly smooth at launch unlike alot of other total war titles the ai which is a weak part of almost all total war games may be the best that it s ever been now for the cons players need to be able to choose where to deploy their reinforcements on the battle map i had a few battles where my reinforcing army and the enemy reinforcements deployed at the same spot which led to a huge disorganized battle breaking out on the edge of the map this turned what should have been an easy victory into a decisive defeat also the ai spends too much emphasis on agent actions which leads to ai agents that are way too powerful by end game while the ai agents are way too powerful the composition of end game ai armies is mostly made up of low quality early game units the result is that dealing with ai agents is extremely difficult but player armies become steam rollers by end game anyway good job creative assembly rome ii and empire really kind of turned me off from buying total war games at launch but you won my confidence back
