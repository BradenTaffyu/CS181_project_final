early access review i hardly ever write reviews for anything but i had to write one for this game i am at 47 hours and cannot stop playing i had to speak up regarding the people who down voted the game because they say it is repetitive duh you run a supermarket you handle shipping and stocking the warehouse it s part of running the store personally i find that part of the game enjoyable i like restocking the warehouse and organizing the layout if you don t like repetition don t ruin the ratings of the game because you should honestly assume there is going to be a lot of repetition in such a game speaking to the creator please do not give up on this game i would love to see the additions you have planned listed on the main menu
