2020 i found out about this game by pure accident my friend had life is strange 2 on their wishlist and i checked the franchise out it quirked my interest but that was nearly two years ago then not long ago i caught a cold and i saw that first episode is for free so i said you know what let me finally check it out and oh boy i bought all five episodes instantly unfortunately the game had to wait over a month for me to find time to turn it on then i finally did yesterday afternoon and i pulled an all nighter the story is captivating i actually couldn t sleep until i finished it whew i m still recouperating it was so good don t let the intro fool you this game holds more way more depth than it meets the eye and i won t spoil it for you the gameplay is simple i kinda wish puzzles were more difficult and that using rewind was more complex with greater ramafications but thats just me this is a casual game after all all in all if you enjoy games with great story i couldn t recommend the game more it has many touching moments for both younger and older audience young audience will maybe mature up and older audience is no less touched you still have to make that choice and go with consequences until the game is over and from some there is no going back thank you staff of dontnod entertainment and all contributors for this wonderful game we need more games of this quality out
