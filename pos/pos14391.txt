2021 early access review excellent factory gamera runs great looks great is stable if you enjoyed factorio it s definitely a must play the base game feels feature complete but it is however currently missing plenty of quality of life features like blueprints copy pasting map labels and notes and more but those will probably be addressed in future patches
