2020 a great game really feels good i d say its the perfect online racing game with mature players just one obvious thing the cost you already have to pay monthly but you still have to buy cars and tracks the membership comes with a hand full of cars and tracks that can get you out of rookie races but to actually progress through the ranks it will create a dent in your pocket cars are 11 usd and tracks are 15 usd per car and track btw if you are willing to spend this amount of money id expect maybe over 200 at the least then go for it it is the best racing experience just make sure you check ahead of the schedule for any series you are taking part in you don t want to buy a track and realize its no good for the rest of the season learned the hard way also want to mention that the vr in the game is pretty good my only problem is starting it in vr it sometimes launches and the game is behind me and there is no way to fix it other than that vr is perfect for iracing
