2021 review leans positiveconclusion if you go in seeing it as a relic game you will love it from the start if you go in as an age of empires game it still needs work but it is much better than it was on release i now lean towards buying it as is but still keep your expectations low for an age of empires game reason great updated version of aoe 2 really enjoy the combat and tactics but the quality of life kinda sucks campaigns are fantasticthe asymmetry is funthe specialization is funreason edit so it seems like most everything they touched actually is better but the stuff they didn t touch is worse than aoe 2 and 3 i do not say that lightly but only scouts can convert sheep no town bell fixed no random fixed no color changeno in game diplomacyno single select unit out of a groupkeeps castles cant produce units unless britishtrebuchet in castle ageno unit stances fixed units need to move first and then get put into no movement they will stop immediately when stand ground is turned on very nice edit wood is rebalanced better than aoe 3 and more important now but there are not enough trees or tree density on the map partially fixed saves previous civ and map details but nothing else skirmish games don t save previous player details so you need to reenter them in every time units can not be directly garrisoned upon creation to keep them safe fixed villagers can only garrison if you click them on the tc gates i think there is not very easy mode for sand boxing if you want to play on very easy just so you can learn a new civilization in peace because they are so different then you cannot do so easily easy will still advance and attack in independently i usually play on hardest difficulty on aoe 2 and 3 so i am very skilled and experienced but sometimes you need to sandbox just to learn new strategies you can play a game without ai but still not quite the same no spies for end of game cleanup cannot change population limit cannot set ending age no post castle or post imperial age start fixed starting resources are set for either standard or death match no in between no unit stats shown when recruiting from buildingsno unit stats shown when multiple units selectedno achievement or mastery when offline including server maintenance cannot see current mastery progress in game cannot manually pack and unpack siege units fixed added direct garrison button no easy to garrison villagers into buildings they want to drop off and repair first if damaged they prefer to repair over safety fixed no rally point for tower and keeps when ungarrisoningrams only have location drop off to ungarrison there is no way to ungarrison in placemonks cannot drop relic in place fixed cannot ungarrison multiple types of units at oncecastles provide 0 pop but houses provide double wolves attack tradewolves attack monkswolves attack scoutscan t see enemy tower range fixed can t tell castle who or what to attackvillagers auto attack next boar when hunting boarcan t load campaign save from main menucan t build rebuild stone wall next to a wall with a stone tower on it need to delete tower first garrisoned units do not heal units fixed villagers do not unload resources when finishing constructing a resource drop off buildingvillagers prioritize repair over resource drop offcan t remove a rally point from buildingvillagers don t pause task to defend against a wolf attack and then resumewhen selecting multiple towers docks outposts can t research tech for all towers with 1 click or 1 hotkey fixed bug sometimes all villagers don t follow a command especially after a conversion sometimes need to be told to build something first fixed no way to select all town centers with hotkeyif units are sent at a distance to kill an enemy and that enemy dies the units will end task instead of continuing to target area fixed ungarrisoning units do not go to rally pointachievement who needs infantry include monks monks are considered infantry campaign scenarios dont count for mastery or achievements fixed towers don t release all villagers back to work with 1 click or 1 hotkeytowers drop oil too far awayshift click and cntrl click resources at market does nothingcan t see how score is calculated in statistics fixed can t see score in game fixed converting unit does not change owner name on bottom of unit cardcan t convert buildingscan t conver ships fixed hre 4th age wonders weren t working for emergency repaircannot upgrate or switch from an arrow outpost to a springald outpost to a cannon outpost i ll add more as i find them there are a lot of positives to this game that i wont get into right now but for right now the negatives near equal the positives there are a lot of great things about this game too many to list this is a good game and i recommend it just have zero hopes for it and you will be fine positive edit i like the towers more now outposts only cost wood so they don t waste stone and you can spam them you can upgrade them to arrow ballista or cannon towers with stone and wood or gold for towers that are important stone walls and towers are great a lot of creative things you can do with them while it is getting better still not quite worth the hype conclusion repeat its better but still needs a lot of work go into it with low expectations
