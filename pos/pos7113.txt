2021 after 360 hours i guess it s finally time to speak to what this game has been to me i cannot say enough good things about scs the company that makes this game these are quality driven developers in the extreme i have never seen such dedication to a great end result the things i love about this game are numerous the level of detail is astonishing no exaggeration whatsoever probably for the 1st 350 hours of this game daily i was being blown away by small details i would notice that were so exceptional things you see once and never again there are no loops in this game repetitiveness everything is a fresh slate from discovering school buses that only run during morning load unload hours for real schoolkids discovering lights that move around in houses to simulate aliveness to yard sales or birthday parties being thrown in a home you pass a water mane break or an airplane crashed in the road near the airport you name it there is so much to see that are one offs and unique the graphics and realism are fantastic one of the things i love about this game is being able to see sights i ll probably never see in my real life another is the absolute vastness of the world and how completely well put together it is the cities are all different looking all areas have unique exits and ramps that lead to unique places you could drive in this game for hours and you will never come close to even finishing half of one state due to the number of sideroads freeways company lands etc the trucks are beautiful i m a woman not a truck driver in real life had no reason in the world why this game should appeal to me never wanted to be a driver thoughts trucks special etc but this game really grabs you and grows on you just look at the number of hours by multiple people in these reviews that s how you can tell a great game when everyone is playing hundreds of hours and not even close to ending soon the trucks are sleek and sexy love freightliners mack anthems volvo models you really gain a sense of pride of driving your rig and what it looks like the power it conveys i can t say enough good things about this game tldr just purchase it purchase all the dlc s they are highly worth it and you won t regret a single one in fact this company struggles to keep up with the demand they re currently working on both wyoming and texas can t come out soon enough for me they ll be an instant buy just like any others they put out great game super exceptional developer company you can t go wrong
