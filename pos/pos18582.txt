2021 bloons td 6 is td perfection i don t know how to write reviews when i enjoy a game too much music is amazing i was thinking of turning it off and playing my own in the background but then the wacky tunes kicked in and i said no it is difficult if you want to go your own optimal path but fun to restart and try again it hooks you because it has tons of maps and challenges and progression but it is not overwhelming it is kid friendly but maturely difficult also i am a perfectionist and every heart lost hurts me deeply
