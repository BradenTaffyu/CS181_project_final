2018 product received for free introductioni ve been looking forward to frostpunk ever since it was first announced in 2016 coincidentally i also began reviewing games around that time and i knew that survival strategy as a subgenre would ultimately be redefined by the title i am about to present to you today i shouldn t be surprised about this game since its developer is none other than 11 bit studios who else would simulate surviving against all odds than the creators of the dismayingly accurate this war of mine we re talking about strategy veterans here which also developed the anomaly series of tower defense titles thus my expectations were high to begin with and i was never disappointed my assessment was correct hell really has frozen over life shall either adapt or perish along with the rest of civilization story the city survived but was it worth it new home campaign epilogue losing a piece of our humanity along the way perhaps more than that yet i firmly believe that pragmatism must take precedence over frail notions of morality when survival of what s left of the human race rests onto a couple of unpopular decisions which someone has to implement eventually damned if you do damned if you don t yet survival at any and all costs does seem logical when you have very little left to lose and continuation of life itself to gain frostpunk does an excellent job at simulating the difficulty of coping with the decisions you ll sooner or later regard as unavoidable mistakes what s both refreshing and odd is how most of the context surrounding the events which preceded the great winter and subsequent collapse of society are gathered from the loading screens the intro sequence to the main campaign doesn t even mention an exact location or starting year the title is obviously representing an alternate timeline within a steampunk scenario but that doesn t mean that it won t include historically accurate names for individuals and events which shall shape the current state of affairs a meteorological catastrophe which would make even the ice age pale in comparison has set itself in motion and its ferocity is relentless as far as you re concerned all that s left of the human race is now concentrated in small craters along the arctic region choosing the north pole as a last refuge and stand was apparently dictated by the abundance of coal deposits which could sustain the marvels of engineering so vital to those fortunate enough to survive the trip over frozen seas and oceans frostpunk focuses on british and american refugees which were not only aware of the cataclysm unfolding but also had the technological means to architect a future no matter how bleak for the citizens of the aforementioned craters standing tall and quite symbolically at the center of each settlement a monolith of human ingenuity will ensure that warmth and life can be sustained even in the most cruel conditions the generator is the focal point of your efforts in this game should its flames be extinguished death shall be the only outcome only a matter of time i promised names and dates the year is 1887 and a joint project between the united kingdom of great britain the true superpower of the 19th century and the united states of america with the assistance of nikola tesla involved the construction of arctic generators in the utmost secrecy once the grim conclusion that the great winter has no end in sight was finally agreed upon it may not be the long night since there are no white walkers to fend off but the perpetual winter portrayed by frostpunk offers the massive eruption of mount tambora from 1815 and the outright explosion of the krakatoa island in 1883 as some of the causes for the rapid shifts in temperature and atmosphere which finally lead to the blocking or dimming of the sun it remains a mystery and it s somewhat irrelevant to your current situation of struggling to gather resources in an environment that invites frostbites in a matter of minutes what truly matters now is forging a new life near the remaining generators which are still functional while also dealing with glaring issues of a society desperate for change it s much harder to pin frostpunk to a single subgenre since it mixes elements of strategy and survival with politics and sociology in a rarely seen manner in games or otherwise you re most likely used to the trope about humanity being its one true enemy even within a post apocalyptic scenario it s not the zombies it s the humans who are the real monsters and so on i prefer sticking to the element of a frozen apocalypse and compare frostpunk with the sci fi movie snowpiercer they share several steampunk elements and the notions of selfless sacrifice which are shown in stark contrast to class struggle and segregation the world has been turned upside down yet some still consider themselves more equal than others orwell would feel like home in new london perhaps bradbury as well since you can t simulate a genuine tyranny without book bbqs graphicsfrostpunk is a stunning game whose visuals will put a strain even on modern gpus depending on the resolution of choice and the city development stage it s a pleasure to finally write about another graphics engine apart form the regulars such as unity or unreal all the titles developed by 11 bit studios are powered by their proprietary engine liquid it looks great and it runs smooth most of the time why am i saying that well regardless of resolution i didn t even bother running it in 4k since i knew what to expect the frame rate will drop frequently in the end game phases of each scenario when you ll invariably have already filled the maps with structures teeming with workers engineers and their children oh i nearly forgot the giant robots as well so there s plenty of action on screen and most city builders have a hard time animating all of that at a decent frame rate on a fully developed map that s zoomed in it s also why most of these survival strategy games are pc exclusives consoles really couldn t ketchup to the mustard race in this case the one thing which really takes a toll on the frames per second is the option to switch in real time between the normal and thermal vision modes the latter is an overlay that can be helpful in highlighting the areas which require the assembly of more steam hubs or activating built in heaters that shall mitigate the deadly weather surrounding most buildings insulated or not a useful tool which i recommend you activate only when the action is paused with so much information and tips being offered at all times i could only complain about the lack of an option for hiding the hud you know at least temporarily so i could really snap some epic screenshots in the current absence of such a small yet crucial element i had to contend with screenshots taken during the preset cutscenes following the unlock of a story event frostpunk deserves an option to minimize the hud user interface and i hope that the dev team can integrate this in a future update i really can t find any flaws to the visuals themselves the effects are perfect and the art style for most assets and drawings confirm that this title is serious about its attention to details youtube video ost frostpunk main theme menu theme views 45 974 the original soundtrack frostpunk main theme
