2019 there are only 3 types of people who play this game person 1 masters of physics engineering and all things space they can calculate every iota of the craft and mission getting every tiny detail down to an exact science and get consistent results true gods of the universe person 2 smart enough to get the jyst of it and get it done may not be pretty or efficient but it ll get there and back most of the time person 3 ooooooo rockets immediately explodes on launch if you are even remotely interested in physics and space definitely check this bad boy out the physics in this game alone are mind blowing you ll learn or maybe already know planetary physics and all of the groovy little tidbits involved with it building your own ramshakle ship and blasting off into the heavens is almost every kids dream at some point in life and this gives you that opportunity you ll spend hours fine tuning your rockets planes rovers satellites and other ridiculous nonsense you dream up and them dash them to pieces in glorious failure time and time again unless you re person 1 easily the greatest part of the game is the most unlikely of culprits good ol jebadiah kermin that totem headed nutjob is a true hero and deserves his own holiday replete with fireworks dancing nymphs and copious amounts of alcohol watching his blissful glee as he hurtles towards certain death is awe inspiring i ve literally sped up time and spent 30 years in game time circling the sun hoping to reenter kerbin s earth gravitational sphere and then spent eveyr last drop of fuel slowing down to achieve an orbit and then another few weeks in game time scraping the upper atmosphere slowing down enough to finally land just to bring that legend of a man home any other kerbals let them freeze in the vast expanse of space but bring jebadiah home at all costs
