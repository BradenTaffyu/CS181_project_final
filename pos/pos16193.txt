2015 early access review as kids back in the day most of us used to play tabletop games but growing up in a world filled with advance technology changed that for most of us now we have jobs smartphones tablets computers lots of videogames social media sites and have little time to even consider whipping out an old board game this game changes that allowing you to play any board game in an open world sandbox with people from all over the world you can even make your own games and play them with friends this game is worth more than its asking price because the devs put their heart and soul into this game they always listen on the forums and update this game almost every week unlike some other greedy developers i know it s something fresh and new that almost never gets old compared to all the zombie and fps games out there they even have a workshop filled with thousands of player made games and steam cards and achievements you must buy this game even if you wouldn t even play it much because it will eventually become an addiction
