2017 after playing more than 60 hours i can only say that nier is too short because it s so damn good the controls are fluid and easy to learn i recommend using a control used an old logitech control without problems the story is rich and focus not only on the main characters and remembers us that in a war every side has important things to lose the music is gorgeous and perfectly fits the various moments of the game not a single crash or bug on my side i5 3570 amd radeon hd 7950 really recommend this game it reminded me of old ps1 games like ffvii and mgs where the major points were a rich story and well developed characters worth the money and time 10 10
