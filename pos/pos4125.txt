2023 overview a modern classic in the card game genreslay the spire is a must own for anyone that has ever loved card games like magic the gathering hearthstone or gwent etc it s a paradigm shift in a positive direction for a genre that has been all but ruined by micro transactions and loot box mechanics slay the spire creates an addictive single player strategic card game at a fixed price that can be replayed for hundreds of hours the good the baddeck buildingin slay the spire you start with a fixed deck of basic cards that through traversing various enemy encounters random mark event rooms and campfires you are able to add and subtract cards or upgrade them to hopefully amass a deck that is strong enough to defeat various level bosses every journey is different with random cards enemies and choices for each mark event room overall deck building is a net positive for the game as it allows for endless replay ability and requires thinking on your feet to determine what the best deck building strategy will be given the randomized conditions of any given run however this will also be a source of mild frustration and learning for new players you can t build any deck you want and will often not be able to refine the deck you re trying to make if you re not thinking far enough ahead the concept of deck building in this game is unique and compelling however my main complaint with the game is that the level of randomness often leaves the player not feeling they re in sufficient control over the randomness of their deck had the developers only given the player a starting deck with 3 or 4 strikes and defends instead of 5 decks could be far more polished and tuned by the player nothing is worse than losing with a deck that never had a chance because it was too much of a mish mash of different strategies due to the fact that the cards that were available were simply not sufficient to create a strongly focused and therefore powerful deck play stylesyou start the game with one character the ironclad to play as after beating the game once more characters with their corresponding play styles will be available this gives the game a strong amount of flexibility to allow players to find a character that matches their preferred approach to the game spike damage vs damage over time vs debuffs and control etc etc each of the 4 total characters operate in a distinct manner from each other and once you master one of them you will likely want to circle back and approach one of the others you may have moved away from initially art style design musicsome may argue the aesthetic of the game is unique and compelling to me it looks a bit like a flash or mobile game ultimately i don t think many will be impressed by the visuals personally i would prefer a bit more detail or something more ornate in the art work that gives a sense of world building and looks less like a weird derivative of a monopoly card all that said the artwork will not be a detriment to your enjoyment and is serviceable to the mechanics of the game animations are nice and snappy and exactly what you would want for card battles music is similar to the art nothing is that memorable but ultimately everything is serviceable and engaging enough to get the job done of making battles and the moment to moment feel engaging and so forth technicalno crashes or problems opens full screen unlike some indie games with plenty of options that can be tweaked the game is suitable to run on a potato pc conclusionif you re even mildly curious about this game it s an easy recommendation on sale or for about 20 i think the standard 25 is slightly high there is quite a bit of replay ability with the 4 characters and play styles the game gives you with the steam workshop mods open up the game even more slay the spire is not a flawless game but is something anyone that is interested in card games should play and shows the potential for a genre that has been fixated on heavy weights like mtg and hearthstone for far too long bonus pro tip for newbiesif you screw up a fight or a selection at an event store you can restart it by going to save quit before the end of the fight or your death then continue from the main menu
