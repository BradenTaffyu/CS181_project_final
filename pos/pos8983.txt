2019 stellaris is a massive galactic civilization strategy game from paradox if you ve played their grand strategy games before you should know what to expect however if you were like me and you struggled to get into their other grand strategy games then i highly recommend stellaris i would consider it to be the most accessible out of the ones i played being a science fiction helped but then i like my history too to talk about everything that stellaris has to offer would take a lot of words but to summarise you create a civilization and their traits whether they are warmongering penguins or peaceful scientific foxes you explore and colonise planets you explore new systems you build fleets and go to war or defend your territory you research new technology you perform diplomacy you can create federations or create enemies well those are the basics but there are deeper features multiplayer is a lot of fun and the system works well but single player is as much fun and the ai isn t completely useless on the higher difficulties it looks great the soundtrack is amazing and the ui while may be overwhelming to start with isn t overly complicated once you are used to it if you re into science fiction love the idea of creating and managing a galactic civilization and you want a good introduction to the paradox grand strategy universe go for stellaris
