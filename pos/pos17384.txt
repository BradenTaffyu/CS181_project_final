2023 total war three kingdoms is the total war game i have been waiting for for a long time shogun 2 was my favorite but three kingdoms has taken that spot the diplomacy in this game is so in depth the characters are so unique and make the search for great officers so much fun spies oh my lord they are so amazing in this game the battles are top of the line for total war and i like the focus again on the officers officers play such an amazing role zooming in on your officer in a one on one duel and watch him deliver that killing blow is just awesome the economy system is so deep that you can finance your realm in so many different ways so you could play the same character in many different ways to be successful i find myself eager at the end of one campaign to quickly get engulfed in another i cannot say enough good things about this game
