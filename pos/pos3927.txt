2020 buy this game if you are a fan of games like fft fire emblem or xcom first of all it is a great game im permanently searching for new strategy rpgs and troubleshooters is one of the best srpg s i played in a long time the story is great until now the music beautiful and the charakters have a great depth to them and im not that far into the game yet as others have already written multiple times it takes some time to unlock your first few characters the shops crafting etc but i dont think its necessarily bad except if you are impatient it was far more meaningful to have the 3rd character join your party after really talking to her a few times getting glimpses of what she can do and finally convincing her to join your team the game has a great variety of skills masteries which you can mix and match as you like im not much of a min maxer but even for me the system is easy to understand my characters feel good and im interested in what the game can still bring me interesting side note the developers respond on most of the comments which shows the dedication they have for their game as an starting developer myself i hope that i can show such dedication myself one day im already sad that the game is episode 1 which means that i have to wait at some point in time
