2018 review updated 03 31 2018 w 182 4hrs played this is a reasonably exceptional fun free to play game there is no evidence of pay2win in my opinion not by far that said like most other f2p games you re able to pay to speed things up and that is highly evident in this game however at no point do you feel compelled to do so because the developers seemed to have made the grind manageable to a degree i should say once you hit tier 8 ships and above you can expect some cash flow problems if you play poorly losing more credits than you earn in a game in situations but this is more evident in t9 10 games as my own general understanding of it premium whatever typically tends to help more with your own economy in the game and has far less to do with competitive advantages in the game more below wargaming offers fairly pricey premium ships to help off set cash flow problems amongst many other things which are ships that can only be purchased with real money but they balance in very well with all of the other ships in terms of stats and playability however purchasing a ship does provide very easy ways to earn tons of credits xp and free xp from forum reading and playing the game they seem to do a lot of play testing prior to new ships being released onto the stable branch to ensure things are mostly scaled properly into the game and i ve never personally felt outmatched duking it out against a premium ship i should also add they provide plenty of opportunities to earn certain premium ships for free refer a friend and seasonal events to list two obvious sources of em in addition to the premium ships they offer they also offer premium consumables for any given ship s abilities in games these will generally prolong any given effect that an ability has increase the amount of charges it has or it ll reduce the cool down period for when you can use that given ability again you can pay to obtain these premium consumables with doubloons currency bought with real money or you can earn them in game by fairly easily completing campaign missions or by opening the free daily crates the same goes for premium game time that can be earned by completing certain campaigns operations co op bot stomping missions etc as a personal note i have not used premium consumables and i have never felt disadvantaged by this but other people may adamantly feel differently i have very little complaints if anything you ll encounter the typical caustic tryhard toxicity you would in any other competitive game ranting and raging that the game isn t going in their favour but even so the game is fun addictive and the grind while it feels manageable to me ymmv really feels rewarding and there s anime too it doesn t dominate the game at all and in fact anything weeb related can be turned off if you so choose a major controversial topic with this game based on the general community opinion are premium this and thats this is understandable but i would highly encourage those looking at getting into the game give it a chance and formulate your own opinion on it it is free after all
