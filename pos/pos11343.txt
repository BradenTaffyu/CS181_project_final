2021 early access review this game has completely consumed me literally and metaphorically i have been eaten by my foes quite a few times ngl but despite in a zombie apocalypse i have managed to completely fix up a once disgusting house into a now beautiful suburban home in diersville i love diersville its a great neighborhood minus the zombie bear i have named the zombies lisa is my biggest enemy lisa s blue dress often makes me feel quite insecure it is so beautiful meanwhile i am wearing a torn skirt why do the undead get better fits than me hmmm also i have somehow managed to make a nicely furnished home using the largely ugly pieces of furniture so that s cool i am the joanna banks of the apocalypse
