2018 early access review absolutely amazing game lets walk through some past runs become the inca on sea ice murder any traders who turn up because you can eat their limbs and makes sofas from their skin why not settup a gulag name your characters after famous communist leaders and watch as stalin and lenin romance each other until your people get depressed due to lack of adequate corn management and starve to death if you re fealing a bit more to the right you can settup a death camp hitler goeboels and gas go on a journey killing anyone who doesn t have the right skin colour fortunately for humanity the orion mod comes with a particularly op bunch of raids and so hitler was quickly murdered and everyone else left to bleed to death start a normal viable colony a strange chamber containing evil bugs is opened guess i ll just leave them there next thing you know they have spread to consume their entire mountain and the mountain protects them from artillery try setting up a valid secure base when next thing you know a tornado has up your more than any raiders could i have never won this game 500 hours in i pretty much exclusively play on the hardest difficulty and get completely demolished by many different sources and yet it always ends up being fun because of the unbearably stupid stories you can set up i have lost to raids infestations given up due to stupid management of setting up a trade caravan given up due to abyssmal planning and investing all my time in making a really aesthetic fridge instead of actually building defenses forgetting that i can just use the nutrient paste dispenser until hour 200 instead of giving all my dudes colon cancer with a level 0 chef making weed and forgetting to stop everyone getting stoned at 3am when i want to defend against a hoarde of mechanised centipedes i can t express how much fun this game can be to lose watching characters who thankfully can recurr in later runs go out in blazes of glory with heroic last stands are the moments that really define your pawns and make you care about them the game is well polished constantly updated and absolutely fantastic can t recommend enough worth the full price and an absolute bargain on sale
