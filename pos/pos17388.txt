2021 watch the 2010 three kingdoms series on youtube before while playing this total war fans may find the unit types basic and the mostly land maps a little samey that being said the diplomacy and character based campaign are well worth your time if you are a fan of tw strategy or the three kingdoms era the overworld economy and faction subsystems can be difficult to understand at first even overwhelming in the first 5 10 hours watch a few guide videos on building trees and you ll be fine you ll develop relationships and vendettas with factions in a way i haven t quite experienced since medieval total war really enjoyed playing as cao cao for 70 hours especially while comparing the parallels and differences to the romanticised history novel mandarin voice acting and artistic design is excellent as well strongly recommend
