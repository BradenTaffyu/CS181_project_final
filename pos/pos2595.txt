2023 some people may not like it because it s a gacha game but project moon the developers clearly put a lot of soul into limbus company aside from being pretty fair in terms of free to play balance the game has a lot of really nice things which other games both gachas and non gacha ones lack instead of going over major pros and cons you can see in other reviews i m going to list some of the great niche features and smaller details people may overlook every character appearing in the story is fully voiced the soundtrack is memorable and features a considerable amount of battle themes more than 7 which is not much by itself but impressive for a game that only has 3 story chapters as of its release day the story mode has a large amount of cgs and unique art for non essential npcs monsters and bosses with several variations they could ve just put the same faceless npc or outright nothing but text in a lot of places but still decided to give almost every entity a unique visual every alternative character version identity comes with a different unique model different animations and different voice lines for every action little to no reused assets every rarity is fully functional higher rarity identities are potentially more powerful but lower rarities are not neccessarily worse they all feature 3 different active skills one passive and one support ability the battle pass even the free one has permanent unique rewards you can t get elsewhere unique e g o s not just consumables occasional premium currency and cosmetics lastly this one is a bit subjective but the game has a huge amount of references to previous pm games without spoiling too much it works as a very nice fanservice so far the only issue i have with the game is the fact that character shards are bound to a season and half of them expire at the end of it it s not a dealbreaker but still feels a bit restrictive i realize it s probably a neccessary measure to prevent people from hoarding shards for months and then exchanging for newly released identities and e g o s without ever rolling a gacha but do shards really need to expire and become threads can t they remain as shards of a previous season this way players would still be able to exchange them for older content assuming the dispense line up we see today doesn t disappear that said i ve played numerous gacha games that felt extremely cheap and lacking compared to what project moon has delivered here if you re a project moon fan and still haven t played lc you should absolutely give it a try i strongly recommend playing at least until the end of the first chapter to see if this is a game you may find enjoyable
