2020 this game is an actual masterpiece i had tons of fun with this game but unfortunately i got kinda bored of it game itself is a mix of an diffrent types of games putted in to one big hella fun game ur getting trought dungeons and if ur gonna make too much mistake s the game doesn t forgive ya u ve lost that healing or money or even ur whole run in these game is ton s of weapons items and powers giving u almost unlimited combinations some of those powers or somethin are better than the others or they are not that useful in the higher difficulties with each difficulty ur getting a power or a rune which can gave ya access to the higher difficulty making it extremaly fun and replayable the artstyle itself is a masterpiece of pixel art the enemies and game itself has this lovely look enemies are balanced and the attacks they re looks are rlly creative and enjoyable to look at game after 2 years it still updated and they are giving new stuff to it so i recommend trying it out or atleast passing the normal mode soundtrack is rlly good and it s rlly suits with the artstyle and fast gameplay i ve bhought the bad seed dlc which was srsly fun to play new enemies weapons and levels all i think i could say about this that i think there should x2 times more levels but it s just me complainin overall the game it s rlly great and fun worth it s high prize i give it 9 10
