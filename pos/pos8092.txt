2014 early access review even in alpha stage the physics engine does amazing job and crashes look really realistic the slow motion mode is like well there are no words for it its just so great you can even freeze the game j if you want to also the gravity options are nice to play with in current alpha version there are seven cars and seven maps every car can be modified by changing or removing parts from them modding community have done some additional cars and tracks for the game beamng com so you can already get even more content good job guys very good
