i could just say this is my 2nd favorite roguelike ever behind isaac but let s continue dead cells is a game that does roguelites justice in every way with its progression system permadeath and gameplay imagine you re playing hades without its isometric design blazing through enemies with spectacular animations and sound design that s the unique thing about dead cells its combat is incredibly fast paced and rewarding in every way swords bows guns knives daggers hammers even sandals can be a crucial point in your run to bring you to victory and speaking of getting to victories the difficulty of the game is done in a cool way much like hades you have to progressively unlock the easy difficulty while starting out on hard with health flasks gold reserves recycling etc this allows the game to remain tough but fair with its mix of tight ass gameplay and really fair gameplay when you die it s exclusively your fault 99 of the time because this game is so heavily reliant on skill differentiating itself from most roguelikes by not sticking to rng and that s what makes it so satisfying to win in the end i beg you to try this game i don t even know why it took me so long to write a review in the first place 10 10
