2018 where do i even start with this game do you have any idea what kind of game this is it is garry s mod of course this game is really fun to play and mess around in sandbox or the other gamemodes you can install packed with the steam workshop in one hand and in the other a physics gun to pick any item you want up and just chuck it at your friendly neighborhood ragdoll jokes aside this game can jam pack some good times with friends i ve met a few people on garry s mod that i am still friends with today the steam workshop just about has anything you need to spice up your gameplay although the game engine it runs on is out dated yes however it is over shadowed by the fact you can still ignore the cons and keep counting the pros now the online portion feels good as well my only complaint would be how some servers have a bunch of downloads that can take up to 20 minutes of downloading depending on your internet speed i usually chill in sandbox and just mess around with some friends in a voice call on discord garry s mod is sure a gem in the gaming market as a really diverse interesting game that can have unsurpassable amount of content one could even say endless amounts given that the creators of mods and such keeps the modding scene alive my hours may or may not seem like enough to fully support the claim whether or not you should get the game but i can say this i would recommend this game to you and some friends given they enjoy sandbox games as a whole this has been my short review for garry s mod i tack on the word short because i could go on for ages about the game but do to time constraints that wouldn t be feasible i am mister bossman and i hope you have a great day and thanks for reading this feel free to leave some comments or ratings if i helped you in the slightest
