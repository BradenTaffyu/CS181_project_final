2023 i always wanted to play a hogwarts based open world game and this one brings a lot to the table it satisfies the itch of travelling through the world on a broom or a hippogriff using various spells to fight against enemies also the sheer architecture of the hogwarts castle is marvellously done even after so many hours i get confused among the corridors and without the map its impossible to attend one class after the next due to the sheer complexity of the castle the introduction of capturing and breeding beasts is a nice touch and so is the concept of using their hairs and whatnot to upgrade clothing but this game is not without its flaws the entire map has been filled with too many tasks just like newer ac open world games and it becomes cumbersome after a while also all treasure vaults has the same architecture and no variation is provided apart from the gaming concerns the game uses up all of my 16 gb ram at medium settings and sometimes kept freezing and crashing due to that for quite a few times after all said and done this is a good game but not in the league of rdr2 or kcd it provides a fresh air in the world of rpgs loved the time invested in it
