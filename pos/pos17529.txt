2017 after 650 hours i ve decided to write a review i have every single total war game in my library save for shogun 1 and medieval 1 and atilla didn t feel like i needed a 2nd rome 2 game tbh this is a great game for newer people in the series they really made the campaign map a lot more easier for new players to the series the game has intuitive ui and is pretty easy to control and even if you get confused there is very easy to access videos websites that teach you the commands you really need for the game the launch was a little rocky but the updates make it great even if you haven t bought any dlc the game still gets updated you just can t play those races or have their added benefits like regiments of renown as far as gameplay for the vanilla gameplay the battles are far shorter than any other total war game this is something i was not happy about this is of course fixable by mods but the base game forces you to micro at top speed especially with the introduction of spells and individual unit skills for some reason the auto skill use right click from the previous titles was not implemented in this most likely due to them having to code ai related functions for the right stipulations for the skill to be used in an automatic way once you mod it right and the battles last about half as long save for sieges which if modded right will not change in pace much you still have room for fast micro and still have time to fix any potential mistakes the ai makes without your help that s the biggest problem with fast paced battles of the vanilla game is the units you control are not constantly being told to make the right decisions and will turn their backs on enemies after no long engaging or simply not engaging any enemy running right by them i m not saying that the units you control should have ai help but this is the reason why fast battles are generally bad overall it s a great game the campaign mode is generally easy regardless of difficulty once you know what youre doing the base game has ridiculously low upkeep costs and ridiculously high income for income buildings which can make getting high tier units become a very easy thing to do towards turns 20 30 again if you really want to challenge yourself you gotta find the right mods the base game without mods is still great if youre new and learning but eventually you re just sitting there like why do i have so much money and things just become too easy i dont play strategy games to be in god mode all the time personally and i think ca really pandered to their casual customers with this game it s a good thing they didn t take away modding support
