2018 early access review a terrific game for those willing to deal with a rather steep learning curve and complicated systems that are all intertwined i suppose it s similar to rimworld in a number of ways but with a lesser focus on combat and more focus on balancing the various needs of your dupes if you don t die of suffocation you ll starve lose your crops to heat or run out of x or y resource it s a pretty punishing game in my opinion but feels very rewarding when you manage to deal with a situation that earlier would ve had you killed i ve played the game a lot more outside of steam and think it holds up rather well you do have to basically go through the same gameplay loop of building things in order to research and build other things but that could be said of any building management game if you enjoy games like rimworld or don t starve you ll probably want to give this a go
