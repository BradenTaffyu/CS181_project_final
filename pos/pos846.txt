2020 i love the art style and simplicity of the game the story line is easy to follow and even though most actions and goals are very repetitive there are small distinctions between dialogue and final products that make the game worth continuing to play i highly recommend this game for those who just want a fun and cute game to play when bored but don t want to commit to a competitive game play or something that has a complex story line that needs to be followed
