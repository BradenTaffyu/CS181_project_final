2020 a truly brilliant game minor spoilers ahead stardew valley is a farming experience like no other and i believe it has helped many people become calmer versions of themselves the game will make you petrify when or if you see that every spring onion you may have picked while perusing near the sewer is infested until very late game where you become one with the foraging skill i personally though have spent many hours speaking to the people of the valley giving gifts and even being married once or twice divorce is possible if so needed now the combat isn t for everyone but it s simplicity is part of what makes stardew such a wholesome and calming experience sure you may soil your undies when falling fifteen floors in skull cavern just to see a horde of skeletons coming towards you but with standing still and timing easy attacks you are safe and able to eat the cookies your in game mother sent you finally the aim of the game for some is to have a nice looking profitable and automated ish farm but this was not always my main concern as i like many others wanted to focus on the community centre upon completing the community centre i would say for the casual player that they have finished the game however i do believe that is important to leave the valley well endowed by this i mean that it is always a good idea to sell all remaining crops that aren t growing straight to pierre and speak to every person one last time for a truly satisfying ending before leaving the valley forever
