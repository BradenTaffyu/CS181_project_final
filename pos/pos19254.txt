2021 age of empires is one of the biggest representatives of the strategy game sector many people of my generation grew up with aoe1 or aoe2 and so the announcement of age of empires 4 as a more modern version of the series was greatly anticipated after taking a first look in the game i now want to give my opinion about it for the build 7274 positive ai the ai is not a cheating mess like in aoe3 de but yet also not as skilled as in aoe2 de still it varies its tactics often uses early rushes to put pressure on the player and can sometimes build appropriate walls stone walls units can now be placed on stone walls furthermore archers can t shoot above them and only siege units can actually damage them which makes them really feel like a bulwark recruitment time due to the overall high recruitment times you won t encounter endless waves of units and actually will have an advantage once you destroy your opponents army landscape and building graphics while i would describe the buildings as good looking especially the landscapes with the varying altitude levels look beautiful gunpowder units all gunpowder units from infantry to siege cannons feel very impactful due to smoke effects and sound design sound the sound of this game is simply amazing the language of the units changes depending on the age as well as on the terrain your units are and the battles feel way more authentic due to the battle noise technical aspects regarding the technical side there is nothing i could complain about the performance is good as well as the loading times in my first 16 h of playing i have not experienced a ctd once negative unit graphics unfortunately the level of detail on the units is so low that they look like they were made back in 2008 build up time of siege weapons siege weapons can build up and dismantle way too quick which not only feels weird but also makes them unbalanced unit pathing usually the unit pathing is ok but especially if you construct siege engines on the field or have a big battle the units start sliding alongside each other which looks ridiculous ai representation the ais have no unique names anymore like in aoe2 and don t mock you anymore with messages like in aoe3 which makes them feel a bit more lifeless neutral ui the ui is very minimalistic easy to read but a bit in contrast to the otherwise colourful game no friendly fire there is no friendly fire which is especially impactful when using mangonels guided missiles sometimes the projectiles fly in a weird arc to hit their target on the other hand this also means that no excessive micromanagement is necessary like dodging arrows in aoe2 victory conditions the victory conditions are a little bit different compared to the older games you don t have to destroy your enemy completely anymore or wait for him to resign instead you must destroy his landmarks but this means that you can also destroy your enemy by sniping his landmarks and he will automatically loose even if he still has a running economy and or a huge army also relocating your base in case your original spawn point gets overrun is only possible if you can construct a new landmark somewhere else otherwise you will lose campaigns i haven t played the campaigns a lot since the custom matches are the major aspect of age of empires so i can t say much about them i only noticed that the video scenes between the missions were incredibly well made but somehow i have the feeling that resources which were spend for this should rather have been invested in the unit models population limit the population limit is currently 200 which feels balanced and sufficient still it can be seen a bit like a downgrade compared to the custom population limit of the other parts of the series civilisations the base game has currently 8 civisations which are very different and have their own mechanics each this might seem like a loss compared to the 20 civilisations in aoe2 de but on the other hand they really offer different play styles only the unit variety feels a bit lacking since all of them share the same base units missing features improvements map editorcustom player coloursmod support random option for civilisation selectionall in all age of empires 4 is a great game especially if you can play it with some friends though 60 is a bit too expensive i think a price of 40 to 50 would be more reasonable
