2015 early access review poor lacking a death wish then this game is the game for you this game is for those people who want to see cars crashed exactly the way they want but can t afford to do that in real life basically this game was made for americans and terrorists on a more serious note i would like to mention that at the moment it includes a sandbox mode where you can play around in many default maps and many player created maps a map editor which you can access by pressing f11 while not in full screen mode alt enter toggles fullscreen a scenario system where you can play scenarios made by both the developers and modders on both stock and user created maps controller joystick and steering wheel support with a very easy to use interface for mapping the controls remember this game is still in early access and features are being added to it all the time in the menu it s obvious that there are plans for a campaign mode edit campaign mode now exists and it s great so far the developers are still working on this game and improving it making it better for all the players
