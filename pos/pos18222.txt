product received for free early access review a little rough around the edges and a bit feature light at the moment however what s there is a really fun and enjoyable foundation it s also beautiful and runs very well i reckon you can get around 20 hours of playtime in the game before you hit a sort of content wall and don t have much to do beyond just trying to build bigger and bigger i recommend it if you re an fan of banished ostriv or farthest frontier and want a more organic city builder at time of review there s no dynamic ai opponent no cavalry not much balance and a lot of locked screens for work in progress features but if the cadence of updates are good and this gets fleshed out quickly it d be an easy recommend to not just fans of colony building but anyone with an interest in grounded realistic or historical games
