game is fine i just don t understand why the devs decided to make up towards the top tiers instead of adding actual real ships that did actually make it off the planning board like ijn shinano instead of hakuryu and sekiryu or whatever the i stg that one anime shipgirl game has more historical accuracy than any wargaming product
