2023 great crpg certainly one of the best even among the golden classics on the infinity engine it is also an improvement over original sin 1 which i enjoyed in terms of battle system those elements combination and interaction with the scenery never get old but it didn t click with me in other aspects there are more interesting lore elements plot with more fun twists way less bland dialogues some of them genuinely made me laugh which is an achievement for a video game writing more appealing area design as an overall package it is pretty hard to think of better game in the genre except potentially bg3 but i will check it later if you compare it story wise with other games there are better alternatives for sure the story is relatively straightforward but still was pretty entertaining to follow as cons i will mention several things dos2 can be dragging sometimes in terms of pacing especially in the last act i expected a bit more with pre made characters story quests they do make experience more engaging they are still a bit lacking i still recommend everyone to start the game with them you can customize their builds however you want anyway the game sometimes seems a bit restrictive due to necessity to find areas more appropriate for your current level also some fights can be too frustrating without cheese tactics nevertheless still amazing crpg which helped to revitalize the genre i remember everyone being doomsayers during mass effect days these are in the past
