2021 if you are serious about competition racing and would do the real thing if you could but you can t like most of us for whatever obvious reasons this may be for you this is not a game it is not forza or gran turismo it is a simulator if you want to just be crazy and smash into people and jump cars 50 feet in the air this is not for you this is as serious of racing that you can have without having the real thing this community is about gaining bonds and relationships through good clean racing i can t stress enough this takes a lot of grinding self restraint and a seriousness that is unique to only iracing if you want the closest thing to racing in an actual circuit but you just don t have hundreds of thousands of dollars to do it this may be for you if you have the gear to run iracing at a high level and even better a vr setup it is absolutely amazing and addictive i am actually new to the community but i have followed it for years and i cannot speak highly enough of the physics rendering and professionalism they have put into this it truly is the best racing sim out there nothing even close to this it is 1 a m and i am forcing myself to get off so i can go to work tomorrow enjoy
