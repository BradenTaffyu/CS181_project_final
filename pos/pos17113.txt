2017 i avoided getting this for quite a long time for the reason that i didn t feel i had played the first one enough and that it had come out too soon considering that people were still spending money on the dlc for the first one what i didn t realise was that in an astoundingly smart move creative assembly had decided that all dlc from the first game would be carried over for use in a special and gigantic campaign mode in the sequel this is both super smart and insanely ambitious now with well over 100 possible starting factions ca have done nothing less than begin to recreate the entire world of warhammer something none of the previous total war games even approach in terms of scope it really is staggering warhammer 2 comes with its own eye of the vortex campaign and all new factions therin this alone would be enough for a normal game and that campaign is a very good one and you will see cameo faction appearances of old world races within it whether or not you bought the first game or any of its dlc in fact despite even due to its monolithic size many players will find the gigantic nature of the amalgamated mortal empires campaign to be too much of a daunting task and will find themselves spending the majority of their time playing through the vortex with the 4 new playable races rather than attempting a campaign that could easilly take months of daily play to get through it is also important to note that mortal empires is only available to owners of both games and that any factions from dlc will only be available to those who either already bought them or buy them in the future regardless of whether or not you make great or indeed any use of mortal empires total war warhammer 2 is the pinnacle of tactical wargaming on any platform
