2015 i ve just played a little but so far it looks incredible although it might look very similar to fallout 3 at first you will notice small differences that make a huge difference small additions such as your character having a voice the gunplay being on par with any fps and 3rd person mode feeling great now similar to dead space add a lot to the way the game feels it s grand it s engaging it s just fantastic ill be back later for a full review in about 400hours time buy this and buy it blindly it s everything you were hoping it would be and more
