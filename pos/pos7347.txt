2016 if you like love euro truck simulator then i am sure you are going to enjoy this too right now at the time of writing this review there is not that much content in the game but there is a fair amount to keep you entertained for the time being more content will be added but most likely at a cost graphics the graphics too me seem a little upgraded compared to the original euro truck sim 2 which is nice and the detailing is kinda a little better it s the only way to explain it i had scaling on 400 and max graphics and was super smooth audio the audio is the same as euro truck sim with some added effects coming from the world it is truck noises i turned off the radio and music because i found it annoying controls this is where i got annoyed i am using an xbox one controller x360 works too but i had some problems setting it up and it took me a while because of the weird issue with the acceleration with the game gameplay the gameplay is the same as euro truck simulator 2 which i did not play much off as i only played the multiplayer mod which i am thankful to say this version now has i am unsure if ets2 has these features but i am detailing them from ats the nice fact you can hire drivers buy trucks for them and a little more buy a garage upgrade it and semi customise the trucks and get your drivers to go on missions to earn you some more money is pretty awesome the detail in this version i find is a lot more extreme to the point when driving around the scenery actually has things going on there are no pedestrians on the streets but they are in cars and wandering around a complex and outside buidings in a small area but there are planes flying over dusting their fields police following people helicopters and actual things to look at there is a multiplayer mod for this game already and it is pure amazing i love everything about it the only problem is there is there no traffic at all not even police cars on the road the only people on the road are other players that is it kinda sad also is the idiots who think this game is gta and race around cutting on the pavement ramming and so much more but thankfully the admins are very fast to actually ban them which is awesome and there is very little of these people and players actually play the game properly mostly again making this enjoyable the game plays more or less the same as ets2 and is enjoyable and will be a better version when more content has arrived so on that basis yes i would recommend this game a a step up from ets2
