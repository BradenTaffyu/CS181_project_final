2017 once upon a time there was a handsome ass canadian from kamloops bc that enjoyed the simple things in life cold beer real maple syrup bacon poutine and tax funded healthcare he didn t want after much but one thing he did desire was a quality sci fi grand strategy game that was highly customizable with various endgame challenges and an excellent random faction generator he searched high and low or at least he waited patiently and hoped and one day his patience was rewarded by none other than paradox and from that day on he grand strategied happily ever after yes friends stellaris is that fabled game it is a wonderful introduction not only to sci fi space strategy but to the real time grand strategy genre as a whole taking cues from past paradox titles as well as successful turn based 4x titles such as the galactic civilizations series stellaris delivers an experience that frankly has been sorely lacking as a huge fan of other paradox titles as well as anything to do with spehss this game grabbed my eye easily and then pulled it out of the socket and proceed to make sweet hanky panky with my skull where to start stellaris is easily one of the most accessible least intimidating grand strategies out there it has enough complexity that you still need to pay attention to what you re doing and who s around you but especially for people that have never played a gs game or have only lightly dabbled in the genre you ll likely really enjoy this one veterans and hardcore fans of grand strategy might find stellaris a little to simple and easy mind you so keep in mind that ymmv mods one of the things that i love most about stellaris though is how easily and extensively it can be modified however want to add a star destroyer the pillar of autumn or a mars class battlecruiser as a ship model custom ship themes will allow you to do this if it can be made into a 3d model imported into a theme and then packaged and put up on the workshop then you can have it in your game the same goes for everything from your empire s symbols flag backgrounds race portraits names etc general gameplay gameplay in stellaris plays a lot like victoria hearts of iron ck eu etc in that you re given the world map in this case a galaxy populated by anywhere from dozens to hundreds or thousands of stars and left to conquer it through a variety of means this could be done by peaceful acquisition of occupied planets and settling of unoccupied ones it could be through the flexing of military might or through shrewd diplomacy by getting other races to fight eachother so you can swoop in and clean up the leftover mess standard fare but be cautious because there are some crazy powerful fallen empires that you can include in your game and frankly they re massive never trust them ever politically you may have to deal with everything from elections to usurpers to racial independence or economic driven riots and rebellions the political system while not terribly deep does make the game more interesting and the fact that some of the people of your worlds may develop new traits that put them at odds with the rest of your empire will keep you paying attention to where you draw future colonists from and where you station your fleets some of your more distant worlds may require a peaceful persuasion force of battleships in low orbit to keep the population from getting any smart ideas star systems are handled in two ways cores and sectors core systems are few and allow the player to have direct control typically these solar systems will be either in the heart of your empire or they ll be on a particularly dangerous border where you need to be able to control military defense infrastructure directly sectors are basically automatically governed but you can set some rules and limits to how that s done one of the good things with sectors is that a governor applied to a sector will apply their bonuses to every world in it so if you have a sector with a ton of industry and a governor with a bunch of industrial production bonuses then you ve got yourself a recipe for fleet spam combat battles are handled in real time there are some formation orders that you can issue to your fleets but battles are pretty much hands off affairs of point your fleet at their fleet fly at eachother and shoot all the lasers basically the freem ing will start and won t stop until one side is dead or runs off it leaves something to be desired but with how big and crazy battles can get i see why they did it colonization colonizing worlds is really similar to the galactic civ series once your scientists scan a habitable planet you have colony ships loaded with colonists who carry the traits and ideals present on their world multiple different groups of ideals and or species on one planet will give you a choice of which group to recruit from if applicable and you tell said colony ship to colonize a world it will do so upon which you pick the tile to make landfall on clear away any hazard tiles and then have a finite number of tiles available to settle on in direct relation to the size of the planet or moon be aware that your race s homeworld ecosystem type will directly influence which planets you can settle on at first if you play a race of anthropomorphic polar bears from an arctic world then you can only settle on arctic alpine or tundra worlds to start anything warmer will be too inhospitable for you until you research the right tech to either settle them or better yet terraform them the same goes for other climates upgrades upgrading and designing new ships was done with ease of play in mind this is great for the player that wants to just come up with new configurations and play the game itself but for players more partial to galactic civ s method of build the whole ship piece by tiny piece it won t satisfy however for the former it is extremely satisfying you pick your ship class you pick the hull design or hull segments you want ie front a b c midsection a b c engines a b c and then populate it with weapons and modules that correspond to the available size or type slots on the hull pieces s m l x t p h when updated versions of the weapons or modules become available you simply open that ship replace them in the design and overwrite it all ships of that design will auto update over time and for a fee no deleting mountains of obsolete designs like in galciv paradox knows how to make things simple random events in terms of random events i don t want to spoil anything but rest assured there are a ton of them and they re all over the place from planet based events to entities and units in star systems anomalies multi stage investigation missions election promises and more the gud stuff honestly and we all know canadians can t lie worth a damn anyway stellaris is one of the best games to come out of 2016 in my opinion it takes elements of what make grand strategies so great combines them with elements of what makes sci fi 4x so great and then gives a simplified version of both styles of game that still has enough challenge depth and complexity to keep the average person entertained and while some criticize paradox for their habit of supporting games for years after release with mountains of tiny cheaply priced dlcs and a few big expansions i for one love this model it will keep the game fresh in exactly the way i want it to be without having to pay for the stuff i don t want tl dr stellaris is something of an underrated diamond in the rough paradox created a real gem here and if you love strategy games and moddable ones at that then you absolutely don t want to miss out on stellaris which deserves a solid 8 5 10 in my books
