2020 decided to buy this game after playing it for countless hours with well you know what methods pros about this game are its beautiful soundtrack is 11 10 this game s tracks are really out of this world a genuinely amazing storyline side missions themselves help you a lot to connect to characters and learn about the world some are boring but genuinely most of them are really great missions making you question yourself game really focuses on human aspect and has a good message to all of us cons of this game extremely bad mouse keyboard support honestly if you don t have controller and you don t use the mods this game is unplayable except on easy difficulty where game automates 90 of its contents for you dependence on mods to enjoy on mouse keyboard somewhat unoptimized resolution issues again dependence on mods to fix this cutscene playback issues again dependence on mods to fix this cutscenes use absurd bitrate which provides no benefit leading to unnecessary waste of space most of the cons are porting issues but then again they never really promised a great version for pc just a port i am very glad that existence of mods make this game almost perfect if you are planning to play this on mouse keyboard make sure to get far mod fix automata resolution and naiom mod actually get far mod regardless of if you use controller or m kb resolution is independent of what you use to play once you finish the game it ll definitely leave an empty void in you 100 there is no countering that the storyline of this game is what one can only say a beauty
