2022 ghost of sparta game contains lot of mixed positive elements it is surprisingly respecting to origins visuals presents lots of nordic enviroments with mythologic style cinematics are far beyond good i never remember or it s been so long to remember that a game when i playing i wanted to skip any single cutscene game puts you in a great mod you feel like kratos you feel like a mythologic god pyshics combat exploring gameplay music are all perfect one of the most satisfying fighting experience definitely effects and slow mo sections completes the perfection it is hard to find any defect in a masterpiece like this i played like 50 hours but i got never bored a single minute if you play on higher difficulties you could feel like playing souls series story presentation and cinematics were biggest point for me in this one i could easily recomenned this epic journey it is an unique experience like witcher 3 you will feel the war inside of you i hope this review helps you out kind regards mert
