2020 i have played this game off and on since release i would guess 700 total hours or more this game has had numerous updates over the years but i will tailor this review to newer players first this game in very welcome to newer players but i would suggest ignoring the general chat on starter worlds second this game is fair to play whether you sub or not most of the pay options are cosmetic only if you subscribe for a single month once you revert to free to play you will be a preferred and keep a lot of the benefits third being a subscriber is my preferred way to play you can level using only the class story and never have to grind sidequests to stay within level requirements most of the time you will end up being downleveled to the content as you will be over the max level for the region the class stories are all fantastic and if you don t have to grind to keep up you will feel like you have 8 full kotor quality games the pve experience is great to include raids operations and dungeons flashpoints with an easy to use groupfinder and difficulty that allows all ranges of capable and experiences of players pvp is good multiple ways to get involved in pvp to include matches of huttball spaceship combat world pvp and ranked matches the ranked stuff can get cutthroat and is best experienced with a group of players you know my very first recommendations for new players 1 get a security key free 100 cartel coins monthly used mostly for cosmetic purchases 2 sub for at least a month 3 get into a guild most have already unlocked the 10 experience boost i highly recommend my own guild of course imperial army on starforge server best group of players i have ever played with accross all my many years of many games www imperialarmy org and 4 experience all the classes to at least level 20 before choosing your main eventually you are going to want to experience all the class stories and being subscriber will allow you to do that without breaking up the continuity of lore too much
