how are people not enjoying this game okay 12 hours in and i am loving it let me preface this by saying i am a 40 year old gamer who s been playing since the 80 s starting the game watch i never touched an obsidian game before this as i am a big time radiation fan and this game got me to purchase an xbox xxxl just to play it boy do i feel justified in my purchase i truly do not understand the negativity towards this game personally my brain is much too small for complex writing or more than 4 dialogue options and if those options actually led to different outcomes 0 10 thankfully bethesda made sure to not only solve the dialogue problem but also give me power armor and a weak ass minigun with the first 2 hours of the game i love how you don t have to work hard for gear anymore the trade0off being that it kinda sucks and isn t really that satisfying o effective until you get better gear so why did they do nvm moving on the factions in this game rock i love how the institute is evil for no reason just like the disney villains from the 1950 s i grew up watching complex villains with actual motivations are icky i love the minutemen and expecting 5 farmers to fix the whole state of massachusetts very realistic i looove the brotherhood and how they ve always been this way and they were never ever completely different before or anything and i like how the railroad has no long term goals for boston and also has the most obvious hideout ever again if it was hidden then my brain could not find it and i would rate this 10 11 but thankfully this game is an 11 10 and anyone who disagrees can suck my nuka
