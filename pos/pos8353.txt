2018 i first heard of frostpunk from a youtube streamer lowko it looked interesting and had gorgeous visuals but i was hesitant at the time i was in between buying dlc for cities skylines and frostpunk thought to myself cities is great but there s no end game the dlc is a bandaid i chose frostpunk and was not let down with my choice sure your typical city simulator starts off difficult but gets easier as you progress frostpunk is a refreshing change from the norm it never gets easier only harder i started the game on normal and thoroughly enjoyed it deciding to do a new home on hard was an odd choice for me as i m kind of a one and done with difficulties the intensity strategic planning and design that goes into planning your every move on the higher difficulties kept me coming back for more the plot of the game is rich but isn t obvious at first until you play through the scenarios and read the loading screen tips it s a very personable game filled with moral choices that highly affect the gameplay i would highly recommend the game for all of you planners and thinkers out there who need a challenge a quote from a terrible movie tonight hell freezes over
