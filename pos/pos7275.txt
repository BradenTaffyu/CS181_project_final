2020 surprisingly fun and in depth easily a few hundred hours of content just to explore all the trucks trailers and delivery types the dlc is definitely a must for this game to feel complete but it s pretty cheap when on sale linux support was terrific out of the box including force feedback on my g920 wheel the graphics are somewhat lacking and cpu bound with disappointing anti aliasing implementations but the sounds and texture quality makes up for for the most part i d still like to see msaa implemented to clean up the choppy look of road signs and barriers i would have bypassed this game completely had someone not recommended it to me but it s fantastic and i m happy to pour my money in to development studios that care enough about linux to keep a relevant release up natively for my favorite platform controls are great though require some customization to bind the things you access most commonly to the wheel i play with an h pattern shifter and the 18 gear transmission takes a while to get used to but was very rewarding to get right at the end of the day with great moddability and plenty of content with the map dlcs american truck sim will be staying on my favorites for quite some time with it s fantastic native linux support even if the graphics in particular anti aliasing leave something to be desired
