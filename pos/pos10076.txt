2016 early access review edit 2017 and this game is still as awesome as it was when it popped up on steam a year and a half agoi think it s valuable to have a review from someone who just bought the game and not just those who have been hooked on it for years and i can say confidently that this is one of the best games i ve played in a long time full disclosure i m a long time dwarf fortress player so 1 if you like df you will love this game 2 don t let that scare you if you couldn t get into df see the accessability section below accessability difficultycoming from zero experience it was easy to learn the game if you don t mind losing a couple times which i found fun the ui is very intuitive and easy after a bit of clicking around there are helpful pop ups to guide you those complaining about a lack of a tutorial must just want everything spoon fed to them gameplayif you like simulations colony builders that sort of thing this is for you it is deep but i really think this game could open the genre to new audiences if you don t like having to try more than once twice three times to understand how to be successful this is not for you graphicsthey re good not the game s selling point but suffice to say they re better than they need to be soundrimworld has a very space western vibe and that comes through especially in the sound i love firefly so it was very appealing to me dev supportagain i just bought the game but the developer seems very committed to his players there are suggestion threads on reddit that he browses early accessas stated in the description there are little to no bugs i haven t noticed any at least overallit s 1 on the steam top sellers at time of writing for a reason it s amazingly well designed it has great replayability for those second third fourth attempts what are you waiting for
