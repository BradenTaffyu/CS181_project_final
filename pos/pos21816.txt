2017 so i bought dark souls about 6 months after it came out on pc and well i was not impressed i initially didn t have a controller even after i picked one up i just wasn t into the movement of dark souls it felt so clunky it just seemed like lame slow combat with no sick moves haha at the time i was playing kingdoms of amalur or another action rpg like that with my issues with the gameplay aside i would have been down to stick it out and see what the game was about however i quickly got frustrated with the so called difficulty of dark souls the limiting bonfire system no quest helper tracker and the minimalist dialogue from the one npc at firelink made me just give up i didn t see much of a story and what i did see was about as convoluted a story as i had seen with all of the frustration i had with dark souls i admit i still found it intriguing i said to myself if they fix the movement and gameplay then i ll give the series another shot and so i waited wanting to explore this acclaimed series but trying to find a more accessible entry point dark souls 2 came out and i was tempted but still apprehensive i bought bloodborn on ps4 played it for 10 minutes and never played it again my fault and then dark souls 3 came out finally the modern souls game i was looking for spoilers obviously i waited for a steam sale i finally purchased dark souls 3 i was hoping that this would be a way for me to get into the souls universe i remembered the vague and cryptic story i had experienced and i was stoked to get into this so i started up dark souls 3 again without a controller and after 3 hours i got past iudex the first boss i was excited by the movement being much smoother and also frustrated by the keyboard so i proceeded on with the game moving onto lothric castle i quickly became frustrated with the controls and i just could not progress knight s op versus keyboard so i went out and bought an xbone controller i also started watching a let s play on youtube i was determined to give this game all i had this time i slowly proceeded to get better and more comfortable with the game and the combat i died to probably every single enemy in that castle my deaths at that time were far more stupendous than my kills die to the dragon die to the skeletons next to the dragon die to the knight after the skeletons die to the terrifying possessed zombie thing next to the knight i learned a valuable lesson with all that dying never underestimate an enemy a combination of fear and excitement made me slowly progress to the first real boss as i finally encountered this beast i have to admit i was awestruck that thing is badass and he proceeded to ground me into dust he s huge he s strong and he s fast how do i kill this thing i went in knowing this was gonna take a few tries haha after the tenth time i was ready i knew this moves and he was going down popped an ember and you died four more times and i finally owned that beast the satisfaction was great and the relief of the bonfire was greater whew so this is dark souls i thought this is hard but doable i ventured forth looking to own some more heirs of fire i rambled through the next areas trying to figure everything out as i went but i would also be watching my trusty let s play youtuber to share in my pain and triumphs that really helped me as the dark souls mood can really creep you out as i slowly grew more powerful i dabbled in pyromancy i found my first ultra greatsword i found side bosses and explored and learned about this tragic world making my way through the middle of the game i began to see some of the beauty of the world there are some truly amazing sites in this game irithyll valley anor londo so cool the bosses abyss watchers pontiff sulyvhan the dancer demons dragons giants wowso here i am now just sitting in archdragon peak waiting to find the courage to beat the nameless king and so now coming full circle dark souls 3 has made me decide to play dark souls again just to give it another shot now i m a level 38 pyromancer heading down to the catacombs been enjoying the hell out of it not as smooth as dark souls 3 but definitely great this game is one of the best gaming experiences i ve ever had i really can t say enough about this game thank you from software
