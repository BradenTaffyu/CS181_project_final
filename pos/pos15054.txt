2018 the game is truly amazing note that you can play it totally alone if you wish for those who havent played dont starve you re trying to survive in a surprisingly deeply simulated ecosystem that s illustrated like a tim burton cartoon lots of trial and experimentation is required or else much perusing of the wiki it takes hundreds of hours to fully understand the world you re in the difficulty is that those who have played a lot of dont starve have so much more expertese than those who have never played it that it s the equivalent of a wilderness survival guide taking an 8 year old city kid camping there are pvp servers avoid them if you arent experienced in the game it s not the way most of us play it but some people love it that way new players joining these servers are fodder joining an open co op world you may be able to find someone to help you the only quibble is lack of goal or endgame content in the base dont starve you have 7 gates to pass through and a great mystery to solve why they hell you re in this world in the first place the game is filled with quainltly beautiful struggles for survival and benefits a lot from cooperation
