2022 this game is brutal and i love it don t expect the default difficulty to give first time players an easy time don t expect to play this game thinking you know what s best don t expect to feel good about your choices don t expect the game to get easier don t expect happy endings expect to hate yourself for making bad decisions each time even though you think you know what is best expect the game to hate you no matter how hard you try but you keep going back for more expect to make morally difficult choices that fill you with guilt and regret expect to appreciate the levels of realism this game has to offer expect tears whether you win or lose after playing this game for over 100 hours i have managed to complete the game and all dlc on medium difficulty and i have managed to succeed in beating some scenarios on hard difficulty it s been rough but i am so proud of myself haha this game is brutal but you will appreciate everything it brings to the table if you are the type of person that loves a challenge i highly recommend you play this
