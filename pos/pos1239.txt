early access review in terms of being a zombie game it does its jobzombies aren t super weak like how twd zombies aremaybe not as realistic they should slowly die out from hunger and get reduced population instead of more appearing later and standing in rondom places just living from breathing air ig and as scary as tlou zombies but it has its scary jumpscare in door moments and stuffdifficulty is hard by defaultit is a sandbox with big modding community and can be costumized to fit you perfectlythe only downside of it is repetetive end game unless you play multiplayer or add some danger over time like horde attacks mod or smth like thatit deserves to be called as one of the best zombie games due to how it shows real difficulty of surviving zombie apocalipse and how good it was executed especially on the start where you start with barely anything to survive
