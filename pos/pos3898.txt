2021 so this is xcom but with korean anime characters that is quite literally the best description i can give it but if you think that s a turn off it s not this is easily one of the most entertaining and engaging tactical turn base games i have ever played with some of the catchiest tunes and just stellar artwork there are a slim few cons which i ll mention below but ultimately this is easily one of the best game i ve ever played not to mention this is still getting updates as of 5 7 2021 gameplay gameplay is essentially grid base combat with cover and elevation however it s vastly more complex then xcom 2 haven t played chimera i really need too but also very forgiving characters you get over the course of the game can be vastly customized between abilities gear masteries these can alter stuff such as movement distance turn order damage etc but one of the best distinctions is that you don t have to get kills with specific characters to get exp that alone is a big plus for me abilities all characters come with a basic ability slottable secondary abilities and an ultimate ability as you level up you ll unlock more abilities and masteries as you progress though your base class and advance classes once you unlock an ability it s not limited to whichever advance class you re playing just masteries associated with it for instance a great swordsman albus cannot use masteries of the magic knight class keep in mind slot availability is based on your class so make sure to think about that as you build your characters gear gear is your weapon armor wrist feet accessories and consumables certain characters can only use certain armor and weapons though albus your first character is a sword fighter so of course he uses swords but also armor that s focused on armor since he s a melee fighter on the other hand sion your second is an esp elemental magic and uses a bangle instead for his weapon you will have some characters who s gear can overlap so gearing isn t too hard of a job but there are pros and cons you ll want to weigh as you get things more to your liking crafting on the same topic as gear there s also a very in depth crafting system it ll take some time getting used to it and figuring out how it works but it s the best way to get the best gear you can buy some from weapon vendors at first but they get outclassed very fast the main way you advance though crafting and unlocking new recipes is to simply craft the old ones once you fill up an exp bar for a recipe it ll unlock follow up recipes which will progress you further in levels the actual crafting part is simple but learning how to get the necessary ingredients is the learning curve and it gets expensive masteries so these oh boy these are the thing that make this game masteries are essentially equipment as well that you can socket into your mastery board each character has a different board depending on their class but each has access to basic attack support and defense masteries depending on which you slot you ll activate set bonuses which enhance what they can do early on you can just go about it however you want but once you start making your way through the game you ll really need to start working out builds for characters masteries are limited at first since you unlock more slots and points to spend as you level up you can do some bonkers stuff the mastery compendium is also worth noting as you play and unlock new ones you ll have a record of all the ones you ve obtained i think there s around 600 ish once you ve gotten one once you re able to craft them using excess masteries while you can choose which masteries to pick in order to craft honestly just click on auto select it ll make things a lot less complicated for you animal companions and drones i m only going to touch on this as this is way to complicated to explain without just going into it as you progress in the game you ll recruit two characters one who can tame beast enemies you encounter and one who can build and summon drones beasts are similar to humanoid characters you have in that they have their own mastery board but also have beast and race specific masteries that can drastically alter how they play different beasts you tame will unlock new masteries as they level and can eventually evolve into a stronger class drones on the other hand are similar but very different similar to everything else they do have masteries but you have to craft them using crafting resources instead of just masteries the later ones will also require masteries to craft but that just means more crafting resources in addition to that you have to use the crafting system to make the equipment for the drones unlike the beast which don t require gear but can equip an accessory neither of these things unlock until over half way through the game so don t worry about it too much if you re considering buying just know that they re there story valhalla city is probably a scarier place to live then night city crime is rampant as all hell to the point that the government who s police force couldn t handle the vast amount of crime has authorized citizens who undergo a test to be troubleshooter people who can investigate and arrest criminals this story follows albus berstein a 20 year old freshly licensed troubleshooter as he not only starts his own firm but seeks out knowledge about a terrible disaster that took his parents from him that only the highest ranking troubleshooters can access honestly that s just a preamble that even the store page does a better job of this is a insanely good story and i do not want to spoil anything at all just play the game art i ll just start off and say the character models are nothing to write home about in addition to that a lot of character models gets reused it s not a huge thing since the enemies are distinctly different as for how you deal with them but it s noticeable however the artwork for character conversations is very reminiscent of persona in that you have hand drawn artwork that changes to express that characters emotion not to mention the big pieces are just damn impressive sound so the first thing that drew my interest for this was the trailers song reminiscence that s some cowboy bebop jazz right there but it also feels very fitting when it s used in game the folks behind the soundtrack for this game did an absolutely amazing job with the music with one song in particular hitting that you say run vibe hard we are troubleshooter however there is something worth noting about the voice acting yes this game has it but it s all in what i m assuming is korean considering the team behind this game is korean themselves it makes sense i personally don t have an issue with it and there s actually an option to turn it off completely but that is something worth noting localization nothing huge to say here but i feel it should be addressed for 95 of the game there is little to no issue in regards to the english localization for the game text however over the course of playing the game there have been a handful of issues characters having completely wrong names names being spelled differently etc nothing serious enough that you won t be able to understand what s going on but it has happened a few times progression there s a very specific reason i m writing this section this game is long it took me 70 hours to get through all the story content you unlock new characters very slowly you get your second after a mission or two but character 3 is roughly 6 7 hours in i ve seen people complain about this so it s only right to mention it personally i had no issue with it as the story was engaging enough conclusion seriously if you like turn based strategy games like xcom buy this it s 25 it s super worth
