2021 early access review not sure what happened i downloaded the game and stated playing next thing i know i look up and everyone in the real world is wearing masks and i have dedicated 391 hours to this game i m the kind of rpg player who will make it through half a game with one character and for no reason at all will start a brand new one for and gigs i have like 100 different skyrim characters im no different with this game but on a larger scale because the choices are endless want to go vanilla and make an imperial who follows the story line great want to be a bandit king that messes with all the kingdoms because eff them thats why do it shoot make yourself a battanian and call yourself robin hood want to go from a mercenary to a trusted vassal where you are putting babies into a kings daughter just for the king to die and the rest of the kingdom make you the new king totally doable want to make your own kingdom and then steal away your enemies vassals and make them yours takes a lot of work but you can do it so many possibilities also the mod community for this game is legit once you get high enough the micromanaging becomes insane but there are mods to help with that there are mods for improved game play more equipment even total continent overhaul shoot theres a mod where your character can swing for the same team and you can marry a male noble i love where this game at is now and i can t wait to see where the developers continue to take it
