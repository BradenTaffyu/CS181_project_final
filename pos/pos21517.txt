2022 having been a playstation gamer for many years prior to branching out to pc gaming the forza games were never on my radar forza horizon 5 was my introduction to the forza series i wasn t sure what to expect from it but it looked like a fun open world driving game and i wanted to try it out the graphics are stunning mexico looks absolutely beautiful the cars look great with excellent attention to detail there s a huge range of cars to earn 500 by completing various races events stories accolades etc some are also rng rewards that you can win through wheelspins car customisation via upgrades and tuning options are great to experiment with to find the right set up for your favourite cars i absolutely love this feature personally but for those who don t there s also community creations that you can use instead you re also able to create your own liveries with endless possibilities i also love this feature although my favourite cars are almost all sprayed purple with black wheels and tinted windows i have a type okay as for the story it was meh not memorable some very tedious moments with non skippable cutscences however it encourages to explore parts of the map you may not otherwise experience i generally opt for more simulator type games i e realistic driving this game definitely does not fall in to that category it s leans more towards the arcade y style and that s fine after a hard day at work college it s stupidly fun to drive around like a lunatic destroying fences drifting super high speed big jumps etc all while earning points and combos to gain fast xp it s even more fun with friends the tracks are decent and offer lots of variety in racing styles from drifting to circuit to rally the eventlab feature allows players to create their own tracks this is great fun people s creativity will never cease to amaze me a lot of the negative reviews i ve read mention issues with performance it s been fine for me just one stuttering issue in 38 hours of gameplay no crashes at all i didn t experience connection issues to friends other players either tl dr great game if you re looking for a fun open world driving experience lots of styles of racing and tonnes of cars to choose from looks incredible lots to do 8 10 for the fun factor
