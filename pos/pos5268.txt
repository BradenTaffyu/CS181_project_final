2015 haven t played very much of this game but then again nobody has and from what i have seen i don t get what these negative reviews are going on about this game is great it runs perfectly with high graphics on my old machine i have encountered absolutely no bugs and the whole thing feels like an upgrade to fallout 3 in every way a great game edit 45 hours later this game is still amazing deep funny and completely engrossing worth each and every one of the fifteen million bottlecaps i payed bethesda for it
