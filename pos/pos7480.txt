2020 early access review let me instill fear into your crafting survival experience with a short intro and gameplay video no spoilers youtube video views 0 jump scares bait your friends sweat profusely as you lose sight of shark s when you fall into the water clean the ocean from environmental pollution craft research sail your way through a mysterious open water adventure to islands and various non island points of interest surprisingly excellent to play alone as a nomad as well gameplay satisfying ok i d rather get a papercut never againtriggered easily know that when your friends don t know how to sort into boxes its okay there are bigger storage containers also the shark s will randomly swim through land mass as indicated in the video 04 43 and 10 17i had this game on my wishlist far too long and canteven other player in video convinced me to get it on sale 15 i was originally turned off by the graphics in other reviews and found the game pleasant when we started overall i would have paid 20 for it if i knew it be this much fun just sailing around graphics omg is this heaven very good decent ewww dry erase board drawing audio joyful good stabbed in the eardrumyou ll knock out 40 hrs real quick try all the game modes eventually when you get the hang of the game the grind is real its shark combat salvaging from the sea mining researching and crafting over and over again pc reqs are minimal you ll run the game well audience is for all agesglitches are rare shark s are sneaky as hell i mean they maneuver around strategically you can become an expert at shark annihilation without getting hit if you learn their behavior once killed shark s spawn after 3 3 30 minutes a short window to loot freely unfortunately there s a delay if you play in someone else s game so your time window is significantly shortened to move and dodge be aware of your food and water you ll swim too slow if you run out of stam and become a highlight in when animals attack difficulty sandbox no threat easy challenging on hard currently we got up to 4 sharks to spawn at the same time had to change my skivvies a few times after being in the water
