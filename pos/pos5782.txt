2022 early access review this game takes some of my favorite parts about warband and improves on a solid chunk of it massive battles yep improved ai yep many more options of things to do besides kill yep given that i have about 450 hours on warband at the time of writing i notice a lot of things that bannerlord makes different and better the combat feels more deliberate than warband and therefore is slightly more realistic despite it being in early access it is relatively stable and whenever it crashes i can quickly reboot to where i was with very little hassle the game is being updated a lot the most recent dev log at time of writing surpassed the steam forum character limit i went on their site to check out the changes and it was a lot of good things fixing bugs fixing exploits fixing the experience gain system if you enjoyed warband as much as i did i highly recommend this game not only is it a rush of dopamine to see a ton of green in the top corner of the screen but the ragdolls are on point easily some of the best moments have come from slingshotting a peasant across the battlefield with a lance or smacking some poor horse archer into the shadow realm with a two handed sword some of the downsides are early access which leads to a number of funky things no pve online game mode which will probably be added soon i hope it s a big game i had to uninstall a few games in order to make space for it but it was worth it overall solid 9 10 would recommend to anybody that doesn t mind the game being in early access for a long time and that loved warband
