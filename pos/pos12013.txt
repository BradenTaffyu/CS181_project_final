2018 early access review it s a good game but it has a few flaws you ll see the game is not exactly hard it requires wit concentracion reflexes and a lot of knowledge of the mechanics but once you get a grasp of all of those things just as any other roguelike you have it i didn t complete a run yet i hope i ll do it soon enough so maybe later i ll have to modify my review when i get into the boss cells mechanics but what it is so far the game is really absorbing when you die you want to try over and over again until you complete a run the basic problem it has is it has a few powerups you wanna get because you think they are going to open you the gates of heaven but in the end it s just one more mechanic that might be useful for a few things but it s not going to be the massive revelation however for the sake of gameplay you have to get them for giving you an example if you want to get certain blueprints or have access to extra weapons and spells the builds you can make are so many that is really hard to keep a spreadsheet with them the balancing between items is averagely good some of them are broken some mechanics are just crazy but others are straightforwardly awesome and they can give a good sense of challenge in the other hand however the game has a huge issue with level balancing if you go to the harder levels it d be logical that you get higher rewards for taking the risk and loosing your run but in the other hand you might most likely get exactly the same items and cells you d get in the easiest path if not less or even loosing everything because the difficulty curve between the easy path and the alternative path is extraordinarily high but extremely unrewarding i don t complain about the difficulty i complain more like about the lack of rewards for taking the hard choice aside from the self pride which is nice but for self impossed challenges i have better games to go to in few words the game is extremely good extremely fun really good to run and enjoy but it could use a few tweaks
