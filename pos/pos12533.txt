2012 i love the ability to play in a game where everyone can make everything theres no such thing as a playing wall in this game because someone will just make a new gamemode for you to play i wrote that christmas 2012 still true to this day story 10 10 you make your own or play in someone else s always new gameplay 10 10 depends on the game but that excels still presentation 8 10 gold source well ok soundtrack x 10 none default replayability 9 10 gets boring sometimes but you ll always come back
