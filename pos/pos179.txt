2016 i suffer from dysthymia which is a form of chronic depression apart from some rare occasions when my family literally forces me to go outside to do some minor chores like taking out the trash i hadn t left the house for 2 weeks until i found this game i came across this game by chance on a random research on google and was imediately attracted by the pixel graphics i ve had a soft spot for pixel games ever since i first played pok mon on my game boy color i wanted to play the game but i finished my college degree a couple years ago and couldn t get a job since so i don t have a lot of money to spend on games i may not like so i got the pirated version not even knowing it was a pirated copy i only found out it was a steam game a couple days later and started reading articles on the game found the wiki found the modders community started to mod my game to customize the graphics and add extra features found the farm layout planner and fooled around in it for a couple days and i just fell in love with the game and the community behind it the quality of the graphics the amount of different features it offers the support you get if you run into any kind of trouble the game is so simple yet so complex and detailed at the same time it s so fun to play that it gets addictive but it s also very relaxing to know you can just play at your own pace and take your time to explore and you won t be missing on any time limit events it put a smile in my face again i knew i just had to have a legit copy of this game it felt like money well spent so today i finally found a reason to wilingly get out of the house to go for a walk and have an excuse to charge my paysafe account and purchase myself the steam version of this game no regrets also the author is still working on the game releasing regular updates with extra content years after publishing this game is a product of love and it won t be easily forgotten by ca or the sv community update it is my biggest pleasure to nominate this game for the steam awards 2016 and 2018 and 2019 d
