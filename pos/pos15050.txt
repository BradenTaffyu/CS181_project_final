2021 don t starve together holds a very special place in my heart sure it s not the grandest game in the world but to me it does it what s supposed to it s a victorian style survival game with co op the game can be quite hard but if you make your own world you can adjust it to be easier if you so desire the game receives decent updates and as of now most characters i believe have had reworks done to them there are large servers you can join and play in but personally the charm for me is with the fact i and my s o had originally played this game when we had first started dating but now almost 7 years later as of writing this we still come back to the game and make a world for us both to play on for a bit
