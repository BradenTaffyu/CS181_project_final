2018 early access review such a fun game and love the sims 1 style graphics haha d me and my boyfriend have spend many number of hours and days on this game building a base together and leveling up our characters i have to say this is probably the only game i m happy for it to stay in early access as it always means new and cool updates and the developers are always brilliant in making the experience of game even better and listen to fans that play it will always be a fan of this game
