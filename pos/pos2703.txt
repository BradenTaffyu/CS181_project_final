2018 divinity original sin 2 is like playing a very enthusiastic dungeon master s homebrew campaign said dm really fell in love with the cosmology and deities section of the dungeon master s guide as well as the idea of creating an epic really long arc where his players eventually achieve godhood mr dm also put an awful lot of time into fleshing out his world and making sure you know that his elves are different they eat people and get their memories see though for some reason he decided to keep his dwarves scottish this dm is not perfect and has his faults for one he really loves throwing environmental effects all over the battlefield to the point of it becoming annoying fire spreads 50 feet in an arc now ice shoots out over the fire now smoke and lighting and tentacles spread atop the fire and ice yeah near the end of the campaign his planning starts to slip both in combat design and in lore for instance he offers his players a variety of different endings to their grand adventure but none of them are all that great and one gets the feeling that he randomly chose the final boss by just flipping through the monster manual with the intent of picking a challenge rating 30 beastie just to tell his other dm friends that i put my players up against this guy once and they kind of survived after playing for nearly 140 hours though none of his players can say it wasn t an epic time at the table they ll probably be back for more btw mr dm lohse was the best character you created
