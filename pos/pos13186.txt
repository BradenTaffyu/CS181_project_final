2021 kerbal space program is a 10 outta 10 game it really is if i had this game on the family pc growing up as a kid i probably would have never gotten off the thing kerbal is a simulation building management physics sandbox game where you control your own aeronautical space agency for this race of minion like species called kerbals i think they made them extra cute because they will often die horrible deaths because of your own ignorance incompetence i guess that was a good idea in management mode the main focus of the game in my opinion you buy upgrade infrastructure take missions from corporations and governments complete those contracts to get more money and more research points to then develop new parts infrastructure to then build more complicated ships bases to take increasingly complex contracts rinse recycle repeat after taking a mission you build your ship this part is very interesting and you need to get a feel for how to make your ship make sense it needs to be aerodynamic it needs to be light enough it needs enough fuel you need to think about things like solar panels for power where do the parachutes go for the return trip and most importantly staging staging is how the ship intentionally breaks away you don t need the giant boosters after you re in the stratosphere and approaching space so you can just ditch that when re entering the planet at the end of your mission all you need is your crew plus re entery is hot so you need just the return crew pod and to make sure that it can dissipate heat with enough shielding so it doesn t explode in the atmosphere all of this is sincerely invigorating to think about and it s not as daunting as it seems as the in game tutorials do an excellent job dumbing it down for you although later missions will still require some galaxy brain thought that s beyond me after you have your mission built your ship and choose your crew they have skill stats depending on what jobs you have them work and their starting skills when you hire them you then have to take control and pilot stage your ship manually luckily you can reload it at the start of launch to tweak your build or try to figure out how if you can fly the thing you ll see a lot of hilarious screw ups at this section this can actually take a long time as a successful mission will have you rounding an orbit going to the moon landing taking readings getting samples returning etc this game is fully fleshed out and very time consuming the time flies by though if you just want to build and fly things without worrying about money research and management you can do all that in the sandbox mode it s not my preference but if that s your thing then go for it anyway what you have here is a fully fleshed out well thought out time passing time consuming fun educational immersive sim game this game rules and i d recommend it to anyone at full price let alone when it s on sale if it is on sale definitely pick it up and have a blast playing this one this is one of my favorite games on steam and looking at the hours put into it it s in my top 20 on here i have a lot of games
