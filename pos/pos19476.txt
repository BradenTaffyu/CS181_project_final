2022 and so the courier who had cheated death in the cemetery outside goodsprings cheated death once again and the mojave wasteland was forever changed the new california republic celebrated its second victory at hoover dam establishing definitive control over the entire mojave wasteland soon after they negotiated terms to annex the strip freeside and many surrounding communities the mojave wasteland at long last had entirely fallen under the ncr s banner the courier fair and even handed in his dealings throughout the wasteland was honored by the ncr for his support of the military at hoover dam he was presented with the golden branch the highest civilian decoration given by the republic tabitha and rhonda went east through caesar s land occasionally tales of their exploits found their way back west though few believed them eventually the stories concerning the duo were collected and published and proved to be quite popular with children invigorated by his travels with the courier raul once more took up his guns in memory of his lost rafaela soon after the mojave was filled with tales of the ghost vaquero who hunts down those who prey on the weak with the help of the gun runners the boomers developed a healthy trading relationship with the ncr eventually the boomers began wandering out into the wasteland while still preventing outsiders from entering nellis the brotherhood and the ncr in the mojave wasteland declared an official truce despite continued hostilities between the two in the west as per their agreement the ncr handed over all suits of salvaged power armor and in return the brotherhood helped patrol i 15 and highway 95 the peace with ncr served to ease veronica s worries about the brotherhood s immediate future still a distance had arisen between her and her fellow members that would never be bridged she began secluding herself in crumbling libraries of the old world learning of promising technologies she knew the brotherhood would never adopt their leaders destroyed by the courier the fiends scattered throughout the wasteland without the organization of motor runner cook cook violet and driver nephi they were easy prey after the ncr s victory at the dam in part thanks to follower s medical support ncr allowed the followers to care for refugees as they see fit old mormon fort expanded its services and was able to aid more people becoming a refuge for the less fortunate citizens of new vegas though arcade had not hoped for an ncr victory he was proud of his role in the defense of hoover dam against the forces of caesar s legion unfortunately when word spread that arcade was once a member of the enclave he was forced out of the followers of the apocalypse pursued by bounty hunters ncr rangers and the brotherhood of steel arcade pushed deep into the eastern plains and was never heard from again goodsprings saw more trade along i 15 after ncr gained control of the mojave wasteland but with that came a heavy burden of the republic s taxes some old timers unable to handle the cost were forced to move on grumbling all the while in the years following the destruction of cassidy caravans ncr used evidence of the plot to blackmail the crimson caravan and the van graffs ncr enacted strict trade laws with little resistance strengthening their supply lines and their position in the mojave cass survived to see the ncr flag flying proud over hoover dam and thought for a moment this is what a hero must feel like she was about to tell the courier not to get too proud of himself herself then she figured he she knew that already that night cass kicked in the door of his room to celebrate only to find the man on the bed was an ncr soldier whose barracks had been destroyed he was cute though so after having her way with him she got the hell out leaving an empty whiskey bottle as a note as she walked along the dam in the night she felt drunk content and happy to be alive which to her was the whole point of it all so she laughed said it all and raised a bottle to the dam and the ones who had fought for it as far as she was concerned the whole thing was proof that playing out a bad hand can pay off in the end as long as someone like the courier was holding the cards during the battle of hoover dam the great khans quickly evacuated red rock canyon and headed north and east into the plains of wyoming there they reconnected with the followers of the apocalypse and rebuilt their strength bolstered by ancient knowledge of governance economics and transportation they carved a mighty empire out of the ruins of the northwest thanks to the courier and lily a cure for the nightkin s schizophrenia was found shortly after doctor henry s experiment concluded nightkin and other super mutants in the wasteland flocked to jacobstown and the town became known as a haven where a mutant could find peace encouraged by the courier to take her medication regularly lily s mind eventually attained a semblance of clarity her memories dulled by the pills she cast aside the recording of her grandchildren no longer remembering its significance after the ncr victory at hoover dam the temporary truce between them and the kings blossomed into a full scale relief effort for the people while the ncr made repeated entreaties that freeside join the republic the kings steadfastly maintained their independence after rey s brain was transplanted into rex s cybernetic body it took rex some time to adjust to the old scrapyard dog s memories eventually rex s mind settled peacefully melding his own memories with that of long travels with old lady gibson shaped up by the courier s advice the misfits distinguished themselves during the legion s attack on camp golf mags was finally promoted to sergeant and the rest of the misfits received an official commendation they continued to serve with distinction for many years though novac was a low priority target for the legion many of novac s citizens died in its defense in the weeks that followed several bright followers returned to novac to help restore its defenses allowing it to remain independent of the ncr looking for a place where he could be of some use boone found himself re enlisting with his old unit though his regrets remained in his thoughts they coalesced into a purpose and boone embraced it he spent his leave time hunting down slavers in the desert his first recon beret the last thing they never saw after hoover dam the leaderless powder gangers at the correctional facility vanished into the wastes leaving the prison empty the correctional facility became another abandoned ruin in the wasteland its carcass occasionally picked over by enterprising prospectors after the vault 19 powder gang surrendered to the ncr they were re incorporated into the correctional system the ncr did increase their sentences and they aren t about to take off time for good behavior after hoover dam ncr helps rebuild primm as a major stopping point on the long 15 though primm s citizens chafe under ncr s taxes they benefit greatly from the increased protection and merchant traffic primm slim proves to be an able minded if not able bodied sheriff for primm due to his slow speed some crooks get away without a scratch but primm continues to prosper under his watchful robotic eye with its logs cleared and its systems upgraded ed e remained a vigilant and constant companion to the courier the brotherhood used the information recovered from ed e to create a small army of duraframe eyebots although they performed admirably during ncr s defense of hoover dam the rangers fell into decline soon after with hanlon s plot against the occupation exposed and oliver hailed as ncr s new war hero many rangers were greeted coldly on their return home few openly blamed the rangers for hanlon s treachery but public and political support
