2023 early access review caves of qud is a game i ve followed for at least 4 years now i think i remember when this game didn t even have a cooking system and the main quest ended after redacted with the redacted and the puffing and all that it is bar none one of the most absurdly detailed experiences i ve ever had with a game playing this game is like peeling back strata of a world older than every idea like trying to make friends with a new kind of darkness when you no longer know how to hide like staring at silence for ages and trying to hear a noise only to realize that what you are hearing is the pause between two words and understanding what all of that means you will also probably die because a goat threw spicy plants at you a lot but there s a lot of messes to be made and weird to uncover even if you end up dying many many times live drink and find something you weren t expecting
