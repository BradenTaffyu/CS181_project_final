2015 i was only seventeen years old i loved caesar so much i owned all of his machetes and balistic fists i pray to caesar every night thanking him for the life i have been given caesar is love i say caesar is life my dad hears me and calls me a psychopath and a murderer he is obviously jealous of my devotion to caesar i called him a filthy degenerate he slaps me and sends me to my tent i am crying now because my face hurts i go into my bedroll and it is very cold i feel a warmth moving towards me i feel something touch me it s caesar i am so happy he whispers into my ear this is my dam he grabs me with his powerful royal hands and makes me kneel i m ready i spread the blood of my enemies for caesar he penetrates the mojave it hurts so much but i do it for caesar i can feel my home burning as my eyes start to water i lead his forces to battle i want to please caesar he roars a mighty roar as he fills the colorado river with ncr bodies my dad walks in caesar looks him deep in the eyes and says veni vidi vici caesar leaves through the dust and firecaesar is love caesar is life
