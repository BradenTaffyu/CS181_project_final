2016 early access review this is everything i wished car mechanic simulator jalopy was a totally accurate simulation of a vehichle you build from the ground up survival elements that are annoying at first but they grow on you when you realize that they diversify gameplay causing the car building to be less mind numbing rpg elements that allow you to upgrade your car a dedicated middle finger buttontrust me the feeling of getting the whole car together after 10 hours of work is one of the greatest feelings i ve ever had in a videogame do you want to feel accomplished this game will make you feel accomplished now this does come with some negatives the game looks like garbage except for the cars which look decent the controls are unintuitive to say the least because a lot of the game is physics based it s incredibly buggy don t leave your engine on the hoist outside there is no tutorial if you want to build the car you re going to have to resort to the wiki or know a thing or two about cars before you play however if you read the wiki you won t get the same feeling as you would if you built the car yourself although the game is finnish it s translated to english which is nice except the transations aren t localized most of the dialogue makes no sense the humor also doesn t translate well the dialogue sound assets are terrible no mod support multiplayer dying in the game causes you to spawn very far away from your house so you have to get drunk and pass out to spawn back at the house this is a nuissanceso with all the negatives why am i giving this game a thumbs up beacuse it s fun it is a fun game it s frustrating at times but it s fun it s a fun and rewarding game i d recommend it to anyone who likes cars even remotely
