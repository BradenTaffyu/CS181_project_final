2022 early access review after 40 hours and 100 completing this early access game i can say that it s one of the most fun i ve played i keep playing even though there is nothing left to do and there is no more fish to catch because it is still enjoyable after my life feels so meaningless now i eat sushi in the darkness and play the same overpriced fps in hopes that the full game releases soon amazing 5 stars 10 10
