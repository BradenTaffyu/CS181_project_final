2018 i ve already played over 200 hours and i ve barely scratched the surface of the main quest i love the setting and the atmosphere i really enjoy the sidequests and i adore the settlement building i ve played some of the dlc too automatron is a lot of fun as is far harbour i m not even tired of preston telling me that another settlement needs my help
