2017 there s more to the ugly business of war than shooting people real war is about communication cooperation patience and logistics there are very few games that show how real military organizations handle objectives and honestly arma 3 is the best way of giving atleast a glimpse of how a real military operation may be broken down and solved i ve got to say though arma is not a simulator not at all this game does absolutely give you a more realistic view of what real firefights are like i e you can t see anything and nothing makes sense but it is not a sim overall getting arma d is a common phrase for the otherwise great vr engine mostly havok actually ruining any house of cards you try and set up the ai isn t too great either and normally needs a person to keep them on a leash to get the best out of them but like most truly amazing games the true magic is what you can do with it mods it s a platform like an m16a4 it comes into it s own when you stick stuff on the picatinny rails if you can think of any major military commitment in the last 100 years you can probably recreate it in this game everything from ww2 dogfights navy seals in nam black ops firefights in the hamlets of serbia cold war submarine stuff right up to full on flag waving desert storm and street fights in fallujah after watching a war documentary you can probably find the exact gun and tank someone talked about in it right down to weird sub versions then run around doing war like stuff with them the community for that stuff is remarkable and you really can go from far above the clouds to the bottom of the sea seamlessly on detailed maps that often extend many kilometres in each direction tanks cars trucks mraps ifvs apcs fighter jets transport planes submarines boats all fully functional and often lovingly detailed if you like equipment this is perfect if you re ok with modding same is true for infantry gear if you like a good gun how does a few hundred sound performance is infamously poor but it s perhaps not surprising considering the sheer complexity of it all quality of life updates from bohemia do come out and it s surprising how different the game feels since release buying this game does give you access to an insane amount of content and games within games zombie stuff too but for the actual game right out of the box it s still pretty good especially with the apex expansion which is wonderful online community is especially good too with even a few real serving military people it s all very mature but friendly if you re even mildly interested in the military this is a truly great game it s not as intimidating as it sounds
