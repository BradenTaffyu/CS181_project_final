2019 product received for free gift from a friend but i bought the switch version at a later date so i could take this game on the go this game is amaziiiing and absolutely addicting i never played farming sims before this but it didn t matter i love it so much to do more than farming fishing and mining and working on the community center finding a love interest and other little projects it s also nice to raise a variety of livestock and make artisan goods everything you can do is rewarding and all the people are so interesting in the town co op is also fun loved this game so much as i said that i recently bought the switch version so i could take it on the go but with some flaws on the switch version ex lack of labels on goods i would recommend this version first to get yourself acquainted
