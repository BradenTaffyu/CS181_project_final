2020 i think eric barone described his plans for the game best i want when you re playing it to be full of joy and wonder and to bring you back the kind of magic that you may have felt when you were a kid when you first played video games and boy did he deliver stardew valley is one of the most calming games of all time the thing that attributes to that is the fact that you can t really lose in this game and once you re done with the game you can increase the playtime by installing mods the modding scene is still very active up to this day so please do yourself a favor and buy this game right now i m so obsessed with this game i played this rather than studying for my finals and i 100 d this game
