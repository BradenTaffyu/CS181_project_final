2020 rimworld has been unexpectedly time absorbing and relaxing when i started playing i was most interested in building bases but as i ve become more familiar with the game i ve found i really enjoy the random events currently i ve been playing on phoebe chillax difficulty and the pace and balance of the encounters has felt pretty good while i relax enjoy the game and learn if the other difficulties are tuned as nicely then i will likely be enjoying this game for a while i definitely recommend rimworld to anyone who enjoys the combination of building and survival game types
