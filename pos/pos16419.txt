2019 early access review this is one of the most immersive games i ve seen in years you play as a teenager in 1995 rural finland your parents are on vacation and you are alone in your house there s your father s dilapidated car in the garage which you can assemble fix and upgrade you ll need money for that also to buy food and drinks so you can do some menial and repetitive jobs like chopping firewood and emptying septic tanks you can also use other vehichles like your uncle s van or tractor there are no tutorials no one to hold your hand you will probably need to look up a guide to build the car for the first time especially if you re not a car mechanic in real life this game is hard unforgiving and frustrating at times but this only makes it more immersive and rewarding when you get stuff done right like figuring out something as simple as brewing coffee or catching and cooking fish there are no immediate and obvious goals you just kinda live in this game its main feature is building fixing and tuning your car and also driving it around so it s best if you have a steering wheel controller car build is very detailed and driving simulation is realistic but it s not all about the car some of the other things you can do bring food to you grandmother and listen to her talk so that she gives you some money when you leave buy a pc and download some simple video games to play play cards and win a new house or lose your own and have to live in your car get blackout drunk get in a fight with a local jerk and take his wristwatch as a trophy give a ride to an alcoholic and befriend him eventually helping him move to a new house or betray him and drive him to suicide get murdered by a guy with an axe drown in a septic tank brew homemade booze and sell it participate in a rally empty your septic truck onto someone s front yard get fined by police fail to pay the fine and end up in jail develop a caffeine and nicotine addiction steal from a shop press a dedicated button to swear and another one to flip people off pee in people s faces or forget to pee for a long time and die of bladder explosion have your car s engine explode and cook some fish on its fire drive with a broken windshield and die of a wasp sting you have allergy so wasps are deadly visit a haunted mansion at night and see a ghost accidentally go to sleep while holding a lit cigarette and burn you whole house down install a badass stereo system into your car to flex on the local plebs10 10 highly recommended to anyone looking for an immersive survival game even if you re not interested in cars
