2020 early access review liffen drenk nyehheheheheh this is probably one of the most immersive roguelikes i ve played to date the ambient soundtrack the colorful and interesting characters and the level of interactiveness is something to behold every playthrough is different thanks to the way factions work along with procedurally generated encounters despite the overworld map having the same layout each time there are so many classes skills mutations weapons and tools that make the game playable in many different ways for example wall in your way chip away at it with a pickaxe no pickaxe blow it up with explosives no explosives melt it with your corrosive gas mutation no corrosive gas use a shade oil to literally phase through the wall like a ghost no shade oil dig through it with burrowing claws the list goes on and there are a rediculously large variety of ways to get around kill and charm your way into heroism riches or villainy as you so desire live and drink friend now give me your water
