2023 honest cities skylines ii review involves majority of the dlcs from its predecessor with some major improvements and some not so favorable optimization overall i really enjoy the game with all the new features and management of you city from the ground up lots of mods that were available for cities skylines have been integrated into the second generation road building and structure placements have been made way easier to move with a new system for citizens to determine the most efficient way of transport depending on peoples needs turning your city into a bustling metropolis the downsides so far for me has been some of the industries as that was my favorite expansion of its predecessor the industries are easier to layout and forget but i enjoyed some of the management of it and the realism of the first on in cities skylines ii i think the resources should be reevaluated as a lot of canadian and american cities are built from oil and gas or mining sectors you will run out of resources in a area before your city can even reach a high milestone in which you need to redevelop your sector somewhere else i would like to see the ability for unlimited resources or a more accurate consumption rate with variety of assets you can invest into these industries the main issues people have had with this game is its optimization my pc has handled the game fine with some tweaking of the settings as you have to do with most newer titles as time goes on i hope more people can actually enjoy the game as i do specs monitor samsung odyssey g9 main games samsung odyssey neo g8 secondary forever running discord and youtube cpu amd ryzen 5800xgpu gigabyte 3080ti 12gbram corsair vengeance 64 gbstorage m 2 wd black sn850 2tb cities skylines ii samsung sata ssd 8tb
