2022 early access review 7 days to die is a survival game which is still in early access the game is already having a huge bunch of content especially if you compare other games in this genre like raft for instance for the past decade of early access the game changed drastically the devs added new enemies items weapons mechanics the optimization steadily being improved too i also want to mention handcrafted building they all are different and interesting to investigate by playing 7 days to die you don t imitate the surviving you make it with each night you discover new enemies zombie horde increases and you always want to make your base more protective in my opinion 7 days to die is one of the best co op survival games at this moment
