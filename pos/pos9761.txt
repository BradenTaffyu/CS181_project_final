2016 my first experience with rimworld first hour of play decided to start off by enabling permadeath mode since i want my ups to actually punish me get 3 decent colonists find a nice location everything fine so far 2nd hourgot a very primitive base set up survived the first raid consisting of one drugged up raider with a shoddy club she was easily dispatched of a 4th colonist named donovan arrives his skill in growing enables me to grow healroot this is looking better and better 3rd houra stockpile for food with proper refrigeration is set up several workshops created built a spacious rec room with a chess and a billiards table and several plantpots refurnished the bedrooms in order to increase their size due to complaints from colonists first harvest of corn and potato is harvested and stockpiled the colony can now survive the winter season at this point and time i confident my base defenses have been fortified and food is plentiful even managed to build a specific section for medical needs as i am caught up in my planning for further expansion i fail to notice a rogue boomrat that apparently snuck into my rec room this rat is quite hungry apparently as it collapses on the floor seconds later it dies in a decent sized explosion that sends fire all across the room which wouldn t be a problem if it wasn t for the fact that my entire base is built out of wood panic spreads in the colony only two colonists are able to fight fire and one of them quickly dies due to the house burning too fiercly the other one retreats outside the death of the first colonist collins sends his trusty labrador into a rage fit and the mongrel decides to attack my sleeping colonists it shreds the throat of two colonists before it makes it s way outside shame that those two were the only ones armed with guns my last colonist manages to vanquish the foe before passing out due to her wounds 4th hourmy last colonist is unconscious outside of the base which now looks like a reinactment of a scene straight out of dante s inferno a lonely raider decides to pop by destroys the solar panels for some reason before he decides to kidnap my wounded colonist he picks her up and runs away with her and so ends the tale of new haven a mighty encampment defeated by a single hungry boomrat i don t know if i should laugh or cry so i grab a beer and decide to create a new colony tldr don t let hungry boomrats into your base which is built out of wood it will end in fiery doom and hilarity 100 10
