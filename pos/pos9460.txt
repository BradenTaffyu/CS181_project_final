2020 assetto corsa is the best selling sim on steam for a reason referrals and reccomendations but this is not a plug and play sim like it s successor acc and here s why 1 graphics without mods they re great but your hardware will beg to differ especially when you turn on aa and shadows this is where content manager comes in it comes in freeware or a full version that lets you donate as little or much of your paypal to the developers of cm within cm is custom shaders patch which lets you turn off shadows completely and boost fxaa a less resource hogging version of aa but competent if you re running a high end rig there are so many options within cm to make the visual experience on par with the project cars franchise that i can t list them all here 2 controls and ffb your results will vary take your time and get a feel for what works best for your gamepad or wheel it will take a couple of hours to do this do not play with a keyboard you are defeating the purpose of buying this 3 multiplayer you can have 10 000 drivers on 3600 servers at any given time but don t rush into one without knowledge of your car and track and the best settings for your car s track not only will your experience be bad for everyone else and you but you can get permanent bans from servers that use kmr a plugin that creates a currency on the server for you kmr deducts money for cuts crashes speeding into the pits clicking back to pits instead of taking the cooldown lap to pit lane and can permanently ban you when your balance reaches 0 only the admins of kmr servers can refil your balance and they have the right to deny that practice practice practice and try to stay away from kmr servers other than those major nitpicks i love this game it has a variety of cars and a much larger mod base some assetto corsa cars like the 787b were even acquired from modders like urd who are known for their high quality sim mods give it a try but make sure to go to cheapdigitaldownload com so you can get the game all dlc for less than 20 good luck
