2022 early access review when you need a little bit more survival and horror in your crafting survival games 7 days is the direction i go the updates that are big but widely spread out keep the game refreshing and feeling new nowhere near as overwhelming as any of the minecraft updates i prefer 7 days over minecraft due to the fact that zombies could come for you at any moment and do come for you on every 7th night plus while this game does follow a grid system like minecraft the graphics are much better if your system can handle them i m not bashing minecraft but sometimes the peaceful days needs to be broken by gunfire and a chainsaw
