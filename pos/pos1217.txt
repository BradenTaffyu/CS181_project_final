2021 early access review ahh project zomboid a game that has been in development for quite some time part of that is due to some very troubling history of the devs losing data without backups which they learned from i can imagine and the other half is due to the devs not killing themselves like many will end up doing in this industry they have a vision and they re making slow but steady progress as for the game itself it s quite something it s got the atmosphere of any zombie apocalypse scenario you want want 28 days later you got it want the classic shambling romero zombie you got it want zombies to be strong and intelligent but few you got that as well i have played every zombie game out there just about but project zomboid captures that survival feeling that is missing from so many the latest build updates the characters animations and weather which bring so much life to the game and is fantastic you will die and probably a lot but that is what makes the game when you start feeling like a true survivalist then you have mods to shake it up this game has a lot of depth than you would first realize can t wait to see what this beast becomes i ll update this review upon final 1 0 release
