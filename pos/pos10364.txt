2020 this game makes project cars 2 feel like an arcade racer i honestly am so annoyed at myself for waiting so long to get this game the physics feel so much more realistic i can actually brake correctly turn corners and run over curbs without spinning off which i hated about pc2 out of the box competizione just plays so well i don t need to fiddle with setups and all of that i can just jump into the car and race and think about learning to set the cars up later
