2017 the first falout i ever played the best fallout i ever played this game started me on the path to playing every single fallout before it and hyped me to play every single after currently only fallout 4 one of the most emersive rpg experiences available it feels awful real when your stuck in the desert dying of thirst and too afraid to fast travel because you may legit die if you do its great man maybe not the best story line in the world but certianly the best as far as free will goes as in no one is immortal no one i dont care how important to the storyline they are you can kill em just give it a go if you hate it well its cheap as dirt by now but if you love it you ll be waiting for the second just like millions like me not sure if it will happen though
