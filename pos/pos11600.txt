2016 early access review 7 days to die is a very good game you use your character which you either create or use a preset to scavenge farm fight and survive in one of two map options navezgane their hand crafted survival map or a randomly generated world gameplay elements you are most of the early game in an up hill battle trying to keep your hunger and thirst along with a third wellness bars high while trying to avoid zombies and if you play multiplayer people you have to manage your inventory well you never know when you will get something very vital to survival but not have enough room for it but that goes without saying in most games like these on another note every 7 days as the name implies a horde of zombies appears and as the weeks go on the hordes get progressively harder this adds a really good pacing to the game keeping you on your toes things i personally don t really like my computer specs well surpass the reccomended specs but still get god awful frames ehhh the schematics annoy me sometimes but they do add a good gameplay element if you look at it that way conclusion all in all this game is rather good i suggest you play on the highest difficulty with the highest enemy spawn rate if you disagree with anything i said here or if i have said anything wrong about this game please let me know in the comments
