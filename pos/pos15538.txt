i absolutely love to relax while playing games like this however there are some issues that get under the skin of a car guy and real mechanic like an oil filter not allowing me to turn over a motor for a compression test which only requires a starter and battery unless the motor is ceased up would love for the developer to work with real mechanics and engineers to develop more realism without over complicating the game for example setting timing adjusting tappets and torque settings although they could also include a few things like head gaskets big end small end bearings and more paintable objects as standard i am meticulously ocd like that
