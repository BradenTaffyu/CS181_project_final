2020 so i m doing something i don t usually do i m reviewing a game before i ve finished it this isn t because i don t intend to finish it but rather for different reasons i have not had a pc capable of running fallout 4 at its highest settings since the game was released and because of that i always put off playing the game that wait is over i have my new pc i can delve into the commonwealth i am reviewing this early because while i ve only just started putting time into the game that was only to learn the controls and to get a feel for the game by playing it myself to get a feel for the commonwealth and what it has to offer for myself i ve watched others play it from beginning to end i know the story already i know all of that fallout 4 had massive shoes to fill not only did it have to follow the two amazing games in the franchise before it in fallout 3 and fallout new vegas but it also had to follow the elder scrolls skyrim as bethesda game studios next major title i d argue the expectations for this game were always too high from the outset but that comes with the territory of owning such a beloved franchise i ll say right from the get go fallout 4 will have many of the same issues that i felt skyrim had as well as its own unique issues but first we should talk about the good i think every single person can agree from a gameplay and control standpoint fallout 4 is leaps and bounds ahead of every single other fallout game where new vegas and fallout 3 combat left something to be desired fallout 4 scratched every itch for me bethesda listened to the issues previous games had and addressed them properly also while some people disliked it i very much liked the story granted i m by no means saying it s perfect but i felt it captured what fallout or at least modern fallout is supposed to be about i also love the overhaul of the weapons and armor systems in more ways than one fallout 4 is the most customizable bethesda title to date i also have to give credit to the dlc s where new vegas dlc s were hit or miss and fallout 3 s dlc s were mostly miss fallout 4 s were almost all hits i also love how voices and characters were expanded i know they only had so much to work with in the older games but it s refreshing not to hear the same voice actor every 3 minutes i have more i like but i think i ve established enough my feelings on what i find good about it which means we must be now take a look at the negatives and this is where i begin to compare it to skyrim and its own shortcomings to be clear fallout 4 by itself on it s own is a great game loads of fun to be had customization galore lots of replayability it s a winner however looking at it from the perspective of fallout games past and the way they felt and played fallout 4 is a terrible fallout game just as skyrim before it fallout 4 leers and ventures away from its roots and what made it great instead forging its own path paved with the continued watering and dumbing down of the game itself disregarding the difficulties hardships and challenges that made past fallout games more like fallout in favor of streamlining with the sole purpose of mass appeal i will say when i play it while i am having fun it doesn t feel like i m playing a fallout game in a way it almost feels like a mix between borderlands and a telltale game which brings me to my next gripe the dialogue wheel there s no easy way around it it s trash at times it makes the game unenjoyable i do actually dread talking to people in game because of it in hindsight after listening to devs talk about it i do understand what they were going for and i give them credit for trying something bold but it failed miserably and i really hope they don t try to revisit it map size is another minor gripe but a gripe nonetheless the map doesn t feel big to begin with at least in my opinion and once you scale to the top of corvega assembly plant or any other very tall building you realize looking around the map it s really not that big especially when you compare it to skyrim it s much smaller in fact it s smaller than the fallout 3 and fallout new vegas maps as well granted one could argue it s quality not quantity it s what you put in a map not how large it is and to an extent i can agree but i also feel at times the map is over saturated with locations and waypoints every square inch doesn t need a backstory or an enemy it s ok to have empty space there are other issues i have but again i think i ve made my point so i ll reiterate essentially what i said about skyrim fallout 4 is a great game in my eyes and will always hold a special place in my heart it brought the fallout franchise into modernity and introduced many cool and exciting aspects to the franchise but it s a poor fallout game it s not 76 or brotherhood of steel that s for damn sure but it left a good bit to be desired 7 5 10
