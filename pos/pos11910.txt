a review from someone that doesnt overreact for context anybody that knows the company behind these games knows it s a small basically indie game company the team has always seemed to have a passion for the community for which the game is meant for that said i give this game a 7 out of 10 currently it can easily be improved to feel more like a 9 given some time this game is not forza this game is not nfs this is a 20 dollar game max by a small company that said they ve done an outstanding initial job on the city setting and the cars and details graphics are beautiful the handling takes some getting used to this game is not meant to feel like car x drift it is not a drifting sim it is an arcade racer car x drift itself didn t have great grip handling car x street has a handling model that is very much geared toward arcade racing if you can t steer smoothly with your controller s stick and are not smooth with your throttle and braking you will spin the game surprisingly feels amazing on a logitech g923 after control binding and calibration although there could be more settings for better feel this encourages players actually having to put in work to have great races and be good drivers once you get used to the handling and camera behavior it s a great time performance and handling upgrades have dramatic differences and promotes balanced upgrading and thinking about your final result for performance when buying upgrades the ai badly needs some work a lot of the time i have pretty good races but if you get in front of ai racers on the racing line they absolutely will take you out and send you flying out of control it feels like traffic and ai have insane mass and you are just a feather that needs some work the story is pretty basic we re not really here for it but the game offers a bunch of activities to do other than just racing crews the ai voice acting is atrocious i personally turned down dialogue as mentioned before the graphics are beautiful however the game is terribly optimized my computer has run way more graphically intensive games with nowhere near any of the problems this game has with its frame rate it runs beautifully for about 30 minutes after booting up then seemingly as soon as nighttime comes no matter what graphics settings you use low to high the game starts chugging to some really ugly levels and apparently stays chugging after that even into daytime i usually have to restart the game for the graphics to be smooth again as for wheel support great plug and playability after mapping and calibration and the patch for h shift mapping was much needed but there is no way to map a separate handbrake the game recognizes it but won t map anything to it for 20 dollars and made by a small game company the bounds of modification and performance upgrades has tons of depth and is satisfying to do if you re big on the enthusiast parts of cars however this game was something we ve waited for for so many years and has been delayed for so long that it s just a little insulting that the game is missing lots of basic but drastic options and features that even car x drift has it really makes us wonder what they ve doing for all this time for the game to still come out like this and be so horribly optimized still it s great fun till it starts chugging i believe that in a few months we ll have a solid 8 to 9 on our hands
