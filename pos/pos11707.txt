2019 early access review a18 is very good i love this game and i v played it for years off and on and i v seen how it went from great to kind of not good but it s always been a challenging game and that s why i love it i m okay with siting down and playing for hours just crafting looting killing and building its all just very fun to me and building a base isn t useless if people are saying that there dumb most poi s aren t sturdy and you would like to loot most of them when the loot comes back if your having a hard time surviving just build a small stone hut with a underground part with a wooden wall with spikes you can just expand with it also remember build a horde base don t use your home to fight the hordes i just would like to see this game go on till its great for years to come remember its not a lot people working on it and there trying there best
