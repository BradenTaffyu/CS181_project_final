2020 i am a disabled father who is homebound most of the time this game the graphics the diversity of wildlife the amazing weather effects have all helped me to not always feel so cooped up and stuck i would suggest grabbing the atv and tent dlc s when they go on sale i have also really liked the high tech hunting dlc and weapon pack 2 as far as different reserves i have medved taiga yukon valley and vurhonga savanna and each has been better than the one before now you may look at all that dlc and feel like it is a bit much but the base game by itself is amazing layton lakes the first reserve players normally start on really feels like you are walking through eastern oregon pacific northwest in the fall i actually probably have more hours on that reserve than any of the others as of this review i have 164 hours played and have loved every minute of it also for the price you can t get a better hunting game i originally paid 25 for the base game and then about 8 for the atv and tent dlc at full price the 3 extra reserves would cost an additional 8 each so 24 and then another 4 for the high tech hunting pack and 4 for weapon pack 2 even at full price all of that content is less than 70 and i actually got a lot of it on sale there are a lot of games from huge publishers that cost more than that for so much dlc and you barely get a decent 20 30 hour story maybe 40 50 if you do everything this game has many players that have pushed over 1000 hours and are still going i know i sound like a shill for the company but rest assured i am just a regular guy using video games to escape my boring life and this is one of the best out there for doing that
