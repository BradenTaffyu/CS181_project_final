2021 for existing fans this is in my opinion the best edition of age of empires ii and a must own for fans of the series the newly modernised graphics while breathing completely new life into the game still offer old time nostalgia to those who played previous editions of the game many quality of life improvements are also added into this edition such as villager count of resources idle villager button and automatic farm queuing among dozens of other interface improvements this edition also introduces new edition exclusive campaign packs namely the last khans lords of the west and dawn of the dukes which consist collectively of about 9 brand new fully voiced campaigns the forgotten campaigns that were released with the hd edition 2013 are also now fully voiced and re polished a recent update has also introduced co op campaigns currently in beta which at the moment includes 4 of the singleplayer campaigns built for co op if you re an existing fan then you probably already have the game and know this but i thought i would provide this information even if it s for a 1 minority who are still on the fence about buying it for new players for those who have never played age of empires ii but are keen rts gamers i would say get it the game has aged incredibly well even to the extent of being more in depth than most newer rts games out there this game can also be quite educational for those of you who have an interest in medieval history in terms of mechanics there are so many units and ways of using them that even today new tactics are being discovered and used each faction has unique technologies and units which adds a whole new dynamic to strategy depending on the civilisation you choose to play as there is a faction for every playstyle i won t list all of the factions here but there are 39 in total 35 excluding dlc including britons japanese slavs franks french spanish aztecs and mongols i haven t really played much in terms of competitive multiplayer but if that is something you are interested in there are often tournaments for cash prizes the game still has a large following and a healthy competitive scene this game defined a genre back in 1998 and even to this day stands out as among one of the best strategy games of all time i recommend this game whole heartily thank you for taking the time to read this review if you did
