2021 early access review took me quite a bit to stop dying to basic bs like getting bamboozeled by baboons and uncontrollably running into crocodiles while not paying attention now i m dying to slightly less basic bs like falling in love in the middle of a cave surrounded by enemies also my longest and still living character is a weak fragile old men who survives exclusively on his absolute hatred for the world around him and uses his iron willpower and ego to stop things from being alive or at the very least convince people they should be ashamed by the very fact of their own existance his only friend is an aggressive legendary turtle that at first sight tried to melt his brain through psychic combat which caused both parties severe nosebleed instead it s like dragon ball but everybody involved is a huge prick
