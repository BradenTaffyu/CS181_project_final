2021 i grew up playing the sims 2 and i remember playing for hours without ever getting bored i got the sims 4 and i m not gonna lie without any dlcs or expansion packs this game gets boring very easily you just feel like there aren t as many things to do it feels very repetitive i recieved the university one from my boyfriend and since then i ve been playing a lot more often i just feel like they re all too expensive all in all a pretty cool casual game it s just too expensive and without any dlcs it s hard to not get bored 3 5 5
