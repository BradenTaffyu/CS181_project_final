2021 i played this game at launch years ago and it was a hot mess it still is kinda but they have added a ton of quality of life changes that have modified it into something that is much more palatable that being said the ftp model that they currently have is pretty brutal so i ended up subbing because i m a subby kinda gal for science pi ve always been a star wars nerd so this game gives me a chance to see and explore many of the places that i had been direly missing since the swg went tits up the single player story experience alone is one of the best i have ever played in any mmo and it gives me some nostalgic kotor vibes plus lightsabers amirite i ve already made so many great memories here heck the first time i landed on tatooine i went and found a sarlacc pit to throw myself into although there was probably more bantha poodoo than i anticipated i am definitely enjoying my time here and if you don t know what sarlaccs banthas or poodoo is maybe you should examine your life choices jk jk 3long ago in a galaxy far far away is where you ll find me tossing back some brews in mos eisley in between space shenanigans
