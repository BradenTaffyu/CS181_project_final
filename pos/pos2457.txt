2020 for me this is the best come back story of 2020 thus far i despise bethesda but i can t hate what ended up becoming pretty darn good the npcs and dialogue are not fallout 4 style this actually has much more depth more consequences many of the story areas are instanced for you and you alone and more dialogue options the amount of dialogue that is locked behind skills and stats is insane reminds me so much of fallout new vegas they didn t stop at just adding npcs and quests you can also have an npc ally join you at your camp home there you are able to do quests for them once you are done with their quests you can send them off and find more allies to gain and do quests for i really enjoy having an ally at my camp i have yet to experience the reputation system but i will try and remember to update this once i get that far i am nearly 10 hours in with a new character and have hardly scratched the surface of the new content i know bethesda went way over budget for this update and it really shows performance well i run ultra 1440p at a solid 90fps it never dips below that ever i am also running lag free on a private server the near 10 hours was from launch day no problems no bugs nothing just a lot of fun it did crash at character creation but smooth sailing after that so i can t knock it much proof twitch tv okerlundtv the vod is up of the entirety of my gameplay session today i went from being pretty meh about the game to changing my mind within a couple hours i had an amazing time and did not want to log off keep doing what you are doing bethesda you can actually get this on a much better track please don t screw this up please
