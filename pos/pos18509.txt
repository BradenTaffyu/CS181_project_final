2020 i have played balloons td my entire life i played the original at lunchtimes during primary school and it is one of my favourite games of all time and probably one of the best tower defence games as well this entry to the franchise is no exception there is a lot of new features added since btd5 there are heroes lots of new balloon types lots of new maps and new game modes i felt that the heroes were a risky choice for the franchise but the way they implemented them made it a good addition to the game the main thing being that they are not compulsory to use so you are still able to get that old feel of the game the way heroes work in game is great as well instead of paying to upgrade them they upgrade themselves over time the new balloon types make the game a lot more challenging and fun now there are fortified balloons that take more hits as well as a fast moving shark balloon that can only be popped with camo detection there are also three upgrade paths for towers instead of two you can also have one tower have five levels in each of these paths they have kept some of the old maps from the original game as well as adding heaps of new ones which also have new features environmental features now parts of the map are able to block your monkey s vision so placement is more important than ever there are also multiple weekly challenges and weekly competitions to add that competitive feel from btd battles there are some small problems though co op matches sometimes take a long time to get into and are sometimes way to laggy to play this may be because of my location the hero noises are annoying you can turn these off in settings the price of the game is also quite high so i would probably wait for a steam sale to buy it i bought it for about 1 50 all up btd6 is a great addition to the franchise with lots of new content that will keep you playing for hours
