2022 i love this game before playing this my previous favorite racing game was either forza horizon 1 or nfs rivals but this reminds me of all the things i loved from horizon 1 on a much larger and improved scale it does have a few annoyances and bugs at the moment which i imagine they will fix along the way things to do with tree textures or online free roam server issues here and there but regardless it s what i wanted and more out of this game and i m very happy with my purchase knowing it ll my home game to play and relax in for the next few years i could go on for much longer about the game already but i think most of it is best to be experienced on your own so if you re debating on checking this out it s worth it
