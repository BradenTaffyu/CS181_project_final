divinity original sin 2 is what i consider to be the single best game i have ever played the combat while initially challenging turns into strategic fun the dialogue and narration alone are good enough to justify the sale price the world the lore and the adventure you go on are not only incredibly exciting but highly re playable too i have subjected more than 5 of my friends to gift copies of this game play it
