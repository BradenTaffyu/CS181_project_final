2018 fallout new vegas is one of my all time favorite games in addition to my time on steam i have 500 hours on xbox360 when it first came out i consider it a must play for anyone who is a fan of rpgs or the fallout series the rpg elements the choices you can make with your character build play style and story elements are what make this game so amazing there are numerous quests with several different endings that are all reflected in the end cut scene when you finish the game it s those choices that really make your characters come to life new vegas isn t a game you ll just want to play once each play through you can create a different character with different skills and personality that will make different choices that impact how you play the game you can be the boy scout who always does the right thing a psychopath who wants to kill everyone or anything in between at first the factions may seem a little black and white but as you look closer there are grays everywhere benefits and hazards to each side and it s possible to have an evil character with a good ending or a good character with an evil ending there are so many options that said if you asked me objectively what i would rate fo nv out of 10 it would be 8 10 in my opinion there are two things that hold back new vegas from being the greatest game of all time and it s not the graphics which i would say are ok or the bland story which some have complained about i disagree but see how a choose your own ending isn t as strong as a well thought out narrative but these two things 1 the bugs the game is full of them they are unavoidable i do glitchless speedruns glitchless is in quotations because the glitches are unavoidable but most of them aren t game breaking to start save a lot and often if you rely on autosave you will at some point lose hours to save corruption usually it s because the game crashes when you go through a door which is during an autosave on top of that it is possible to soft lock in vats or freeze in place for just long enough for what you were aiming at to kill you those are the main game breaking glitches but numerous quests perks in game events etc are or can be glitched most of those aren t more than an annoyance and of course on top of all that are the usual fallout elder scrolls bethesda graphical glitches that can vary from hilarious to a little disturbing but once you get past the bugs learn to live with them you have a great game on your hands 2 the second thing i think would have made fo nv the greatest game of all time which was actually removed during development is after story game play when you beat fo nv you see your ending cut scene specific to the choices your character made in that play through see the impact you had on the mojave and the people who live there the credits roll and a prompt pops up asking if you want to re load your save from before the final battle that was a disappointment i want to be able to play in the world i created with some factions gaining power other s losing it i understand why they cut it there are so many possibilities and the game already pushing it with content was overflowing with bugs creating an end game that addresses every ending for each mission you ve done would have been too difficult all that said i d recommend fallout new vegas to anyone who asks if you think you should play it you should play it if you are on the fence you should buy it when it is on sale i recommend buying all of the dlc but starting with all of the gear from the various pre order bonuses makes the early game too easy tl dr just buy it the game is amazing
