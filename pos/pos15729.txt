2021 product received for free early access review i recommend aim lab to people i game with cause i use aim lab on a regular basis it s helped me improve my aim within a month of using it and i m going to continue training my aim with aim lab the specific scenarios for micro flicking flicking and tracking are awesome and i find them extremely helpful one thing i d recommend is having the ability to train for a custom amount of time like an hour instead of one minute for example because most days i focus on one particular part of my aim like micro shot for fourty minutes and then i move on to the others i don t care much for the one minute scores because i understand that my skill comes from consistency over time overall great aim training system huge kudos to the development team
