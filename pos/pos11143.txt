tldr if you played it its modern day theme hospital if you didn t it s a tongue in cheek gamified version of the american health care system where you rip people off and then they die anyway general thoughts overview so if you played theme hospital back in the day then two point hospital tph serves as a solid remake that captures the core gameplay and humour everything is instantly recognisable and while the conditions are different the humour and intent behind them is captured extremely well you are the director of a for profit hospital in two points county somewhere in the states your job is to build a hospital and wrangle as much cash out of the meatbags as possible hire staff design and build rooms deal with emergencies and thrash rival hospitals to be the biggest and best in town pros the radio shows are just wonderful they fully capture the essence of a cheese radio station with an entertaining array of hosts giving the game quite a lot of life the atmosphere theme and general core mechanics are just fun and enjoyable from building up a little gp surgery to a massive diagnostic hospital almost every step feels rewarding and pushes you along a little more the star rating challenge system means you can push yourself not enjoying an area you can move on with a few wins here and there completionists beware there are a significant number of places to go and hospitals to build cons tph is extremely repetitive there is very very little that the game can do to freshen things up between hospitals making the game one you ll likely get bored of after a few days but come back to later to progress again tph is a dlc simulator it s very frustrating to see so much locked behind massively overpriced dlc s designed to squeeze every last penny out of a player tph has a distinct lack of unique character if you ve not played theme hospital then this is going to be very different to pretty much anything you have played but if you did play it back in the day then this doesn t bring anything new to the table it actually takes things away like the cut scenes and the most interesting illnesses while the core mechanics are fun and engaging it is difficult to understand what is going wrong early enough to stop problems from wasting hours of time there is very little granular control over how to go such as money in and out how people move about the hospital break times and rota filling it can make the game frustrating to play suggested improvements better control of afore mentioned gameplay elements particularly room rota and break control for staff the option to control the shape of the hospital buildings closing up gaps t increase surface area more options on curing diseases emergencies marketing etc i d enjoy seeing an ability to work in partnerships or snipe clients form other hospitals for curing overall recommendation if you like colony building or management games then tph is an absolute must if you enjoyed theme hospital then tph is a great clone that captures the feeling extremely well if dlc simulators annoy you then this is going to be frustrating if lack of granular control is a thing then this is going to frustrate you and if you want a game which has proper end points for its levels and an overarching story then this is going to disappoint you for me i really enjoyed my time with tph i ve played it in waves and i ll probably come back to it again in the future i like it so much that if they ever put the dlc on offer for super cheap i might even pick some up my curator page with reviews by genre in case you want to find more games or even reviews like this one
