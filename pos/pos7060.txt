2021 early access review a wonderful game very well made and its not even fully finished yet there so much to do and learn very relaxing game and relaxing music i look forward to more content hopefully much much more 10 10 all round the only thing that would be nice to see is a small tutorial on how a few things work and how to best start as a new player would 100 recommend this game
