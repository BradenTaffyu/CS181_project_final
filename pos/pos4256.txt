2020 there s not many games where you can lose a war because your leader throws too many parties instead of fighting battles fore real though this game is something of a gem even at release the ui was outmoded and the graphics were mediocre and the combat was somewhat subpar but that is really all secondary to the fantastic sandbox this game gave you have you ever wanted to live a medieval adventure story have you ever wanted a chance to go from rags to regalty based on your skills on the battlefield or cunning at court have you ever wanted to create your own army to take what rightfully belongs to you what about entering the arena to compete with crooks and kings alike for your chance at gold and fame or to woo a fair maiden you can do all that and more in a single playthrough this game that s not to mention is as a platform for modding where it appears you can do anything from being a naruto ninja to a star wars jedi and everything in between the sieges are also fairly unique where you must either attack or defend fortified positions using the units that you have either brought with you or garrisoned there the game shines as a sandbox where you can make your own story friends and enemies with the ai that resides there here s an example in a playthrough i started as a trader s son started a mercenary band pledged fealty to the king of swadia met count haringoth who was a complete at all opportunities as i fought many battles and started to rise to nobility during my many successes i found a fellow noble who also thought haringoth was a and my prevailing and unwavering friendship with him was cemented fought many more battles against swadia s sworn enemies the rhodoks took much territory in swadia s name but at every opportunity the king took it for himself instead of giving it to me by right of conquest pleasing haringoth endlessly unpleasing to haringoth i would take every opportunity to denounce him court any women either related to him or interesting to him and embarrass him by spanking him in any duel or arena i could eventually get taken prisoner for a while realize swadia is getting annihilated because the king continually starts wars with other nations and then ignores it to throw festivals in his own honor and in honor of the lands he is claiming that other lords got eventually get out of prison and decide nah i can t stand this but am still tied by fealty continue defeating the rhodoks and taking castles until eventually i take a town king harlaus takes it for himself rebel take my town and start my own empire immediately garnering denunciation and war from swadia tear back across rhodok territory convincing them all to join me while fighting swadian and sarranid incursion meet haringoth in the field of battle oh yes trounce haringoth and eventually take all of swadia for my own immediately build a prison tower in haringoth castle where i seal haringoth for all time declare war against swadia s sworn enemy the nords tear across their land taking their towns courting their ladies and switching their loyalties all while giving my bro beranz territories and joining with him regularly to laugh at haringoth locked in his own family s dungeon time for war against swadia s sworn enemies the vaegirs during war against the vaegirs i get notification that haringoth has somehow escape his prison and joined my enemies meet haringoth yet again in the wild where i find he was given a sizable army under vaegir fealty immediately obliterate haringoth s army with superior swadian heavy cavalry and slap him back into shackles take haringoth back home to his castle that i own many many battles later i am finishing off the vaegir while fighting a successful three front war with the khanate and sarranids to find haringoth has slipped away yet again i finish off the vaegir and have just taken the khanate s last territory when i find haringoth yet again this time battered broken and timid with an army in the low double digits meanwhile i command a 185 man army of the finest soldiers in the land and host nobles among its captains i immediately attack and put him back in his cell i finally chase down the last of the khanate now with just me and the sarranids left i have tired of managing whinging lords other than beranz and his magnificent mustache and prepare to wipe up what is left of the land not under my empire include many rebel territories i make sure haringoth castle is never disturbed nor even near any front line fighting despite my best efforts i find out haringoth has escaped yet again however i never see him again instead of trying to reclaim any vestiges of his former nobility instead of trying to align with my enemies to serve in their armies instead of even being able to run a reasonable bandit ring haringoth has completely given up and left the entire continent in shame just to get away from the fate he built himself for crossing me lol him with beranz while we continue consolidating the continentwhere else are you going to find stories like this
