2021 early access review this is a game where you can get all the achievements too easily and so that s not the matter rather this is a survival game and you can build up your bases as per your wish you can customise almost everything as per your choices as long as you have access to the server there are several types of game play styles where some players like to play pure vanilla games some may like to add some mods some may like to farm each and everything from the scratch to survive and some may use creative menu and go deeper and faster these are my opinions after passing over 400 hrs in this game and grabbing all the achievements the final word is about the community and i personally feel that this community is kinda strange where so many wants to play co op but rarely players play co op rather end up playing solo due to their variety of preferences rarely tally but they add each others you may differ with me but i found the community is such than many other games
