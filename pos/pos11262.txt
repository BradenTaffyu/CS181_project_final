early access review this is my very first review on steam so that should speak to just how much i absolutely adore this game truly a masterpiece in terms of games in this genre and easily my personal game of the year i see a lot of comparisons to stardew valley but honestly there are several differences you can jump swim dive use magic catch bugs the story is much different and more interesting the fishing is more simple the requests on the request board actually feel worth doing i like the npc s and their personalities a lot more the events are different and this game has 2 reoccurring events each week which are really fun and different every time also the aesthetics are obviously a lot prettier without needing mods i enjoy being able to change my outfits whenever i want to no mirror needed and having multiple color options for every piece of clothing as well overall i much prefer this over sdv but i will say if you like that game or games like coral island there is a good chance you will love this one also works perfectly on my steam deck so flawless it doesn t even feel like early access
