2022 loving the game so far it s my first forza game ever so i have no other ones to compare it to played good with keyboard plays better with a racing sim setup top notch lighting graphics map is pretty cool would have preferred a more urban setting tons of cars to acquire customize there s more performance upgrades than visual user interface is pretty bad game is very vibrant and colorful down to the menus while being arcade y it s a solid driving game just ignore the npc s and dialogue
