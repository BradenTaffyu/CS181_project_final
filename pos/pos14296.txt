2022 early access review this is an extraordinary find more well developed and polished than many games that are in full release the depth and overall scale of dyson sphere program is like nothing else i ve seen and it s vast multi layered complexities create an addictive experience that will cause you to lose sleep miss meals and snub friends the graphic design is excellent and what s really struck me the most as i ve played this is the way it creates a genuine classic sci fi feel i like to turn off the in game soundtrack and put on some ambient deep chill music and i really feel transported to another time and another world given the relatively low price and the huge amount of content it s an unbeatable deal and having had a fair amount of experience with building games i highly recommend dyson sphere program
