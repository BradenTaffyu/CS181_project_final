2016 excellent game which is being continually developed and supported by the devs there is a major roadmap for future free and paid content this was one of the smoother total war launches i have experienced i could actually play a multiplayer campaign from launch day without constant dc s and crashes the dlc can be a little pricey lots of the negative reviews are salty about this but there is still plenty of content in the base game plenty of online replayability without having to reach for your wallet so you can take it or leave it multiplayer balance is coming along and is in a fairly good place at the moment they have mainly managed to capture the spirit of warhammer with a good part of what makes a total war game and i can only see this game getting better with age
