2018 early access review forewordi love survival games almost as much as i love rpgs especially when it s a zombie apocalypse esque game 7 days has a very unique take on survival that differentiates from other survival games yet those things also make it a bit flawed if that makes sense pros atmosphere rather than jumpscares the game relies heavily on atmospheric horror and i really like how that s portrayed in 7dtd especially when you see the remains of a city or the gloomy misty weather that makes any potential zombie harder to spot progression replay valuethe most fun part about this game is its progression based system you ll as most other survival games be able to make more and better things as you go along it does however get a bit boring once you ve got everything managed the stews boiling the goldenrod teas brewing and a reasonably sturdy concrete layer for zombies it s fun to start over every now and then building everything from scratch but work on that one improvement you disliked about your previous play on the fence story there s nothing not even on the non custom navezgane that explains anything why the things that happened in the 7 days universe happened while i don t think a survival game really needs a story it d still be nice to have running your own server while this goes more or less without saying if you decide to run a server and client on the same pc be prepared that the game soaks up a really large deal of ram 16gb wasn t enough to cover my os server background programs and a client at the same time especially noticeable when entering cities with large buildings and tons of entity spawns combat combat s fun but it can feel a bit wonky if you decide to swing your melee weapons at zombies the fov makes it feel like you re further away than you actually are i prefer a sledgehammer as those usually are able to one shot the more common zombies bows crossbows and guns are nice too cons mechanical choices certain mechanical choices which are luckily changed in the next major patch included thermal insulation clothing against cold and warm weather which made you switch constantly very annoying camera the player view for some reason maybe due to the fov is around your waist on the standard game settings you can adjust it accordingly but why it s ever been set on this beats me it just doesn t make any sense bad optimization where to begin the game is clearly not optimized as the game gets increasingly stuttery on anything but the most modern hardware playing on 4k with everything on max goodluck with that you ll probably need an nvidia rtx 2080 and even then it will probably not exceed 60 fps ratingsstory gameplay 6 10music 5 10graphics 7 10replay value 7 10reviewit s hard to write a review for this game as i ve played off and on every other patch yet the times i ve played it was with friends fighting and fencing off layers of zombies the last time i played there wasn t even a talent system yet which i very much like i ll add the things i dislike about the most recent patches though is that the 7dtd characters can t seem to regulate their core body temperatures and that means switching to different kinds of clothing every damn time also minus insulation clothing doesn t make sense how s being nude warmer than wearing a t shirt i also hate how the moulds have been removed from the game for the sole reason of we wanted 7 days to die be a scavenging game yeah that s fun to a point scavenging but it gets really tiring if all you find are glass jars and other miscellaneous junk items want a specific crafting schematic good luck we ve entered several cities and we always find the same poop over and over again i ll be honest though these are just my opinions and maybe the majority likes the endless scavenger hunts that s okay too everyone is entitled to their own opinions afterwordi still recommend 7 days to die as they still update the game through minor and major patches without a charge the game has so much potential and the atmosphere is magnificent yet the game is still unfinished after all these years there s improvements and downgrades in every patch i m really looking forward to see what the truly finished product will look like if that does ever happen edit 1 fixed minor typoes 2 12 18
