2017 early access review supporting the publisher would be reason enough to buy this game seriously the publisher is an example to all those doing the early access thing it was a one man show and he was active in the community incredibly responsive and humble and he still kept adding to the game eventually he added on other people and these people added to the momentum and the guy still hasn t lost his humble as judged by his community involvement there s been like 0 shady efforts to monetize this thing and that s huge in comparison to the norm also the game is really fun haha
