2021 early access review as a complete newcomer to this game i m utterly blown away those plans you always told your friends you d enact during a zombie apocalypse this is the only way to accurately and realistically see them play out from enormous amounts of different interactivity with nearly every item in the game to the gripping terror you feel from hearing a banging on your door in the dead of night this is a zombie simulator lover s dream come true permadeath survival elements plenty of room for roleplay and tons of customization i couldn t ask for anything more you re going to die a lot but that s how it goes enjoy the struggle enable beta build41 for all of the amazing mechanic additions and visual upgrades
