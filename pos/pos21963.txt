2016 so having played the other souls games to death i decided i d challenge myself and roll up a deprived build being the lazy that i am i decided that i wasn t going to get any new weapons or armor after i picked a set i liked now let me tell you guys i was wearing the rags from the uchigatana master and the sages hat i was wielding the starting club and grass crest shield i played the game to the best of my ability and i played the whole thing solo i was having a ton of fun the enemies were faster than all the other games but i could demon souls roll now none of their attacks mattered so long as i got gud and gud i was for i had played the others now somewhere in my head i had this crazy idea that no one would think of normally in dks1 what if i go raw on my club for max physical without ever having to put a point in my str or dex i was thinking in my head the scaling would be horrible the damage wouldn t last i would die before i killed anything i went on to beat every boss with that little raw club without help from summons npc or otherwise since i had no need for my souls i dumped them all into health and stamina my friends and i got the game at the same time and i was the first to finish not only that when they had complained about certain areas that were built to exploit the weakness of their builds i had powered through them when they had mentioned some annoying bosses i had beat them on my first try my faith in miyazaki had carried me through i learned that through my self imposed suffering that i had found the perfect pve build everything else in the game was put in with its promises of power if only i would stray from my path from my god miyazaki s teachings i denied them all and was rewarded ps the club is for pvp don t even bother i still pwnt people tho b c they were scrubs once i had completed this journey and basked in the immense euphoria of beating a souls game with a club basically naked i had something in my inventory a certain greatsword from a certain prince with c d d d scaling in the four main stats i knew what i must do i pumped every point henceforth into those four stats while still in rags and that overly gigantic hat i went on to rip entire thirds and fourths off of boss healthbars in new game for everyone who gives a bad review because something that was once the right way has been changed you must change you must embrace miyazaki and cast aside your worldly desires for defense poise damage range you must cast aside your shield you must cast aside everything that you believe to be a reasonable choice against an army of monsters and use your faith in miyazaki as a weapon and not a faith build club lightningbolts i have seen the light and i have been rewarded you can experience unbridled bliss and joy by ascending to paradise when i arrived it all faded to black as that last ember slowly died through the deafening silence only two words filled my mind two words described what had happened why i had succeeded and where others had failed two words that described my journey two words that embodied my faith in miyazaki two words i had lived by since i first played even kings field and evergrace two words rang through my mind over and over i had broken down into tears because i had found the answer and stayed true over all these years and i will tell you what they said to me git gud
