2023 warhammer ii is truly the pinnacle of the warhammer trilogy unfortunately i wanted warhammer iii to carry this legacy into the future as much i want to enjoy warhammer iii it just isn t as good as this game warhammer changed total war forever and warhammer ii took it 10 levels up warhammer iii takes 1 step forward but two steps back i can easily recommend warhammer i and ii solely for just the chaos invasion event being present but i simply can t recommend warhammer iii as they removed it it s not just that though warhammer ii has superior pathing compared to the third game the ai might be slightly better compared to warhammer ii but that alone isn t enough overall warhammer ii is the best of the trilogy and should be in any warhammer or total war fan s library warhammer i could be even appreciated however warhammer iii isn t close to being the successor upgrade quite yet to warhammer ii
