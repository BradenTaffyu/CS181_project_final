the game has shown steady improvement since its release so i still trust the developers many reviews have drawn comparisons to previous titles in the series but regrettably there hasn t been a significant leap forward in graphics or gameplay mechanics for multiplayer enthusiasts like myself company of heroes 3 offers a more refined experience compared to its predecessor units feel more consistent in terms of damage reducing the frustrating effects of rng there s a refreshing emphasis on light vehicles and infantry although matches can still sometimes descend into artillery and armour slog however the single player component of coh3 feels lackluster while coh1 s campaign remains the pinnacle followed by coh2 coh3 falls short in comparison i can t speak much for ardennes assault but the italian campaign doesn t hold much appeal to me hence i wouldn t recommend the game solely for its single player content regarding factions and battle groups you start with four factions and three unlocked battle groups for each additional battle groups can be obtained through in game currency or by purchase while unlocking them may take some time recent adjustments in rewards helps with grind as for skins the current selection is rather underwhelming in conclusion i recommend company of heroes 3 primarily for its multiplayer experience however it s advisable to wait for a sale the average search times can range from 5 to 10 minutes depending on the meta and faction preference
