2022 early access review this game is either one of the greatest of all time or a frustrating archaic pixelated hellscape and it s completely dependent on your preferences in videogames and willingness to learn about the game s core and not so core mechanics caves of qud is an open world roguelike videogame that has gained a dedicated following due to its unique blend of post apocalyptic science fiction and fantasy elements and is the best realization of those combined genres that i have ever seen in a piece of media second only to frank herbert s dune series which this game coincidentally draws some inspirations from the game features a randomly generated world which offers players a unique experience each time they play as well as a rich and complex character creation system that allows players to create their own unique character examples include a psychic mutant who s abilities to affect reality include bending spacetime creating plants or remote controlling other beings try it on a goat you get an achievement a physical mutant with 4 arms three faces quills fur photosynthetic skin pyrokinesis and is loved by birds because of their fashionable wings a final example is a true kin meaning they aren t mutated but can instead gain cybernetic enhancements and augmentations who is a master tinkerer with a biodynamic power cell causing their bloodstream to produce power that they can plug electronic devices and superweapons into who also amputated their legs so they could instead have tank treads and also has an onboard gpu in their brain that can identify any artifact robot weapon or machine with their statuses power levels current modifications or functionality one of the standout features of caves of qud is its unique approach to gameplay the game features a turn based combat system that is challenging and strategic and requires players to carefully plan their actions in order to succeed in addition the game s main storyline while not yet fully completed offers many interesting pieces of information that serve to make the world more fleshed out and explained death is a near constant in caves of qud and unless you have prepared thoroughly and even if you have you can die in some very frustrating ways the characters i mentioned earlier died as follows the psychic got pushed into a clam by a robot which teleported him across the world into a high level area where he met a galgal a biblically accurate angel thats actually a robot and was promptly tackled by it and died immediately the mutant contracted a fungal infection and because many plants hate fungi was immediately attacked by a group of sentient laser gun toting plants who were previously her friends the cyborg actually got extremely far but unfortunately met a redacted and they were disintegrated by an endless barrage of high explosives unforgiving but each was a lesson and actually saved more characters down the line from making the same mistakes another notable aspect of caves of qud is its user interface which while not intuitive or easy to use initially for those new to the classic roguelike genre is both extremely creative and effective the game s ui is well designed and allows players to easily access all of the game s features and functions which makes it easy to navigate the game s complex and deep systems the ui can also be affected by gameplay one such example is the confused status effect which makes all of your inventory both scrambled and illegible simulating everyday life for a dyslexic like me as well as making your main map screen kaleidoscopic with the visuals on screen not representing the real board however caves of qud has also been the subject of controversy particularly in relation to its developers and their interactions with youtuber ssethtzeentach ssethtzeentach is credited with helping to increase the game s sales and popularity but has also been involved in conflicts with the game s developers which has led to drama and tensions within the caves of qud community whether you enjoy his style of humor or script writing or not it would be wrong to claim there is a better and more comprehensive review available despite it being slightly outdated compared to the game s current state in addition the caves of qud discord has also been the source of controversy with some players reporting instances of harassment and toxicity within the community this has led to discussions and debates about the need for better moderation and community management within the game s online spaces i can personally attest to this as i waited 3 months just for the opportunity to join hoping to learn more about the games lore and development i was instead bombarded with political ideologies and doctrine the majority of chat channels being filled with political discussion regardless of the channel s true intentions the entirety of the moderation team offering membership in a book club which consisted wholly of political and ideological rhetoric while i understand and respect the freedom of speech to express and discuss such things i felt it encroached on the discussions of the game which was the sole reason i was there there were also direct calls to violence by some members towards law enforcement as that was a hot political topic at the time i found such statements wishing for both the harm and deaths of anyone both unacceptable and incredibly harmful to my perception of the greater community as a whole overall while caves of qud offers a unique and engaging gameplay experience it has also been the source of controversy and drama within the gaming community players who are interested in the game should be aware of these issues and consider whether they are comfortable with the game s community and developer interactions before deciding to purchase the game tldr game is extremely enjoyable if you like mechanically crunchy games and are willing to suffer for a bit to learn it however i unfortunately have to recommend keeping the community at arm s length and the discord community even further new information post moon staire updatethe main quest line has been further progressed with some truly interesting and fun mechanics as well as many bugfixes qol changes and logical edits to various species interactions and mechanics story remains unfinished but the polish is continuous and is on a very good path and rate of completion the last few times updates have dropped the price has increased so if you were on the fence before i would recommend buying it now as i have only ever seen this game go on a 10 sale live and drink
