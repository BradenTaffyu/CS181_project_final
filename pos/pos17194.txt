2021 i don t know how to review this game so i m just going to ramble go watch mandalore s video if you want an actual competent thing that s not me i spelled it adredaline for the first 16 years of my life warhammer ii is a sequel but more of an expansion pack to total war warhammer you play as one of the factions you use to be able to buy models for but can t right now unless you know where to look the end times are upon us and that dink archaon is leading the greatest host of chaos warriors the old world has ever seen the rats are also being dinks in their lust to warpstone and wanting to bring back the horned rat or something like that wage an all out war against the land dwellers grimgor the biggest orc ever is raising the largest waaagh and raising millions of orcs to his cause the undead are doing something i don t know they re always up to something dumb and evil so that means we re boned or at least you are if you re human or dwarf or elf or dinosaur sexual so you must raise your armies and fight for order or destruction in the biggest map in total war history or at least i think it is jesus that s a big map warhammer ii is that game i play for a few hours restart my campaign and then do it again i am monstrously terrible at this game and i end up doing something to screw myself over in the long run which sucks because i m not this awful at other total war games but 316 hours in and i ve only completed two campaigns because i stink luckily the game is pretty good there is a faction for everyone and even if you have to dig a bit you ll find someone you like to play as everyone has their ups and downs even if it doesn t feel like that at first the empire is the closest you ll get to a normal total war faction even though they have things like wizards and steam tanks bretonnia is up there as well with their focus on calvary other factions always have something else going on with them like how the greenskins can completely overwhelm you with numbers and buffs and how skaven are bastards warhammer is a neat setting i m pretty familiar with and they did a good job capturing the look and feel of the tabletop since the first one back in 2016 the warhammer games have come a long way adding factions left and right and even going as far as adding the vampire coast dudes who basically only had a few snippets back in the day this probably would have been a decent advertisement for the tabletop if games workshop didn t axe it what are some neat things at the time of this review you can turn off chaos now in case you want a more vanilla total war experience gotrek and felix are in the game who are my personal favorites you just have to get them from the total war website they re free though blackfire p ass looks like how you think blackfire pass would look and karl franz is only slightly shorter than he was in warhammer online modding is also a big thing mods are anything from completely new factions new units a new way to play the game sfo check it out its neat to 20 karl franz s in a single unit some of the mods are better than dlc you get with the game even and the community surrounding it seem dedicated to modding except sometimes the game updates and the mods explode okay but what else well two games and a billion dlcs later and still no army painter i d bring up shogun 2 again but i did that in the warhammer 1 review mark of chaos had army painter come on ca give me army painter actually shogun 2 had a lot more options for multiplayer you d think would be in warhammer of all games there are no customizable generals no clan wars no online conquest mode no uh army painter you can play pvp you can do a comp stomp and you can play eye of the vortex or mortal empires together or against someone else its basic but i guess that s all people need and i m just being a crazy person give me army painter i mean it i ll cry there are also some factions that are gimped if you don t put down the extra cash like skaven for example the ai keeps up the long venerated total war tradition of cheating and sometimes and the beast men still scratch the center of their bums and sniff their fingers but i can t say any of that will effect you in the long run i have 300 hours now i know people going into 1000 it has that problem you can t escape from literally any grand strategy or war game where you quickly either get murdered to death or the game turns into a map painter but that just comes with the territory i liked warhammer ii it gets a big score out of a little score i can t really say much else because its one of those games you have to be a big brain to fully explain even if it isn t the most complicated thing around it has a lot going on so it just gets a big score out of a little score the first person convicted of speeding was going 8 mph join the curator to face down chaos and banish it
