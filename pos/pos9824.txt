2019 the story of my first rimworld colony experience colony starts with three of the most intrepid and unusual characters to have ever come together plus a cat called april luigi lug a child survivor of an illegal black market organ harvesting cartel from which trauma has caused him to become completly incapable of causing violence eyon ian early life as a cave dweller dubbed cave child proficient at cave painting and gardening but not much else miranda mira prodigy inventor and designer child of famous inventor whose intelligence has been passed down to create outstanding skills in construction research and gun usage colony thrives first three days of existence with minimal occurrences aside from the occasional friendly tribal villager interested in trading day four the tables suddenly turn whilst foraging surface rock for steel lug is met with the alarming prospect of a nearby squirrel becoming rabid it is deranged and will attack any living organism on sight unfortunately for lug he is the closest organism the rabid squirrel attacks without mercy biting and mauling lug being incapable of violence even in self defence lug flees in the least helpful direction possible away from the colony other colonists rush to his defence but by the time they reach lug he is unconscious and suffering severe blood loss and multiple lesions with the squirrel defeated miranda slowly hauls lug s freakishly large body across the landscape lug is placed in a medical bed awaiting medical attention unfortunately lug is the only colonist proficient in medical procedure knocking on death s door lug only just escapes his demise as the cave child eyon administers herbal medicine half a day passes with progress slow with only 2 3 colonists able to do work tables begin to turn once again out of nowhere a warg suddenly infiltrates the colony compound and viciously mauls april the cat to death with a few swipes of tooth and claw miranda armed with masterwork compound bow faces off against the warg misses twice and is consequently mauled to a crucial medical emergency status eyon makes desperate attempt to keep colony alive by facing the warg with revolver also misses and receives heavy damage but thankfully disposes of warg suffering heavy blood loss eyon drags miranda too a medical bed next to the still recovering lug manages to prevent bleeding and then himself retires to medical bed to rest from heavy wounds lug is the first to be back on his feet all seems to be despite the circumstances under control lug is able to feed his suffering compatriots and returns to daily routine night approaches and all colonists are asleep warning bells suddenly begin as a raid from nearby pirate settlement approaches a single raider is headed for camp all would be fine if it wasn t for the fact that the only colonists capable of defending were immobile and recovering from wounds lug does what lug does best and hides inside dormitory in hopes raiders will steal a few items and leave raider has other plans and proceeds to burn down any structure or farmland that exists within the colony whilst also discovering the cowering lug and swiftly dispatching him with a few swings of a spiked club raider suffers severe burns whilst gleefully running a wild pyromaniac spree and succumbs to wounds all hope seems lost as colony goes up in flames suddenly a wandering jewish traveller approaches the colony and attempts a daring rescue to the remaining wounded colonists in the dorm upon entering dormitory good samaritan is greeted by super heated air that instantly floods lungs and causes severe internal burns he crumples to the floor and is burned in the fire alongside the rest of the colonists that is where the story of my roller coaster ride ends 10 10 would recommend tl dr terrible events cause brilliant inventor cave child and traumatic pacifist to die horrid deaths despite best efforts to remain alive
