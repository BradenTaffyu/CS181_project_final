2022 i don t usually give reviews but this maybe an exception at first i didn t really want to buy or play this game from the trailers i ve seen the game looks very similar to x com and i already play x com in the past and have x com2 in my library i like x com and at first i didn t believe other game with similar mechanics will surpass it what s the purpose playing similar games then the sale happened so i buy it because of the sale and think what the hell i just gonna try this not many games could be played with my crappy laptop anyway i found the game isn t as similar as an x com game i thought it was x com games are focusing on tactical strategic battle the main focus of the game is the battle the tactics the decissions but this game feels more like a traditional srpg jrpg with stories and everyone in your squad actually has personalities and backgroud stories even the battle feels different x com required more strategic replacement of your troops and poor placing and decissions will really punish you this isn t the case in tac where your heroes feels overpowered especially in the beginning phase the masteries and their sets are what ultimately differentiate these games you feel more freedom to strengthen the squad more than x com tinkering with masteries at the beginning is very confusing but when you get the knack of it was pretty fun i play lots of jrpg when i was younger so yeah i really like troubleshooter abandoned children but also because i am fans of the x com franchise i feel the tactical aspect of the game the tensions the timing the importance of strategy placement and decission of the battle are rather lacking you ll be punished if you had wrong decissions in x com especially in x com2 you really have to think to complete the missions but i didn t feel the same way in tac it s has its pros and cons yet overall it s a very good game really great job by the devs now i do feel guilty buying this game because of sale you guys really deserve every penny
