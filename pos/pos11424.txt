2023 early access review bought 7 days to die years ago during its early alpha days refunded it after 15 minutes i recently gave it another shot and wow it s now one of my favorite zombie games graphics aren t amazing and the game can be a bit wonky despite still being in alpha it feels pretty much completed the devs keep adding new content and updates it s truly a testament to their dedication what sets this game apart from others in the genre is its authentic survival essence from dodging zombies to dealing with resource shortages infections wildlife and even the occasional unpredictable building it keeps you on your toes crafting exploring huge maps looting and the skill progression all add tons of depth to 7 days to die building bases allows you to be very creative but also requires careful planning the best part it s a blast with friends often leading to unexpected hilarious and memorable moments
