2020 fallout new vegas is the result of your pals over at obsidian the remainders of black isle the people who made fallout 1 2 coming over to bethesda and saying hey can we get a shot at this 3d shooter genre and you know what it s great obsidian always seems like a small yet satisfying company in terms of game development new vegas is probably the best example new vegas is probably the best fallout game with superb writing story character development and mechanics returning from their original first two games obsidian did a damn fine job of bringing their golden touch to the new direction that bethesda chose to take starting with 3 and then 4 came along and up most of those ideas but let s just pretend like this was the last fallout game don t mention 76 please
