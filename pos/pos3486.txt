2017 i ve played a fair amount of games but nothing will be as special to me as this undertale is an amazing game and definitely worth the price from the jokes to the amazing characters and storyline it s not something you can forget about easily a lot of people will turn away just from the graphics but that s really not what it s about in my opinion undertale even teaches you a few life lessons such as being nice to others and never giving up there really isn t a lot to criticize about the game itself imo the fandom can be scary at times but don t let it turn you away i m sure a lot of people in the reviews has already commented on it if you didn t already know there is actually a free demo version of the game available on the undertale website if you aren t sure about getting the full version in summary undertale is something i think everyone should try at some point if they like story games although obviously not everyone s cup of tea even better if they do it without spoilers but the main points of my review are it has a great storyline great characters you decide the ending memorable very good soundtrack mostly made by one person toby fox puns 90 of the fandom is terrible it s actually pretty alrighti definitely recommend you get this game if you have the money it only really takes about 6 8 hours to do a full play through depending on whether you read everything or not
