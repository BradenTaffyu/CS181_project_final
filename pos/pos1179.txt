2022 early access review this is pretty much the definitive zombie game for me right now it s graphics are a bit rough but it s by design and doesn t impede the gameplay at all which is fantastic this game offers not only a great zombie game but a great survival game to boot both base and nomad style play are totally acceptable means of play and the difficulty and granularity of settings in this game are scalable from incredibly easy to almost impossible the detail in this game is high and the playing is very simulation heavy whether you want night of the living dead shamblers or 28 days later rage zombies infection from bites blood exposure or just already infected like the walkind dead you have all the options there are also challenge scenarios you can play a great selection of many and varied mods and a helpful community on hand the game gets even better with friends as it s great for co op or pvp and the devs seem intent on enriching the mp experience by adding all sorts of new rp options as far as i know survivor npcs are also still on the table so that will enrich the game as well if you like zombie games survival games or apocalypse games this one scratches all three itches and well it s also got great mp and mp roleplay potential as well i do recommend trying it out
