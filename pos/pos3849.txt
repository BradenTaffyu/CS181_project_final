2020 having finished the main story in its entirety and moved onto achievement hunting optimisation and grinding i ll be making some edits here if there are any discrepancies between comments the dev response from what i ve written that s why in a quick outline of the review as a whole i think this game is great for its pricepoint dandylion from what i can tell is a very community centric developer that is intent on doing the best it can by its playerbase while there are negatives for the most part i feel they re outweighed by the company s outstanding efforts pros the complexity in gameplay is enough to consider buying troubleshooter all on its own there are some mastery sets that are definitely better than others but with the right mixing and matching you can pretty much make anything viable want to turn the protag into an actual magic user that s doable just focus on boosting his esp power setting him up with the right sets and building his gear around the power of wind want the great hero irene to solo maps you can do that while there are recommendations floating around and certain farming mastery boards available to pull from you can make anything work if you take the time to experiment a little having finished the story now i can say with confidence that it s good still not great but even good is head and shoulders above most games in the current era with how many different plot points all tie together how characters are related to one another the mystery of certain things going on in the background it s a story that rewards critical thinkers and sets itself up perfectly for future releases the in game explanations for why some masteries exist is interesting too like a certain someone that can t die as a bit of an add on to story is the characterisation definitely a big plus from me as someone who enjoys when that blends with the bigger world as a whole sometimes the voice lines and whatnot will get annoying hearing them over and over during missions that s probably something worth looking into for future releases but the sheer diversity of written text between every story mission that s entirely optional is astounding there s character depth for days if you bother to look the general design both in terms of artwork done and enemy designs is pretty astounding there is a decent amount of copy pasting across certain enemy types but the bosses all tend to look unique compared to their normal guy counterparts so it s not too egregious not being too familiar with korean mythos or culture i m not sure if yasha dororis and so forth are things that they re already familiar with or are unique but either way i like the difference from usual western rpg s i won t touch on it too long but the art for this game is stunning i even convinced myself buying the artbook was worth it and i haven t regretted it yet last for the pros but definitely not least is the developer i can only go off of what i ve personally experienced and seen but dandylion is fantastic within the first few days i started playing there was a massive server error that reverted people s saves what did they do made a massive apology to everyone on the server and sent all accounts a set of in game resources based on your max character level and current act in the story so many devs would have just said sorry and left it at that but not dandylion as you can see below too the fact that i got a dev response on my first run through of a review goes to show that they care quite a lot more than most the so so being an rpg esque title it s inevitable that grinding is going to be a part of the game this is a double edged sword because whilst there are interesting ways to get certain items or masteries abusing a certain character s ability or finishing your research on an enemy to be allowed to craft all their masteries respectively it still takes a considerable amount of time and effort thankfully you can get through the majority of the story without devoting too much time to side activities but it is definitely something to keep in mind if you want to 100 the game while this game has some fairly good music it s obvious pretty quickly that the diversity of tracks is limited being an entirely new franchise in today s market gives it a pass but no more i have high hopes that the themes they explored musically in this will carry on into future releases with a bigger ost that i can feel a bit more happy about spending the money on map variety is something i tossed up a few times between being so so and a pro but i ve decided to put it here while the difference in maps is pretty good for the most part there are a lot of assets that start to feel a bit samey as you continue through the story there are a few instances where the same map is used but never in a way that makes you annoyed as usually it s a learning experience or for thematic effect one of the worse parts is how the layouts of certain maps feel unfair or force you into really unfortunate engagements that smart thinking can t really help you with even so i d be excited to see a bit more variety in types of maps locations in future games both beast taming machine crafting are introduced a little too late into the game in my opinion the sheer depth and usefulness in these systems doesn t quite make this a con but it s a close call because you re so used to not utilising these systems by the point they show up that it s a bit of whiplash to suddenly start using it it doesn t help that in the late game both beasts and machines are really really strong which makes them extremely helpful on some of the more challenging side missions the cons as mentioned previously the voice lines are generally lacking i can only assume that s because this is kind of a first in a series and a bit of a flagship so i hope for any followup games this isn t as much of an issue it does grate on you after a while but when you get new characters it helps to break up the flow of hearing the main character say the same lines every time you move him it gets significantly worse in late game when you ve heard the same things for tens of hours already so this becomes more and more of a con the longer you play difficulty spikes this is more of a personal gripe and as a whole i think the difficulty curve in this game is good what i m more referring to is artificial difficulty spikes there are certain missions with mechanics that will take you from left field or introduce something you had no way to know to prepare for some general advice is that when you start seeing snipers always have someone carry smoke the worst offender for me was a mission where you re rescuing civilians with no enemies on the map and after a certain number are rescued the enemies spawn regardless of the turn order and your positioning poor positioning on your part and not knowing where they spawn can lead to an essential instant mission over as there s no real punishment for losing characters this is fine on the surface but can be very frustrating if a mission was going well up until an artificial difficulty spike the verdictthere s not much more to add that i haven t already summarised early on in short if you enjoy strategy rpg s you ll like this game if you enjoy strategy rpg s and are a fan of anime tropes you ll love this game if you just enjoy anime tropes in games you ll have decent odds of liking this game but might be frustrated by the depth of the systems available whatever your preferences the pricepoint of this game makes it more or less a steal 25 usd for a game that ll probably at the very least give you around 50 hours of playtime that s 50 cents an hour what more could you want
