2020 fallout new vegas is a science fiction first person post apocalyptic role playing shooter game developed by obsidian entertainment for the gamebryo engine set in the post global nuclear annihilation remains of the mojave desert you play as a courier saved from a shallow grave tasked with traversing the wasteland on a quest to track down the man who shot you along the way you ll make powerful enemies and lasting alliances get roped into a multi sided war for the fate of the mojave and uncover the mystery of your undelivered parcel that hangs in the intersection the outcome is up to you so choose wisely important disclaimer if you don t have the patience for technical twiddling and game modification especially when it can be in depth and isn t already accessibly documented i would recommend you don t bother with new vegas in my time with the game i wasn t able to play it comfortably without days worth of experimentation with different performance mods anti glitch mods etc ironically there is more documentation of the bugs than there is about ways to fix them but i got there eventually for the most part that didn t stop the game from hanging every now and then usually taking upwards of 5 seconds to simply open the pause screen and occasionally crash fortunately i never had any issues with my saves additionally if you re playing on an older or low end computer and are hoping this game will run well considering the 2010 release date you may want to do more research on the matter everyone s pc is different but it ran quite poorly on mine usually swinging around 15 30 frames and resting at around 25 it was playable but not ideal i was eventually able to improve matters a bit with said performance mods and by lowering the graphical settings obviously if you don t have the patience for obtuse design either you may still want to steer clear of this game when i first picked it up about a year ago i think i played for a cool 9 hours and felt utterly alienated and unmotivated by it as someone who has never played a bethesda style rpg or any rpg at all in depth this could easily be attributed to inexperience or personal taste and indeed when i finished playing i still had my issues with it just from a personal taste perspective so there s some merit to that but my experience during my first playthrough was not of boredom it was primarily confusion i genuinely didn t know the premise of the game my primary objective or even who i was as a character when it came to combat and inventory management i was similarly completely lost and i also couldn t figure out how to follow or complete quests whatsoever my compass didn t make sense to me the npcs were mostly talking about exposition which was beyond me etc and i struggle to put all that up to me just being thick or otherwise not familiar with this style of video game storytelling overall its really not an accessible game and has virtually no tutorializing aside from one tutorial quest that is ironically meant to teach you how to shoot things the only mechanic i was already comfortable with going in i played for 9 hours couldn t figure out what was going on and dropped it this more recent playthrough was vastly more successful and i m not entirely sure why i d say the primary reason is that i had a few patient friends who i was able to contact for questions regarding the design questions like what does radiation do what s the difference between my overall health meter and the body part specific damage in my inventory how does the compass work etc having this stuff plainly explained made the actual game part of the game easier to access and i found myself genuinely able to get immersed and i mean it when i say that new vegas is an incredibly immersive game to me the dialogue and characterization is uncommonly well written and the role playing you re allowed to do via that portion of the game is both seamless and engaging the art direction too somehow managing to evoke the entire mojave desert in what is a comparatively small in game space from the hot tans and dusty browns of the day to the ancient lush blue of the desert under the night time sky characters are well rendered both graphically and narratively with opposing and varied ideologies opinions personalities histories even physical species and body types it s a vast and involved setting that feels truly populated and the craftmanship and raw effort that went into putting it together is mindboggling even setting aside my awe over the display of artistry and consideration that went into every inch of it i think it does suffer from a gameplay perspective at times and this is something more commonly talked about to be fair the shooting feels messy and not in a way that makes me feel immersed you literally walk at a snails pace and you run at a regular walking speed which results in the player literally always running and it wasn t until this game that i realized how incredibly monotonous it feels to only have one speed in a first person game i started a brief third playthrough with a melee build and it was by far the superior experience so take that for what it s worth i imagine it would get less viable as more powerfully armed enemies get folded in new vegas is an incredibly political story at the heart of it literally revolving around humanitarian missions and diplomacy all pointed towards an eventual culmination at the hoover dam whoever you side with you re both a party leader representative and a soldier and your interactions throughout the game flesh out all of these perspectives and supply the player with material to form motivations and opinions and general engagement with the plot as well told as it is i found it weird how much the game still tries to be relatively apolitical in the same breath despite being a game centered around politics the story bends over backwards to avoid politically challenging any of its players creating a web of palatable but meaningless figureheads while this works from a roleplaying perspective it also means the developers don t really end up making a coherent point in that department the ncr for instance a sort of militia aiming towards what is essentially the re establishment of the american government are depicted simultaneously as well intentioned highly motivated willing to accommodate etc and bullheaded militaristic and short sighted the ncr troopers for instance are a muddy propagandistic reflection of us soldiers portrayed as thoughtful and humane yet overworked while the ncr itself is literally anything you want it be depending on which angle you look at it from regardless of whether you like the us military as a force you will come away pleased by how they re represented by the ncr and the game is like this in basically every way thematically this makes me struggle to make much of new vegas as a universal and objective product but as a co authored experience between myself and the software a truly collaborative and exciting role playing adventure i found it to be compelling and moving in equal parts often times it was a story about danger survival exploration and yet comfort and safety and familiar places it was crushingly lonely and then you can make friends to travel with you sprinting through the wasteland at night under the rich starry sky listening for ghouls or bugs or anything that could pose a threat is a sensory experience unlike anything i ve ever had and then i pop open the in game radio and sacrifice my own attention for something more wholesome it s a story being told somewhere between culture and individualism between the safety of society and the freedom of loneliness essentially it s a western and as a western it s a nuanced startling journey across a living breathing world that is worth escaping to
