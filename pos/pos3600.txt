2021 i usually never review games and if i do they are ironic reviews but this one just hit me so differently that i felt the need to it truly deserves it and i sincerely thank my friend for gifting me this game i want to make one thing clear immediately omori is absolutely not a game for everyone both because of the themes it touches and for some moments of the game that seem to flow apparently a bit slowly that being said omori is a game that captures those who want to be carried away by a well curated non trivial story i think this is the only game that has given me unique emotions in a way i feel like i ve changed after playing it and i m really glad plot there are no spoilers omori deals with the story of a deep friendship between a group of friends where you will enter the shoes of 2 characters omori and sunny going as previously mentioned to gradually touch darker and mysterious themes the exploratory component and the multiple interactions of the characters with the world around them in order to join the pieces of what is happening and grasp all the aftertaste of the story will prove to be particularly important gameplay in addition to the exploratory component with secret roads events for which you will also have to often retrace the steps of the character to return to places already visited environmental puzzles the game has a fighting system that takes up that of the earthbound series conclusions unfortunately to avoid spoilers i had to omit several strengths of the game but i can venture to say that if you are players who are not in a hurry to rush a game but on the contrary prefer to continue calmly exploring interacting with the world created and appreciating the small details and if you are not afraid of more old style graphics then i think this game will not leave you disappointed at all i wish i could forget this game so i could get to play it again and go through all of what it has to offer what a journey this was
