tldr buy the game its a good crpg with w40k loregood points lore writting and voice acting are s tier large depth in character builds and combat talents a lot of option in how to approach combat long game i like long games still no end in sight after 40 hours edit final playtime of 220h for my first campaign longest game ive ever played loved it a lot of choices with actual real consequences in gameplay and story not just dialogue options very cool and original space combat interesting approach to trade a lot of qol details skill check in dialogue are automatically using the higher skill in your party you have a clear vision indicator of your ennemies in combat you can preview vision and abilities when you select the tile you want to move to what is mid would have loved an overwatch ability maps feel a little bit empty in content no real exploration and level map is very meh i know balance is complicated but playing less than hard difficulty feels like cheating hard is kinda fine more is straight up unfair if your party has a lot of combat options ennemies sometimes feel a bit dull no stealth mechanicbad points nothing is a deal breaker for me buy the game cover should be way more important and feels like it has not been fully integrated with other combat mechanics arenas are sometimes debatable for instance cover bonus isnt dynamic you either have full bonus or no bonus as long as you re not on the same horizontal line or behind the ennemy they have full bonus even if you are right on the corner under the line which in xcom for instance is a flank shot camera is sometimes janky not a lot of verticality in the maps and arenas minimap m is straight up ass inventory management is bad visual bugs edit section added what is hopefully going to get patched fixed combat cursor sometimes janky when it has to deal with elevation overall balance some builds are just op and you often use the same combo with each character camera placement and optimisation of environment assets so they disappear efficiently cover mechanic better minimap edit buy if you like love warhammer 40k you like turn based combat you like nerding out on character builds you like a good well written story you like meaningful decisions in crpg similar to wasteland 3 divinity original sin baldur s gate 3 disclaimer do not expect the magic of bg3 which is one of the best games ever created 10 10 in my book rating at 40h ingame solid 7 5 10 rating after 1st campaign 200h 8 5 10 could be a 9 but too much jank still this is the kind of game where you really feel the love attention and ambition of the devs and where you wish they hade more time and more money to accomplish their vision give us more content for the love of god please more content more traders bigger maps a few weak points but the overall balance makes the experience enjoyable hopefully this is the solid base of a long series of w40k crpg please make more games like this price 50 is a tad much to my taste 30 to 40 range looks better under 30 just buy it
