2016 product received for free i love this game honestly i do pro s combines warhammer and total war in a great way a lot of content most unique total war game to date very unique races units lords and heroes graphics voice acting music and sound is amazing magic is a great addition just like the various new unit types reimplements good features from older games like provinces character customization is very cool improved ai both in battles and the campaign great support from the developercons rare crashes performance issues long loading times the ai has been improved but it s still lacking magic seems a little unbalanced attack spells are quite weak compared to the buffs ai heroes can be very annoying on the campaign map lacking multiplayermost cons are details while the pro s are big and very welcome i would rate the game 8 10 recommended
