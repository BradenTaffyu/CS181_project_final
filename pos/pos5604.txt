2020 early access review this is by far one of the better games i ve played even when this game lacks a compelling story unique npc s and is flooded with bugs i still enjoy this game more than titles of this genre i got married have like 3 kids my own kingdom an army of like 100 goons and own a couple villages i commanded armys to raid castles in bloody close combat battles and when i win i can t help but to feel like a badass just the title screen and music do it for me for that reason i overlook the flaws this game is jam packed with stuff but often feels repetitive the story isn t the greatest but the game litterally drops you in and you basically conquer the world the way you want be a warlord or a merchant side with person a or person b you have options high replay value i just wish the npc s had uniqueness really and the leveling gets slooow i don t usually write reviews but i hope this helps someone
