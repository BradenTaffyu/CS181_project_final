2017 early access review normally i am an extremely critical reviewer even when i give a thumbs up i usually fill my reviews with criticism but this is probably going to be the one game i don t do that with simply because i am so impressed with the way the developers are handling the game most devs probably would have ended development of this game ages ago and called it a beta most devs would have stuck with their original concepts no matter how flawed they were because redoing something you ve already done is expensive most devs would have released core content improvements as part of the dlc for this game not this dev 7 days to die seems to be trying to program the ultimate in zombie survival games they aren t trying for amazing graphics they aren t trying for anything flashy they are simply trying to create the most complete core concept of any zombie survival game ever and slowly but surely they have been achieving that goal they aren t a large team so development has been slow going but whenever they release a new alpha there are massive changes i ve played since alpha 4 and the current game looks nothing like it used to and they re still going with massive changes every patch right now as of this review they re working on adding dungeons backstories and quests to the game last update they added turrets ferrals sleepers etc most of the criticism of this game is centered around the development speed but wake up this is a tiny team i would honestly be happy with my money spent as it is right now they ve been bugfixing just as much as they ve been developing too and a lot of the worst problems with a new patch disappear within a couple patches
