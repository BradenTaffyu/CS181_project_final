2018 product received for free seriously one of the best games i ve ever played in my life i ve never been a fan of rpgs myself always went for fps games but i got an interest for this game for it was known for it s diffculty more onto that later the bosses the sceneries etc i was gifted this game and i have to say it was one of the best gifts i ve ever received about the game itself if you are scared to pick it up don t the game is not as hard as people make it out to be it just leaves you to discover stuff for yourself to learn the mechanics playstyles etc this game is by far the best for beginners to the dark souls franchise for it has the most polished gameplay out of the three with some more simpler mechanics kinda of parries are definetely something that actually requires a bit of skill and the same goes for backstabs to a certain extent you have to be more precise with stab than in previous games but we re getting offtrack the story is good nothing really amazing but the main focus of the story is good the lore of the rest of the kingdom of lothric and the dlc worlds too are what s interesting about dark souls games the lore of every boss every area every enemy it s all really fascinating and well crafted just like in other games so it doesn t disappoint in that regard gameplay in itself i found pretty satisfying but i do think the pvp part of the game could have some problems fixed hackers griefers etc soundtrack in the game is also pretty awesome there is something in particular about the final boss theme that has made a lot of people really emotional myself included it s a really cool easter egg but i won t spoil anything this game s music is something you have to experience yourself to understand how awesome and well produced it is the game in itself is beautiful it has stunning graphics and is extremely well optimized except for the beggining of the ringed city dlc all the ash may eat up your frames all the effects boss fights sceneries and enemies have an immense amount of care put into them to make them feel like they belong in this fantasy world and to look the best they possibly can in short dark souls 3 is an amazing game not too far from a masterpiece in my opinion shame that it still has some things that should ve been improved by this time but whatever the game is still playable i highly recommend giving this game a try seriously it s amazing
