2014 i t started out bad really bad the game was half made but that made a great opportunity for modders to make great mods and play around and now the game is fixed and it s magical never been so happy for a total war game before and now im on 684 hours of gameplay i cry when i see how much time i ve wasted on a single game but i have enjoyed every second of it i d reccomend a good computer for the game sincerly a satisfied total war fan
