2021 early access review this is a hard game to review i can t not give the thumbs up it s too unique too much fun and too addicting i have 600 hours already and i just got it a couple of weeks ago and i don t see putting it down anytime soon just be warned this is one early access game that lives up to its status i ve been spoiled by games like minecraft factorio and satisfactory games that were priced humbly full of amazing content and rock solid for me anyway games that felt complete already and then kept on delivering on a regular basis well bannerlord doesn t keep company with such ea games bannerlord lives up to the ea disclaimer it s obviously unfinished buggy as all get out unbalanced frustrating freezes every play session and at any given time you ll wonder whether the developer has abandoned the game updates are infrequent and small and they barely bother to communicate with the players still i d buy it again is it worth the price only in the same sense that usury is worth it if you owe the mob it s worth it only because it doesn t have any competitor except its own outdated predecessor i figure they figure they can charge what they do because fans don t have an alternative but it does say something that there is a large i m going back to warband contingent within the m b community
