2019 yes total war warhammer ii is out now but that doesn t make it any less worth it buying and playing this one there s a ton of content here not to mention the old world scenario being my favourite of the two games don t think of it just as an addon to the mortal empires campaign and more factions personally the game feels more stable than mortal empires still love it though for me and less random or immersion breaking for lack of a better term there s something special about playing the old world map the only thing this map would need is a skaven presence to make it perfect it would be a great addition to warhammer 2 if this map was available as an alternative to vortex and mortal empires i m a huge fan of warhammer fantasy and also an avid total war player since the days of rome and bringing the warhammer setting into the total war franchise was an instant purchase for me as much as i adore this game i do recognize the downgrading of the campaign details the provincial system army management diplomatic and economic options like buying out a city it certainly doesn t have the depth and detail of medieval 2 shogun 2 or even the first rome but ever since they brought along the whole system from rome 2 there s really not much they can improve on something already limiting we are losing features with each game instead of keeping them simple elements like splitting my forces into two armies would be something awesome in this game to reinforce border garrisons but instead we absolutely need a lord to have an army and that adds heavy upkeep with each lord still considering the brutal nature of the warhammer world it is indeed fitting to make things simple and it works but those elements would have made this even more of a masterpiece i do love the game anyway though you get four amazingly well designed races with subfactions and lords also a couple free factions each with its own unique mechanics armies and economy i really love how ca portrayed every faction in this game each with its unique gameplay goals and effects the provincial system isn t my cup of tea but the design and environment of the campaign map is very well done the soundtrack and voice acting is also fantastic most of my issues are fixed with the game due to the awesome mods the community provides basically making the game invaluable in terms of replayability the graphics are just stunning with optimization always being an issue with any total war even with modern i7 s and my gtx 1070 i would say it runs pretty well most of the time only ever had fps drops on siege battles with multiple full stack armies on the field and even then it s bearable is the game still expensive three years after release with plenty of pricey dlc yes it is however i did pay full price for all of it and don t regret a cent i must recommend the game despite its flaws it is simply too good the feeling of uniting the provinces of the empire as karl franz and stand united against the tides of chaos restoring the glory of the karaz ankor as the dwarves flood the old world with a tide of greenskins so overwhelming that even chaos can t stand against it or even take advantage of the bickering between the elector counts of the empire and strike to create a new empire under the rule of the vampire counts it is simply too great to miss out on especially when you also get the extra content for tww2 consider buying it on a sale and then it becomes an absolute bargain
