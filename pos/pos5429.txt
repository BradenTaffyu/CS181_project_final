2016 early access review i ve been playing this since the ascii only days when it was one of those thank god i m not on shrooms roguelikes i convinced myself to plow through the rugged don t f ing play this game interface with the moments of flashing what the heck am i looking at 4th wall breaking screen color patterns and was rewarded for doing so the game broke through to be a true experience filled with amazing combat many moments of pause from the game to go think about what i should do next and seemingly incalculable ways to work around almost any situation while keeping just enough hp to make it back to town when i saw that there was a tileset i bought it to support the development but didn t plan on playing the steam version just to pay back for hours of entertainment then i decided to fire it up and was blown away by a new experience everything i loved was now more approachable and i could recommend the game without adding any kind of fine print i found myself doing so often the graphics fit perfectly it s still probably going to take time to get in to it for new players but just give it a go if you are already a fan of roguelikes especially moria adom or tome style and have somehow never heard of this game i sincerely doubt you ll regret the purchase buy the game
