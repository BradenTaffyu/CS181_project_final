2014 just thought i d share an old preview of the game that i did when it was first showcased at pax fallout new vegas lived up to every anticipation and is truly an excellent game worthy of the series i just returned from my first pax where i managed to get a good look at the upcoming fallout game fallout new vegas the bethesda booth had demos on the x box only allowed you to play for a theoretically 15 minute interval using a demo savepoint and had lines at least 45 minutes long all of which gives you a very limited look into the game but fortunately i discovered that the nvidia booth had a fallout 3 demo for the pc often with no lines and a gameplay duration limited only by your conscience as such i was able to get in several hours of play in the new game that said i avoided most anything that would spoil the plot for me as well as avoided major areas like the strip instead i focused on learning what i could about changes to gameplay and i m writing to share those with you what i ve learned if you ve been looking forward to this game some of these things you will probably already know from other reviews and spoilers fallout new vegas uses the same engine and basic gameplay as fallout 3 but incorporates a lot of things from fallout 1 2 that fallout 3 dispensed of and includes a lot of game tweaks previously only available in mods visually the game is beautiful the green haze is gone giving us a bright blue sky and a lush desert landscape which is heavy on oranges and browns traits are back traits are special perks available only at the beginning which either modify the game a little or which give you a benefit at the cost of a drawback you can pick two traits for your character one trait wild wasteland adds additional wacky content and modifies existing content and special encounters that makes connections to the bizarre encounters you could have in the first fallout games skills have been mildly revamped small guns and big guns are now just guns plus they have added in the survival skill more on it later a lot of the perks from the older games are apparently back in addition opposite sex perks like black widow now have same sex equivalents food items now give you health slowly over time rather than in a single lump sum with sufficient survival skill you can activate any campfire you find and cook food or otherwise combine foodstuffs to create superior foodstuffs for example you can cook gecko meat to create a gecko steak which is much healthier similar to the recipes for food you have the ability to modify or break down your weapons with a sufficient level of repair skill you can even break down scrap metal into lead you can add silencers scopes etc to certain weapons if you have the parts the repair skill and a workstation in addition apparently you can repair items up to 100 regardless of the level of your repair skill higher levels just makes it easier requiring less items and having mentioned gecko meat yes geckos are back in addition to a wider variety of monsters new vegas offers more variety within those monsters including smaller young versions of the adult critters as well as basic good evil karma you also garner reputation with each settlement and group on a similar note stealing from any group even an evil one will get you negative karma this leads to scenarios like the one i encountered below i sneak up on a camp of powder gangers a gang formed of escaped convicts they be evil and take them out gaining positive karma for killing the bad guys but negative reputation with the powder gangers i loot their bodies gaining nothing except loot of course then i loot their campsite gaining negative karma for stealing from the powder ganger faction as a fun addition if you are wearing the outfit of a particular faction you are disguised as a member of that faction the initial reactions of people you run into will be based on that disguise so as it turns out running around in powder ganger armor wasn t such a smart idea weapons at least some of them have special critical hits for example fighting with boxing gloves allowed me to knock an enemy critter out cold so overall i m even more excited for fallout new vegas than i was before pax it looks like this game is going to be excellent
