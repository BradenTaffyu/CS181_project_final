2017 i decided that my first stellaris playthough would be on ironman mode with no prior knowledge of the game whatsoever what follows is three of the most interesting points in a campaign that has thus far spanned 180 years background i named my empire the galactic empire and began the game as a militarist materialist and authoritarian the celimy conflict early on around the 50 year mark i encounter a species of strange fungal creatures they call themselves the celimy states they are fanatic spiritualists and pacifists fools after a series of insults and the declaration of a rivalry the celimy declare war on me my navy christened the grand imperial navy departs the coruscant system to engage the celimy mycelium carriers as they called themselves a short time later the imperial navy reaches the celimy home system imperial transports land armies on their capital the takeover is rapid and at the end of the war the celimy states has splintered into 3 separate nations the celimy hegemony the celimy confederacy and the celimy associates later on the associates would become my vassal the confederacy was a long standing enemy the galactic civil war around 120 years in the galaxy is almost fully filled with about 20 separate empires and two distinct sides begin to form on one side is myself and a federation called the stellar entente along with various other small empires the other side is comprised of a vast array of small nations led by the karabnar nations war breaks out with the karabnar declaring war on the galactic empire i now have 3 fleets the star corps the shock battalion and the grand imperial navy the star corps and shock battalion are relatively small shock forces whereas the grand imperial navy is my main force a massive space battle in the ocheron system involves over 1000 ships with almost every known nation being present the battle which was beautiful to watch was relatively even until the arrival of the star corps and shock battalion who tipped the balance with fresh ships the combined fleet of myself and my allies yes the ai is that good eventually reaches karab the karabnar nations capital and takes the system with the help of two titanic beasts recruited from the outer systems of the empire on the verge of victory i am notified that a massive fleet is currently in orbit over coruscant sent by the hjaarthi syndicate one of our enemies the fleet is in position to take our homeworld my own fleets cannot reach coruscant in time all seems lost a mere few days before coruscant s fortifications would ve failed a fleet from one of my allies the verulian compact comes out of hyperspace above coruscant and annihlates the enemy fleet the karabnar nation and their allies surrender and the war is won the fallen empire 150 years in a fallen empire which is a fully developed but stagnant state exists above me they call themselves the yz vorak remnant which i shortened to y remnant they are military isolationists and hate my empire with a special intensity they insult mea and shortly afterwards declare war on my empire this sort of war is usually a death sentence so i move large numbers of people away from the frontier and prepare to submit at this point i ve got 3 vassals all are weak but they are extremely loyal the vassals join me in the war all 3 of my fleets meet above coruscant along with transports for my droid army irony much i deploy my entire military to the jahab system where we meet the fallen empire s forces their ships are unlike anything we ve ever seen and are incredibly powerful we are losing the battle things are not looking good suddenly out of hyperspace come 3 fleets my 3 vassals have brought everything they have to assist the effort with their help we drive back the fallen empire forces fastforward about 3 years through intense naval strategy and economic strain imperial forces have out matched the y remnant s fleet the grand imperial navy and the fleets of my vassals orbit above their capital the core i don t have enough strength left to invade their planets so i offer them a white peace fallen empires cannot build new fleets so this seemed logical enough i recieve a notification peace accords on coruscant while signing the peace accords on coruscant two v remnant agents who were standing next to the emperor of the galactic empire killed him and mutilated his body furious the imperial navy and the combined fleets of all of the empire s vassals and allies immediately attack the y remnant capital out of nowhere a massive army from the fallen empire comes out of hyperspace over the core i still am not entirely sure where this army actually came from in the epic battle that ensues the grand imperial navy defeats and destroys the y remnant s fleet allowing the ground invasion of the core to take place with the core fallen the fallen empire cowers and begs for peace the y remnant is annexed by the galactic empire peace reigns across the galaxy around 20 years later subspace energy surges indicate something we have not encountered before a new being from out of our dimension makes contact their signal is not unlike a hunting call by popular request an update their name is the unbidden and they make an immediate point a transmission appears on my screen depicting some kind of strange ethereal being they say something about prey and then the transmission cuts out the unbidden fleet is marked by science ship in the bottom part of the galaxy below myself and the qix lufran combine the qix lufran are isolationist authoritarians but decide to deploy their entire fleet the sole largest fleet in the galaxy to immediately engage this extraterrestrial threat the qix lufran fleet reaches the unbidden s position and is utterly destroyed this shocks the entire galaxy interestingly enough these unbidden would remain effectively dormant in their small region at the bottom of the galaxy not sure if it was because of the fallen empire bordering them or simply because they were waiting for reinforcements either way the unbidden hold their position for the time being the great intergalactic war the galactic empire has become the most powerful and largest state in the galaxy above us the hjannarthi syndicate exists which nearly equals my own power to our left is the stellar entente federation to the right is the njalax high kingdom and the uriy republic below us the zuifvan imperium the qix lufran and the unbidden although there is a period of peace there is great unrest in the galaxy the qix lufran and njalax grow closer and closer every year eventually they declare a defensive pact and close their borders to myself the stellar entente and the hjannarthi syndicate their combined power rivals my own they are dangerous they undergo a combined massive military buildup and begin to become increasingly aggressive in mid july of 2412 212 years in the tensions boil over the njalax and the qix lufran declare war on the galactic empire the hjannarthi and the stellar entente the galaxy is divided a line is drawn essentially down the middle of the galaxy dividing the left qix lufran and njalax from the right galactic empire and allies i issue an immediate order to deploy the fleet the long dormant grand imperial navy assembles over coruscant admiral cognat leads the navy my ever reliable vassals send everything they have to join the imperial navy i love those guys the stellar entente s federation fleet strikes first they use their wormhole stations to attack directly at the heart of the njalax my own fleet reaches the qix lufran capital with relative ease meeting almost no resistance we confront a vastly outmatched qix lufran force of 2 battleships and 18 corvettes max rev length
