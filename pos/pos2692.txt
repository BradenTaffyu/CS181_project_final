2020 short reviewread this if you just want to hear what i think about the game i would recommend divinity original sin 2 to anyone who enjoys a good rpg its storytelling is fun and engaging while the deep tactical gameplay is unlike anything i ve seen before the soundtrack and voice acting immerses you into this fantastic world larian studios have managed to create pros and cons unique take on turn based combat that is both fun and challenging engaging main story that doesn t always take itself too seriously overall great voice acting combined with a stellar soundtrack the lack of guidance can sometimes be too muchrating exceptionalclick here to see my rating chartfull reviewread this if you want all the details after being stripped of a powerful magical power known as source you re sent to prison by ship along with many other sourcerers from around the world but not everything goes as planned because not far from your destination the ship is attacked by a group of mysterious creatures the ship sinks but right as you re about to meet your demise from drowning a voice calls to you this is the beginning of your journey to becoming divine an adventure littered with friendship challenges to overcome and lots of humor so where do i even start with this game it s a great game that much i can say already the story might not be the most complex and mind bending one to be told in a video game but sometimes stories don t need to be littered with twists and turns waiting around the corner it doesn t take itself too seriously either but this approach to the storytelling actually works and it doesn t interfere in the game s serious moments i really enjoyed the story the game tried to tell especially the moments spent with my fellow companions who all had their own story and goals running beside the main story arc my party consisted of the red prince a lizard who was caught red handed with a bunch of demons lohse a bard consumed by a demon and sebille an elven assassin and a former slave i was fane an undead and one of the last of his kind there s a reason i m not going deep into each character because i honestly believe their stories are so well told and certainly are something to experience for yourself after spending so much time with my companions it was sad to have to say goodbye to them at the end of the game that s a good thing because it meant that the writers accomplished what they probably intended but this is an rpg so how well does the game incorporate choices pretty well actually the choices you make often influence the characters in your current location and sometimes even the whole location itself i would say that the main direction of the story is mostly linear but where you get to choose is how you accomplish the tasks at hand now on to arguably the past part of d os2 as i will be referring the game as from this point onward the gameplay the game features turn based combat but its take on this is what differs it from most crpgs the game s combat scenarios revolve around the environment they take place in rather than only the characters the game s many magic elements leave behind a surface corresponding to the skill you used affecting anyone standing in that particular field oil can slow down enemies while ice can make them slip but if you desire even more devastating effects then you ll also be able to combine these elemental effects together by cursing a field of blood you ll apply a decaying effect to anyone unlucky enough to be standing in that area causing them to take damage when healed these environmental effects make for a much more believable and deep combat experience making the game seem far more advanced than most turn based games each character also has an amount of physical and magic armor if you haven t guessed already physical armor protects against physical attacks while magic armor protects against various types of magic once you manage to deplete either the combat begins to open up for the possibility of applying effects to your enemies this could be everything from making them terrified to knocking them down as you can probably hear d os2 is really advanced when it comes to combat and you ll need to make usage of all the tools the game gives you because the game is very challenging just like any other standard rpg d os2 s stories are told through various quests which the player can complete there s a lot of them in this game and none of them involves boring chores such as fetch quests while the quest design itself is great i did have some problems with how they are communicated to the player the game doesn t feature any quest markers for locations you don t know of which is of course a good thing however the game gets a little too greedy with information at times a lot of quests task you with reaching a certain location or character but never gives you any clue to where these might be this means that i often had to use various guides online because i simply wasn t able to find whatever it was i needed to continue the quest this became irritating as i really wanted to solve the quests on my own but without any clues it is very hard i also found it a bit weird that i would sometimes have multiple quests with the exact same objective next up is presentation and by that i mean graphics visual style and audio let s start with the graphics they certainly aren t the most stunning most impressive on the market but i didn t expect that because i already knew that this isn t a aaa title there is a lot of detail put into the world which really helps you immerse yourself in the many locations the visual style of the game is a mixture of photo realistic and cartoony some of the character designs were really visually unique which helps the game set itself apart from other fantasy titles but what about the audio the audio effects are just what you would expect but the voice acting really exceeded my expectations especially the cast for the main characters did a fantastic job in their role which might even be part of the reason why i enjoyed spending my time with them so much rpgs can sometimes have really bad voice acting but this isn t the case here the best part about the audio though is easily the soundtrack composed by borislav slavov the music fits perfectly with the style of the game and gave me the vibe of going on a grand adventure if you liked this review i would appreciate it if you took the time to check out some of my other reviews here also feel free to leave a comment on this review if you want to discuss
