2020 ah three kingdoms i figured nearly 300 hours in was a good time to write a review well the tw fanbase has been a bit split in recent years over the warhammer games some older fans have enjoyed them as much as historical titles while others have been waiting for a return to the true historical games personally i think three kingdoms does a fantastic job of bridging that gap with the romance and records modes one of which has much more powerful individuals a la warhammer the other being much more akin to the older historical tws so should you buy this game probably in my opinion if you re devoted to a single past tw title or disliked the warhammer games for their new mechanics not setting it may disappoint you because the franchise has continued to evolve but if you re just a fan of the formula creative assembly have been using for a while or got into tw through the warhammer games just get it skip the eight princes dlc though mandate of heaven and world betrayed bracket the base experience really nicely princes is set two generations later and just feels disjointed and weird
