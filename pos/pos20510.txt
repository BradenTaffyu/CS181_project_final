2020 i first tried this game way back in college it was a great way to unwind at the end of a long day of classes work beat it several times over then i finally tried other tower defense games on steam played them some i liked others i didn t this one i had to come back to btw most of the time you see is play but a significant amount of time is either in bowling slots or zen garden great way to unwind 9 5p s if you wait you can grab it on steam during a sale for 1 25 it s a great deal
