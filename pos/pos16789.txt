2019 a long arduous sims like house builder with extra steps and the inability to shift click the wallpaper colour into existence in the whole room in an instant with an insanely priced dlc that isn t worth it yet somehow i played 40 hours of it for 3 days straight until i completed it entirely and actually managed to cramp my hand and give myself clicking strain so i must have enjoyed it despite my complaints i also really enjoyed the samantha house and that kind of secured it s fate in this review
