2023 calling a game a hidden gem is kind of cliche at this point but this is absolutely 100 a hidden gem of the strategy rpg genre i ve been a big fan of series like x com fire emblem or tactics ogre for a long time and this 25 game from a small studio holds up against the best of the best so even though i never write steam reviews i feel like it would be a disservice not to shill this game a bit if you re familiar with x com or similar titles you can largely understand how this game works top down tile based squad fighting unlike x com and more similar to titles like final fantasy tactics this game uses an ap system where instead of each side taking its turn at once each individual character will take its turn depending on its speed as well as modifiers such as what actions it took the previous turn or status effects also unlike x com through the game you build a small squad 9 at end of main game with no permadeath pros cons high build customization there s a system in this game called the mastery board basically each character has multiple slots to place masteries on masteries are modifiers for your character and equipping certain masteries together might also unlock a set which boosts the modifiers given there are at this moment 827 masteries and 427 mastery sets many of these masteries are class or even character specific and many of them are also limited to beast units more on that later but that is a massive amount of build variety possible i spent a lot of time workshopping combinations and then testing them in battle and i loved every minute of it also every enemy you encounter in the game is built on its own masteries only a few of which are enemy restricted so if you see an enemy with an interesting build you can check that enemy s masteries and build your own unit similarly the beast drone system later in the game you get a character on your squad who can tame beast enemies you encounter including many bosses the process of taming is rather delicate and taming a difficult enemy can involve a lot of risk taking for the ultimate reward however tough that enemy was once tamed your tamer character can summon them to most battles this greatly expands the variety of units you can build and bring into battle the drone system is similar you get a character who can summon controllable drones to the field these drones have their own version of masteries called modules of which there are 103 with 45 possible sets there are different kinds of drones with different niches from high speed drones with flamethrowers to tanky slow drones that fire movement restricting spider webs you individually build each drone with the crafting system and it s a good sink for excess money and material late game massive gameplay customizability if you don t like something about the game there s a decent chance you can change it for difficulty level alone there are five options safe to cruel as well as a challenge mode that makes missions much harder which can be enabled for most missions individually you can enable additional challenge options such as making boss units more difficult limiting your level to the recommended level cap of each mission give enemies additional masteries and more for speed of game there are seven options for how fast your or enemy s movements go where most games would give three options at most guides and information this game has a lot going on in terms of mechanics masteries enemy variety loot etc however just about anything you need to know can be found in game the help menu is extremely thorough and even gives exact information such the equation to see how a unit s speed translates into ap every piece of loot or crafting material you get as well as every mastery and every mastery set you have used are all kept in easily accessible indexes in game there is an information system where as you encounter an enemy type more and more you get information on what masteries and attacks it has its loot drop table with exact percentages what maps you can find it on and other useful information for such an complex game i only had to use google once to find an answer to something i couldn t figure out everything else was readily available in game the story takes a while to really build but it is very engaging does a fairly good job balancing the arcs of all the different characters that join you and gives a lot of interesting lore about the world around you both implicitly and explicitly the end of the main game season 1 leaves some plotlines incomplete for the dlc and possible future seasons and i genuinely want to see where it goes the early game is slow and doesn t come close to how good the later game becomes you start off with just the main character supported by generics and you only build your team up gradually through the game s story i think this largely comes down to how the game was developed chapter to chapter in early access the best battle mechanics such as beast taming or the dance system only really come into play midway into the game because they took time to develop when you first start a new game you have to choose between playing online mode or offline mode if you choose offline you can not switch that game to be online later meaning you can not interact with other players in game or fighting others in pvp i don t see many people online at any given time and have not tried to do pvp if you choose online you have to have internet connection and the server has to be up any time you want to play you can export a copy of your online mode game to offline mode but this option isn t really mentioned clearly anywhere i don t think all these restrictions are worth it for fair pvp experience the game is still being updated gradually if you look in the dlc you can see that after the game came out of early access in 2020 an additional free dlc chapter was added and now there s an additional 10 dlc chapter for which content is still being released so that s new missions higher level caps new unique characters with their own highly customizable niches still being added to a game with 100 hours of content in the base game content content content i ve gotten 100 hours of game time without even touching the dlcs yet main game has 7 chapters divided into 47 missions a few of these missions are as short as a one on one battle but some can take well over an hour to complete every single story mission is repeatable and you can take different options in story dialogue by repeating these missions with some achievements even requiring this there are as far as i ve discovered 35 repeatable mission maps 11 of which are violent case maps which offer additional challenge in exchange for useful boss drops there are a few other one off maps you might see through doing side quests the game gives you plenty of incentive to repeat chapters to unlock new masteries get better loot tame the interesting boss beast complete a side quest etc there are 258 steam achievements some of which are quite difficult and i m tempted to get them all there s probably a lot more i could say about this game but i ll end by saying that if troubleshooters 2 banished children or whatever it could be called came out tomorrow for three times the price of this game i would buy it in a heartbeat edit i have since beaten the first free dlc and tried pvp the free dlc adds one chapter and two characters each of which holds up to the quality of what is in the main game as for pvp it is unlocked only once you beat the main game meaning you could like me hit 100 hours before ever even getting access it is however very fun when you happen to find someone to do it with
