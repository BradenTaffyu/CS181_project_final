2017 builds on everything was good with first game and throws in a ton more some bullet points runs fantastic seems really well optimised and i own every other tw game and have tested on this system really great tutorial for begginers guides you step by step then takes the stablisers off at a set point a lot more colourful maps and units a huge map with very distinct areas four very different races to start with they all look and play very differently i may edit this later with more thoughs negatives but so far its a very polished larger version oif the first warhammer game
