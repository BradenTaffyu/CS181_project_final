2019 update at release steam reviewers are the biggest bunch of whining babies they love to tank a game s reviews just because of one little insult they can t forgive this time everybody is mad because they expected something which kunos never claimed the sim would have would scheduled races be nice sure is it worthless without them nope the rating and matchmaking systems will become more effective as people spend more time with the sim your experience with early access multiplayer means very little even if you think it should have had scheduled races the value that s included for the price of purchase is far beyond what any other sim offers update this purchase is a no brainer for any sim racer full stop whether that applies to you depends on your definition of sim racer and whether you include yourself in that group i could go on and on about all of the reasons why i think acc is and will be the best racing sim ever if you have specific questions i can answer in the comments but mostly i want to recommend reading the blogs about the driver rating systems part 1 part 2 basically those blogs offer brilliant solutions for every major complaint i ve ever had or heard about iracing the tracks are laser scanned the cars and physics are on par with iracing if not better and the driver ratings are genius to make a brief comparison of the physics iracing makes the car feel very light and forgiving compared to acc with acc you feel the weight of the car and the effect it has on your traction the end result is that i have to be much more precise with my inputs and much more conscious of all the factors that influence traction a few people complain that it doesn t feel realistic but they re actually complaining that it isn t as easy as other sims they ve played with iracing i am able to get away with things that probably should have caused me to lose control and overall it s too easy to go fast especially in cold temps it s surprising for myself to say that because i thought iracing was brutal when i first started about 3 years ago but i ve learned many things since then and acc simply feels more true to life comparing lap times at nurburgring gp in iracing i can do 1 50 51 pretty easily in a gt3 car maybe even 1 49 with quali fuel in acc i think the best i ve done is 1 55 maybe 1 54 in ideal conditions i don t have the real life gt3 experience to compare with but that seems about right to me i probably shouldn t be able to do lap times within 1 2 seconds of irl professionals though i d love to believe i m just that good so again for any sim racer this is a no brainer for gamers with gamepads i m not sure i would recommend and that s not meant to be an insult i just want to be clear that this is not at all like a forza or gran turismo this one isn t made for gamers it s made for sim racers
