2019 product received for free don t starve togetherthe irony that i have like 34 hours as of this review but like 32 of those hours i played alone still fun no matter if you play with friends or alone tho i prefer mostly alone or with really trusted friends cause some of my friends set the world up in flames more than once you can get items in your steam inventory if that s a thing your interested in it s time for science so just buy it you will earn your money back from the daily drops in like 8 years if you re lucky then maybe a few years sooner edit game time randomly keeps increasing even tho i stopped playing this game at 34 hours and started just starting the game for a minute each day to collect the daily item cause why not and somehow i m at 91 hours despite logging in for 1 minute once per day which makes no sense since it jumped recently from 67 hours to 91 as in literally today as of this edit somehow 24 hours appeared with me just logging in for 1 minute and closing the game
