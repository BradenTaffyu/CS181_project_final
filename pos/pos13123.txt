2019 a game geared towards engineering design and experimentation where possibilities are endless if you ever wondered what it would be to become an astronaut a pilot or a nasa engineer kerbal space program offers the closest thing to that here you can design test and fly rockets space stations interplanetary spaceplanes and whatever vehicle your imagination might fancy you can circumnavigate kerbin ksp s equivalent to earth send probes to other planets mine asteroids for fuel and resources and establish a satellite network to help the little green kerbals achieve their goals of space exploration you will find yourself using the scientific method even without trying throughout an endless process of trial and error many iterations will fail but once you achieve your objective the experience can be extremely rewarding as only real life engineering can be kerbal space program is a very unique game it is at the same time scientifically sound but accessible and fun while it requires some understanding of physics to be enjoyable there are plenty of forums documentation tutorials and helpful people always willing to assist the player the gamer base is comprised of real life engineers and space and aviation enthusiasts that along with a dedicated legion of modders keep ksp fresh and constantly evolving this guarantees a near limitless replayability constrained only by your imagination and system specs one of the most interesting aspects of ksp is its modding capabilities you can find mods that expand substitute and significantly alter practically all vanilla functions and processes from extra vehicle parts to a whole new solar system mods can keep you entertained for years the fact that ksp is flexible enough to let you tailor your gaming experience to your exact needs and tastes is part of the triumph of this successful space simulator the physics model is not exactly akin to reality but quite serviceable in practical terms you might not notice the difference the huge assortment of building parts can be complemented with an even larger variety thanks to mods the planets are huge and getting there is challenging but sometimes there s little to do the devs placed some interesting features dubbed anomalies that can become interesting to locate and visit available in most celestial bodies but as in many other cases the reward is the journey there is a primitive science collecting system now enhanced by the most recent dlc which serves as a progression structure of sorts letting you unlock parts and technology as your space program becomes more sophisticated you can choose from the career science and sandbox options that range from most gamelike to entirely constraint free vehicle building to satisfy different approaches and needs the game is fine as it is but i strongly recommend using mods after you have learned the ropes in vanilla ksp this is a game where the experience really shines through mods and heavy customization years after its initial release ksp is a game that is still growing even after changing hands this game is updated every now and then with new parts or tweaked mechanics well into 2021 ksp is being improved and refined and the final approach update shows exactly that the developing team are as dedicated as the huge modding community all of them dead serious about the love they show for ksp if you are even a little curious about aerospace design or interested in any space program or exploration initiative this game is for you highly recommended
