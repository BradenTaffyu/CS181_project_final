2017 early access review i wish there would be a mixed setting for reviewing because caves of qud is the most complicate game to rate i ve ever seen that s why i will be straightforward why would you buy caves of qud if you want to try the hardest rogue like rpg up to date with minimalistic graphics and rich story then you can buy this game otherwise forget it because you can have a lot of fun and really rewarding moments as you can become so frustrated and angry to smash your keyboard wich is actually the only controler if you still want to buy this game few things you must know before playing the game developpement community caves of qud is in early access supported by a great dev team these guys are awesome the minimalistic render of the game permits amazing possibilities regularly updated by new stories content and bug fixes sorry you won t fall in love for a wood sign again caves of qud is one of the most promising early access around most of the ones who played it have barely scratched it s surface also the developpement logs are some of the funniest i ve ever read if you enter this world you will find a friendly community forums are full of nice and helpfull people plus there s already implemented steam workshop to add new stories items character presets or skills overall difficulty and survival tips caves of qud is a brutally difficult game maybe the hardest i ve ever played hours of efforts can be lots in seconds there is no space for errors and lack of planning especially when you build your character don t trust reviews talking about weird stuff with character creation of course you can do amazing things in this game but taking risks leads to a game over and nothing else no exp for your highscores no unlockables after death just lessons regrets and your tears you can save your starting character sheet and also the world seed wich is one of the most important feature regarding difficulty everything is random except tilesets if you save your world seed it makes adventures way more manageable for your successives tries so keep that in mind surviving requires you to gather food and water depending of your character you might have different habits to fullfill your needs also be ware water is a currency and can overload you it makes trading a bit tedious because you must trade water for items with the same trading price but lightweight to set a base in a village is a good thing you can lift chests and drop them anywhere if you store items inside nobody will steal them remember to always have a backup plan when you create a character by plan i mean a way to escape fights because almost everything is random you fall rather often on huge packs or a really vicious enemies just around a corner down some stairs or in the wilderness on the border of a new tile that s why you must be able to set up a decent escape plan for every situations run jump lay mines throw grenades freeze with your hands stun with your cudgel or just teleport yourself and run away teleportation is my favourite skill in caves of qud nothing can beat this you can inspect the world around you helps you to know your enemies there s a cybernetic augment that give you detailed informations about your target if it s tough or impossible and angry run note that you need to light your environment or get the appropriate skill to see whenever the conditions temperature matters check your body temperature or when it s too late pour something on you doing regular faction checks and inspecting new people helps to prevent bad surprises and take your time you might survive longer character creation even if the possibilities are almost limitless when you create your character you have to choose between mutated humans and true kins mutants can tailor their skills by adding new limbs organs or spychic powers teleportation and some other cool stuff one of the starting mutations is really interresting you can be versatile choose an unstable genome and get amazing results or focus on one type and exclude the other physical or mind mutations you can also select a caste that gives skills bonuses equipements and serves as your background true kins could be seen as fresh fallout vault dwellers stronger starting attributes and unable to get mutations they get more skill points every level and have access to cybernetics the weaker cousin of mutations at least for the moment you can also choose castes and they get slightly better starting equipement wich is sometimes really unfair compared to mutants your equipement is really important no matter what character you create try to spend enough ego points so you will sell your loot at decent prices no other attribute can affect bartering take time to understand how attributes and skills works if you fail to stick to one character type you won t be able to reach your full potential saving and practicing a character in the first tries is a good thing especially true kins they are easier to handle when you start progression caves of qud is very grindy you will often kills tons of enemies to reach a decent level and skills mutations sets be ware quests are extremely hard you must explore the world first and get some gear and experience to be able to finish them the deeper you explore the more you venture to the east the more dangerous it will be tinkering is the only crafting skill available in the game a bit of a problem sometimes because related to intelligence and gives access to tons of receipes unavailable to other builds without itl especially restorative injectors and grenades you can buy them if you find some appropriate traders but crafting is still the best way to survive longer also tinkering enable to lay mines in fact to put grenades on the ground wich is really helpfull when you want to flee the word of the endcaves of qud is a unique game not for everyone that s for sure detailed on many aspects and extremely deep the pleasure of discovering new characters locations and even new ways to survive is a delight however loosing a character that fast and forever is really annoying especially after so many hours spent on trying to get the best of every situations that s why i m still mixed and turned my review into a small guide to prevent you most of the frustrating moments when you start keep your time to learn how to survive in this world otherwise you will miss everything about this game live and drink my friendn b don t forget to save your characters builds and copy and paste in a folder your world seeds teleportation might be your best ally trust me
