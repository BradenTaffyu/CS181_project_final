2014 entry 1 its my first day running my new company marauder trucking i took out a huge loan from the bank scored myself a sick looking volvo truck im ready for action journal entry 2 i m new to driving a vehicle with this many gears and new to shifting manually with a clutch but i think i got it under control then i back up straight into the side of a small van so no im not under control i ve now damaged my truck to 8 and cost myself a pretty penny for the accident but hey we all gotta learn sometime right journal entry 3 after driving around my small property parking lot and learning my gears i decide to venture to the populated streets i backup this time checking my mirrors and carefully pull onto the street i m now happily driving among the traffic of europe the drivers a slow and waiting at lights is a pain in the rear but alas this is my life now journal entry 4 i have picked a mission to haul a load of heavy machinery across the countryside i drive to my location which happens to be a nice little farm with very tight corners and fences i see my load waiting between two other loaded trailers this looks like a tight fit i attempted backing up several times not getting it right i m sure the farmer and his wife were either giggling inside their house or regretting not hiring a better driver i finally get latched on and give a sigh of relief i pull out of the space and very gently make my turns while trying not to stall out although its tight maneuvering i am able to escape vincent s smoked meats journal entry 5 now on the road i get to enjoy the beautiful countryside and shake my fist at the slow and dangerous drivers around me it begins to get a bit darker and a light rain starts i almost drive my truck off the road twice trying to turn on my headlights and windshield wipers but were all good i m now cruising down the road at a gentle 70 and things are good uh oh i can see a line of cars piling up behind me so i better pick up the pace this was a poor decision on my part journal entry 6 now thinking back in the best interest of other drivers i should have just stayed the speed i was going but i did not i got far to generous with the gas pedal and shifting ended up pumping my truck up to around 120 this speed was great i was making good time i didn t have a line of cars behind me but i didn t account for sharp corners in my equation i came whipping up to a corner thinking ok ill just tap the brakes and slow down a bit well its wet on the road its a sharp corner i got it down to about 98 when i hit the corner and suddenly my world started to become slightly off center journal entry 7 now that my truck is laying on its side i ve learned a key element about gear reduction to control speed as well as when to and when not to apply the brakes i had missed my corner by lots i had not taken into account the grade of the road and i rolled it and slid for a long distance it was quite scary after my truck is up righted from the long skid on its side im now looking at 72 damage the truck sounds like a blender full of ball bearings and the lights flicker that s totally normal right journal entry 8 ok the truck sounds terrible but it still drives its got horrible turning now and 3 of my gears are non existent i m still about 2 game hours away from my destination i am able to drive for about 45 mins before the truck really starts to have issues i was driving along at my new cautious speed of 50 and suddenly my truck turns off great no power steering so my wheel locks up and its like trying to steer a dead whale with a pool cue not working well but i m able to get it to the side of the road safely journal entry 9 i am able to start the truck again and drive another while before it turns off again i m now only 20 mins away from my destination and im not giving up if its the last thing i do im getting this load to its destination i ve now cranked this thing over enough times that i could probably forge a blade on the starter but luck has it that the final stretch into town is all down hill yay throw it in neutral and coast into the city i blast my horn and coast powerlessly through red lights dodging traffic and jumping curves i look like a boat without a crew heading directly for the shore journal entry 10 i can see the building i m almost there i m coasting much much slower now that the terrain has leveled out the truck won t even start now its toast im about 30 feet from the buildings entrance and moving at a speed of about 5 7 old ladies with walkers are getting better torque ratios then my truck i finally land right next to the door unable to start the truck im not going to be able to back it in manually so we will take a gimme on this load this may be bad for my business but i can personally suggest you don t hire anyone from marauder trucking
