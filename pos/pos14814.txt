2021 early access review this game is really fun 2x as fun since they added workshop support lots of variety in mods you don t need a super computer to run it my pc is mid range 1660 super and ryzen 5 3600 and i get 60fps on high graphics 75 render scale 1080p edit previously this review complained that the game forced you to play campaign mode before sandbox they added an option to skip campaign mode so now i am happy
