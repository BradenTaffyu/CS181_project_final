2023 actually genuinely think this is incredible buying this completely blind with all the dlc and gubbins was the sensation of having the most heavy game of all time airdropped directly onto me flattening me like an ed edd n eddy gag immediately evident in its years of careful tuning through content and quality of life updates on top of the sizeable season pass extra facilities and continents such a behemoth of moving parts would otherwise have felt mismatched insurmountable and offputting were it not for the way these mechanics are eased and tutorialised through story context i had a session where i felt like building an airship for my fleet and learned that i had to travel to the arctic go on a perilous expedition to save a stranded soul lost in the pale archipelago carefully manage my campaign s dwindling heat and health to best a gargantuan iceberg all to find a hydrogen vein i can transport halfway across the world it keeps happening i keep setting short term goals only for the floor to fall out from under me and suddenly i m playing a completely different game i m terrified of what will happen to me if i open a restaurant for my capital trust believe in the sheer industrial might of ubisoft triple a to cram a city builda to the gills with enough varied emergent content adorned by absolutely luscious sunkissed gouache presentation that i forget that i m essentially doing admin tending to a blooming orchard of stacking intercontinental production lines all the while receiving affectionate telegrams from a actually named willie wibblestock entering first person mode at key milestones in my nation s development to see a downright adorable early 00 s pc game looking simulation of my beloved townsfolk livin their bestest lives i can afford them it s so nourishing yom yom
