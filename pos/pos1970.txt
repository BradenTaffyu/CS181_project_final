2022 7 0 expansion review from a completely new player s perspectivepros dual class system is a great idea my favourite addition to the game this is amazing as you don t have to grind so many characters to play multiple classes its great for diversity in case you re getting bored of a particular play style or prefer different classes for different in game activities pvp or pve a lot of people are mad because you cannot combine the two classes together however i find that each class is already quite diverse and has a great range of abilities mashing two classes together i personally think would be a mess and create significant in balances and pigeon hole a single meta build right now there are multiple meta s and classes are well balanced for pve and pvp loadouts is a great idea especially when you want to switch class specialisations or classes altogether separate storyline to a class is a great idea content is a lot of fun and i m having an amazing time playing it s the first mmo i ve played in years that i m not rushing to the end game combat feels amazing for a tab target system it feels so impactful and engaging overall performance is perfect not hard when the graphics are out dated companions are amazing and powerful i love how they enable you to play solo in this game in case your friends are offline or are just a solo player in general at first i was against the class re work balancing new ability tree however after a few more hours playing i can honestly say it s an amazing idea a lot of people are mad because they are no longer insanely over powered with an endless arsenal of spells abilities but i believe it creates balance and fairness across the classes it also makes it feel like you are really customising creating a build for your character because you need to select which passives and abilities you will find most beneficial to your play style before the update i could have every heal stun cc aoe single target etc ability on my bar as i wanted whereas now i need to decide carefully what pathway my class will go down i love the story missions i force choke and use lightning on everyone i can and my companion absolutely froths it i am the galaxy s biggest sadistic psychotic hole the legacy system is a big yes in a game where you will definitely create multiple characters it s nice to have a cross character progression system cons ui needs a serious re work it looks horrible the foundation layout design is perfect however it is ugly the amount of gameplay content added with this expansion was dismal most are saying 2 hours worth upgrading end game gear is too difficult and shouldn t be so much of a grind the developers need to seriously adjust the end game gear grind before it s too late items in cash store are way too over priced there are current issues with the dual class system that need to be patched overall graphics aren t too bad however it is 2022 and they need to be updated legacy level xp is way too slow and the prices of legacy benefits are way too high my character is bugged and is not eligible to que for group pve content i have tried everything to fix this caution this is my personal opinion as a fresh player with barely any idea of the game or understanding of its systems and gameplay before the 7 0 expansion
