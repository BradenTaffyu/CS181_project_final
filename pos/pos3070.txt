2017 early access review after playing this game for around 74 hours with many friends i can say without a doubt that this game is a fantastic rpg with great characters and deep exploration there are a few bugs here and there but that is to be expected with a game in its alpha stage i love this game and i even purchased it for two of my friends which they are addicted to now i would highly reccomend this game to all rpg fans and to any gamers for that matter pros fantastic musicgreat strategic gameplaygraphics are cleanfor being only act 1 story is well fleshed outgreat teamplay and multiplayer experiencegreat opportunity for role playing steep gameplay consequences seriously cons occasional game breaking bugs save often memory system needs to be over hauled gear being attribute locked can be frustrating at times
