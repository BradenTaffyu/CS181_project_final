2016 product received for free yes sorry i assume you were asking whether you should get this game i assume you like 4x and have a pc that can run it since you were looking at the reviews and all you need to know on that front is yes you should stellaris takes paradox s grand strategy feel into space and does it really well giving you a good deal of customisation of your race including importantly ethics that strong influence how you interact with other race spiritualists don t like materialists and no one likes a xenophobe if i were to give it a score out of 10 personally i d like to give it a 9 but i can see a strong argument for an 8 based on a few bugs unfinished features and gameplay plateaus that i am sure paradox will fix fill in a timely fashion it s a great game the only main issues are some bugs mostly pretty minor so nothing to mention compared to most releases these days and a fairly passive ai who plays war much more defensively than they could and a mid game plateau where little of interest happens unless you are playing a very militaristic expansionistic empire additionally it is worth noting that the revolt feature particuarly important to slaves and races dependant on them has not been implemented due to lack of time right now you can enslave away without fear of slave revolts and it is disappointing that this feature was cut froim release even if paradox do intend to roll it out soon after these are issue i have faith will be filled based on paradox s previous titles faith based on evidence should have probably used a different word oh well and the game itself is still incredibly fun even for these failings now something i have to sing massive praise for paradox for doing is the accessibility stellaris is incredibly easy to get into there is a small advisor bot who is helpfully voiced and is even amusing on occasion who asks how much guidance you want when you start your first game this alone with the early game missions that walk you through some basic empire growing steps really helps push new players in the right direction if you have ever had issues getting in europa universalis iv or crusader kings ii you are fully justified those paradox games offer no manual no tutorial no guidance and are downright obscure at times apart from paradox s ever helpful dedication to tooltips which i love stellaris however just works you can pick stellaris up and play no youtube guides or lps needed although you d be remiss if you didn t watch my excel ahem where was i stellaris is likely to be the paradox gateway drug for players new to their titles if you love 4x or paradox games then this is certainly the game for you does it have some flaws sure but not too major and ones i do believe will be fixed in the near future does it have some bugs sure the lack of upgradeable warp drives on troop transports is particularly egregious but these are issues that will be gone within the month most likely and paradox has a long history of supporting their titles with updates fixes and optional dlc get it ee p s yes i focus on negatives more than i should with great games but that s because i want them to be perfect so bad
