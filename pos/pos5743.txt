2022 i ve been a massive fan of mnb since the first before it was on tsteam i waited patiently for 10ish years between warband viking conquest and this it s a good game but feels like a fancy re skin with a few extra features and revised map i know there s more than that but having soaked up every drop of earlier iterations it doesn t feel like much new so why the recommend each previous game has booned due the modding community and the upcoming full release w workshop integrations gonna be sick ultimately none of that possible if they didn t make the game in the first place they may miss the mark but f k if they didn t make a solid few games with great combat mechanics and a decent world
