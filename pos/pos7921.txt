2015 early access review this is a very enjoyable game the devs have released many updates and it seems to have a very promising future though it is a good game if you are looking specifically for a racing game this is not for you yet as there is no career mode or organizable races the physics are the best i ve ever seen in any game that i have played overall i give this game a 9 5 10 as it shows much potential to grow into something much bigger update with the new career modes and track generator this game is even more enjoyable
