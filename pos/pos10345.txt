2023 purchased assetto corsa competizione a week ago and have already put 38 hours into it i m playing on a 27 1440p monitor with a thrustmaster t300 gt and included pedals mounted to my desk having so much fun that i nag my friends about coming over to play it has got my daydreaming about buying new gear and a proper rig even though i certainly don t have neither the cash or space for it i don t have that much experience with other sim racing titles so i can t really comment on how authentic it feels but it s a huge difference between this and arcade racers such as forza horizon and need for speed what i can say however is that even on my little setup it is very immersive sound and graphics are very nice and the cars behave on track as i would expect them to compared to the racing line hugging rubber banding ai from titles like forza horizon the ai is much better can t comment on multiplayer though because i m still learning how to not be a wrecking ball near other cars would i recommend this game yes absolutely even just practicing doing hotlaps and racing against the ai is incredibly fun
