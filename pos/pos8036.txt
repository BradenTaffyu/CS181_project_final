2021 early access review this game is absolutely incredible the cars are almost like in real life and i am not only talking about crashes the cars work in a realistic detailed way which is just amazing never have i been so grateful before to give developers money like when buying this on top the price is a steal for this game if you want this game but you aren t sure take it
