2023 in sum its a good game i loaded up company of heroes 2 and played a round carefully looking at the game before loading coh3 it s on par with coh2 in a lot of ways and even fixes or adds some features but it did feel strange the first few missions did not do a good job in convincing me that it was worth it frankly i expected to be wowed with the refinement and even further additional detail in graphics and special effects like they had brought with coh2 but really it just feels close to the same there are differences but it s not having me go wow the additional campaign map is interesting but i somehow probably would have preferred they spend that time refining adding additional commander abilities and wowing me with the sequel than adding this new layer for single player is it worth buying i think so but probably at 30 40 would be stretching it i got it for 42 and i was still on the fence but i really liked coh2 and i m enjoying playing coh3
