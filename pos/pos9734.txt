2016 early access review do not be fooled by the early access header on this store page this game has more content than most full releases this is the dwarf fortress with a user friendly interface that you ve been waiting for your whole life let s get the flaws out of the way first since those often have more of an impact on whether you buy than the pros 1 there is no z layer you cannot dig downward or build upward to be fair this would be impractical for people in the situation the game s plot takes place in but the z layer is a big part of dwarf fortress and certainly bears mentioning 2 the world is somewhat less complex than dwarf fortress there are obviously no elves or vampires or demons enemies are limited to humans tribal through futuristic and robots 3 the graphics only get about a c or b in the current state it s reminiscent of prison architect but with slightly less polish excellent for an early access build however that said i was a kickstarter backer and have at no point been disappointed with the game s releases or pace of development the game has never once crashed on me even in the very first builds i played there has been at least one update every month sometimes multiple even the very first initial alpha build released was a fun game albeit with very little content and that was only entertaining for a few hours and there has been a massive amount of content added since then mod content is already available and has been since a very early alpha build if every kickstarter game got this good this quickly early access wouldn t have the bad reputation it has today bottom line if it looks like fun to you it will be this early access game is better than most indie game final builds tynan the creator could have easily sold it as early access last year and the fact that he s waited this long says a lot about how he plans to approach development he didn t go for the quick cash grab and made sure to have a complete and entertaining product before he sought any money from non kickstarter backers i have a great deal of confidence that this game will continue to receive significant and exciting content development for a long time to come
