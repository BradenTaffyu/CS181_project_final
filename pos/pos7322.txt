2016 all in all a very nicely done us followup to euro truck simulator 2 probably could have been a little better researched though afaict there s no 80 mph limits outside texas and some of the signage is a little funky with freeway construction zones having noticably last minute signage compared to the real world a few of the interstate freeways have intersections this is basically not something that exists in real life save for a few farm access points and these have been mostly been changed to ramps even if they only serve one farm at this point but it wouldn t surprise me if this gets worked out in a later update
