2017 spent two months debating whether i should spend this much money on a game i would spend twice the money to experience this game again for the first time haven t even touched multiplayer dnd mode yet as a longtime fan of rpgs this is not just the greatest rpg i ve ever played it is in the running for the best single player experience i have ever had on pc everything you do seems to have a meaningful impact on everything you will do next after 30 hours of gameplay i had to stop reloading quick saves and accept my decisions divinity 2 rarely presents you with black and white moral choices and a simple slip of the tongue will see you losing loved ones fast the combat is challenging in a good way it allows you to customize your party completely and make logical and creative decisions in combat that you don t really expect to work but then they totally have an effect you weren t expecting that is why this game is perfection every time i pushed at the borders of the game to see if i could get away with something i realised the border wasn t there so i pushed harder and got more creative i have a man who can speak to animals and i highly suggest you take the perk that allows this asap in game because it opens up a huge depth to storyline i now treat chickens and squirrels with the same respect as i do any other npc i speak to the ghosts of the dead and they present me with a lot of moral decisions how far will you spin your moral compass to become godly powerful who will you grow close to only to realise that at any moment they might stab you in the back or even worse that you will have to choose to lose for the sake of the greater good 14 10 would sneak a peek at lizard royalty having sex in a caravan again x
