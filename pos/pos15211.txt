2020 i played every popular big racing game out there froza horizons gt s all nfs s grid juiced dirts and etc this is the ultimate drifting game best drift feeling overall great car customization and tuning great balance between arcade and simulation suitable for all control devices cheap in comparison to similar games yes some aspects are lacking like proper campaign player progression ranked races or some definitely worthy cars but this seeming lack of content doesn t make this game shallow drifting itself is the content here and this is exactly the right reason to buy it
