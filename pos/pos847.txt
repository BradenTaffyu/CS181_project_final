2022 it s fun to play both on multiplayer and on single player i find it s a great way to destress and pass time but by far my favorite thing about this game is that i have now created a character called john who is a menace to stardew valley we ve made an entire storyline for him he acts different in co op and singleplayer and we ve passed it as two different universes it never ceases to entertain me
