2021 fallout 4 is good and i personally think it received a lot of unnecessary hatred especially from the new vegas circle jerk if it isn t for all the unfair treatment that fallout 4 received i would not even consider writing this review to clarify i have spent about a few hundred hours since the launch of this game playing a pirated copy but i felt it was only right that i supported the developer by buying this game or any other games for that fact buy legal copies guys support the devs so do not let my low playing hours deceive you i will split my review into a few sections skills and perks dialogue system rp many argue that the dialogue system is watered down and i agree the four options do not give you a hint of what you re about to blurt out but the dialogue system was never the main problem if you noticed most dialogues in fallout really do boil down to this agree disagree inquire leave the main problem is the removal of the skill checks this is bad if i role play as a medic can i use my medical skills in persuasions no in fact most skills can only be categorized into scavenging trading or combat yes it is watered down and i don t stop people from on it gameplay as a veteran in both fallout 3 and fallout new vegas i will assure you that gameplay in fallout 4 has been improved a lot the enemy are no longer just bullet sponges with high damage the combat ai though a bit buggy has seen significant change humanoid opponents will take cover and sometimes retreat to heal up ghouls are now much more intimidating than it was lying in ambush zigzagging to dodge your shots and makes unexpected dashes and sprints they are no longer just a reskinned humanoid melee combatant now they are actually something better deathclaws are no longer enemies that are just stupidly tanky melee fighter they can sling cars at you and when trying to close the distance yes they will zigzag like the ghouls robot enemies now also have various means of hurting you capable of taking you at range while charging and attacking you with melee weapons and if their offensive weapons are disabled they would self destruct to try to take you with them i ve read players who are pretty dismissive of the gameplay but i disagree the combat and exploration is literally half of the game and i dare say that it is outstanding in that department don t even get me started on settlements and weapon and armor customization they are superbly done but they are not crucial to the main quest so you can forgo them if you want to environment and world building the environment and the world that was built was good every single houses piece of furniture and items have been placed with purpose they re a visual story of their own your map is not just a bland empty land with points of interests scattered across instead you get random encounters or explorable ruins downtown boston gets especially condensed as you continue to play the game cramming dozens of points of interests in just a small area each with their own purpose and sometimes with their own unique quests writing the main quests of this game is rather straightforward if a bit cliched there s a few factions that you can support the minutemen local militias that you can build up into a significant powerhousethe brotherhood of steel militaristic fanatics that hoards pre war technologiesthe railroad spy like organization that stood against the institute the institute a mysterious highly advanced organization with ambiguous aims everyone s boogeyman this is where i think fallout 4 faltered a bit i would love to have gray areas or more moral ambiguity in the story between the main factions but in most cases it makes no sense that they could not work together and that their goals are mutually exclusive some of these factions objectives are not morally ambiguous you can t really have much of a debate they re just plain wrong but the quest design themselves are superior even compared to the previous fallout titles the railroad had you sneaking around communicating in secret codes the brotherhood let you ride a helicopter while you use the door gun to spray bullets at enemies at fort strong to soften them up before they drop you off in the hotzone there is really a lot of faction defining moments along the faction quest lines the side quests of this game are rich and while there are no lack of mundane fetch quests or radiant quests there are certainly memorable moments and varieties in side quests there were some that allows you to partake in shady businesses bobbi no nose or save a stranded chinese nuclear submarine yangtze or roleplay as a comic book hero the silver shroud quests these quests are filled to the brim with production value companions companions are superb in fallout 4 they are easily one of the best part of the game they are not just a hired gun that follows you around like a generic npc and shoots stuff for you they have their own personality they have their own agenda they will join in conversations as you were talking to other npc providing their own remarks at the situation some companions like it when you are generous others like it when you act a bit more selfish than usual you can always find that companion that fits your playstyle and sometimes companions gives you personal quests that explained their pasts or motives their random taunts when you pick up junk when in combat or when you are approaching a point of interest it is just so much less bland than it used to be sound design and voice sound design of fallout 4 is excellent the voice acting is especially immersive now with more realistic character gestures and facial reactions gone were the times when you are just taking to a mannequin with moving mouth yes 3 and nv they actually smile and frown properly now yes its still ugly at times but ultimately i think the whole is better than the sum of its parts the little gestures they make along with the expressions used in their voice makes it a very immersive experience it s the little things the voices actors do not get enough credits nick piper hancock all of them are memorable not only because of their well written characters its the superb voice acting that sells it the music in fallout 4 is great combined with visuals it really makes an impression on you the entrance of the prydwen to the commonwealth is the one of the most memorable fallout moment that i ve lived through in no small part because of the music there are also good songs on the radios or you can listen to the silver shroud radio drama it is a must listen experience i think the entire story took about half an hour to listen mods fallout 4 can be even more fun with mods however i think that mods should not be considered in a review about this game only the credits should go to the modders conclusion it s a good game the production value is certainly there we cannot and should not take it for granted every single one of those meticulously crafted side quests a big map that is actually fun to explore all these little encounters where a raider was mourning at the grave of his dead friend etc the devs actually takes time and effort to build them and i thank them for it people will argue that the game is buggy yes the rp element is watered down yes the game engine is aging yes the main story is not engaging and does not have real consequences i disagree but understandable wasted potential i disagree but understandable this game is mediocre i disagree but understandable but if you think this game is absolute trash no get the f out there are games more deserving of this title and i will not stand idly by while you discredit everything else this game did right
