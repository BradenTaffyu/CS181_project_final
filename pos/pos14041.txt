2018 early access review great game but for an early access game this game is really great it is stable looks polished runs on linux no bugs so far hard but not sadistically so i e it plays like dwarf fortress light the 2d sideview basebuilding reminded me immediately of an old game called wiggles which is even older than dwarf fortress i was pleasantly surprised that at first the difficulty was not quite as sadistic as dwarf fortress one thing that i did not like after seeing how seriously the game took physics was that some parts of the asteroids will always be hot for no reason at all even with no replicants near it no pipes animals or plants some areas will be well over 30 sometimes even over 40 other areas will mysteriously be cool even if they are right in the middle of your base now for my big grief after playing for a while and reading several guides online i realized something you cannot reach an equilibrium in this game heat will always pile up no matter what water will always run out no matter what ironically its not oxygen that becomes a problem it would be really nice if this could be fixed before the final release certainly in a closed system like an asteroid water is not lost even the sweat that evaporates off the replicants has to go somewhere having a humidity condenser would be one solution for the heat radiative heat exchangers hot side in outer space cool side inside would be a solution
