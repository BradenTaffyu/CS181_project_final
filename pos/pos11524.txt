2023 early access review i started playing this in 2023 so i dont have as many grievances about the changes as long time players do so if you come into this with an open mind its a very fun game especially with friends if you dont like slow progression and building up your characters skills then this may not be for you you start out with next to no skills and getting them are kinda rough but once youre character is well built its alot easier graphics are decent enough given how interactive the world is also base building is a strong suit for this game in my opinion my main complaint would be that if your doing a little too well the game seems to kinda screw you over randomly like sending a hoard in broad daylight all in all i still recommend it
