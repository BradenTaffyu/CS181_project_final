2022 the closest we ll get to kotor iii still fun to play from time to time one of the best mmos on the steam platform nice to see it s still going strong and gathering new players everyday i love running around with my different chars doing questlines and trying new gear you don t get this feeling from any other online game also most of the content can be done for free you can always get the dlcs later you can spend several hours in this game and still not scratch the surface i recommend at least trying it you may get addicted
