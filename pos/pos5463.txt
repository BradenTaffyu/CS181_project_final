2017 early access review phenomenal writing truly unique and original setting rich with lore total character customizability and freedom of choice brutal punishing difficulty that revels in killing you over and over again so you can start again with a better understanding of what it takes to survive in the harsh unforgiving world of qud be a teleporting mind reader or a four armed sword wielding behemoth with horns hack off your enemies limbs and bludgeon them to death with them or slice off their face and wear it as a mask put on mechanical wings and fly above the battlefield hosing your enemies with a tank fed flamethrower or do the same thing as a mutant with your own organic wings and the ability to shoot gouts of fire from your palms chisel through grainy sandstone walls with a pickaxe or superheat metal with fire until it s reduced to a puddle of molten slag overwhelm your enemies with psionic attacks that render them little more than jabbering disoriented cretins that stumble and trip over their own feet gather liquids to concoct your own tonics and remedies from ancient texts or play around with them to see what happens if you mix a little of jar a and jar b get infected by fungal spores and grow glowing tendrils on your back contract a disease that makes your tongue swell and rot away leaving you only with the dialogue option of nnnnnnnnnnn douse yourself with your remaining supply of fresh water to put out your flaming clothes get sucked into a rip in the space time continuum and ejected at an unknown location miles underground with no light source find yourself hunted by interdimensional psychics hell bent on ending you at every turn this game is not for the faint of heart but if you have a shred of imagination do yourself a favor and get this game endure the initial learning curve and accept that you re going to die a lot trust me it s worth it
