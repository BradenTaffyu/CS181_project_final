2021 early access review when i first played caves of qud to be honest i found it rather mediocre and the most interesting part was trying out different mutations then i simply put down the game and was done it occasionally coming back to it whenever i was bored with other games so i will start out by saying this game isn t for everyone but then i came back to the game with a different mindset and fell in love with it this isn t a game where you will stomp over everything and eventually beat the final boss if that s what you re looking for this isn t the game for you this is a real unforgiving apocalyptic world with the simple goal of surviving as long as possible and getting stronger in the process you will be confused when starting to playing caves of qud having no idea what to do or explore of course you ll also won t have a clue about any of many buttons and even basic interactions will be confusing but i ll assume you ll willing to get past the initial learning curve and maybe look up tutorials if you are still interested in the game the game is difficult in many ways as the basic starting quests are deadly without preparation and leveling beforehand caves of qud is an inherently unfair game and that s part of what i love about it life is difficult in this world and it s near impossible to survive if you go exploring but you still need to explore the only way to survive in this world is to learn from your mistakes balancing risk and reward there will be times that you enter a map and instantly die to an npc s bullet or attack every monster is dangerous and will chase you down and kill you if you aren t careful however you can also gain the ability to be completely overpowered and rampage among maps instantly killing everything on the screen perma death makes those every situation tense and more interesting as it teaching you the value of survival of course you can turn off perma death in the options but i personally would only use that option for learning about the game permanent death teaches you to do everything that can improve you chances of survival is important and faction reputation can be extremely valuable to avoid those instant death by random impossible to beat npc s running away is an extremely valid option and extremely necessary in many situation instantly dying to npc teaches you the necessity of caution when exploring zones getting swarmed by monsters teaches you to have an exit strategy dying to a straight up fight with an average level enemy teaches that you cannot blindly attack or put yourself in situations without a retreat every death is a lesson the only question is whether you ll understand and learn it slowly you ll learn how to survive in this harsh world don t go into deep into random ruins never take unnecessary risks curiosity kills the cat and adventurer the look feature is your best friend fall in love with it at 60 health you need to start considering retreating from the combat etc overall i really like this game and love to recommend it to everyone but i also know it s not for a mainstream audience as it requires a certain amount of persistence to learn and specific mentality to enjoy it
