2023 i dislike turn based games the combat often feels like it has no weight and is just a chore to get through i also dislike dialogue heavy games because it often feels so dry and is also a chore to get through this game is immune to both of those problems the combat is incredibly satisfying and the dialogue is rich just like the world around it all i want is more
