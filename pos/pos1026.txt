2023 early access review alright ima be absolutely clear this game is not for e v e r y o n e have you read that properly now lets proceed the game is for a very niche audience mostly for those who appreciate the little details and very atmospheric tone in an absolutely giant map that would take around a in game day bout an hour to walk to the next nearest significant town the loot can be as scarce or abundant as you want should you wish to mess about in the settings the multiplayer is pretty good but can be awkward or janky slightly buggy with a server with many mods or high player count i should also add that bugs are hard to find unless you are really trying hard to find them personally i haven t found any game breaking bugs and if there are any you d probably have to go out of your way to find them i wouldn t trust the cars tho multiplayer does strange things alright the game has been in early access for an admittedly longer time most would like and still isn t done yet but do not let that dissuade you from trying it out as there is many activities and shenanigans you can find yourself in such as spawning in a house accidentally pressing q and find yourself fighting a rather large group of your friendly next door neighbours with a spoon or modding the absolute s out of the world and live in an overgrown ruined city with scarce resources and a horrific deadly winter or just messing around with friends in the detailed zomboid infested state of kentucky i d like to point out that the game is very friendly to modders with the workshop filled to the brim with an abundance of fun stupid and hardcore addons for those who feel the game doesn t have spice for their taste if the guns are subpar in your opinion there be a mod for that if you dont feel the car mechanics are complex enough yep there s a mod for it the combat feels too clunky for you then i d frankly just have to diagnose you with a serious case of skill issue lol i mean seriously it s just holding right click and hitting the poor zomboid with a crowbar or something of the like let me be absolutely clear this is not a average shoot em all up kinda zombie game its a isometric survival simulator that forces you out of your comfort zone and actually treats its zombies like zombies and gives them the proper respect they re deserve meaning they are numerous and legitimately dangerous you will be thrown into sticky situations whether by starvation bathroom zombie raves you weren t invited to and the cold and desperate cruelty of winter with the fun being there is little to no hand holding you simply exist to exist in this world with no goals other than making your own tale on how you inevitably died to a blunder you ve made in a unfair world be it a bite you ve got from a looting run by a random zomboid or going through a broken window a story up and getting a nearly life ending leg fracture the game tells you this is how you died and lives up to that statement at the end of your tale you will die this is simply how the cookie inevitably crumbles all of your characters time spent alive your time looting from the remnants of knox country your countless near death experiences will fade either by swiftly being taken by the horde or struggle enduringly to hold on until making a tragic blunder then before you know it you ve become a new character one with an entirely different backstory and traits searching your old broken down safe house and finding a familiar figure banging on the door turned into a hollowed out body without a soul in it this is a hard game you w i l l die at every stage of your play through at some point even if you are a veteran at this game some might find this game flawed but then this game might simply not for you some may be angry at the unfairness of this game and want to go out action packed guns blazing like all the other average zombie games out there but i should remind you that the game is only as fair to you as you want it to be don t be like the people who leave negative reviews if the game simply is too hard or not their type after all you have full control over the rules the world abides by this is the proper sandbox experience after all edit why is everyone liking this it aint even that good
