2017 i m not one for leaving reviews but i feel this game deserves some praise while the game isn t perfect i feel the amount of negativity surrounding other reviews isn t a fair assessment of the game there are some loyal passionate and long time customers of the franchise civ v being regarded as such a fantastic and well balanced game shouldn t cause negative reviews for the newest installment in the series i think the developers made some fantastic changes to the game while sticking to it s roots districts are an interesting addition to the game and i like the way builders are used in this installment the technology tree and it s eureka moments add another layer of strategy not found in it s predecessor some of the government policy cards could use some balancing as i often tend to use the same over and over however as i ve played with other civs and altered my playstyle i find myself using cards that i hadn t in the past sure the ai behaves a bit odd and is something that can be easily beaten as you settle in to the new mechanics they also have some strange behaviors these are not game breaking issues and something that i m confident that will continue to be balanced in future patches i honestly think these minor annoyances are the reason for the negative reviews just because something isn t perfect doesn t make it bad patches have already been introduced to adjust ai behavior while in the meantime steam workshop mods have been opened up one of which is an ai improvement mod at the end of the day the game still gives me that one more turn feeling i ll make a mental note that i want to wrap things up and 2 hours later i m still playing if that isn t the qualifier for a solid game i don t know what is
