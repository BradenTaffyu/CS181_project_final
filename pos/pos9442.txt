2021 assetto corsa has been a key component in keeping the sim racing community active throughout the last 7 years although similar games within the genre may have been more appealing and user friendly compared to assetto this has to be the finest sim racer i ve ever laid my hands on transitioning from the earlier days of gran turismo and forza motorsport franchise assetto corsa is one of the most community based sim racer on the market by default the vanilla version of the game contains a strong variety of vehicles and tracks for everyone to dabble in whether you re an open wheeler king a gt class master or a street car specialist the provided contents will have those who loves cars but don t have nearly enough money to own them in real life have a time of their lives if you came from the days of modding rfactor then this game has taken that aspect to a whole new level being the strong foundation the physics engine provides there is unknown quantities of modded contents out there that are available for download if you wanna drive around monza with a ford transit go for it if you wanna hot lap laguna seca in a double decker bus i m sure someone crazy enough has made the mod for you to do so the quality of the mods can vary depending on who it s made by but popular cars and tracks should be at least 70 true to its real life counterpart being a video game it will always have flaws the game itself almost been 7 years old is starting to show its sign in the visual department when it was first released it did not provide the high end graphical fidelity as forza and gran turismo of its time the ui design is very backwards and doesn t provide much excitement to the average racing game enthusiast the sounds in the game were ok but weren t the best day night cycle and weathers were not a feature that was implemented which have made ways into similar games of the genre if you were beginner into sim racing then it was certainly not easy to setup as the game is not very gamepad or keyboard friendly i must admit it took me a while to setup my wheel to how i want it to feel having said all of that a sim racing connoisseur like me has found no other games that is quite like ac on pc with csp sol and content manager installed i have the option to go from the foggy morning track day at the nordschleife to the sunny drift matsuri at ebisu finishing off the day with midnight high speed trials at wangan there is nothing more to say but a definite recommendation to those who owns a steering wheel and a powerful enough computer to run this
