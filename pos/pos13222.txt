2019 it s a great game like space like rockets like learning orbital mechanics if you answered yes to any of these questions this game is a game for you if you didn t it might still be a game for you it is not that hard to get the hang of but will teach you some real rocket science along the way in fact i am pretty sure this is how elon musk develops missions for spacex it is generally not a fast paced game unless you are about to do some unplanned lithobraking so it is quite relaxing all in all a solid 10 out of 10 i don t know what else to say
