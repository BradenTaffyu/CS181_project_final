2016 early access review this game is glorious and heartrenching at the same time excellent way to forge stories in my first game my group of survivors had crashlanded in a grassy open plain their lovely fuzzball of a husky survived bonding nicely with the oldest member of my motley crew who had lost much in the crash three weeks in the bandits attacked it was the husky that saw them first and bounded into action the others quickly noticed something awry and grabbed the few weapons that were at hand charging after the valiant pup sadly in the panic the failed to shoot straight and our noble canine took a serious thrust of a spear before the raider fell in a hail of poorly aimed bullets we had no way to treat the pup and with a heavy heart her companion trainer and friend through tears had to end her suffering she was a good dog never forget always remember excellent game for forging stories would highly recommend
