i absolutely love this game i didn t think i would play kaycee s mod and then i got hooked for 80 hours imo kaycee s mod is the real game and the first part is just a tutorial on how to play with fun easter eggs and an engrossing story if you like a difficult fun but not so punishing challenge this is the game the dark culty vibes are wonderful and the graphics are simply delightful i played the game via family sharing i bought the game for myself just to write a review and support the creators because i enjoyed it that much
