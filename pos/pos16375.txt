2023 early access review recommended for anyone who likes cars mechanical tinkering or has a case of 90s nostalgia my summer car is an utterly amazing game survive in 1995 finland earning money through odd jobs spend it on alcohol food and obviously car parts restore your father s 70s compact car take it to rally or to race or just about run your everyday errands in it the graphics look a bit ps2 ish and old at first glance but playing the game that is quickly forgotten as even visually it makes up for that with a good attention to detail as well as the way it kind of fits the faux retro vibe and 90s theme the gameplay is quite open and free but the same attention to detail is what makes it stand out among open world survival games the titular car is modelled well of course and within hours you will know all the parts bolts and bits of its engine as you assemble repair and diagnose it everyone who knows their way around an engine is a bit at the advantage here but frankly those who don t could learn a thing or two here the proper way to play my summer car of course is with permadeath where you start entirely over when you die i am convinced this game has done more for seatbelt awareness than decades of psas ever could
