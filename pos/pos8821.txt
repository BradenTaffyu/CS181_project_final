2018 i must say that i adore stellaris overall but in this case i think it s only fair that i review the base game is the base game a full experience at this point 2 1 sort of in my opinion stellaris plus utopia is the full game for single player purposes all other dlcs add some neat stuff but utopia is pretty fundamental i ve seen other people say utopia and all other dlcs are optional but in my opinion you probably wouldn t want to play much more than 50 100 hours of stellaris before buying utopia the other dlcs can be bought a la carte and in whatever order you like and you can play for hundreds of hours without them even though i think utopia is that important there are several advantages of selling base stellaris and utopia separately multiplayerbecause everyone in the lobby benefits from whatever dlc the host owns you can play the fully loaded game in multiplayer co op for only 15 on sale for the base game this also makes it really easy to get friends to join your multiplayer stellaris group as you can gift someone a stellaris key and they are completely good to go stellaris is a really great option for game groups as it s relatively easy to learn for its genre supports dozens of players scales well to larger groups as it is real time rather than turn based and ai can continue to play on someone s behalf if they stop participating in the group or can t participate in a given game night the low cost of buy in for the base game makes this all the more appealing trying out the game before investing a lot of moneywhile utopia is needed for ascension paths special civics synthetic dawn is at least equally good in this regard to be fair i m just saying the base game lacks special civics and any tall play styles which really need megastructures the base game allows all the basic empire types to be created and played with a typical wide play style you can get a decent number of campaigns out of the base game and learn how the early and mid game work mid late and late game can be substantially altered by dlc before committing to any dlc with a game like stellaris it really isn t possible to try it out in the 2 hour steam refund window however steam family sharing is a better way to try it out if possible especially if you share libraries with someone who has the dlc as you can decide for yourself what dlc is important and what you can do without the base game serves its purpose but you ll need utopia for the full single player experience
