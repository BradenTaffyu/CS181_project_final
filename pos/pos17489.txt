2017 please note that many of the negative reviews have large amounts of time played the reviews are based solely on the dlc prices while that is a valid concern it is a shame that other gamers will miss out on such an enjoyable game because of that on top of that ca creates free content such as the recent bretonnia patch which has been thoroughly enjoyable i haven t purchased all the dlc and my game does not feel poorer for it now that that s out of the way if i can talk to my fellow lover of shiny things out there you can play a fay enchantress on a unicorn a huge stompy tree with a sword and a wonderfully campy vampire queen in a gorgeous dress this game is great i ve beaten two campaigns and i still expect to get much more playtime out of the game i recommend it wholeheartedly
