2017 early access review after 31 hours at least 6 of them me being stupid and restarting my entire game just because i flipped the van over until i found the push mode i can safely say this is one of the best games i ve played this year the sheer number of possibilities that this game holds is staggering one of the only things that makes me sad is the empty beer bottles and other trash that despawns i should be able to pile them up in every corner of my house if i feel like it the driving is very nice there is an almost life like complexity to the parts more could be added but is very nice as is funny how the ferndale is the worst car to drive by far dying by falling inside a sceptic tank really gives you a new outlook on life definitely worth encouraging at this price warning it will be hilarious at first then tedious then frustrating then very frustrating then once your car is finished and runs you ll feel like you accomplished more in those short dozen hours than anything in any other game update 25 11 2017i still stand by my original review and then some the latest additions to the game have made it even more complete and authentic while keeping it s original charm games like this absolutely destroy any aaa title that s come out this year
