2020 i have been playing ksp since beta i take breaks from it periodically but i always get the urge to build more rockets and explore different celestial bodies granted i am a huge fan of space so it really appeals to me however the desire for exploration is satisfied through this game for anyone plus the kerbals are awesome it really is educational as well you can learn a lot about physics rockets and orbital mechanics through this game all in a fun way because it s so fun kids will even benefit from the educational aspects got the game for my oldest daughter who loves it and recently asked for books about rocket science she s 11 i believe that my interest in rockets and stuff played a role but ksp is what really pushed her to want to learn more highly recommend and can t wait for ksp 2
