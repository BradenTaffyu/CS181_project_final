2019 a review after having played for 175 hours as a native culture background player overall 9 2 10 art 9 5 10 music 9 8 10 strategy 9 10 gameplay 9 10 pros beautiful and precisely accurate design of art fascinating background music and sound effect attractive game system and great experience in a war battle cons lacking portraiture in contrast with other games with the same kind and the 3d models of them don t fit their portrait and more they look ugly to some extent the gender for da qiao and xiao qiao is wrong they are famous for their beauty in the three kingdoms period but in the game they are male and look lame in addition chinese people do not look like the appearance in the game it fell a little weird for this part please find references from koei game in the end the game is getting a little boring as you enter the late game for there are a massive cities to management and lot of trade to control with repetitive operation suggestions adding more portraiture and skills for the character and adding different backgrounds music for various influences please simplify the flow in the late game such as uniform the construction of city with auto management by the prime or magistrate adding a calculator input when the player is changing the trade the number expects adding water battle because many famous battles such as battle of the red cliff was fought on the river adding more geography constructions such as hu lao fort or qi shui fort because they were playing a very critical role in the ancient chinese battles offering a choice to the player to decide whether he or she needs to declare their emperor because the emperor was sensitive to the country in that time and it usually depended on right political time perfect situation and people s support it was common for a vassal to not to claim the emperor instantly for political considerations i am expecting a well balanced and more abundant gameplay system and if you do i ll buy them twice thrice again and again thank you for your efforts i have played the three kingdoms for about 700 hours it s a good game for me and the latest dlc is also nice despite it has so many bugs but bugs don t bother me too much my concern is it looks like ca has picked up mandate of heaven as the beginning of the three kingdoms and eight princes as the end of the story which is fair then start adding different dlc in between them to fill up the timeline and to tell complete the story which looks reasonable but in this way a player can t full experience the whole story once a time in the game from the beginning to the end instead they have been just put in different starting locations in the map and repeat the process of unification of china again and again in the end i m not satisfied enough with the experience and i think i will get bored if you follow this routine next in my view this separate narrative is fair in some ways easy to manage but it also breaks the continuity of the whole story the repetitive gameplay is a little tedious too i was wondering if you could connect all the dlc and their events all and integrate them with the gameplay in the future maybe after you have created enough dlc by following some guidelines in the game events will be triggered by achieving certain conditions in some ways then i can choose yes or no to trigger the event or ignore it i also can choose when and where i can step into the sandbox mode the logic between events is relative consistent integrated not just separate them in different dlc i do not appeal all factions will have this but at least make it happen on liu bei cao cao sun jian will be this will optimize the experience of gameplay great so the understanding of the story has improved a lot of players will love it the fiction romance of three kingdoms is a long epic wonderful historical novel and the story of liu cao sun is most attractive to the players your efforts will be worth or another easier solution for discontinuous events now dlc was separated by campaigns in a certain time of the three kingdoms period you can pick up all kinds of factions but lacks the depth of them what about independent dlc just made for only one faction like da wei shu han eastern wu yuan etc the dlc will focus on a few people s stories and their fate correspondingly it crosses a long time span has several campaigns and successive events from the faction s creation to its end before a short period many factions now a long period one faction is it feasible suggestion conclusion focus on independent factions dlc liu bei cao cao and sun jian sun quan etc sun quan actual build the emperor of wu and ruled his faction and wu state from 200 to 252 people believes more that he should be the representative leader of wu kingdom instead of sun jian if it s possible please put all their events together add some critical historical events integrate them with the gameplay in the end there s a large number of players who want to have full gameplay and full experience in the game now it s far from enough even new elements new portrait paintings are good not enough for they are unable to change the gameplay in addition there are some small wishes i wish to speak see if there are supporters 1 can we make the way of earning ranks titles more complex and more reliable especially to declare the king 2 can we release some independent dlc for zhuge liang and sima yi in the future they are especially popular among players who are acquainted with the story and the story itself is wonderful 3 can we add a new assignment lobby by putting a character who has lobby skills to another faction s cit if the lobby works the score of negotiation will raise and make it easier to accomplish agreements 4 can we add a jail system in the game 5 can we add an event for the married characters to have the chance to give birth to children who are able to inherit their parents skills and attributes
