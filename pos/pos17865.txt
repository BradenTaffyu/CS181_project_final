2023 update the dynamic campaign is now very fun to play and makes the game easily worth 40 just on its own i hope they expand on this formula and focus more on the dynamic and random aspect than on the pre scripted missions and i wouldn t think twice before getting the game now the enemy battalions are aggressive and invade your territory to take lands the battles are challenging enough that i actually risk losing sometimes even though i m pretty decent at the game they have changed it so that field battles don t start a real time battle but are autoresolved i think that they should allow you to experience field battles in real time maybe not always but at least occasionally i m considering getting the dlc just to replay the campaign on the hardest setting maybe when it goes on sale since it s a bit pricey i don t have any real complaints about the game just give it a go will ya had to get this game now to see how bad it actually is but no there is nothing that s unforgivably flawed about it that it would garner a mixed rating i m having a blast playing a single player campaign in an rts for the first time in a decade this says something i ve got only two real points of criticism to relic 1 please for lord s sake raise the max camera height 2 enemies should be a little bit more aggressive in the dynamic campaign as someone who s enjoyed coh since 2007 it s sickening to see so many self proclaimed fans committing a first degree murder to a pretty good game without even giving it a real chance to improve itself over the next months the comparison with coh2 reveals how entitled these people are all the more obviously campaign first of all coh3 features 2 campaigns out of which one is a lengthy dynamic campaign that lets you move around companies like a general on a wide theater of war which respects the player s agency and choices at launch coh2 featured one abomination of a campaign which was 100 scripted that it wasn t even worth playing they added the theater of war missions over the next years i also appreciate how good the combat ai is i m playing on the tough difficulty the ai will try to flank you and bring solutions appropriate to the defenses you set up like bringing a mortar or a tank against your emplacement instead of simply throwing their units at them factions and coh3 features 4 factions right from the get go compare that to coh2 which took its players hostage and forced them to buy the us uk and okw factions separately without even adding campaigns like coh1 did gameplay this is the same game at the core everything is pretty much the same with some extra qol features like auto replenishment of units at the base no game breaking bugs no visual glitches top performance etc etc giving this a not recommended just shows that you either have a crappy rig or a crappy personality screw you i m ashamed of being called a gamer because of whiners like you who think laying down some money gives them all the right in the world to defame insult and drive the hard working game devs to insanity
