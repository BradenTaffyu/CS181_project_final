2021 my favorite total war game currently pros diplomacy works really well compared to the other titles character focused with interesting lore duels are a great game mechanic color coding of generals and units leads to interesting army compositions battles just look amazing and the overall artstyle is just perfect romance mode is a perfect balance for me between historical and fantasy for people that like purely historical there is always records mode very interesting time period and setting being interested in three kingdoms and at least not entirely disliking asian themes names helps as a westerner but i am pretty sure this game can be interesting to anybody did not encounter any major bugs so far very polished game decent faction variety mechanics with good depthcons most dlcs are not worth it at all in my opinion unit variety is a bit lacking but makes sense and is good enough for meoverall highly recommended
