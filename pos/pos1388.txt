2016 early access review this is my first review on steam even though i ve been a member for 7 years that s why you should give this game a try i m a fan of builder games and zombies so when i saw a zombie game where i can build i had to have it i wasn t sure i would care as much for the gameplay but it definitely gets addicting i spent my first few tries in an easymode sandbox and still managed to die the graphics actually suit me great since i m an old school gamer and prefer it more simpler than newer games today have the action is pretty much the same no matter what you do but the way it goes down differs you could lose your focus and walk into a bathroom without paying attention and a zombie will lunge at you from behind the door you could turn a corner and walk right into a herd you could be bashing a zombie in the head with a shovel and think you re winning but a zombie out of your line of sight comes up from behind and you re now infected i once survived for 3 months and had stocked up on everything to outlive a lifespan and then fell from a roof i was building and died anyways why do i keep restarting after such heartbreak it must be a good game i am excited for more updates on this game we definitely could use more to build more items throughout and my most requested is different maps to explore i d love to not only have more maps to choose from but maps that edge to another map
