2019 this is one of those games where a fundamental change paid off unlike other total war titles this game is focused on diplomacy rather than the outcomes of the battles you are surrounded by nations on all sides and shifting alliances make conflict a dangerous gambit you are forced to negotiate like a human being rather than steamroll everything in sight with an army of heavy units the ais actually feel fairly responsive and you ll develop long term alliances with certain neighbors a key difference between this game and previous titles is that you ll almost never annex an entire faction in one war war is outright expensive and the longer it drags on the more the costs will weigh on you furthermore all nearby factions will watch the warring parties and the more devious ones might launch an incursion into your lands whilst you are occupied elsewhere this game is like a pit of hungry cobras in that it s a constant back and forth between you and your rivals you ll eventually begin to develop something of a mutual respect for certain enemies and you ll find that different enemies use different tactics in battle i d say this one is a winner
