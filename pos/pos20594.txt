2022 difficulty my 90 year old grandma could play it easy normal hard challenge mode dark souls give me god of war mode okay this will be controversial the game expects you to be alert and quick in your reflexes and make full use of the range of combat mechanics in the harder levels and the punishment curve at least in my own personal opinion is quite steep graphics ms paint bad meh graphics don t matter in this game good beautiful masterpiece music bad not special good beautifulbear mccreary has worked his magic in creating a score that fits the baritone of kratos voice and the atmosphere of pain perseverance and grit quite appropriately there are gentler sections when need be and fast strings and chanting vocals accompanied by brass during the more epic boss fights it s great and totally immersive story this game has no story like playing temple runners for the story it s there for the people who want it well written epic storysanta monica studios have always been known for telling a really gripping story throughout the history of this franchise and this gow is no exception grabbing the attention of the players right from the get go the game does expect you to do the basic homework regarding the background of kratos though and once that is taken care of the story has no lack of gravitas and nostalgia coupled with frequent stunning set pieces and consistent pacing i nominated this for outstanding story rich game for 2022 steam awards price underpriced perfect price could be cheaper overpriced complete waste of moneysony could have released it a bit lesser than 2018 pricing mere 10 rebate in 4 years seems a bit steep yet as far as substance is concerned the game strongly holds its value and is still a valid purchase requirements you can run it on a microwave average high end nasa computerthe pc port is near flawless and the early frame drops in wider areas and stuttering that i have encountered have all been or being patched actively due to the presence of custom frame rate capping and support for fidelity fx and nvidia dlss it does not take the cutting edge modern system to get a decent experience that said current or one generation old hardware can really portray the beauty of the colour palette and fluidity in the combat the to the fullest just for context i am using a ryzen 5600x 16gb 3200mhz memory and a 3070ti fe gpu and it has been buttery length very short 0 3 hours short 3 15 hours average 15 50 hours long 50 90 hours for completionist runs extremely long 90 110 hours no ending you can literally get lost in the map and not do any quests and still have loads of fun the pc playthrough is my third the two prior being the basic one and then getting my rear smacked in give me god of war difficulty in new game this run would have its focus on completing everything main side quests optional bosses in a single playthrough and by my experience 90 hours should suffice fun i d rather watch paint dry hard to enjoy repetitive actually pretty amusing ride of your lifeoverwhelmingly fun game that s it that s the description replayability it s a one time experience only for achievements if you wait a few months years definitely infinitely replayablethe game has some sections that you would need to revisit not having the right gear to unlock hidden regions and there are higher difficulty levels to explore in future runs the game recommends to save the hardest till at least the completion of a single run and then there s new game where you start with all accumulated gear and skills from prior runs that said it s a minor disappointment that although new game has fresh sets of armour it does not introduce fancier ways to take the enemies down worth buying no wait for sale yes
