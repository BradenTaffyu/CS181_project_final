2019 i m unsure why steam says i ve only played for 26 hours when i know i have more pros interactive community of characters some of which are romance ablecustomizable propertya slice of life amalgation of activities to occupy yourself withadorable pixel artcons slow to get the ball rollingtedious at certain pointslack of an obvious grounding overarching narrative although this can be a positive for those who detest being forced to play through a main questline at first i thought the game was a bit slow for my tastes in terms of pacing i m acclimatized to pvp games not to mention i decided to try this because i came from playing starbound and terraria on expert never having played a game in this animal crossing rune factory genre it took me awhile to start soaking it in relaxing and enjoying the little details speckled in here and there to really grasp what to expect it s simple it s pure it manages to remain innocent despite for instance coming with a crude alcoholic character included who has very raw things to say about his outlook on life i was also impressed that one of the characters shared my deterministic absolving worldviews that kind of depth is rare in a game and it s juxtapositioned well against the start of the game when characters seem a bit too cookie cutter flanderized until you get to know them more stardew s relaxing atmosphere makes it perfect for if you have an audiobook a youtuber or some kind of commentary playing in the background as there are moments when the game can feel monotonous such as when you re gathering resources modding stardew will increase its longevity tenfold unmodded i found i was already getting repeat dialogues early on but with a few mods here and there namely stardew valley dialogue expansion longevity the narrative series mal s rival heart events and mods such as part of the community you can bring more personality and life into the game if you re feeling romantic for a character s pixels you can grab an after marriage mod with more events for whichever character you have the pixelhots for it s also worth noting the world can feel a bit empty in some places so i d suggest grabbing sve or stardew reimagined to fill out the space with immersive decoration companion npcs or pet interaction can also help to kill that nagging loneliness when you re out adventuring and finally if you hate tedium make sure to grab the tractor and automate mods for factorization multiplayer is alright although it guts out a bit of the character interaction for the non host players another issue is that the modding community is not always informative on whether a certain mod will function in multiplayer or not be sure to check comment sections first and mod profiles second if you re really worried about a mod working in multiplayer i played some single player then attempted to have my friend join me only to find out that the furniture mods i was using weren t compatible with multiplayer and that all the time i had spent decorating my home would ultimately never be appreciated by that friend on top of that longevity a very popular mod incidentally taxes extra the more players you have making the mod too difficult and unplayable in multiplayer point is you ll want to be thorough on checking mods because you ll wind up annoying your friends if you share with them a modpack that s dysfunctional all because the author of a mod didn t bother to clarify immediately that it s untested for multiplayer this is more of a critique of the modding community than it is of the game itself it s more of a warning to people who want to haphazardly mod this game to death and then hop in multiplayer expecting fluid gameplay i can say without a doubt stardew is worth more than what i bought it for but it takes some effort to get deeper into the good content i d give it a try if you have the time to invest
