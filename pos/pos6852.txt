2019 as a person who got ats first this isn t hard to adjust for the most the truck customization is far more superior then ats due to the fact european truckers have a different culture then in america now the question which one is better ats or ets2 i say both if you got the money pick up both if you want the expansions wait for everything to go on sale or try finding some cheap ones through buyer beware you don t know if those keys are legit scs has lately been pumping up teases and updates for both games which gives them my respect and scs has also did the breast cancer awareness charity event an event that is for a good cost you ll probably ask yourself trucking games are boring what do you expect hardcore extreme trucking this game is relaxing for most people you re basically going on a virtual road trip so fire up your favorite playlist go in first person turn off the mirrors and gps and just rely on the dashboard and go haul your cargo i can tell you you ll be probably spending about 10 to 30 minutes configuring your truck for your personal use and building and organising your fleet to match it s nice to sit down from a hard day of school or work firing up ets2 or ats putting out some tunes and just dive yourself into the shoes of a trucker i can tell you though ets2 players in truckersmp are more dangerous than in ats players by the way trucks can t just be added they need to have a license in order to use it and it takes a long time complaining to them really doesn t help and like i said before scs is doing a lot of things new truck can wait or just get some mods
