2018 really upsetting to see the most recent reviews mostly negative i assume its mainly due to the controversy which occured not to long ago due to one employees comments and also the implementation of female generals i also dont agree with it because it breaks the historic atmosphere for me however im glad ca altered it so only factions that where known to have female generals leaders where effected alot of people say the political system makes no sense i find it works and is simple to understand keep the loyalty of your opposing political parties by paying them off every now and then appoint them as generals of your armies and navies so you dont lose influence after all how suss would it be if just your family party owned all the armies d would be great if we had more variation for character events i mean how many people must i punish for defacing the temple till it gets through to them xd civil wars can easily be avoided if you do right by your politics im curious though does the strength of the uprising army depend on the amount of influence they have in the court ill be binge playing this game until tw warhammer 3 release im just glad ca continued to support this game with updates and dlc abit costly though wait for sales i remember when this game was unplayable how different things would be if this current version was there for its release day dont take the reviews seriously buy this game if your sitting on the fence about it especially when its on sale you wont regret it
