2016 ok i m starting to think people confuse disappointing with terrible game this right here is far from a terrible game in fact it is a very good game and anyone who says differently is lying to themselves this is however the weakest title in the fallout series and that does need to be addressed this is far from the rpg that we had gotten in nv but it does address a lot of the problems i had with nv gunplay is much much better loot is much more exciting because we don t automatically know where the best weapons are and each play through is interesting because you don t know what you will get i recommend this game as a flying colors because it is a good game its just disappointing in between f4 and nv lies the perfect game in my opinion
