2019 pros lots of things to do pretty big community tons of addons tons of gamemodes tons of maps fun with friends or even by yourself very replayablecons i can t see anygmod is a must if you re looking for a game to play just make sure to have some friends playing with friends is just a way better experience than playing by yourself if you don t have friends that play gmod you can still hop onto multiplayer and probably make new friends there this game is also a very good game and you can see it in the reviews sure its old but there is still lots of things to do and that makes it replayable this game will probably fetch like at least 100 hours probably much more in my opinion 10 10
