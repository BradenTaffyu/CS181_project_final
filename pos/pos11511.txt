2022 early access review it took me a while and several false starts to get into this game but once i did whew it was easy to go deep currently can t stop playing and really enjoying the open world the progression and playing with a small group of friends the early game experience i m not gonna lie was a bit of a barrier i don t love horror games in the first place and the game puts on a lot of pressure early to learn all the basics fast and get your survivability up before the first nightfall when the zombles come out once you know how to do this it goes pretty fast but that first play through was probably appropriately stressful and terrifying once you get some momentum though and get the hang of the system it s quite awesome the game is so open and has so many options that it s easy to pull toward a play style that you like and spec out your character how you like the game is rife with spontaneous adventures there s always some new goal to get to the combat is fun and you live and die based entirely on your preparation and resourcefulness the survival aspect feels like survival in a zombie world the game forces you to scavenge for things and you learn eventually that the apparent garbage you re picking up can be turned into useful items the game is not without some jank however the block frame system is confusing until you get it the ui looks like it s stuck in the 1990s though you do get used to it surprisingly quickly there s some glitching with the models some strange animation delays that make certain actions sluggish and for some there might seem to be a lot of complexity there isn t really a story to speak of which is why it s nice to have some friends along to make your own adventures it s like minecraft in its open endedness with the gameplay focused on what you do in the world overall tremendous fun if you like deep survival crafting want some real zombies and are looking for a more mature experience with some indie jank thrown in i highly recommend
