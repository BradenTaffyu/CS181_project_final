2021 disclaimer i don t play many crpg s and am definitely not a hardcore rp er in general i never thought i d finish this game i finished a classic mode game maxing out side content with like 110 130 actual hours playing the game so i m torn i really loved the story the part i played in it and how it panned out incredible perception of freedom in this game it left me genuinely curious how the game would unfold had i made different decisions i think this game would appeal to sandbox gamers minus the open world but for me the type of freedom this game has often distracted from what i was doing in the story or my immersion in it there s a lot to tinker with if you re willing to immerse in the systems but i would have liked for it to be more focused on gameplay and tactics i really disliked how much looting and inventory management there is in the game there s gotta be a way to organize that and recipes and books and equipables better felt messy and time consuming to filter through and organize probably as a noob i just wish there were more guardrails or tips for effectively scaling with the difficulty of the game without requiring deep meta or wiki browsing i feel better prepared for the next crpg i play and for what it s worth i finished disco elysium around the same time and liked it better overall 7 10 the good there is so much to do the story factions on factions on shadow factions it was cool unraveling it all and finding gems of hidden context through side quests i do wish one of the big reveals towards the end factored into the ending or final decision more but ok side quests there are a ton of side quests many pretty deep the majority of which are rewarding and fun freedom you decide how you want to go about your quests and interactions kill sneak diplomat ignore it feels like these are all valid options spec you can build spec respec your party however you want at any point in the game skills stats class hair etc interaction you can talk to probably literally everybody and they ll all have something to say about their world and their lifethe bad there is so much to do spec there are so many attributes and skills and items and weapons they all really matter and i was getting destroyed in some of the more intense battles in the very beginning and the very end requiring me to spend a lot of time reloading or running around trying to figure out how to be better to do the thing i wanted to do pacing is up to you spending a bunch of hours deep diving side quests or shopping or managing your party sometimes feels necessary but it does feel like a rabbit hole i really felt the times i got trapped and spent my whole session in menus or backtracking my attention spills everywhere playing this game the ugly there is so much to do loot looting what feels like 98 of objects in the world is a bit of a double edged sword boxes vases shelves chests drawers corpses bags i mean the list of object types isn t that long but they re eeeveryywhere the lucky charm skill encouraged my aggressive looting for higher rare drop chance but this whole world of interaction drove me mad i certainly did it to myself but loot did feel like a massive distraction clearly just not a fan of excessive useless loot shopping was not into searching for specific shopkeepers to sell me the specific type of spells or weapons or armor i needed why are there so many why don t they have better signs why are they scattered all over the place it just adds to the time sink and running around aimlessly complexity there s little to nudge you towards good builds or good practices this is probably the other side of total freedom you do whatever you want but you also have to figure it out yourself this really cost me in the first 1 2 acts and then at the very end the last battle of the game was seriously impossible for me until looking up some good builds online and then spending a bunch of time getting better gear i spent 100 hours on this game i m getting my epic battle dammit also there s a crafting system in this game good luck
