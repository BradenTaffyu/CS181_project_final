2023 forza horizon 5 is a 2021 racing video game developed by playground games and published by xbox game studios first impressionmy first expectations of the game were based largely on the previous game in the series not anyone but the iconic forza horizon 4 unlike most people i was expecting exactly a game that was quite similar to the previous one with very slight improvements and it lived up to those slight expectations my first impressions when i got into the game were kind of mixed i certainly saw the improved graphics and i really liked how much fresher the game itself was based in mexico fh4 which was based in england was quite colder pros cons amazing range of customization exquisite attention to detail with gorgeous lighting so many races and challenges drivatars are unbalanced gameplayi m pretty happy with the gameplay itself whether i want to play singleplayer or multiplayer i know i can have fun playing either mode i want to pay more attention to the multiplayer however i spent quite a few hours in it and had quite a few good moments but like everything else there were some downsides i ve run into hackers in a few sessions but i ve seen people complain about their far more frequent occurrence i ve personally seen hackers quite rarely but it s not like they don t exist i ve also seen quite a few modded max level accounts and so on which is pretty ugly and unprofessional for a game of this level that aside the multiplayer is a wonderful place with room for everyone want pure races of various kinds there s horizon open for you prefer to drift there is a special place where all drifting competitions are organized or maybe you fell in love with the battle royale mod that was added in fh4 well it s here too so i guess there s something for everyone to enjoy achievementsthe game currently has 97 achievements you can do quite a few of them by going through the game s story as well as through the hot wheels dlc the ones you won t get by going through the singleplayer are pretty fun and show different details of the game that you might not notice unless you re focused on getting those exact achievements but i really think it s worth the try to be completed difficultyaside from the intro to the game you ll be able to alter your difficulty settings at any time in forza horizon 5 it pretty much depends on you you can either make the game very easy for you or very hard i suggest starting with the lower difficulties and gradually working your way up i know you ll see yourself taking more money as you raise the difficulty but you ll make a lot of money anyway just by playing and forget about watching your credits ignore them and you won t know when you have so much money that you don t know how you can even spend graphics art stylethe graphics are very beautiful so beautiful that they make you feel warm inside while looking at them and that big open world that you can roam around and explore the graphics are so good that a lot of players like to just set up cruises with each others drive slowly and enjoy what can i say about photo mode i ll let the pictures speak for me cruising a screenshot of forza horizon 5 by the shuttle pimp it don t scrimp it a screenshot of forza horizon 5 by the shuttle forza horizon 5 and oreo have teamed up to create the most playful car you ll ever drive a screenshot of forza horizon 5 by the shuttle soundtrackthe soundtrack of forza horizon 5 features over 100 songs available through six radio stations each with a different genre and host however i prefer to listen to my playlists on spotify but some people prefer the in game music and it ok so i don t mind it performancei had no problems at all game tested on cpu gpu ram i7 9700k box 3 6ghz asus rog strix rtx 2080 ti 2x8gb conclusionthe game isn t that new anymore and it gets discounted often so i think it s best to wait for a discount and when you see it get it right away the game is truly unique and worth your time
