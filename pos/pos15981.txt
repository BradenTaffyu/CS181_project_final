2014 early access review this game is well worth the money i picked it up on a recent sale for 10usd around early december 2014 if you like popular board and card games or if you just like to spawn my little pony figures and throw them around in zero gravity for some reason this is the best and practically only game to do it in if you watch a video you ll see that it s basically a physics engine with some tools to help you play board card games cards can stack you can right click and deal out cards to players you can shake cards or dice to randomize them you can flip cards upside down with the f key you can have a hand where cards are hidden even when face up and so on it took me a day to learn some of the keys and the proper way to manipulate objects so i don t go smashing things around and it took me a bit of time to learn administrative controls so i could take away the ability for players to flip the boards or even join games without permission sometimes this is good you can also press l to lock things down so they don t get moved and control if spectators can jump into your game and start throwing things around or if they have to wait for you to put them into the game if you think that people will just join your game and wreck it that happens but with the right privileges set it doesn t and even if someone does there is an undo button that works adequately you can also save the state of the game and there is an autosave feature and reload it if things get messed up or if you have to leave or someone drops and you want to continue later this also lets you set up a board game the way you like to start and then save the state so you don t have to keep doing that over and over you can import parts of one game into another game and then save it together too if you join someone s game and they have a cool looking 3d model you can save that to your chest and then pull it out anytime and anywhere you have the privileges to in a recent patch the developer of tabletop worked on a nat punchthrough method so you don t need to set up port forwarding to be able to host your games this doesn t work for some people and i still try to port forward so i don t have any problems lag can be an issue if you have a slowish connection i ve played with people from the us canada various parts of europe and australia players come from all over and some will naturally have bad pings even so i regularly play with people who have a 300ms ping and it works fine there is voice chat within games it is set to push to talk by default so you don t have new players with open mics annoying you there is a mute kick and ban feature the ban feature is especially nice since it remembers your ban list so that if you play the next day that person will still be banned recently the ban list was improved so it doesn t get reset when you reset your settings griefing is remarkably low considering how easy it is to grief and typically it happens when the host doesn t care enough to stop it it really comes down to finding some people who will play the games you want much like with real board or card games as far as the game selection goes i m pretty sure this whole thing is illegal but there are many top board games see boardgamegeek com that have cards boards tokens and dice models copied into the game check out the steam workshop for this game to see the options i heard a rumor that the developer of the game munchkin i m not a fan sent a cease and desist order to steam and all the munchkin mods were removed i would expect more of that in the future that being said it is not very difficult to create your own card decks boards pieces etc or find ones other people have made and then save private copies yourself the games on the workshop are actually playable and gameplay is not as frustrating as it may seem in fact since it s basically just a physics engine it is rather intuitive to use i ve tried board game simulator programs before and they had about 500 context menus you had to go through to do anything and they were impossible to use with this you may not know the most optimal way of doing things but you can easily figure out some way to do it you could even play mtg in this there s android netrunner too plus a whole bunch of great board games i played some simpler ones like king of tokyo cosmic encounters dominion forbidden island and one complex one eldritch horror which just takes a long time and they all worked great i also had a good game of 5 player chess which started off chaotic and very exciting and turned into a game of turtling so i created a sudden death player to finish up the game a new player on the board to replace a dead one starting with 16 queens really you can do just about anything you can play d d through here you can play all the classics poker black jack monopoly clue candy land tons of games are here and i would imagine more are on their way if you like board or card games at all or want to try some of the most popular board card games on the market today you really should pick up this game there is literally nothing that can compete with it biggest cons i ran into some bugs that are worth noting 1 on my first day i would be playing with a bunch of people and then everyone would lose connection this did not happen on my second day something may have been going on with their master server 2 somehow at one point in the middle of a long game i suddenly couldn t push to talk anymore when i restarted the program it worked again i m not entirely sure what happened there i was host so i don t think anyone could have muted me but i admit i didn t check 3 once or twice after playing for a while the game won t let me load new tables until i restart the game 4 about a week into playing i hit a bad bug where i wasn t able to end turns search change settings or even exit the game without clicking the x and crashing the window i m not entirely sure why that started to happen i have to restart the game to get it to work i can still play games and chat while the bug is in effect but this is definitely not bug free check out the list of board games and card games on the steam workshop for this game if that doesn t excite you then don t buy this game and if it does know that i ve tested a bunch of them and they are playable and not just piles of garbage there are some difficult things that you sometimes have to work around but if you learn the ui they are easy a lot of problems people have are rolling dice properly without smashing into things or shuffling and stacking cards quickly or even drawing and moving cards around without accidentally revealing them all of these things can be done very efficiently but it takes a little bit of learning to understand how the engine works and until you do you ll probably find yourself knocking things over by accident but everything is pretty easy to fix and it s kind of fun tldr 10 10 no regrets buying this for 10 would pay full price you better like card board games
