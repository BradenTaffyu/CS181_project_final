2021 early access review stressed out after a hard day at work have a craving to feel in charge but not in a shoot em up sort of way this game may be for you i know it sounds insane power washing things as a game how is that fun well it is hear me out this game is not fun in the rpg or fps kill everything that moves or tactical takeover of a galaxy sort of way but in the much more real world i made this thoroughly gunky place sparkle like new way that sense of accomplishment is what this game offers if you are a fan of shows like hoarders or flip this house or any other program where the goal is to take something nasty and make it so much better you would have a hard time knowing it was the same place without being told then you will enjoy this game it is also a relaxing game there is no timer counting down no you have to do this before that you can take your time and start where and how you want on a job which for many people who work a position that doesn t allow them much freedom where time or decisions are concerned can be a breath of fresh air
