2020 back in 2013 i downloaded this game and was threatened with a fine by scs software s lawyers as i acquired it through a torrent this torrent tracked my ip and as i lived in germany at the time was threatened with a 1200 one thousand two hundred euro fine we hired a lawyer specialized in this who managed to negotiate it down to 600 six hundred euro needless to say after this graduation gift from my parents them paying the lawyers specifically i opted to play more of this game it is a very well rounded game with a nice development system the driving is good and doable even if you only drive with mouse keyboard combo the graphics are decent and there are regular updates though there are many dlc you needn t buy them all as they are mainly flavour and the base game is suitable for most needs i would recommend this game as a calm relaxing game to disconnect and just drive around europe if you take it more serious once you have your own drivers and your own business up and running it is very easy and you print money
