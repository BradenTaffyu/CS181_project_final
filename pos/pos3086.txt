2021 this is possibly my favorite game of all time across all genres it s simply a masterpiece and it has set the bar very high for rpg games to come larian studios loves their fans and instead of underdelivering like ubisoft they release even more content than expected for such a small group larian studios is one of the greatest studios of all time every single character in this game is voiced and mind you there are 1200 characters and nolan north isn t even in it which is a plus every single interactive object is narrated and the narrator brian bowles is the best narrator of all time the sound design is one of the greatest sound designs of all time the visuals are stunning and the game world layout is the greatest visual design of all time the game mechanics are awesome and even though you ve played this game 20 times mods will keep your spark going i ve nothing more to say other than larian studios you are amazing this is truly a masterpiece
