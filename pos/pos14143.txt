2022 what to say i started playing oxygen not included oni a faithful saturday morning and for the next three weeks i spent all my waking hours doing nothing else than growing my colony it s a great colony simulator in the vein of rimworld but i found it far better for one oni is nonviolent no guns no constant dread that an arbitrary unexpectable raid party of nearly invincible fighter robots falls literally on your head in the middle of your base and kills all your colony great oh but you d be wrong the assume this means there no risks that oni is a pushover this is the opposite of true an oni map is many 2d physics simulation combined together and each simulation is a way for you to fail miserably oni is mostly focused on all sort of management tasks like managing fluids contamination resources stress etc there is also a bit of exploration the whole game is a puzzle around expansion and figuring out how to spread the gif export feature definitively takes advantage of that aspect you can go into the colony summary tab and look at a timelapse of your colony from the very start and it s very satisfying seeing the colony growing at full speed your colony in oni exists in the middle of an hostile environment you start with very limited resources not just food or water but also as the game name implies oxygen and you must grow your colony to survive it s easy to make the wrong decision when growing your colony the simulation creates perfect opportunities for f ups with immediate bad effects or an ticking bomb ooops i accidentally linked my poop hole with the clean water reservoir i guess i shouldn t have dug into a methane gas deposit and let it slip into my base yeah right you probably want more than a simple gas mask to dig into outer space ah yes i guess i shouldn t use hot water to cool my machinery oh right bad idea to send colonists clean up a room filled with 100 c water looks like i am running out of clean water to convert to oxygen what to do what to do and on and on the epitome of fluid management in oni is when duplicants don t have proper plumbing aka you failed at planning for fundamental needs and they make a mess the constant threat of bodily fluid turning into contaminated world fluid at any place in the map where you really don t want it is the one mechanic in the whole game that can summarize all other also the game has great animations just look at it it s so adorable aww it hits that hitch of colony simulation without annoying random events you can t possibly plan for everything is born from the simulation hence fully plannable it s fun and the game doesn t punch down at any point
