2018 a proper strategy game this game is a good candidate for being a bit too complex and thats perhaps the only thing wrong with it that it s hard to learn however with every decision you make there s so many things to consider if you re going to war consider the money you have the number of troops you have the troop quality your troop morale your reputation what allies you and your enemies have all of the above for each of those and more this gives it a level of depth beyond any other strategy game i ve ever played and that includes civ v and rome total war games which i m now disappointed by whenever i play because of their relative lack of depth or strategic options for example in civ v it s absurdly difficult to win if you don t go for an early game military rush or focus on science for the long game partly because science can really set you up for any victory and you re pretty screwed without it whereas in this game because there are so many things to think about there are a hundred somewhat correct choices at any time along with a thousand incorrect choices i think because the technology progression is downplayed a bit and having better troops in this game makes less of an impact than civ that helps this game to give you more options at any given moment i still suck at this game but here is a summary pros an incredible deep strategic campaign with so many factors to weigh into all of your decisions a ridiculous range in difficulty levels if you are s t play as the ottomans if you are chuck norris play as ryukyu or byzantium great mods extended timeline mod allows you to play in the years 0 9999 with more civilisations and technologies con no s no tutorial you have to learn the game for yourself which will probably take up about the first 50 hours of playing or more but playing as the ottomans is not too difficult even for complete beginners is it worth the price for any game this always in my opinion depends on how many hours you can put into it if you are into strategy games and want more of a challenge definitely i ve just come back to this game and played it for 6 hours straight i was expecting to have forgotten everything but i ve found its actually not too bad to come back to i m currently playing on normal quite difficult difficulty as the ottomans and still pretty much crushing all civs around me if you are worried that you might play this game for a little while give up and then have no motivation to go back to it don t it s surprisingly easy to start again after not playing this game for a long time this is more true than ever the game has such a great range of difficulty no matter how good or bad you are at strategy games you can manage to make meaningful decisions the game ranges from very easy difficulty playing as the ottomans in which it is easy to manage and win wars to very hard difficulty as a small nation for some of which i m not even sure if it s possible to survive more than a few years dlc i ve seen a lot of negative reviews concentrate on the poor dlc policy of the game they underestimate how much fun the base game is to play especially if you ve not played a strategy game of this scope before really you don t need any of them to start with one good thing about the dlc though is that if you have a friend who has more dlc than you you can both play games together using all of their dlc you don t both have to own them i have done this many times with other steam friends it s the best strategy game i have ever played
