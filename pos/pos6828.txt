2013 euro truck simulator 2 is one of the best driving simulators out there allowing us mere mortals to experience the thrills of driving a truck all over europe and its many challenges ranging from narrow roads to sneaky speed cameras who would have imagined that it could be so entertaining i have been playing ets 2 since its release in 2012 and scs has never stopped improving the overall experience to say it has evolved would be quite the understatement the current version 1 48 looks like an entirely new game if one were to compare it with the first version i played back in october 2012 and they don t seem to be stopping any time soon dlcs paid and new trucks free come relatively often keeping the experience fresh for everyone if you haven t given the truck sim franchise a go yet i d highly recommend doing so it might seem dull from afar but i promise it will get you hooked it s beyond addictive
