2018 i played stellaris since the intial release date and personally i always loved it exploring the universe the randomly generated species you encounter along with the random events anomalies and what you can do it feels like there is more than just fighting other empires and thats what i enjoy most about it with the 2 0 update i was extremely happy with the newly introduced mechanics and think that they make for fair play what i still notice is that you are still able to die releatively easy and i ve noticed that since the release of the game i m not sure if i just suck but endgame crisis can literally destroy your empire from the inside out experienced before 2 0 and while playing 2 0 i literally faced endless waves of 19k fleets under the banner of the khan i believe this is from a dlc though although i manage to kill him in battle and save my empire i feel as if this game just has you set up to die some times my second biggest complaint is that whatever ideologies you chose you always seem to get species following the opposite basically the entire galaxy doesn t like you and this has happened on endless playthroughs no matter what ideologies i choose experienced before and after 2 0 overall it is still an amazing game highly recommend a long with the dlc
