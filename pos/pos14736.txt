2016 the best civilization game since civilization ii that is to say nothing of the bugs and that easily means the best strategy game in 20 years in my opinion with the sole exception of sid meier s civilization of 1991 itself even civilization projects seem to be far superior to odd ones civilization ii was just great it still plays and even looks much better than many modern strategies civilization iii had some interesting gameplay ideas but terrible looks and tiny and colorless units and everything civilizaition iv featured excellent visuals but stripping usual features in favor of separate add ons was really a bad idea civilization v had the most innovations in the series but here we again had a number of paid dlcs and addons and that plain black style of the graphics and the interface was quite ugly for my taste what i liked in civilization vi the visuals they are now as bright and cute as they had never been before you feel as you d want to lick the buildings and the units the leaders yes they are best looking and even almost historically true looking since well the first and probably the second game the completeness no major feature is stripped down in the original vanilla edition wow the districts great idea actually even if it is the only major innovation not just seeing a city growing randomly but laying out its urbanizaton by hand is extremely satisfactory well bad things the bugs of course yes it is a very big game but it still could have been tested and proof read better i had my load of ctds and freezes and some russian texts surely need some editing still i have no complains of ai some leaders are stupid some are treacherous some are plain weak just like in real life politics you know some interface drawbacks where is the good old list of all my units i have a crowd of writers and painters who are waiting for the next amphitheatre to be built and how am i supposed to find them scattered all over my little big empire and when pericles declares a sudden war on me how can i gather all my military who have not fought anything else than idleness for many centuries i am not even sure they will add it in future patches well this complain relates to every civilization game since ii but i would still love to see something like palace from civilization i or throne room from civilization ii again much better than just a boring statistics screen and what about getting back screens with real people rioting or celebrating we love our ruler days oh forget it they will never give us back that joy unfortunately of course it would be blasphemy not to recommend civilization vi to everybody especially if the bugs would be finally corrected
