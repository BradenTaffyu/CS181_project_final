2014 early access review after having spent over a day total on 7dtd i must say it is my favorite game as of now it combines all of the best aspects of the forest minecraft and dayz with few bugs that are hardly noticable and it lets you take the game into your own hands build a massive corn field sure keep a cage full of living dead go for it you sicko build a giant statue of shrek i have 3 already you can do what you want and more whenever you d like and it doesn t require internet which is an important aspect for me because i live in a rural community and thats why i never really got into rust overall i say it is completely worth the money10 10 would build shrek again
