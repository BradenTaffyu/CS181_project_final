2020 early access review the game needs to be fleshed out with features but as it stands it provides tonnes of content and is incredibly moddable even without the release of mod tools it has its issues but i personally have only run into a very small handful of full crashes or game breaking bugs in my 90 hours the combat puts a smile on my face every time running through someone with a couch lance or a two handed polearm is great fun tournaments always get my blood going especially on realistic i recommend this game highly but remember that it is early access and they are working on the game consistently most of my experiences have been with a modded beta branch
