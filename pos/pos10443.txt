2022 after playing assetto corsa i decided i wanted a more hardcore sim game i bought acc and am amazed at how well this game plays i ll start with the pros very easy to get the hang of but it will take time to master the ai are pretty good in my time of playing definite upgrade from ac the tracks are very enjoyable you don t need to pay more than the base game to enjoy it the ui is very easy to navigate cons lack of cars you can buy more in the dlc s they provide but for the base game you only get gt3 cars
