2022 thehunter call of the wild is one of the most calming life changing games i ve ever played before playing this game i lacked patience but this game taught me to slow my roll and enjoy wherever you are in life or in the game while you have a chance to be there i ve become fascinated with the great outdoors and intend to live my weekends outside from now on camping fishing and hunting even though my family is not an outdoors family i ll make it my mission to teach myself these skills in real life so i can pass it on to my kids later on there s something truly special about hunting harvesting and being outside with a purpose as for the game play itself nothing is more satisfying than landing a perfect heart shot on an animal i enjoy the large selection of guns animal callers scopes and species of animals on each map i m not even remotely upset by the price of the dlc as during sales and normally each dlc has a reasonable price for the amount of fun and exploration each and every dlc offers buy this game give it time to grow on you i didn t understand it at first but after maybe 4 hours i figured it out and fell in love thank you expansive worlds
