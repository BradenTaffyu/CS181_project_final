2015 early access review this game is really about teamwork you have to share food supplies weapons and clothes between all players to survive longer which is the goal of this game the game saves your progress automatically with each new day so you can continue playing in the same world you don t have to play until you re starving in game and or in the real world di played it with friends and also with random players and my recommendation is to try it with friends you can t just let a friend go hungry or let him her face the hounds alone right you set up a base together and make some labor division give them a nice garland i found it a bit difficult to do all the things above with a player i never met before that being said the game is an excellent way to test your inner survivor and to learn to work in a team
