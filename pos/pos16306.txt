2019 early access review tldri recommend anyone can pick this game up and have fun might take a couple hours to get around the learning curve but you won t be disappointed actual thoughts pros price high replayability for a noob it is actually fun to learn how to play and what you need to do to be successful anyone can play this drink your own pee multiple vehicles to drive more things to do other than build the car when you need a break made by 1 person and is still a high quality gameneutral apparently even beast pcs have trouble running this game i disagree with this statement i have a 1060 3gb with 16gb ram and an i7 4790 not a beast by any means and can run max setting with v sync and get 60 fps pretty consistently i have no idea how these other pcs have issues running it other than user error everything is in finnish graphics are very simple don t look here if you want aaa title quality graphics this is made by one person subjective cons no multiplayer im unsure if mp would actually be beneficial or not though everything is in finnish there are some subtitles but not all can be frustrating at times actual cons people may get motion sickness with all the bending over you can do i do after building engine and chopping wood updates are rare but again 1 person this is amazing for what it is steep learning curve which may turn people off of the game too soon previous to playing this game i did not have a huge interest in racing sim or build its like minecraft since putting in 100 hours my interest has skyrocketed at first this game was so frustrating to me and i had zero patience for it and building the engine eventually after putting in some hours and dying too many times to count i began to understand a little more of what i needed to do and how the game plays after that the game started to become more and more enjoyable to the point where i now play this daily congrats on 3 years and hopefully many more to come if you ve made it this far leave a like why dont ya
