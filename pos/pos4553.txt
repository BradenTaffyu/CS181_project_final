2019 play with some qol mods such as being able to interact with towns from the world map this game is great until bannerlord finally comes out sandbox game where you can roam around as a mercenary warband leader or strive for the crown no matter what you choose to do if you internally roleplay it will be an amazing experience with many stories behind it personally i rose through the ranks and became a renown general eventually i married the marshall s daughter and i plotted for the crown the king was too weak and i had enough of fighting his wars against the cancerous mongol like tribes mounted archers are a pain in the ass i instead brought the war to him and took his crown with my father in law at my side it was easy to gain support and turn them all against the former crown with my new kingdom secured i then sought out to expand my borders which led to wars with other neighboring countries it was a great and memorable experience if i did not have other games in my backlog i probably would continue to play as can be told from the many reviewers with thousands of hours however after hundred hours i felt satisfied and left it there i m not quite as big on sandbox games as others so my own story felt done it was well worth the price though and an excellent journey i am hoping bannerlord will be a worthy successor i do quite miss the massive first person army combat and being able to both fight and command troops mounted and unmounted
