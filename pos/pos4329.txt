2014 really one of the best sandbox games i ve ever played every once in a while i stop playing it because i m too busy but i always keep coming back to try and conquer all the land combat is fun the mechanics are fresh and actions have consequences you can invent your own little stories and have your companions accompany you in your adventures some of your companions will get along some of them won t everything ends up feeling alive this is one of the few games that i just keep playing over and over out of pure enjoyement
