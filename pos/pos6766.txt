2022 ets 2 is a game that i have been playing since my childhood i m still having fun playing i can say that this game is among the most relaxing games i have played but there are some major shortcomings in the single player part of the game after playing the game for a few hours it turns into a game of just taking a task and pressing the keyboard keys and this is what discouraged me from playing the game all the time after a while i don t think the money earned from missions tow truck prices trailer prices bank loan rates and the like are perfectly balanced the fact that it only rains in the game makes me think that the weather mechanics of the game are very poor it would be more fun and challenging if it snowed tornadoes or other natural disasters
