2020 early access review graphics you forget what reality is beautiful good decent bad don t look too long at it paint exe story it doesn t have bad average good fantastic make your own story its multiplayer what did you expect gameplay very good good it s just gameplay mehh starring at walls is better just don t audio eargasm very good good not too bad bad earrape audience kids teens adults humans pc requirements check if you can run paint potato decent fast rich boiiiiii ask nasa if they have a spare computer difficulty just press a easy significant brain usage easy to learn hard to master difficult dark souls grind nothing to grind only if u care about leaderboards ranks isnt necessary to progress average grind level too much grind you ll need a second life for grinding game time long enough for a cup of coffee short average long to infinity and beyond price it s free worth the price if u have some spare money left wait for that sale drop not recommended you could also just burn your money bugs never heard of minor bugs can get annoying ark survival evolved the game itself is a big terrarium for bugs fallout 76even though it s early access and has been in development for god knows how long there s crucial things this game is missing and i hope they fix or add them compared to mount and blade the graphics are definitely a huge improvement it doesn t take away from anything the environment is awesome detail of the weapons and armor are a huge step up but the faces of characters in this game are so off putting and cringe to look at hopefully they improve it so i can actually make my character look like me or someone else if i want to role play the story is just like mount and blade do what you want kill plunder conquer and control but there is a story to follow with the game that seems to be unfinished or bugged your family killed you and your brother separate to make a name for yourself choosing a side or making your own empire and rise above it all simple to the point nothing to brag about make your own story how you feel fit to your playstyle the sword play is debatable for some people at first i hated it it felt off but over time with fixes it felt smooth and polish enough to enjoy but the damage output within the campaign and multiplayer can be really frustrating in mount and blade you and your double sworded cleaver can mow down 10 soldiers simply rushing you 20 farmers can do the same and you ll come out feeling badass and like a monster to be feared of this game it s the opposite 5 farmers can stun you over and over and you ll be dead before you know it or half your health is missing armed men you ll be constantly retreating to your line of defence screaming for backup after a while i got the hang of it there s a pattern to soldiers movement you can exploit if you re fast enough to run rings around them in another form that you ll be facing a difficult fight ahead of you overall it s a good game compared to mount and blade and is sure worth it with the additional 20 off if you re a new player coming in you ll have a great time i would wait till the game is finished in my opinion banners are still being adjusted for the game and the skill tree needs to be tweaked some things you do in the world don t improve the skill even though it says this is the way the bugs are annoying this occurs when sieging some units go down the ladder when the gate is breached this has been fixed for the most part along with enemy units getting stuck in corners or building and all your units pile on trying to kill him while your trying to get through to cheese through the gaps and finish the job hope this helps some people decide whether to get it or not i love writing reviews and expressing how i feel about games
