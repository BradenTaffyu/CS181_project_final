2016 there is a worrying number of overly biased reviews for this game as is the case with steam reviews in general the single player is an experience that sums up the souls series in a very climactic way it s definitely the most fine tuned and visually striking souls game to date the base game is superb there are a few secret area s that are rather large and diverse and the items and weapons are sharp interesting and nicely balanced for the most part estoc bestoc armors are varied and tend to mix well together i would have to say fashion souls is now better than ever the bosses are amazing all of them the first boss is a great introduction to the games difficulty and mechanics a specific optional boss is honestly one of the best souls fights of all time and one of the most challenging lore is one of my favorite aspects of a souls game and this game has some very very interesting characters and bosses my particular favorite being aldrich the devourer of gods he s a total scumbag pvp is definitely the thing that needs to change the most there are hackers who are causing concern for players but before you post a negative review might i recommend a counter measure or at least a fail safe to prevent irreversible damage backup your saves it s as simple as that sure it s a nuisance but it s more preferable than losing your character completely i can assure you from is not ignoring it i d like to remind you pvp was pretty bad in dark souls 2 when it came out only after many updates did it become balanced and fun give dark souls 3 the same patience there are new mechanics and changed concepts it ll take some time but it ll be fixed this game is not as bugged or as laggy as so many people seem to claim i run a 960 on high and get 60 in all areas of the game note i do run a higher end processor so your fps may vary i don t know if from is offering a fix for other less optimized cards but i can assure you this is not a half assed effort for a port the devs have discussed with the community the problems and bugs people are experiencing within the game and their acknowledgement alone means they re willing to work on fixing these problems this game is worth your time fromsoft is a pretty good developer if you don t want to risk buying due to the lag or pvp problems give it some time it ll fix itself out over time
