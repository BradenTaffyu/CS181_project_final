2023 great game needs some small balance patches over few weeks months but no rts was ever released with perfect balance between factions but it reeks of sega balance is needed now while the game is still alive yeah the game is dying devs are just so untrustworthy and trying to trick people who haven t bought it yetoverall i would recommend this game sure but at this point it s better to wait and see if it survives
