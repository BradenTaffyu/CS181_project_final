2021 i was looking for a great tower defense game since i played and fell in love with a very old mobile tower defense game that s not available anymore so i found bloons td 6 and i am addicted i ve played for over 100 hours by now and still have not played every map especially not in every difficulty i also have not unlocked every single upgrade for all towers yet though i am very close to that you can play alone or in a group up to 4 players you can play with your friends which i really appreciate and love but even the public community is non toxic i have never played with strangers that tried to ruin or manipulate the game when it comes to the monkey knowledge points i still have a little way ahead of me to unlock everything i am level 93 by now also does the game offer events and cute custom things like skins emojis and animations the amazing thing here you can get all that with in game money if you work enough for it you don t have to pay real money for skins etc highly appreciate that there is a huge variety of towers and enemies the design is super cute and colorful the only thing i could see people be bothered by is that at a certain point after round 100 with all your many towers and huge upgrades the map gets very clustered and overloaded this can make it hard to impossible to find your towers and see anything in all the chaos but that insanity after round 100 is what i am here for so i am not bothered by it at all overall i really recommend this game and think the price is justified for the amount of fun i already had with it 10 10
