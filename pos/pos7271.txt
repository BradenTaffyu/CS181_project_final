2016 it s hard not to compare this to ets2 but that is the standard scs have set for themselves so what have they done well and what s new to like they ve done a remarkable job capturing the american feel of small towns large cities surrounding countryside and the ai vehicles the detail that has gone into the local businesses is terrific graphics are excellent and on par with ets2 with a slight improvement in texture quality the game runs stable with not so much as a single crash or hiccup in 14 hours it s also nice being able to drive american trucks and trailers and is a welcome change of pace from the euro hgv trucks there is a new parking option i like when delivering loads that you can gain extra xp if you put the trailer exactly where the customer wants it or in certain places it sort of harkens back to the challenge of the dangerous drives of scania truck sim or truck trailers though on a much smaller scale the world feels alot more alive with npcs that actually are busy doing stuff instead of just standing around and many other little details too numerous to mention that said is there anything else not to like nothing really bad but it falls short in a few areas that i had higher hopes for 1 sound while the truck sound effects are adequate many are recycled from ets2 the engines sounds are just okay but inaccurate engine brake is far too muffled and the air brakes don t sound anything like the kenworths and peterbilts i see everyday with their brash loud blasts of air rattling diesel engines and jake brakes so loud you nearly soil yourself if you re next to one 2 weigh stations this is another new game mechanic which sounds good on paper but adds little if anything to the game i m not really sure what they re trying to do here but after nearly 14 hours of playtime i ve been required to stop at two weigh stations and nothing happened either time so it doesn t add anything significant that i can see 3 game size the game world is small compared to the initial release of ets2 and of course with all of the ets2 map add ons scs has a very long way to go to catch up it took a long time for them to just create two states and months for arizona which still isn t available it makes one wonder if they ll ever get the entire continental usa 4 only two truck brands to choose from which is a real bummer while i m sure the licensing will be worked out eventually for other brands they could have at least released them under ficticious names assuming they re finished with the modeling we really need to see freightliner mack international and western star to name a few in summary i give it a recommendation to hard core sim fans scs fans or trucking fans but more casual sim fans might want to wait until the game matures more and more content is added on to the big three things most people look for in a game i ll give the following ratings graphics 9 10sound 6 10gameplay 8 10overall 7 5 10
