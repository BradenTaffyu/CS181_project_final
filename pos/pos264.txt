2020 so let s just start this off with saying that this one guy managed to create a game which not only has more depth and personal involvement than most of the aaa titles coming out even in 2020 but has managed to keep this game updated and added a duodecillion new items assets and npcs into the game earlier this onth december 2020 this game lets you be what you want to be and rewards continued gameplay with even more depth be a farmer and grow rows upon rows of crops be a miner and go spelunkling be a fisherman and go fish for so godawful many types of things you can fish up you can even be a lumberjack if that so fancies you the people you meet the quests you get into the sheer amount of things to do you will not put this game away for the first while once you re hooked you re hooked deep the graphics only adds to the pleasantry of the game bringing both a fun way to do shading and objects but doing so in a retro manner so both young and old can play along and the sounds are contributing equally as much to make the experience of playing this game so much more eventful and amusing it is warmly recommended and with as much effort as has been put into the game and with as many hours as you ll likely end up spending on this game it s more than well worth the money spent purchasing the game
