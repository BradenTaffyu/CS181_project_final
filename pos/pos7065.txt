2023 this game has ruined my daily routine i haven t gone to the gym in a week because of this game i haven t spent anytime with friends because of this game i am in my early twenties and i feel like my life is slowly slipping away from me because of this game i have spent 35 hours driving trucks across the american landscape bought almost all the dlc and been drinking nothing but budweiser and soft drinks like a true american in the last 5 days i need help this game is going to make me need therapy because i think i have an addiction i will get home from work tonight and once again turn my computer on and get straight into trucking i wish i never purchased this game as it is ruining my life i love and hate this game if you are going to buy it be warned it might get you too
