undertale is a masterpiece it thrives in subverting your expectations of a typical rpg in every way and i mean it in every way from worldbuilding to combat to characters everything you expect will be thrown out the window you will come to love the characters for how well written believable they are the most minor trivial character from this game oozes more personality than a lot of games do the writing makes the game feel so immersive thanks to how believable cohesive it is the multi layered rich themes are gonna leave you thinking of this game long after you re done with it the music is superb though that much is clearly evident by the widespread presence in meme culture the combat is extremely unique brings out the best of bullet hell turn based systems it s the only game where i ve ever truly felt that my choices matter despite never advertising as such overall i simply cannot recommend this game enough it is a masterpiece through through with no dull moment i don t do number ratings usually but for undertale it s an easy 10 10
