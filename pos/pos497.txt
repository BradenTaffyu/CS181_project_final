2019 first off i am a primarily first person shooter kind of player however this sweet little game is my anti depressant for when my bloodpressure is higher than snoopdog on the 20th of april i bought this game a few days after christmas and within a week i had already achieved 21 hours it is a little repetitive but it has very rewarding outcomes if you put the time in it is similar to another favourite of mine terraria the dating aspect is fun and amusing as there are lots of funny individual cut scenes for each bachelor ette each season is a new wave of opportunities spring summer fall autumn and winter the gameplay is charming and enticing and has a goal to complete the deserted and decrepid community centre but also to complete your character as a master of many proffessions the sprites are simple and have a more detailed portrait when spoken to they are realistic and memerable a great game to play with your friends stealing furniture and family members or fighting over potential mates i notice i ve written a disitation worthy of oxford here but it really is a good game with a developer who deserves a reward for completing a game like this all on his own p s it s totally worth 11 for almost endless gameplay a loyal farmer fisher forager fighter and miner
