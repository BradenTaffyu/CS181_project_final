2018 one of the best games i have ever played dark souls 3 is immersive with a dark story difficult and unforgiving gives the players specialy the new comers a tough chalange that most can t handle persistance and adaptation is the key here anyway this game was a great atmospheare with a rich hidden lore everything happens for a reason i would like to thank a friend for buying this one for me enjoyed it as jolly co op and as pvp great game with a lot of variety must have for tryhards i would praise the sun till the fire fades 10 10
