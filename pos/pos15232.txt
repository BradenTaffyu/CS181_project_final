2023 the drifting is good i play on a controller and it s nice to be able to hold nice angles with ease so i can focus on being close the one in front of me you don t need to counter steer the car with a controller and the game does a fantastic job of keeping your car on the line you ve chosen the tuning is in depth but the base tune is solid if you re unsure of how to do it
