2023 so the legend i heard about troubleshooter abandoned children is that its origin is that a dev team used to making mobile games decided to make a game that you just bought every tool of unbelievably super maximalist throw everything in long running mobile rpg design has been thrown in here except instead of being done with an eye on monetization it s just for fun because it s cool but oh wow there s so much there s so many systems in this game build robots catch monsters craft gear dismantle gear farm super hard missions for rare gear upgrade your characters with 20 interlocking mastery abilities at once run teams of ten of these complicated characters at a time combine certain ones to unlock secret mastery bonuses specialise in certain jurisdictions to obtain bonuses from the respect of their communities there s multiplayer that i ve never touched order drinks for your crew at cafes pay their salary you give them a bonus for their hard work why would you ever not do that they deserve it assign teamwork bonuses the hero irene thinks heixing needs to put a shirt on so she gains 50 less affinity for him i play on normal difficulty and i m pretty sure i could ignore at least some of these systems but wow there s still a ton of them sometimes the translation can be a little stilted but the feelings it wants to convey definitely carry through i like it also it has this incredible obsession with following the antagonists of the game as characters like pre mission scenes are always from their point of view always whether they re cultists or gangsters or like frog monsters you get to pick dialogue choices for them sometimes the dialogue choices affect their tactics in the fight you re about to do it s wild do you want to play what is possibly the most unbelievably maximalist tactical rpg ever that s troubleshooter abandoned children it rules
