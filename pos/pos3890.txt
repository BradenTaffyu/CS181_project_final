2021 this is it 30 years of video games and i finally found it my prefered game i m in love got to write something about it the musics are really good some suprising tunes covers i didn t expect i would like graphics are not bad nothing to say really art design is really good because it s not too fancy not too serious simple but original and still credible it has it s own style which creates a nice and unique universe which is dare i say a little bit cyberpunk y but the story oh my i didn t expect that depth started light the plot is not that complex i expected something simple all the way but the lore is huge and nicely worked on sadly you feel the lack of time budget and clearly see that some story lore points or gameplay features would have been more worked on developed and it takes some serious turns some of the cutscenes and dialogues between bad guys are really heavy and serious it s the first game that made me cry for a bad guy and more than once story deals with friendship leadership respect the fine line between good guys and bad guys and a lot of other values that are harder to define as the story goes on it s the kind of game that not only deserves but need some kind of screen or book adaptation gameplay is as the story simple but deep i had hundreds of hours just looking at my characters mastery boards where you customize skills passives and such and thinking testing optimising my builds more than i ever did on an mmo and trust me i did possibilities are not endless of course but boy oh boy are they many each character is unique but none are useless and it may be the only game from which i don t dislike any of them mayyyybe leton but still a lovely guy the only point i dislike is that you unlock them really late last two characters you ll unlock will be after the end of the core game while some of them have really heavy gameplay mechanics such as pet taming or bot summoning where each pet bot have the same depth of customization as main characters have so hundreds of hours worth of leveling brainstorming and deep impacts on team building not only can you tame every pet you ll fight with a simple entertaining yet not so easy gameplay mechanic but you can level them evolve them specialize them and there are legendary ones hard to find ones this taming aspect only would deserve a stand alone game and still be good i could write for hours about what s good so what is not well the only bad point is the lack of budget for the dev team time money you can feel they lack some and the lore character development and story did not get the polish they needed and it s really sad also multiplayer is basically non existent not a big deal really but it could have been fun and most of all add a ton of playtime with a pvp side it s even sadder when you look at the patch notes and see how these cuty pies are so sorry everytime i m always like oh no don t worry sweety your game is golden already you did good i can wait one more month for that patch take your time so if you want to try something good fresh made with love and attention that will consume hundreds of hours of your time go for it heck buy the soundtrack too it s deserved now stay safe everyone and take care
