2017 this game is beautiful this is a calming game that could get stressful really quickly once you start your left off in a farm in which you gotta live in and cultivate your crops and sell them for money you live in a small town in which you can get friends go fishing trading mining killing slimes and monsters etc this game is really worth it please buy it i can t find a way to hate it maybe its not your type of game but i can t find a reason to hate it in the way its made 10 10 i bought it for 15 dollars and i would probably pay more if needed to
