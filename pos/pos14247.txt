2023 early access review you start on a single planet alone and with a bare handful of resources you end with colossal factories and logistic systems that span planets processing resources from as many as sixty four star systems and enveloping stars and a black hole with megastructural dyson spheres dyson sphere program dsp has been described as factorio meets satisfactory and while succinct the characterization doesn t quite do the much larger scope of dsp justice each starting seed of which there are 100 million contains sixty four stars around each of those stars are between one and five planets and there are twenty two different types of planets including gas giants and ice giants every planet in your personal galaxy can be built upon a couple of huge reasons why i love the game so much and have played for more than a thousand hours i m not getting back are the visuals and music dsp is absolutely gorgeous the planets are sumptuously designed with flora and topography they re large enough to feel spacious but small enough to imply the interstellar scale the horizons visibly curved you can zoom the camera in to see items with incredible minute details and zoom out to see the entire star system nearby gas and ice giants provide stunning punctuation to a sky filled with stars the nearest ones labeled with names that players can change in fact you can rename all the stars and planets which certainly helps keep track of where desired resources are as you leap off the planet and warp through space the soundtrack is triumphant encouraging and uplifting becoming muted and mystical in the space between worlds and stars near the black hole in each personal galaxy the music takes a more ominous tone as it should finally one of the best features of owning dyson sphere program is that it is being regularly patched and updated without any additional dlc cost the new content is added by game designers that actually heed the feedback of players and is always interesting enough to compel a fresh new playthrough
