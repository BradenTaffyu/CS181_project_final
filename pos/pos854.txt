2016 after getting a rundown farm from your grandfather you set out to make a living in stardew valley in any way you see fit apart from farming and raising livestock you ll also have plenty of fishes to get foraging a museum collection to complete daily quests and many npcs you can get to know befriend and marry stardew valley is truly a great farming sim there s simply so much to do that it can even get slightly overwhelming at the beginning but the amount of content and options you re faced with are what make this game so good pros nice art style cute soundtrack tons to do farming different crops raising livestock building new farm buildings upgrading your house or change its floors furniture forage fish collect artifacts for the museum collection raise npcs disposition daily quests a mine to explore and fight in a few secret areas and finally a community center to rebuild by depositing tons of different stuff in it unless you take the evil easy way and side with the corporation the gameplay is simply fun no matter what you re doing from the aforementioned options lots of different areas to explore the skill system is pretty basic but works well and even has exclusive perks at lvl 5 and 10 for each skill npcs have good backstories great sense of progressionneutral npcs can be a bit hard to find sometimes as their schedules make them move about during the day still it s realistic and the wiki can help you if you need to look where someone d be at a given time day combat works but it feels a bit clunky cons can be a bit cryptic when it comes to tutorials i think reading a few guides and keeping the wiki at hand would be a very good move for most players livestock pathing can be a bit poor sometimes object selection when several people objects are near can be a bit annoying some menus are a bit unclear or fiddly when it comes to displaying information or searching through different items certain rare fishes artifacts can be quite frustrating to get spring of year 2 a screenshot of stardew valley by stranger1982 after 50 hours with the game i m not even halfway through year two and i still have a few things to do before i finally complete the community center and tackle a few other things and achievements i m interested in the game is simply big in terms of overall content and things to do and requires quite a bit of time and research to be enjoyed properly for those that pour enough effort in it stardew valley is a very rewarding game that is sure to repay your work with something maybe a new tool a farm building with new animals a museum reward or the option to make your love interest move in with you at the farm there are a few blemishes here and there but none of them get in the way of the fun and it s easy to lose yourself in the game so much you realize a couple hours have passed only when you look at a clock the sense of novelty eventually wears off from the second year onwards as you ve seen the festivals you know how to reach the goals you re missing give gifts to this npc grow this crop make sure to keep this item etc and have automated the crop watering process still while it ll feel a bit more like organized work and less like the adventure of your first year there s still enough to push you forward for at least another one before you ll have seen most of what the game has to offer if you love the farming sim genre stardew valley is a truly great game and is sure to provide a lot of bang for your buck even at full price the fact this is the creation of a single dev makes it even more impressive
