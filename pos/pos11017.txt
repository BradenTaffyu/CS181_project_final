2023 i love this game i haven t experienced any major bug or performance issues since release day and i have been playing it quite a bit nvidia is suggesting low settings as optimal but it looks awful so i have it on medium with not really a performance drop but my pc runs a lot warmer not a problem coming into winter for me this version feels more like a real city i love that we can see the industries and what the city needs to steer you into the city s development i am actually embracing mining and farming etc compared to cs1 where i just went for a towering metropolis i genuinely feel like i am getting a more realistic and next level city building experience it s very cool that you can build food farms and lumber mills etc and you can see the industry that processes the raw materials and that one feature that i think could be more ideal is that if industry near the raw material source is more aligned with that production line e g industry that requires timber is more likely to develop close to tree farms i also hope that this can happen in redevelopments as well as in factories relocate to premises built closer to supply chain sources i like the changes made to the service buildings and the accuracy of their size i really enjoy that they can be upgraded instead of needing to build the same buildings everywhere for example the large fire and police stations have a huge service area instead of needing each of the stations in every suburb traffic flow is much more realistic and more dynamic with it s peak time rush hours and lane usage that said as of now there are some traffic ai qwerks that need some work like the 3 5 point 90 lane changes at intersections which congest traffic further along with an excessive amount of intersection u turns that said with enough planning you can work around these two annoying features there are some interesting traffic quirks as well which for me are just comedic more than a problem like people walking along the sidewalks in very long tunnels surprised there is even sidewalks in such tunnels when a motorbike accident occurs the cim remains on the bike laying sideways on the ground until the accident event is over fire helicopters drop water on to tunnel fires through the ground and pedestrians and cars levitating back up to bridge roads if they come off during an accident loli love the heat mapping overlay for many things like pollution and ideal spots for commercial zones etc but i will say that sometimes there is so much visualisation that it s difficult to see the heat maps i will also add here that underground works are hard to see due to the volume of information you are seeing on screen the seasons are great but the extreme darkness of winter makes builds harder hahaoff the back of coming from cs1 which has a litany of expansion packs and mods this can feel a little stripped down in many senses but honestly with bug fixes and more content this will be next level exciting times ahead
