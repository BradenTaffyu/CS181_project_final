2018 i don t understand why this has mixed reviews this is a wonderful sequel almost everything is an improvement from the previous installment hell even the load times intro video menu and the tutorial are improvements the differences of the game from v are noticeable but very easy to pick up quickly through the tutorial there s several changes to the game including subtle changes that make a big difference for instance the workers are utilized differently instead of a worker taking multiple turns to build a structure the structures are built immiediately in one turn with the worker to balance this the workers have a default charge limit of 3 so you can only use that worker unit to build three structures until the unit is expended the other reason why this is a plus is because in v you would end up with several workers wandering around your empires with very little to do this way you don t have multiple useless works sitting around on sleep they also made a small yet impactful change with roads you can no longer build your own roads instead roads are now constructed automatically after you form a trade route this was the only reason a player would need to build roads in the first place so it only makes sense for them to remove the option to manually build them and instead construct them automatically these are just a few small examples there are plenty of big changes to the game as well to me all of the changes that they made are positive ones at this point the only reason why i would play v would be because i m playing with friends who don t own vi the most common complaint i see about this game is the change to the grapics making them look cartoony i can understand what they mean by that and i suppose i can understand why it would bother them but not enough to disregard all the good things about the new mechanics and changes to the game i believe those people are just being lazy and arrogant they would rather judge a great sequel poorly based on the first impression of the visuals rather than experiences the fun and new dynamic modifications made to the gameplay as a final note the graphics are beautiful compared to v even if they do have a cartoony vibe to it
