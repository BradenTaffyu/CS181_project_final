2021 does it have smooth frame rates no is it bug free there are hour long arma bug meme videos and physics fails about this game on youtube does it have a learning curve it is more like a learning cliff where you will stumble down on your face most of the timeis it bordering on the real life level complication it depends on how good you are at deciphering many different sights and range finders before you empty a full mag to kill just one enemy soldier against which you still can t accurately calculate the distance to kill so why are you giving a positive review you ask besides its quirky faults and bugs this game is the ultimate epitome of the sandbox milsim legacy of bohemia interactive not only arma 3 gave rise to several game genres on its own like milsims squad post scriptum battleroyale pubg with pubg developer starting out as an arma 3 multiplayer game modder it also allowed unique customisation options the vanilla game version offers you a singleplayer campaign co op missions and multiplayer games missions you can either create cooperate and multiplay scripted missions permanent missions co op pve and pvp missions everything you see on the map and even under the water is within the game zone see those distant mountains you can climb there to get a vantage point on the enemy or carelessly get sniped form there whilst on foot driving flying and swimming whilst also carrying a wide range of equipment and this is not even the best part of it yet arma 3 is very mod and modder friendly with developers releasing increasingly quality of life and user friendly updates mod integration and semi official themed dlcs after 7 years the modding community is still up and running want to play as a ww1 trench fighter a wh40k space marine a ww3 panzer commander in the 80s or even go go karting dressed as my little pony there is possibly a plethora of mods for those making the sandbox experience unique and giving the players unlimited creative freedom to create share and play their own missions content also has a decent multiplayer community ranging from retired army corporals shouting in military jargon to warcrimes go brrr toxicity players but despite all the flaws i counted this is one of the games i enjoy playing the most both sp and mp and has a unique feel
