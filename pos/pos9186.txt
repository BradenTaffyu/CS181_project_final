2020 i have to admit there s something poetic about building a race of immortal robots with the singular purpose of blowing up every planet harboring sentient organic life in the galaxy and while we can all fantasize about what we might want to do in our wildest dreams stellaris helps make those dreams a reality i haven t put too much time into the game as real life seems to pull me away but the level of control a player has in this grand simulation is just incredible furthermore mod and multiplayer support is done very well and the new story packs add a level of depth that i really do appreciate i d love to see an increase in tech level per item there are only 5 levels to research of each weapon for example and more story information but as is i m quite pleased however i do feel a bit insulted when a race of hyper intelligent geckos threaten my interstellar empire because i am evidently a soulless machine and an abomination in the face of their god whatever 10 10 would crack a world like an egg and scramble it again
