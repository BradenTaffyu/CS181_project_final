in general it s a massive upgrade from sins1 i have been playing throughout the early access portion and eagerly following updates i can wholeheartedly give this game a positive review for not only the amazing work stardock and ironclad have done but the overall attitude and willingness to engage with the community in a very positive manner particularly through discord congrats on the release and awesome work
