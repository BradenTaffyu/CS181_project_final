2019 something i think would be really good is giving the player more graphics settings there are a ton of settings coded that you can change in the config file that help it run better on older pcs it s a little weird that you can t just do it in game the game itself is fine it s a bit dumbed down from previous titles and more like a standard shooter than an rpg dialogue options kind of suck most of the time settlement builder is pretty good and fun i enjoy that part the most decent 10
