2015 this game is honestly a work of art the story told in the first episode alone is incredibly compelling and frankly i m overjoyed to live in a time that makes things like this the game is a little cheesy on some of the dialogue but not nearly as much as you d expect from a game about teenagers written by adults 9 9 10
