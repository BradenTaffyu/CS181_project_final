2015 early access review i ve played most of the survival games out there and this has to be by far the best one available the devs are very active and are adding things at a very reasonable rate with consistent patches and updates this game just has everything you want zombies and tons of them especially at night when they turn into 28 days later crack zombies building you can build underground above ground build castles huts shelters expansions on already existing buildings the things i ve seen in this game amaze me the creativity of some people is astounding i ve literally seen kilometer long tunnels leading from a base to a nearby town i ve also seen castles surrounded with spikes and hidden doors passages the looting system is also great items generally spawn every 7 in game days which is a very reasonable amount of time the randomly generated maps are amazing and literally endless so you have to potential to find hundreds of towns etc so much freedom you can even deconstruct buildings in towns use dynamite to blow things up chainsaws augers the leveling system is very well done too and very unique as it hasn t been done in other popular survival games as you level up you become more efficient at crafting being able to create higher tier items at first you ll be able to create faulty items which are the lowest quality as you level you ll be able to create from faulty poor good fine great flawless it takes forever to gain a high enough level to make flawless items so you can spend lots of time leveling up which adds highly to the game playability there s also pve servers for people who don t want to deal with pvp every server i ve joined the admins are great and active if anything happens they re generally happy to help regardless of the situation highly recommend this game over every other survival game available don t read anymore reviews this game is in alpha and is very playable and has lots to offer in content features and enjoyment
