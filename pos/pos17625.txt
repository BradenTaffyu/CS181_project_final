2016 the best total war i ve played since the original rome and yes i m an old timer the factions all play vastly different from each other in both grand strategy and real time but appear to be reasonably balanced in strenghts and weaknesses it s graphically beautiful the campaign will absorb you for weeks if not months and it s the type of tw that you ll come back to again and again for pure escapism this is the game you need in your life it could have used some more of the really excellent fmv throughout the campaign but overall it s genuinely a highly recommended game for strategy gamers i have very little bad to say about it as i experienced no bugs or issues the launch was the best one i ve seen for the entire franchise 95 100 gaming gold right there
