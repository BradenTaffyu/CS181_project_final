2017 hey first review here so don t expect an expert in video games but in real american trucks i am i drive trucks since 1993 i like racing sims like asseto corsa and the likes when i saw european truck simulator on sale i gave it a try not expecting much i do this for a living remember i got hooked this is almost like the real thing don t skip parking your trailers it s the best part use your mirrors not your views i had to try american truck simulator they have a peterbuilt just like the one i drive at work the american version is much harder because the trucks and trailers are so much bigger this is great i like the fact that you can build up your garage and your fleet using loans or just plain waiting and working for it hiring a i drivers to drive your other trucks you can have multiple garages internet radio and the music player that plays your own music genius well that was my bit if you want the almost true feeling of driving a big rig on the road look no further
