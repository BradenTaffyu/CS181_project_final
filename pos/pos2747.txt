2021 one of the best rpg s i ve ever played it most definitely has its flaws but the challenge you can get from this game is absolutely mint some things to note before buying this game 1 it s armor system is unlike most other games it blocks status effects and crowd control until it is removed then they can be applied a couple of feats you can pick up can bypass this on enemies but that s the exception not the norm 2 if you re playing through this game for the first time don t feel bad if you can t play it at the highest difficulty it s not meant for a first time playthrough but to challenge experienced players on subsequent ones with more enemies more intelligent enemy ai and of course stronger enemies as well 3 when building your party composition it s better to do all 4 magical all four physical or two and two i do not recommend you go with one person solely as one thing and the other three as another as that one person all by themselves will not be contributing much to fights 4 there is no tank in this game that sort of role doesn t exist there are also no traditional classes optimizing for certain builds is of course a thing and for harder difficulties almost mandatory but the sky is the limit with your imagination so long as you play within the confines of the systemhope you enjoy the game feel free to hit me up if you re new and would like someone to play with game plays just fine solo as well but games are always more fun with others
