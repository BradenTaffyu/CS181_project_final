2023 this is my first video game review but i felt compelled to write it i m old enough to remember when the atari console came out haven t really played video games since 2015 or so ori and the will of the wisps was my first game getting back into it and it reminded me how much fun video games can be i liked that you unlocked skills as you played giving you time to master them before increasing your skill set the worlds were rich and beautiful and the soundtrack made it feel like i was in a movie being old i am not a big fan of the open world just go and around gta style this game naturally guided me through to the end which i like wish i could wipe my memory and play it again as new this game is a gem
