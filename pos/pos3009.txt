2016 divinity original sin 2 is one of the best rpgs available it s at least in my top 3 favorites if not 1 but it s probably 1 updating review from classic edition i ve been playing through the game again and i would say that almost all of my prior gripes with the game have been resolved for definitive edition they significantly reduced level bloat although i wish they d reduced it more but at least now it s not absurd like it was before i m not running into nearly as many bugs and the ones i have run into have workarounds saving and reloading the game fixes most of them as i had stated in my prior iteration of this review any claims that the game is too difficult are completely bunk but larian for some reason believed people and added an easier difficulty than explorer if you can believe such a thing is even possible and i m fine with this solution since it doesn t affect the higher difficulty levels actually i found the game to be too easy before even on tactician i beat it with a 1 character party without much trouble which ideally you shouldn t be able to do and they seem to have somewhat addressed that as well as the game does seem a bit more challenging now without being unfair if you haven t played since classic edition they did add new content to the game and not just in the form of those gift bags i m still on act 1 of my new 1 man army run and i ve found at least 2 new areas also some of the content was modified a bit that crab on the beach can kick your ass in the early game now whereas before it was just a joke there are also some new questlines that appear to continue on to further acts
