2023 i don t know if you can tell by my hours but i love this game i ve been spending so much time jamming to it s music finding fish to level my sushi recipes and other stuff it s funny pretty and the story is super easy some of the boss fights are hard until you figure things out i have found that some of the quests will come back around so if you don t succeed at them you can try again another time 10 10 this is a blast
