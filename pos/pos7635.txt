2018 early access review i am currently a traffic crash investigator for a sheriff s department in the us not only is this game fun it has the potential to be a great tool in the field of traffic crash reconstruction the physics engine hands down is very close to the real thing part of my job consists of taking real world crash data reconstructing and mathematically remodeling crash and vehicle dynamics that said not only is this game simulator really extremely fun it has the potential down the road to aid law enforcement in the reconstruction of fatal crashes similar programs that take raw physics data and convert them to 3d renderings such as this one can go for upwards of 50 000 although beamng drive is not to the level of forensic software it could be with some tweaking and insight i highly recommend this title and i can t wait to see what future updates hold there are some bugs but this isn t the full game and is to be expected to the developers consider speaking with a consulting firm in crash reconstruction to get the correct formulas equations etc and you could possibly license a professional version which could spell big money some type of mode to enter real world vehicles manipulate vehicle weights be able to place them on a road at certain angles and certain speeds etc would be awesome i can tell you already that the game in its current state will yield crash results in the same ballpark very close to the real world
