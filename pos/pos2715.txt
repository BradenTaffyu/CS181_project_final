2018 i spent 60 hours playing act 1 a couple times without realizing the whole thing was a tutorial act 2 is twice as big there are a total of four acts even if the latter two are only as long as the tutorial this game will still take me more than two hundred hours just to finish i could tell you about the fantastic quest writing the amazing characters the delightful and frequently funny voice acting the creative and deep combat system the gratifying loot the adult both sexual and distressingly dark world or even the gorgeous and performant art but most of all it s simply enormous it s a joy and a massive huge sprawling one at that the game is also as of december 2019 still being supported with patches minor add on content and interesting stuff like the dark eye gamemaster mode campaign along with user mods of all sorts some of which have been integrated directly into the game through an optional menu you really cannot go wrong
