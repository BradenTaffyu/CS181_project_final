2023 this is one of my only reviews i have ever left on a game and with all the negative ones i feel as if there should be some honest input for what it worth i have watched the dev live streams and map roads they have put out so hopefully they see this review the new campaign is 10 10 its a mix of total war style but with the true to its roots coh game play i don t see what all the negative feedback is about the units are smooth the textures are great game play is smooth and the voice lines are solid i am on turn 115 currently and have had the most fun in a coh campaign out of all 3 games the skirmish and coop vs ai multiplayer is great there is always a option for mods for maps all units mod and many many more to keep the game fresh but iv e had a great time with just the normal content i have ran a handful of online matches and no disconnection issue and hardly any lag on multiple occasions i genuinely hope that many of you read this and give the game a chance because truthfully speaking as a coh vet this game is in my opinion the best of the series game devs if you see this like you say you read in you re live streams keep up the hard work and dedication to the game we appreciate it
