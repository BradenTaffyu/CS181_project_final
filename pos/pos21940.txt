2016 if you liked dark souls 1 or 2 then just buy this game as it s basically the same formula with some tweaks if you ve never played a souls game then let me ask you these questions does the idea of facing a moderately tough for a souls game boss in the first 5 minutes without any level ups or extra equipment sound appealing to you do you like dark fantasy if you re a fan of berserk then this is definitely the game for you do you want a game challenging enough where even the most basic enemies can kill you very quickly if you mess up if the answer yes then is this the game for you if not then get gud or get out
