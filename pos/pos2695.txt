2017 if you like turn based rpg s with lots of customization and a good story to put along with them do yourself a favor and buy this game this game will leave you wanting more every time you put it down choices matter characters are interesting combat is fluid this is one of the better if not best turn based rpg s out there side note larian studios has shown how much they care about the content they put out by giving you the best they can offer did you notice the price tag isn t 60 did you notice the divine edition is only 15 but not at all game changing or content locking from the base game did you notice the game master mode wasn t a purchasable dlc that is humility right there they aren t trying to squeeze every last person for some money they are looking to create quality content so that we can enjoy it at for what you re buying an extremely generous price they knew the fan base and what people wanted and how bad they wanted it they still did not take advantage of us larian studios has earned my undying support
