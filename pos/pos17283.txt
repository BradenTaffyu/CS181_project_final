2019 alone i find the game boring and at times durring battles with huge armys a little overwhelming the totorial doesnt teach you enough quickly enought in my opnion but over the last week i have been having a complete and total blast with this game due to one thing playing it with someone changes the whole gameplay and its for the better nowdays i tend to find myself in a way naging some of my friends to play the game becuse its insanely more fun with other people the battles are also fantastic to watch with your troops and monsters fighting being able to watch other users battles makes the game so much more fun and having the ablity to gift troops to friends in my own battles so i am not as overwelmed and flusted really changed the game for me i would recomend this game for anyone who likes stratagy or like me just enjoys a game where you can have fun and work together with a friend my only issue atm is that the co op campain is only two player i think having 3 4 people playing the campain would make it more intresting and fun
