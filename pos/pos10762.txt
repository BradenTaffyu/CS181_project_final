2016 here is a brief description of my game took control of iran instituted economic reforms improving economy instituted social reforms iran adopts facism ideology iran becomes new persian empire new persian empire attempts to coordinate facist coup against iraq coup gains slight foothold but fails immediately new persian empire declares war against iraq iraq has much bigger army than thought war lasts for years new persian empire finally deals decisive blow agains iraq wins iranian iraqi war iraq annexed new persian empire declares war against afghanistan another underestimation war stalemates between the two countries russia britain usa france and pretty much everyone else get sick of my crap all declare war on new persian empire new iranian army fights valiantly but is ultimately beaten back but russian might territories begin to fall german reich offers membership into axis faction new persian empire accepts too little too late new persian empire leader calls for a full retreat to city of tehran armies hold out for a couples of years before falling to allied might and power territories are divided up among allies after annexation new persian empire leader goes into exile and an empire falleni am very impressed with what paradox has done with this game while it still needs a bit of polishing here and there i am very impressed with the feel and immersion of this installment even though they have shaved down some of the customization features that we were used to in hearts of iron 3 i still feel there is a lot for me to control and for me to keep an eye on to make sure my country is headed in the right direction strategically and i did not feel too limited on creating my armies divisions air forces or naval fleets one of the things i will miss is the ability to control how many different techs i can research by balancing out those resources with what is created for espionage officer training and diplomacy such as the system available now in hoi3 nonetheless still a great installment i highly recommend giving this one a chance thumbs up paradox
