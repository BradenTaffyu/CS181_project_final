2021 didn t even realize i ve spent 279 hours of my life playing this game and that was before i discovered the free dlc one of the best srpg s on steam every character is unique with their own backstory you ll spend hours customizing and re customizing your characters building multiple mastery boards crafting materials and grinding just to obtain new gear pets and abilities don t be discouraged by all of the negative comments about the english translation the gameplay and story more than make up for it
