2018 i feel like i have to write a review to counter the new complaints about 2 2 the latest update 2 2 le guin adds many layers of complexity to stellaris it should honestly be called stellaris 3 0 because the game post patch is extremely different planets actually make sense now and the whole system is far less arcadey and is more reminescent of victoria 2 with its pops and stratified workforce it s all done exceptionally well however many players will complain because they don t like the added complexity these complaints are absurd stellaris like most paradox games was never supposed to be a casual arcade game it just was like that because of lack of content and depth now that paradox added content and depth to it the more casual players will find issues with it but those players looking for meaningful gameplay will find that stellaris is much improved more and more devs have been removing content and casual players have been embracing it because lack of content means yay less micromanagement what they call micromanagement i call actual depth of gameplay and that s what stellaris added in 2 2 thanks paradox for rehauling this game and making it a much better experience
