2020 what a game and what a ride you have tons of action fluid combat gorgeous visuals a fantastic soundtrack a deep story with a variety of endings and more nier automata was an experience i ll probably never forget though will more than likely replay in the future while it was a couple of years ago when i last played i couldn t recall having any issues with the pc port i played on either this is a game you ll enjoy even if you didn t think you would it took me roughly 73 hours to 100 the achievements in the game offering bunches of content for you to play through in which you ll actually enjoy completing 10 10 this game made me feel like a pro has a soundtrack i still go back and listen to and a story so rich and deep you ll find yourself invested even after you re done playing do yourself a favor and play nier automata
