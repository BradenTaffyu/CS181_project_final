2019 buying this game will mean you either end up doing the campaign and not being able to complete the second mission because oh i don t have the game mechanics mastering knowledge to pass that minefield or log into a private server with your friends in sandbox mode and do dogfights with modded combat planes which means there ll be three fighting with spitfires and il 2 sturmoviks in the air while an targets you all from the ground with a futuristic 20 feet tall mech or you ll register on a rp server where you ll be able to fullfill your terrorist ambitions by blowing yourself up with a suicide vest on the main square with half of the server screaming in vocal chat to determine who the towed a red shirt guy s car without warning i guess it s decent so yeah buy it
