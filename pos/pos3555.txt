2016 at first i didn t want to bother touching this game nothing made me want to play it felt as if it was a mere waste of my time boy was i wrong i fell in love with this game and i m sure you will too the characters are loveable the gameplay is simple and the story and script is absolutely heartwarming and frightening at the same time a lot more work was put into this game than you can see for now give it a shot i m sure you won t regret it you ll want to revisit it again guaranteed 10 10 i wish there would be a sequel of the same caliber
