2018 i bought stellaris on release found it a decent game had my bit of fun and then went meh and left it uninstalled decent but nothing special the 2 0 update changed that this is the game i was hoping for old stellaris was a good 4x but not much of a grand strategy game stellaris 2 0 is a grand strategy game in the paradox tradition just set in space
