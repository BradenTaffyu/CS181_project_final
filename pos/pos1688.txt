2017 hello i m nathan otter you may remember me from shows such as cardiac emergency or dude where s my otter but today i m here to discuss nier somehow i never reviewed this game even though i played it for 139 hours well spoiler alert it s a really good game like really really very quite good playing nier really feels like an old love letter to arpg console games well i suppose it is a console game but i haven t had one since ps2 so it still feels like a throwback to me in a way it s tough to explain why nier is so good it s a grindy repetitive game but also one that loops back around itself so many times throwing weird things at you pony island style that it never quite loses its grip nier is like a race car on a wet track always on the verge of doing a dale earnhardt style crash and burn but somehow always pulling it off at the last minute you can t really know nier until you finish it then finish it again and again and again it ends and begins again so many times before the whole story is revealed and even though sometimes you may feel like sisyphus the original rock star nier keeps feeding you enough treats to keep you going one more round ok just one more i think nier looks lovely for a console port has a wonderful story offers many secrets and plot twists can make you laugh and cry and really what else do you want video games are what makes us the star of the movie nier does this amazingly well i guess the thing that lets me know i really like a game is when i m at work and want to go home and play it i can tell you this there were a lot of days i was at work thinking man i can t wait to get home and play nier if that isn t what makes a good game then i don t know what does i m nathan otter and thanks to a bunch of doctors and nine otters i approve this message play nier
