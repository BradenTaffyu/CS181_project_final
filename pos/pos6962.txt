2021 early access review it took me a long time to find a game that my friends and i could play together we are a huge group and it s always dfficult to find a mp that can take up to 10 players another thing is that when we were able to find a game for all of us usually the mp was not that good they were always not that much fun after a while luckly raft have all those things an awesome mp the game keeps getting better and better as you go i can t stop playing it
