2015 early access review tl drthis is as real as the apocalypse gets for video games i ve played lots of zombie games like the rebuild series state of decay the last stand you name it and this is the most realistic out of all of them this is a great game whether or not you have friends to back you up and every playthrough is different especially if you choose different traits in game although this has a few minor items that make the game feel less real like lack of clothing options or lack of cars this is still a great game that you should try at least once pros constant updates if you are using iwbums that is huge map lots of player made content very realistic mod friendly good community huge selection of items found in every day situations good crafting system good graphics very dynamic character upgrades players can get sick injured sad zombie speeds can be changed from walker to jogger to runner in settings still has room for a lot of improvementcons for character torso you either have a vest or sweater for character bottom you can only have pants and shoes or take it off no npc s yet i m not counting this against the review no cars yet again not counting against ratingwithout a doubt a 10 10this gives other zombie games a run for their money in terms of realism and i am scared and excited for this game s full release this review will be updated upon playing the full release
