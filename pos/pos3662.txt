2022 i am in a lot of pain i have played this game in its entirety 120hours is what it took to complete this game twice and receive all of it s achievements if you have not played this game yet get away from the reviews and any community posts just play the game and open the door when kel knocks if you are still reading this review and you have not completed the game 142 190 240 109 the true route is the first route i have played my initial opinion was what a cute game then it put me through all stages of grief 5 times and then gave me a phobia for stairs the hikikomori route portrayed my depression in great detail a constant state of emptiness i cannot explain how much misery this game has brought me but damn it s beautiful this is my favourite game of all time by far of course every game has its downsides but in game the downsides are very insignificant most struggles i ve experienced in game were when i was replaying it so upon your first playthrough you probably won t notice any outside of the game i have noticed a big downside of playing omori this game sets your expectations for video games very high to the point that i cannot enjoy most games like i have enjoyed omori this game is very well made written and executed and most modern games compared to this are just nothing like that that sums up all my thoughts about the game if you still read this whilst not having played the game and you are interested in playing it please do it s definitely worth it and because i knew there would be someone that was still going to read this i tried to keep the spoilers to a minimum thank you for reading my review have a nice day i will now cry whilst holding a mr plantegg plushie nate
