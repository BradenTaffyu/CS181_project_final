2018 i have about 7 hours in ats so far as of this review and i feel there are some pros and cons from a newcomer view to the genre pros very engaging content there is a lot of depth here to be had especially growing a company in the game dlc and workshop content modscons macos is very laggy regardless of the settings i wish there was a more managable way of checking for traffic left right at stops when using a controller after the initial intro to the game there s really no direction other than drive and make money it would be nice to have a path of some sort to each stage in the game
