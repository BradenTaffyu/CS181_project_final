early access review i was unable to open a door the key had been lost after i had defeated the boss by simply teleporting it across the map so i instead decided to commit towards a simpler solution i merely forced the door to become sentient and simply asked it to move to which he quickly questioned its existence and let me by it was a rather straightforward solution honestly
