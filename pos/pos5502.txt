2021 early access review my journey into qud started like most people hot off the heels of the sseth video laughing at all the dumb ways he exploited the game i came in half expecting to do the same but what i got was a beautifully brutal game that invoked strong memories of the atari 2600 era an age that i wasn t even born into yet for reference the earliest gaming experience i had was on the windows 95 98 i didn t get into non pc gaming until late into the ds lite and original wii s lifespan thus my only experience with the atari 2600 era is from watching avgn videos so being struck with constant feelings of nostalgia for an era i hadn t even been alive in was a strange but wonderful experience qud is probably one of the best recreations of an atari 2600 game on the market today an experience i never knew i wanted until i had it it perfectly recreates the wild west feel that early era gamers went through when everything was mysterious and nobody fully knew what they were doing of course modern internet and fairly extensive wikia entries means that you can do research on all the major hurdles the game throws at you but a high level of randomly generated world creation means that every run still ends up being fairly unique thus i d like to opt out of my usual review style and instead recall the many trials and tribulations of my various characters in it s place my first character was a plantoid goo girl she was heavily regen focused but not very well optimized she had psychometry and mental mirror with negative ego modifiers for example she was a humble watervine farmer in the marshes focusing heavily on defense with shield spec and massive regen she could sustain through most fights but didn t have to dps to overcome high damage swarm mobs she farmed the marshes for a very long time but struggled to find new hunting grounds after that at the time i didn t realize how unlucky i d gotten with my six day stilt markets which were dominated by chefs and had not a single book seller or tinkerer in sight i lucked into the flaming ray mutation early on and this became her primary damage source so she went east to try her hand at golgotha but got shredded many many times i hadn t discovered goatfolk farming for carbide items and xp yet so i instead travelled farther east into the banana groves there she found her true calling a shopkeeper offered crystalline weapons armour i only had steel and an electrobow when i first arrived and high level trees could be farmed for huge xp gains so for many ingame weeks she literally became one with the jungle feasting on the essence of fellow trees and trading in thousands of jars of jam for crystalline equipment forged from the energy of the stars themselves with these upgrades and about 15 additional levels she was able to tackle golgotha bethesda susa and the tomb of the eaters she still struggled she barely survived the long conveyors of golgotha and hostile mechanimists made bethesda susa the hardest fight of her life i realized she just wasn t strong enough for any additional lategame fights so at the peak of the tomb of the eaters she crossed into the afterlife and ended the run after getting bored of several quick true kin runs my plant girl was reborn she traded all her mental mutations for freezing ray and thick fur this run i discovered many new things i learned how wild and beautiful randomly generated villages were i had two desert villages spawn close to each other that both drank acid each asked me to spy on the other and i had a town of friendly madpoles spawn in a village completely flooded by water with it s outskirts a mess of spare farmland single tile ponds holding gigantic fish sseth s everything eventually runs out of limbs quote became my official doctrine i went heavy into axe specialization bucklers on each arm which to this day remains my favourite combat build my six day stilt had two tinkerers and i discovered how amazing tinkering was i still grinded the jungles for xp and jam but discovered that you could grind goatfolk for carbide equipment as well through sheer luck i had enough molluscoid reputation to water bond with slog and transform myself into a giant slug i discovered how op strength was because with 6 from the transformation i now had the stats for decapitation berserk could shred cheese high level fights with instant kills after some more exploring i decided to soft retire the character at level 35 my next character was a true kin praetorian this run was generally disappointing because i wanted a charge focused build but was let down by how short the charge distance was even with starting pentaceps i realized how scary the game was without enhanced hearing and limb regen madpole rivers became serious deathtraps i got to level 27 after struggling a bunch with goatkin and soft retired out of frustration though later research made me realize that the biodynamic power plant i d picked up previously might be enough to revive the run later on my latest run was a high strength fire drake fire breath carapace armour and wings she instantly became my favourite character her massive jump charge range boosts from wings was everything i d wanted from the last run high strength let her rip through enemies with a halberd tough impossible opponents could be instantly eliminated with berserk decapitations carapace let her deal with elemental enemies much more easily and completely ignore the incinerators at the tomb of the eaters she contracted mumble mouth on her face very early into the game which was the most optimal infection i could have asked for i kept it the entire run the endgame map was absolutely littered with secret locations because of it she somehow had enough rep with robots to have them be neutral to her so she could just waltz through the deathlands loot to her heart s content and eventually got good enough to take down leering stalkers and chrome pyramids 30 levels deep into some ruins she discovered the subterranean caverns an area where zetachrome items just lay about on the ground where trash swarm enemies from mirror spawners reflect 100 of your damage back at you and where electrical cherubs can attack 5 times in a single turn one shot you by the end of a few expeditions i had more money and tinkering items than i knew what to do with remember how sseth had never seen the metacrystal tinkering component i found about 18 antimatter batteries containing 1 each on my first trip alone now i m in a sort of limbo i m experimentally flip slopping between a full psychic esper slug and an electrical variant of my dragoness having reached the end of the current story several times and knowing that eventually money exploration have no real value in the ultra lategame i ve sorta hit the maximum value of this game for now it is still in development after all in conclusion qud has been a strange and magical journey for me it s weird and wild sometimes a little cryptic and harsh but also incredible to experience even with it s spawning oddities and occasional balance inconsistencies it s also not for everyone i have a soft spot for low visual games with good stories but if you re used to modern spectacle shooters than the ultra simplistic art style might be hard to adjust to you must do your research before starting though qud s entry fee is steep if you re unprepared you ll get shredded if you re prepared you ll still probably get shredded but less often do not play on permadeath though while an admirable concept there s lots of instakill bs in this game and nobody should have to grind 40hrs only to die to something in 3 seconds roleplay mode strikes a good balance between having to respawn at towns but not having you lose everything for making a single mistake worth a recommendation but seriously do your research first
