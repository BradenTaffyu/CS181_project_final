2016 early access review the first original sin game was my favorite title of 2014 and i have been impatiently waiting for the sequel from the moment i finished it i am pleased to report that it has been well worth the wait larian studios have a fundamental understanding of what makes a good sequel divinity original sin 2 keeps the things that made the original great and builds on the areas that were lacking the art design is even more stunning than before and the one act currently available is packed with things to do i ve already found numerous clever ways to solve both major and minor quests combat arguably the most important aspect of the game has remained largely the same with the addition of new mechanics such as height and cursed surfaces to keep things fresh the plot in the first game was one of my few complaints as it felt generic and poorly paced in places however in original sin 2 i find myself much more intrigued and very much like what i have seen of the story so far although the game is still in early access as i write this it already feels like a straight upgrade from original sin 1 as far as criticism goes the music currently feels slightly lackluster although being able to choose a special instrument to play during climactic moments is a novel idea one of my complaints from the first game was that by the end of it combat had begun to feel tedious as i said combat is still fundamentally the same but i have yet to explore all the new features and i hope they keep combat exciting across my multiple inevitable playthroughs of course as an early access title bugs and glitches come with the territory but i have yet to experience a game breaking one i am currently playing on ultra on a moderately powerful laptop and performance has been stable with an average fps of 60 65 in conclusion did you like divinity original sin if yes you ll love this one too if for some reason you didn t you re not going to find a completely new experience here although it might have fixed what you disliked if you re new to the franchise i d always suggest buying the finished first game over the unfinished early access game but if you re a fan of turn based rpgs you ll likely get more than your money s worth i have a huge amount of respect for larian studios and i don t doubt for a second that divinity original sin 2 will only get better from here
