2016 best optimized total war game i have ever played i can run everything on ultra settings and i have a gtx 980m 8gb even shogun 2 had problems with my card but warhammer runs buttery smooth true it gets a little laggy if i host large 2v2 battles but that is more of the army animations becoming laggy rather than the game itself but most battles aren t that huge and thus runs perfectly fine i gotta give it to ca after the horrible launch of rome 2 and the mediocrity of attila i was beginning to worry about the future of the franchise total war warhammer has reinvigorated veterans of the total war series like myself and put renewed trust in this company right now i would say the game sits at an 8 5 out of 10 give us more races like the elves or skaven and this would easily bump it up to a 9 10 a solid strategy game and here s hoping it s the start of something wonderful
