2020 early access review i grew up on warband which is a masterpiece of a sandbox game i liked bannerlord it s visually beautiful especially the armor and landscape but the pacing of the early access is much slower than warbard catch me training my army for a good 20 30 hours of gameplay before i could even think of creating my own kingdom don t get me wrong combat is excellent and the visual of the huge armies is spectacular but it gets repitive the pace of the game moved faster in warband i advanced in a kingdom faster trained my favorite army talked some guy into marrying me and delcared myself as i am the rightful ruler of calradia and then started conquering the map the flow of the game felt right the flow of bannerlord doesn t quite feel right the mechanics have the potential to be excellent the whole mini board game thing is fun and i like the more customed interactions but they don t feel like they go anywhere substantial it seems harder to gain favor and then another long time to be in a stragetic position to use that favor speaking of give me a track lord feature on the map or give me death the potential of the clan family feature and the re vamped governing system are very promising as are the new economic opportunities and these might shine as new additions but even they can feel cumbersome when added to by the game s slow pace the quests are rough they aren t actually enjoyable but in warband at least they were relatively simple and a break from battle bannerlord s are more drawn out with no new experiences added bonuses than regular gameplay you either fight or talk to people it s the same as the entire game you just have to ride across the entire map first these games aren t skyrim and it shouldn t be but would be nice to need to use some degree of skill to complete a quest or solve a puzzle rather than just legwork i m still incredibly excited to see this game s finished product and it was immersive and fun for a good while but i might return to warband which still feels like my medieval home and wait another few months for new updates
