2016 i am a fire keeper i tend to the flame and tend to thee the lords have left their thrones and must be deliver d to them to this end i am at thy side the fire keeper introductionto cut a long story short dark souls iii is a great game and also a perfect start for anyone that has not played a souls game to date from software came up with interesting ideas to make weapons more diversified the world and most of the levels are interesting and full of secrets and as usual there s a lot of hidden lore for people that are interested in story and motives however from my point of view the game has also lost a bit of the atmosphere and essence of the early souls games especially the feeling of hopelessness and solitude is even rarer than in dark souls ii and the difficulty of the journey changes a lot between challenging and cakewalk according to director miyazaki from software will now focus on new projects and dark souls iii will be the last souls game for the next years on the one hand this is a sad message but on the other hand i m glad that the quality does not decrease with yearly new instances without many changes the kingdom of lothric and its tragic storythe overall story is as usual in a souls game based around the cycle of fire and dark fire is fading and you have to return the five lords of cinder to their rightful thrones in order to link the fire once more this time you are neither an undead nor a bearer of the curse but an unkindled one born from the ashes of an undead warrior that failed on his mission everything is as ominous as ever and leads the protagonist into a long and dangerous journey through the kingdom of lothric there are lots of areas items and names that link back to the precursors and there are some really atmospheric levels with great design and architecture and lots of hidden secrets and loot i d like to mention archdragon peak lothric castle and the grand archives here by the way the game looks gorgeous from software was finally able to spice the game up with some beautiful graphics in addition to the fantastic style here is a screenshot to give you a better impression the view of firelink shrine a screenshot of dark souls iii by nv sure all souls games looked good due to their unique style but the amount of muddy textures was simply too damn high in the earlier titles gameplayaside from the fact that the whole game feels a lot faster and agressive than the precursors there are some changes to spells and dual wielding in general and the new weapon arts from software brought the mp system from demon s souls back and went away from the fixed amount of casts ashen estus flasks are used to recover the so called fp focus points and the attunement stat now gives more fp in addition to attunement slots moreover they changed the dual wielding system not every weapon can be used for dual wielding styles anymore instead there are some specific dual wield weapons like e g the brigand twindaggers every weapon has also a weapon art a powerful special attack like a mighty blow or a useuful skill like e g a quickstep some of them are defined by the weapon class e g the weapon art of most straight swords or shields is the same but some are truly unique this gives some extra spice to several weapons and finally makes many of them feel more diversified aside from raw stats multiplayer and pvpfrom software has finally included a password function for easier access to e g co op games or fight clubs aside there s the usual stuff several convenants with different goals the summoning for bosses and areas and interesting frustrating pvp that is always a difficult topic in the souls games you can definitely rant hours and hours about it especially about balancing and viable options however i have to admit when you get a good opponent that plays a fair duel things can be a lot of fun despite the typical git gud massacre unfortunately from software dropped interesting convenant ideas like e g the rat convenant you made others invade your world to lure them into a madhouse full of traps and enemies contraone thing that bothers me a lot in this game is how it handles ng it s a massive step backwards compared to dark souls ii which did something amazing here it changed stuff in ng there were not only new drops to many bosses but also you were able to encounter a lot of new phantoms in the areas there were changes in some boss fights e g the two pyromancers during the lost sinner fight and even stuff that surprised you completely like e g the two pursuers in the throne room or the surprise attack of duke s dear freja on your way to brightstone cave tseldora this brought some variaton to the game which was really needed in ng from my point of view unfortunately they left this out of dark souls iii aside from upgraded rings that you can only find in ng and ng ng is exactly the same it s a pity those were fantastic ideas and a great start to a more diversified changed ng moreover i have to say the game feels pretty easy from time to time sure some bosses give you a nice challenge when you fight them for the first time but afterwards i rarely had a problem the feeling of winning after trying over and over was so rewarding and i kind of miss this for most parts of the game maybe that s the point i already spent a lot of time in the souls games and earned a lot of experience i guess for everyone that plays the series for the first time it s still pure madness a shame that there s no champion convenant this time though conclusion dark souls iii shows me once more why i love the series design architecture and style of the world are fantastic the gameplay is fluid and responsive and exploring the areas feels worthwhile moreover the lore is amazing and i love reading all the little hints and listen to the mysterious dialogues there are some challenging areas and you are always happy when you find an interesting weapon or level up your character sure aside from all the good facts i also mentioned many points that are from my point of view weaker than in the earlier titles not all changes are great but that does neither mean that dark souls iii is a bad game on its own nor that it is a bad souls games those are simply aspects where i think that they are weaker than before but maybe i am a bit nostalgic here as we all know there were always flaws in the souls series and stuff like balancing was always a difficult topic e g the scrapping spear from demon s souls however dark souls iii has its own style and atmosphere and that makes up for a lot and moreover it s way more accessible for new players and a great start for anyone to the whole souls series you can respec your character many of the bosses and enemies are more forgiving for mistakes and in pve there s less ganking and less ambushes that simply frustrate you i d rate it 9 out of 10 points on its own and maybe 8 out of 10 points as a souls game damn maybe i have finally turned into one of those infamous undeads that praises the first game s and hates on the successors may the sun have mercy upon me praise the sun t this endorsement
