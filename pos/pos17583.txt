2016 genre turn based fantasy strategyi was a massive warhammer fan back in the mid 90s but haven t been able to get into the tabletop significantly since i played shogun total war a lot back in the day but haven t got into any total war games until this one i got this game on pre order with the free chaos expansion i played through the dwarf campaign on easy and no mods managing to earn a win after a lengthy session then i tried the chaos and beastmen achieving campaign wins with both and having fun on the way i only fought the odd battle auto resolving most due to the limited time i have to play games nowadays i miss being a student so much since then i have tried running unsuccessful campaigns as the empire and vampire counts due to what i think was an op chaos invasion with powerful armies and the norse types becoming automatic vassals attacking from all sides that was restricting my ability to capture enough cities for a win this i admit led to a few rage quits i have since experimented with mods and found one that disables the chaos invasion now i have played through with all three other races and had a great time dominating the map i have also tried a few co op campaigns these have been fun and although the objectives are basic you get to try out some interesting alliances the main problem i have here is coinciding the time to play the various races have there own unique objectives and through the free and paid dlc you can get more races factions and units these can be used in all your grand campaign games to add more variety i know some people don t like paid dlc but with each one i have got so far exc the blood pack i have felt they are value for money and give significant added enjoyment to the game there are loads of free community mods that allow you play the game the way that you want without paying extra money too i think it is just a shame that it feels the main story of the campaign of the chaos invasion was not thoroughly play tested for balance across all the races without it you are able to have some great sandbox warhammer themed fun though
