2017 tl dr at bottomif you enjoyed this review consider giving it a thumbs up verdict highly recommended when in rome total war rome ii emperor edition a screenshot of total war rome ii emperor edition by axii total war rome ii a magnificent experience that can best be described as a strategic slaughterhouse set in ancient rome with a significant emphasis on historical accuracy you ll wage war all across the mediterranean with legions ready to give their lives on your command considering this is still a total war game there s a wealth of mechanics you re guaranteed to have seen before and more than likely will see again so don t expect a significant amount of innovation here this is to be expected and i think that even just by improving upon what had already been established in the first total war rome game that in itself makes the sequel a worthy purchase however this is not to say rome ii is perfect or without flaws of its own as even still bugs manage to persist from the abhorrent launch which afflicted the game right from the start rome ii also has some moderately frustrating ai problems made exponentially more so seeing as this is a strategy game and a crafty ai can cut the fine line between a lasting classic or like the fall of rome a tragic failure veni vidi vici where to a screenshot of total war rome ii emperor edition by axii now as you may imagine rome ii involves enough fighting to satisfy even the most battle hardened legionnaire and is what you ll spend the majority of your time doing arid deserts without a man in sight gallic jungles brimming with ferocious tribesmen and all the high seas in between you will make these environments ring with the sounds of battle there s maps aplenty and while you may fight two battles in a similar forest you will never fight two battles in the same forest each battlefield has its own land features and you ll have to strategize how to best use these to your advantage in order to prevail against whatever foes may come you may think that this is the place where strategy would become crucial but to my disappointment i found that actually in more advanced cases it was the exact opposite yeah it s crucial that you use some basic strategy such as hitting your enemies flanks with cavalry while they attack your main line but if you want to go for a strategy even slightly more advanced such as using part of your force to set an ambush in the treeline you re all out of luck i ve tried many times to lay an ambush among the trees and every time without fail the ai seeks out my men and annihilates them before any plan can be executed you may think that this is just poor planning on my part and there s a good chance you re correct but it s pretty suspicious that even when i place hidden units far behind my main force the ai still seeks them out relentlessly as if they knew they were there from the start this highlights a massive problem within rome ii the ai can never function strategically in the same way that a human player could meaning that they ll never use much strategy and instead try and engage you in a head on brawl this removes the element of preplanning from battle strategy and instead forces your focus on how you ll handle your men and adapt tactics once the bodies begin to litter the field while this is certainly a major issue it still doesn t take away from the sheer magnitude of just how breathtakingly enjoyable these battles actually are i found myself fighting battles even against foes i outnumbered almost five to one just because it s so satisfying to control such immense armies feeling like a general barking orders and implementing grand strategies there s substantial variety in unit design and function for each faction which always allows you to form any army to attempt just about any strategy you want and especially helps with managing difficulty if you re having too much trouble then you can simply make some modifications to your army toss in some new units remove a few more and head right back into battle hopefully with better results no matter the flaw and no matter how big it may seem in the end the battles of total war rome ii still feel massive and brutal just as they should be sim city 27 b c nightfall a screenshot of total war rome ii emperor edition by axii when you aren t busy fighting you re going to be managing your empire on the map screen where you can view your various cities and the buildings within them as well as the terrain and just about everything else pertinent to your rule there s a variety of factors which are going to contribute to either your success or failure in running an empire in total war rome ii chief of which are food and public order both aiding or hindering your rule in their own ways neither can be ignored unless you re a ruler who prefers endemic levels of starvation and rebellions sparking up in every city as opposed to peace and prosperity food as any poor peasant may be able to deduce is critical to not only keeping your settlements from slowly starving themselves into an early grave but also for raising more armies and feeding those that already exist you ll produce more food by building the respective food producing buildings though i often found myself extremely hard pressed to actually gather the food i required the problems with this food system don t seem to make sense one winter you ll have the perfect amount of food and the next you ll somehow find that half of your stores have gone missing this alone can and will cripple you by making you unable to form armies large enough to adequately defend your lands as well as making soldiers in the existing armies desert this doesn t happen than often and the problem s also negated by the sheer enjoyment you get of managing your massive domain though nonetheless when it does occur it feels cheap and unfair as for public order this is a lot more straightforward and less confusing since you can hover over your cities and see exactly what is influencing them rather than having to guess as you would with the food system throughout your gameplay you re going to have to constantly monitor these two factors lest they get out of control wreaking havoc all across your lands what impresses me the most is that i found myself often just looking at the map planning what i wanted to do and actually having to make strategic decisions on how i was going to march my army where to and at what pace among other factors the overland map truly impresses upon you the feeling of being an ancient general poring over a war map to ponder and plan his next conquest tl drtotal war rome ii may have had a frankly pathetic launch and has some flaws even still but neither of those can eclipse just how indescribably enjoyable the battles are making up for it all if you found this review helpful or entertaining then feel free to leave a comment and join my steam curator group at mudkips gaming
