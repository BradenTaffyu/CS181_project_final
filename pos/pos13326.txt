2015 the best simulation game ever i played this game before it came on steam and i really love it so i tought i should make a review because people need to know the hard truth about this game first of all let s take a look at the graphics the game looks like some kind of a cartoon which makes it really cool i shouldn t have done it in any other way it just made so unique than we got the possibilities this game has an enormous amount of modifications you can add to your game by easily dragging into a folder with the mods your game get so much more intresting to play with a million possibilities even without modifications the game is still amazing to play with many things to discover there is even a multiplayer modification which of course makes it posible to play together with friends or just random people and it s soo cool the developers of the game are amazing too they listen to their players and add suggestions to the game or sometimes add stuff to the game that has been inspired by amazing modifications you can easily play this game the whole day without noticing the time flying every time your ship crashes you are challenged to make a ship that actually can fly to the moon and if it doesn t work you try again and again and you guessed it again some people maybe think this is annoying but i think it s a good side of the game instead of beating the game easily you are challenged every time in this way to get more into the game and learn more and more about real life space missions you even got different things to do you can do training missions or other kind of missions you can start a carreer play in sandbox mode or even play in science mode which makes it possible to both do research on planets for science points and make ships using all the parts u want without unlocking them you can go to soo many different planets which are made so cool they all got things like drag and stuff based on real planets however some are changed a bit because it s still a game for example taking of at kerbin earth requires you to have a ship with quite some power while taking off at the moon is much easier because of the gravity there probably are some bad sides of the game but i actually didn t discover those yet however if you are using modifications they may sometimes don t work quite well together and sometimes make your game suddenly crash but this isn t the fault of the developers so don t blame them if you want to see someone else s perspective of the game you should check out some other reviews but my advice is to really buy this game if you like the things you see i would also recommend to watch some gameplays on youtube and maybe if you want you should search the internet for kerbal space program mods to see what kind of modifications you could add to your game when you bought it i will definitly keep playing this game for a long time and if i needed to give this game a mark it would absolutly get a 10 10
