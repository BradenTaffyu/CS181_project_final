2021 by far my favourite game of all time i learned degree level rocket science enough to pass a second year university paper on the subject then got a job literally building rockets for a rocket company down in nz all thanks to the joy inspiration passion and education i found while playing this game it can be anything you want it to be i m currently doing a playthrough where i only control my rocket using home made autopilot scripts with kos mod for a challenge only just managed to get to orbit at the mo with the best modding community of any game i ve ever seen the possibilities are endless
