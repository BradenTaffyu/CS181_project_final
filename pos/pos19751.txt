2016 i ve spent weeks playing this game almost litterally this is by far my favorite game ever made if you ve never played it before take a good 20 hours in vanilla to get a feel of the atmosphere and visuals then go rampent with mods and you ll have a almost current gen first person fallout game with true a dialog system fallout is suppose to have you re not playing a story you are the story my favorite roleplay in this game would probably be to go a steath small arms sniper rifle route with wild wasteland turned on for maximum enjoyment dlc is a must so get the game of the year edition
