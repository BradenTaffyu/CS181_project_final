2017 honestly the hours i have doesn t even include the pirated hours done as well as some offline time but if you want an honest review this game is a very great way to sit back and relax without too much of a care in the world besides the traffic and the haul you ll be carrying unless you freeroam this game has a crazy amount of support to the point of having multiplayer managed by a group of staffed unrelated to the scs software team however this mod is still in alpha stage and carries no traffic speaking of mods this game has a decent amount depending on what you re looking for most would agree that the map is currently pretty small but with map mods that expand the map as well as the scenery you ll be able to bare with it especially when you can use map mods as a substitute for the actual map releases we don t have many trucks but mods fix that mods pretty much fix everything for the time being until the game grows to be something magnificent like a butterfly
