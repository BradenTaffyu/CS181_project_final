2017 as a youtube comment somewhere so aptly put it came for the booty ended up crying god what can i say about this amazing game that would do it justice a masterpiece that s what nier automata is a work of art that thoroughly drew me in gripped my heart filled me with joy and stabbed me with pain like a good book i felt i could hardly pause to catch a breath i wanted to see the next part wanted to feel the exhilaration of the next battle wanted to no needed to know what was to become of the characters i held so dear even the pain was precious because it meant something it was real it was deep it was important it was i m not sure all i know is that i have 198 games in my steam library and have played countless others on consoles and pc over the years i m a pretty dedicated gamer games come in all shapes and sizes from shooters to top down strategy and it s hard to compare apples and oranges so in the interest of accuracy i ll say this nier atomata is the best action rpg i ve ever played if you want an in depth description of game mechanics and play style i m sure there are other reviews and videos better suited to providing you with this information but i ll go over the basics real quick combat a satisfying hack and slash system with a high skill cap which fluidly changes from 3d to sidescroller to top down depending on the situation a wide variety of melee weapons as well as several range options can be employed throughout the game also included are arcade style bullet hell sequences both in 3d and 2dvisuals i m sure you can see for yourself how good this game looks from a glance but i should also note the special effects character animations designs and environments are very well done and interesting music i m not one who usually pays too much attention to game music but the ones in nier really captivate and accentuate the atmosphere of each location and situation so perfectly that i must make a note of how exceptional they are this was also a big factor in how emotional the experience was story if it wasn t clear from my earlier rant this is the reason the game is so important to me to steal the wording of another review i ve read nier is never content to show you something interesting and then rest on its laurels it gives you one new wonder after another slowly drawing you into the game s world and its inhabitant s lives a sense of urgency and desire drives you forward and the unexpected twists and turns will send you reeling trying to catch your balance as you re thrown headlong into the thick of it again and again maybe i m getting more emotional as i get older but i don t think i ve ever legitimately cried because of a game before shed a couple tears sure but broke down completely not until nier i give neir automata a 10 out of 10 for perspective in my gaming career i ve only given 3 games a 10
