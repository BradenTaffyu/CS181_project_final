2023 i recently had a craving for an historical tw a game without single entity monsters or magic where there is a deep strategic layer and lots of tactical options i love the warhammer tw series 1 500 hours but wanted something more historically rooted so i sat down and tried shogun 2 after the latest patch it runs much better now but lacks the modern campaign mechanics and ui ux i now appreciate i also gave rome 2 dei a go i love the historical period and cultural diversity but don t miss the rng nature of the senate likes dislikes and agent spam i had left 3k after mandate of heaven with 100ish hours what put me off was the lack of unit diversity and the romance mode where single characters can carry a battle i decided to pick up 3k again and installed a compilation mod trom tup to give records mode a glow up 1 characters the legendary characters are now all unique with different weapons armors and customized skills we have to really take care to pick each character not only for compatibility with the court but also commandary effects given that the character level determines unit quality it s so important to attract and retain talent a key way to damage an enemy is just to execute their best characters within a few battles they are down to just rookie officers 2 economic management managing the economy food public order income is complex but also quite satisfying having cities specialize in food industry and or commerce and having characters do assignments to boost income public order character satisfaction and reduce corruption adds a fun empire management overlay to 3k this circles back to how important it is to acquire a diverse and talented character pool because getting 10 corruption and 5 satisfaction makes a huge different especially in the late game 3 diplomacy warhammer has pretty simplistic diplomacy where we sign up for nap alliances and vassalage in 3k you can build coalitions that are a stepping stone to full alliances and can established stronger relationships through strategic marriages my only wish was a way to offset the long term diplomatic penalty as a strategic threat from empire development as i grow my empire i have to conquer some of the smaller players and i get 30 to 100 diplomatic penalty from exterminating their friends it also seems that executing generals is generally a net negative very few factions will like this but nearly all dislike this even cutting down universally disliked factions like nanman or bandits or yellow turbans 4 unit diversity instead of spear ji and sabre militia dominating most armies until imperial dragon units emerge trom tup introduces dozens of new units e g pirates two handed hammerers glaive wielders with grenades with different unit caps and character specific regional recruitment there is a big spread between militia buqu and elite where even experienced militia units will break and run after 5 10 minute engagement so you really get what you pay for in the long run top end units don t unlock until level 6 so there isn t elite unit spam from the start and unit caps to maintain unit diversity well into the endgame 5 battles the heavy cav charges of 3k are probably the best in the series rolling over yellow turban militia units with cataphracts has the same visceral feeling as grail guardians plowing through skanvenslaves in records mode there is a de emphasis on characters and more weight on unit role morale and fatigue so there is a strong emphasis on tactical considerations like unit match ups and generating a chain reaction rout characters still play an important role there are some characters with unique skills like fire explosions that can basically chunk a militia unit by 20 30 and send them routing almost immediately i have already put in 80 hours in the last three weeks 3k will be my mainstay historical tw until ca releases empire ii or medieval iii
