2021 team hospital is back better than ever old school gamers will probably remember bullfrog rip who made theme hospital as a spinoff of their succesful theme park it was a whimsical hospital tycoon game before the term tycoon became a genre term with a heavy focus on humour you do not treat real illnesses instead you get farcical diseases such as lightheadedness where someone s head becomes a lightbulb and the treatment is to send them to a device which unscrews the lightbulb and attaches a new head or someone is rendered in greyscale and the treatment is to spray paint on them as the game goes on the diseases become increasingly more absurd and it can be real fun to just watch the sick people stumble around with all the weird effects that happen to them two point hospital is almost a theme hospital clone and that is a good thing you run a series of hospitals where you start with an empty building and have to create offices for doctors to diagnose treat and cure patients as the game progresses you unlock more and more different diseases and treatments for them and soon it becomes a real challenge to build everything you need while keeping up with the never ending influx of patients each hospital has its own three star goals with one star needed to unlock other hospitals so the additional goals are only there to provide an extra challenge with over 40 hours in i still haven t unlocked everything but i m at the point where i can say without question that this game is worth your money and time in addition to the hefty base game content there are expansion packs which add new items hospitals diseases and treatments and the game also features workshop support for even more content the music is also a high point the base game has fitting music tracks but on the workshop you can find a lot more to add and there is an option to enable or disable individual tracks
