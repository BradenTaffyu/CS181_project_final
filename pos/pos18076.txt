2014 im a fan of the total war series and rome 2 total war is a worthy successor of rome 1 total war i love to play the roman empire but i think that the romans have too strong units and if you dont play them they will lose miserably but i love the barbarian fractions like the germanic suebi or the celtic iceni also what i miss in rome 2 total war is the family tree like in rome 1 tw or medieval 2 tw but its still an awesome game 9 10
