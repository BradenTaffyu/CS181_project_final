2020 this game is nothing short of straight beauty i have never played a farming sim before this and honestly i thought i wouldn t like it because it was so different from the games i usually played at the time fps as soon as i cracked it open i felt the joy of 100 perfect headshots of a pvp match light up my cerebral cortex as my brain was melted by the gracious and time taking beauty of stardew valley the amazing 16 bit design of the character portraits freshly tilled ground and don t get me started on the fishing without any guides i made 15 000 gold before winter and even with watching guides you never feel like you re cheating yourself because there s just so much joy to it that it is impossible to ruin the game with watching videos about spoiler and spoiler i was amazed to learn that this was created by one guy mr eric barone may whatever god he believe in bless his soul as he has blessed mine with this amazing game tl dr great mind blowing 10 10 no complaints
