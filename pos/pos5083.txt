2019 honestly its still not as good as the previous titles even fallout 3 but its still fun in my honest opinion i didn t sink 220 hours at this time of review to think its not fun sure i may have modded it out incredibly though its a very casual rpg and thats what i like about it its something i don t really have to think about to play and its more something i can just sit back on the couch and play i can t recommend it if you re looking for an experience akin to new vegas story and roleplay wise but if you re looking for something just to play i can not great not terrible
