2023 a dream come true for fans to explore hogwarts however i would only give it 7 10 after the initial joy and wow factor has subsided i only enjoyed the initial part of the game once you play longer you ll notice there are some stuffs the developers could have done better things to improve better npc dialogue mini conversations npc are just spewing lines after lines with no relevancy when talking to one another in the living world no proper conversation increase enemy variety dynamic hud it s too cluttered dynamic camera controls explore far combat near quidditch update just play with mods and you ll enjoy it further
