2023 it is an aight game it feels like an ubisoft game which i dont mind ubisoft games but in this game it just feels extra generic which generic is exactly how to explain this game its just average combat is fun but then even on the hardest setting you face roll everything so youre really only using a few spells i never beat the game i quit cuz i just got bored but the story as far as i played was decent the sidequest where okay the graphics are ehh okay the art style is really good the writing is aight the castle is really cool though im not much of a harry potter fan ive seen all the movies and listened read a few books but thats it but even i enjoyed the castle so if youre a mega harry potter fan youll like this game due to that but again its pretty much a ubisoft harry potter game it to me got just boring the longer i played cuz the game got way to easy the leveling up feels boring like theres almost no cool attributes to level up at the end of the day this game is very very generic 6 10 slightly above average if youre a solid harry potter fan then id boost that score up by 28 10 for harry potter fans prolly is the best harry potter game out there i only recommend it if you like ubisoft styled gameplay loop cool magic combat as i said it gets braindead easy and harry potter also revelio youll be hearing this every 10 seconds and youll have to slow down to cast it so that batman vision slows down the gameplay so much when youre exploring lol you dont have to use it but with out it youll miss out on a lot
