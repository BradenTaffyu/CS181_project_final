early access review when i first got this game i d seen a short clip of someone playing in a video i was interested so i bought the game and tried it out at first it struggled to hook me in i was actually planning to refund it completely but that was when i accidentally went over the two hour limit i knew refunding then would only be a pain so i decided to give it another chance i will never feel that was about this game ever again i don t know what happened but one day this game just held me in its grasp for an entire week as i lived through the body of the virtual survivor on my screen people give this game a lot of credit but i would like to point out just how easily it can hook you in for hours upon hours just to see your survivor s life through this game although straight out telling you you are going to die makes death almost seem like the final goal you re telling a story you are the survivor this is project zomboid
