2019 early access review day 1entered a 3 story loot promising building i got cornered by walkers in a bedroom on the 2nd floor locked the door with the key i found on a corpse on the way in bang bang i had to escape somehow grabbed the window curtain and made a rope although the rope wasn t enough i hoped the jump wouldn t hurt much day 2 found walkers banging on the door on my way back to my hideout i flanked and started bashing one managed to get in the living room from the front door must have heard the tv how could i forget to turn it off killed them all too tired to cleanup the mess now must sleep day 3woke up in a rainstorm no day for scavenging i will stay inside and read for now but not before i clean up yesterday s mess turning on the tv should be safe now with that kind of rain outside i picked up the poor bastard s body and headed for the trees 10m from the house i threw the body in the mud and then two walkers appear from the trees i pushed the one back while the other managed to have a bite stupid stupid rule no 1 never feel safe why would i let my guard down day 3 afternooni panicked i just ran as fast as i could i locked the door behind me i know my end is near and the bite burns burns so much bang bang those walkers won t let me go in peace day 3 midnightthey broke down the door they are inside now i am hiding in the bathroom well i guess if you are reading this you already know that i can feel the fever taking over haven t eaten since yesterday i am really hungry hand itchy scratchytastydon t let the graphics fool you the game is very deep and immersive for me it s not just the gameplay it s a story every item pretty much in the game can be used to craft something else tons of options like a paper clip can be used for fishing etc has a crafting system which is great and the latest build 41 with the new animations is awesome i ve played a lot of other survival games i think this is one of the best if not the best i only wish multiplayer servers had more people but you can always play with friends love it
