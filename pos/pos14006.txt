2020 this game is a nightmare don t buy it still here okay masochist here we go i like the good city builder or factory game and this had an overwhelmingly positive score what starts out looking like a simple kids game with cute animated 2d protagonists quickly turns into those same lovable characters literally pissing and vomiting all over your tiny pathetic base then you watch some tutorial videos and try again only for your base to more slowly die an agonizing frustrating death then you watch a few more videos this is the 3rd try for me i m 600 cycles and 160 real hours in and i have finally reached an a point that i ve tamed most of the animals dug up most of the biomes have enough water oxygen heat pressure energy and satisfaction amongst my frustratingly idiot hero s to relax a little but of course now comes space i can t properly explain how complicated this game can be on the first full play through but the satisfaction of seeing my dupes live and thrive is it s own reward absolutely one of the best and worst games i have ever played i need some sleep
