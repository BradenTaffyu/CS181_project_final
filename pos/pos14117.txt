2022 this game is a fantastic colony management sim you have to manage every aspect work schedules excavation routes food production oxygen production air quality control and conditioning resource exploitation and more it sounds tedious when i list it out that way but it s an absolute blast to play you can also adjust game settings to make certain aspects of the game easier or non existent if you don t find them fun additionally there is a sandbox mode which is akin to creative if you re familiar with minecraft obscure title hopefully you ve heard of it the early game can be a struggle if you ve got your settings cranked up but eventually when you get yourself settled in it becomes a game as much about exploration and optimization as it is about survival the spaced out dlc makes this even more true i d recommend this to any fan of management sims or anybody who enjoys a game that can be approached casually or with a keen eye for optimization and synergy for the price tag 25 base 13 for spaced out on 1 10 22 this is an absolute steal with regard to how much fun you ll have with this i guess it s worth noting that the only con of this game is likely to be the fairly steep learning curve it s not much worse than most management games though
