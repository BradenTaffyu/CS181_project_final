2021 i don t normally leave reviews and this isn t so much a review as the story of my useless tamed raccoon early in my first run i realized that tamed animals sold for reasonable amounts of silver to caravans so i tried taming all kind of things long story short i ended up with a raccoon that i constantly had to adjust zones for to keep him out of my hydroponics walk in cooler gardens etc because this little critter would eat almost anything well to my dismay i soon found out no one wants a raccoon not settlements nor passing trade caravans and i m not the kind of guy who just kills pixelated pets for no reason i set his training on the highest it would go and forgot about him pretty soon i caught on to the fact that in good weather you could send your useless animals with your trade caravans and they would forage rather than eating anything in reach and i kept hoping against hope i d find someone to buy him so i send this furry little parasite out on another trade caravan and for the first time i get ambushed by 2 man eating yorkshire terriers i have two colonists with rifles and reasonable shooting stats and they miss and miss and miss one of the terriers reaches the first colonist and while he isn t a danger injured colonists are a pain in the ass and i would guess even more so on a caravan then too my complete surprise my raccoon intercepted the second yorkie and held it at bay until one of my semi useless colonists finally managed to pray to the rng gods and get a hit in that useless food sink went from furry parasite crapping all over my sandstone tiled floors to hero pet that saved a second colonist from getting minor scratches 10 10 would tame useless creatures again i disabled comments because i don t want to have to read about all the things i am doing wrong i am doing them wrong and having a blast great game
