2020 early access review this game is simply brilliant been playing these games since the original m b came out in 2008 and can say the long wait for bannerlord was worth it this early access game in its current state has enough in it to keep you occupied for a long time i m over 60 hours in and still have so much to do taleworlds regularly patch it and i ve encountered no bugs as yet so very happy once the mods start coming in upon general release slated to be in about 12 months the scope of the game will be increased substantially modding is what kept the previous titles relevant many years after they came out so i m excited to see what the future brings for bannerlord
