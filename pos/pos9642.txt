2018 been playing this game on a cheap wheel and the controls feel very precise if you like touge mods and an overall nice community this is your game if you lag then you have a garbage computer the only reason you wouldn t like this game is if either you can t drive or have no taste in racing sims this is the racing game you play when you think that forza is for normies peace
