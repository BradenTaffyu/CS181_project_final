2016 if you wonder why the stream rating is so low there are mainly 2 reasons 1 the developer made quite some radical changes and people tend to hate change omg i cannot employ the same strategies as in the last civ the devs are horrible people and eat babies 2 the ai is currently pretty bad that s a fact and it is indeed an annoying one update after the patch the ai got a little better still it is far from being strong after a few mods and tweaks this will be the best civ in the series i don t see any way around that it is already a great game and the changes they made over the previous civs are amazing everything fits neatly into place the only reason for me to pick civ4 or civ5 over this is the ai and i am sure they gonna fix this soon
