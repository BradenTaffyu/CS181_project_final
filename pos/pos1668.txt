2017 over the course of about 59 hours i 100 completed nier automatai would like to preface this by saying both that this is my first real steam review and i m most likely the least qualified person on the planet and that nier automata is one of the most beautifully symbolic and artistic games of all time and it most definitely kept me gripped through the entire experience yoko taro s form of storytelling made the games themes and narrative structure undeniably one of it s strongest areas the story is thoughtful and most definitely impactful and the way that the environment and character designs support the games ideas is perfect i do not want to get into spoilers because i feel it is something that every person who enjoys video games should play for themselves the majority of the gameplay mixes the typical platinum games character action style of fighting with rpg elements a lot of the gameplay also transitions into bullet hell style shoot em ups side scrolling hack and slash s and top down fighting sections the transitional gameplay really allows for an experience that stays fresh and engaging for the majority of the gameplay nier s music is another one of it s strongest area to the point where most would say that there is not a single weak track in the game i d certainly agree with this as i find myself listening to it constantly even after finishing the game up the only real issue i have with nier lies not in the game itself but rather it s horribly optimized port it doesn t make the game unplayable by any means but tinkering will have to be done for sure i don t know if it would be proper of me to call nier automata a flawless game as i am sure that someone out there will have issues with it outside of the poor optimization but in my case at least it was a flawless experience it s everything i could want from a gaming experience and far better than i could ever have expected i highly recommend this game to anybody who really enjoys video games when people call video games art things like this are shining examples of it so in my opinion i have to give nier automata a 10 10
