2023 a very pleasant crpg with an excellent 40k vibe interesting characters a lot of depth great music lovely visuals i dislike games that rush you this doesn t i can take my time and i love that and i do need time because there s a bunch of reading of the story and comprehension of the game mechanics to be done yet it doesn t feel like a chore at all i enjoy investing my time into them because the writing is excellent couple that with a lovely grimdark atmosphere which is quite unique if you ask me and i believe we got the game that many 40k fans have been waiting years for finally a really good 40k game
