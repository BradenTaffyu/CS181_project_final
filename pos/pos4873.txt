2017 fallout 4 is a good game that could have easily been a masterpiece if not for a few glaring flaws most notably among them the game s confused direction fallout 4 sets itself aside from the art direction and tone of past fallout games favouring sleek looking synths that look more like something out of i robot than any of the 50s sci fi movie robots that long time fans of the series have grown to accept as being simply the way those technologies advanced in fallout s alternative history seeing these machines and new technologies such as teleportation standing alongside the vacuum tube computer monitors and flash gordon jumpsuits really shows a desire by bethesda to take the franchise away from itself so to speak many of the things that exist in fallout 4 in terms of art and tone simply don t belong in a fallout game survival in post apocalyptic america doesn t seem so hard given how easily settlements are constructed how many people will flock to them and how simple it is to get access to food and fresh water by building a pump and planting some crops one would think that if fresh water was so easy to access with a simple pump that the water chip in the original fallout wouldn t be so important the g e c k in fallout 2 wouldn t have been needed to save the village and the entire plot of the water purification project in fallout 3 would be a little pointless the settlement system makes many aspects of the game simply trivial and the settlements themselves never come under any real threat building fully automated robotic turrets capable of mowing raiders and super mutants alike down is no issue in bethesda s newest take on post nuclear wasteland survival these things being said about the game s confused tone the gameplay itself is very good while the more hardcore role playing elements have been replaced by a rather trivial perk system that was hit and miss for me the weapon and armour customization is a lot of fun and the free survival mode is a wonderful way to play the game and if a player is so inclined to ignore the settlement system provides a new level of immersion and difficulty to the game s wasteland survival that the previous fallout games failed to master my fallout 1 and 2 characters would go weeks without eating food and my fallout 3 character used it to heal is wounds oddly enough the shooting elements are a massive improvement over fallout 3 and new vegas with enemies feeling far less spongy and guns behaving a bit more realistically the world itself is also a real pleasure to explore while i have seen this game criticized for having a smaller world size than fallout 3 or skyrim i would argue that there quality of the world is greater it is more full and encounters and dungeons are more likely to tell a compelling story as opposed to the dozens of generic bandit caves in skyrim and identical raider hide outs in fallout 3 the main story is driven through the selection of one of several factions i found the motivations of only one of these factions compelling without giving too much away the game does give the option to try and work with several factions if one is indecisive but eventually the player is forced to make a choice the game s main story is very linear outside of a few key decisions such as which faction you join and which ending you choose unfortunately the story s biggest weakness is that the villains are the least interesting that the franchise has ever seen the main villain s motivations are absurdly unrealistic and i could not bring myself to believe that even an insane villain would come to the leaps of logic that he came to and the entire evil organization that you work against throughout the entire main story does the rest of the game a serious injustice honestly this game would be better without this main story holding it back the game s fun though does not come from the main storyline thankfully if a player just wanders the wastes and in the case of the survival difficulty setting just tries to level up and stay alive while completing the many side areas and talking to the many interesting npcs throughout the wastes it is hard not to enjoy this game despite all of its flaws in terms of tone and story i simply can t call this game a bad game for how fun it is to explore the wastes forget the story the settlements and the factions enjoy this game as a lone wanderer and make your own story and you will certainly enjoy this game that being said this is definitely the weakest title in an otherwise very good franchise
