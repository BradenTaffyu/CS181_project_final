2017 early access review project zomboid is my most satisfying early access type investment this game has come a long long way from the early days of 2d sprites where the zombies looked like little green aliens to where it is now it s really fantastic if you love romero zombie movies dawn of the dead night of the living dead etc then you will like this game it s not an action game it taps into that personal survival story echoing romero s movies there is no storyline and your goal is to just survive and thrive this involves scavenging the huge world map managing your resources and building a base to live whilst engaging or avoiding any zombies that cross your path ultimately the goal of the game is to see how long you can survive before your inevitable death and as such the game has a brutal roguelike nature where combat is difficult and lethal and just one mistake can lead to your demise very often i find my over confidence is what leads to that one fatal bite that ends my character in an attempt to make the game feel realistic pz has a huge amount of micromanaging which i could totally see being a discouragement for some players eg put the food in the oven turn on the oven set temp let it cook remove from oven chop the food into a bowl etc personally i love it and it s one of my favourite things about the game because i can t get enough of that type of realism i want my game to feel like i m just some insignificant dude in a zombie apocalypse and not some hero controls feel good for the camera view and the graphics style is perfect for this type of game the devs are quite responsive on the forums engaging with the community and i feel they really do take fan feedback into consideration pz has experienced a huge amount of scope creep which has been awesome in terms of the game but also frustrating because the final game release date edges ever further into the horizon updates can t come fast enough and i say that only from a position of love and excitement for the game however if you are the type of person who does not have the patience to endure early access development this game is going to drive you mad i simply can t wait until the new animations and npcs make the game the modding community is outstanding and mods range from massive maps to new items to quality of life improvements workshop is also available which is awesome my final thought is if you love zombie movies especially dotd and notld this game is for you
