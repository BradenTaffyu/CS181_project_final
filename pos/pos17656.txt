2016 after even more play time and playing all of the factions i m revising my review i m still recommending the game barely however i am changing it from 4 stars to 3 stars this is a good total war game but not the best ca definitley didn t put a lot of effort into the depth of the game on a star rating i would give it 3 out of 5 because it is not perfect and has some pretty serious gameplay issues and definitely lacks in some depth compared to other total war titles as usual it is graphically amazing the battles are fun except the seige battles and the game will suck up a lot of your time especially if you play almost every battle like i do i ve never played warhammer so i was not familiar with the various cultures of the game however despite my misgivings about this latest installment of the total war franchise not being based history i did find it somewhat refreshing to take a break from rome 3 total war or it most likely would have been empire ii so far i have tried out choas empire and vampires and found each one uniquely different and not just in the units they can recruit their tech tree s are completely different as are the diplomatic options and the way they go about unlocking units and or technology forcing a different play style depending on the culture you select the game is also extremely stable i have over 90 hours and it has not crashed once kudo s on that so graphically great fun and engaging what is there to complain about the drawbacks of the game are things that most likely will get fixed with patches or in the workshop or with content purchases 1 there are limited factions to start i would really like to play bretonia however it isn t an option also the map doesn t seem as expansive as titles like rome or atilla offered although the battle maps except the seige maps offer a wide variety of terrain 2 the ai seems to be dead set on razing every settlement and to recolonize a settlement no matter if you have 2 units or 20 in your army will cost almost half of the army part of the problem with razing is because for some reason orcs and dwarves can only colonize their own kind or each others regions vampires and humans are likewise and chaos cannot colonize any regions because of that they just raze any settlement they can t colonize 3 another ai problem is the the ai has no strategy it just rushes you with everything it has and recruits like 10 archer units for factions that have them and pelts your soldiers with missles as they are engaged with the other 10 cavalry and infantry units think you can just use your own cavalry to rush them off think again because half of the missle units are light cavalry that can outrun and pelt your cavalry 4 confederations happen way to fast within 30 turns the dwarves had all become one confederation the empire and become one confederation and bretonia had most of their regions in one confederation which meant here were only like 5 factions left taking a bit of fun out of the game 5 also thankfully chaos warriors came free with my pre order because they are by far the least fun faction to play they have very limited diplomacy and outside of the norselands are just attack and raze attack and sack and repeat and so forth 6 added the seige battles suck you no longer get a town view in a minor settlement it s all done open terrain in major settlements you get half of a city one segment of wall and the archers even after attrition from starvation and towers will pick off most of your army by the time your seige equipment gets to the walls no matter how far back you put them you will also need at least 4 seige towers 8 total and two battering rams for each seige battle because the archers will destroy at least 6 seige towers plus any catapults you have 7 edit i initially said there was no group formation there is one but it s a little button on the group tab that you have to click and it can be a pain in the ass when you re in the midst of a battle to select and de select finale note it would also be nice to see some kind of a missle and or artillery unit for the vampire counts
