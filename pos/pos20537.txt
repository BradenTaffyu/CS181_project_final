2020 very addictive gameplay with hours of content i first played this on my mom s iphone 4s when i was ten i probably played it and it s sequel for over fifty hours now that ea bought the rights to it and remade the original this is the only way you can play the good old fashioned pvz popcap has always been great at making some of the most replayable games out there and this one may be at the top of the list
