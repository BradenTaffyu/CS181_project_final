2017 a great rpg and a great fallout game probably the greatest fallout gamer to exist to this very day i m writing this review story 10 10 what can i say the story is really great as it gives you options variables it has a compelling funny intriguing storyline with believable immersive and with good depth characters my god i love all the factions that are included with this fallout game graphics 6 10 for the younger generation they won t mean much as they are more used to the gta v or battlefield type graphics but for older generations like mine they hold at a good level these graphics are the nostalgic and satisfying type and with just a little modding to them they can be just as good as the newer ones but why would you need great graphics if you have a great story you can enjoy the latter if you don t have the former the modding community has made some graphical mod upgrades so if you re desperate for a new look go for it gameplay 5 10 the mechanics of this game are very outdated more than its graphics so you would need to implement some mods to make your gameplay experience a little bit better this game has the main story ones as well as some side story ones where you can explore new areas and meet new chacacters that aren t dependent on the main storyline also you can buy if you choose some ad ons or dlc these hold extensive and extended mini storyline main missions and can be used as an extra source of playtime there are also achievements included with this game and some require you to use specific weapons to complete challenges etc extra playtime at its best that is if you would want to continue your stay in vegas nevada soundtrack 5 10 as far as i can remember there is nothing that special about soundtrack in this game it s okay a standard fallout rpg soundtrack type overall 9 10 i reccomend this game for mainly achievement hunters and singleplayer adeventure story type gamers i believe these people will enjoy it more than other types of people
