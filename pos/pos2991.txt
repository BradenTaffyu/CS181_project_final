2020 i ve heard so much praise for dos2 but the rather long playtime had always intimidated me turns out that was rather silly because now after completing it at 130h i kinda wish it would ve went on for even longer i m glad i got to play this during the corona quarantine the immersive world and outstanding characters were just exactly what the doctor ordered the fleshed out combat system was a joy to play around with because it encouraged me to try many different character builds don t get me started on the writing the story quests and dialog are all so incredibly well written if you want to get even more out of the dialog make sure to get the pet pal talent just being able to speak to wholesome dogs makes this rpg a must play imo if that wasn t enough already everything is accompanied by the most amazing ost i ve heard in awhile rpg fans can t go wrong here and i m really looking forward to if larian studios can one up themselves with baldur s gate 3
