2018 early access review i ve never been one for breaking down the door to my neighbor s home and walking in uninvited nor have i ever been one for killing everything inside their house but i find it strangely satisfying to stride out of a house with my bag full of loot and my pistol still smoking traditionally games in the zombie apocalypse survival genre have lots of guns gore and a constant struggle to maintain supplies rolling in from early access 7 days to die is one of those games you look at and expect very little however i have been pleasantly surprised here are a few of my favorite things that make this game work what works you get what you put into it while playing 7 days to die you re tasked with the usual collecting supplies killing zombies building bases trend that is expected out of a game based in an apocalyptic hell known as navazgane or a randomly generated map with no guarantee of safe shelter players are in full control over how they decide to approach surviving in this place so if they decide to dedicate careful planning and teamwork if playing among friends into the game they ultimately will have a much better chance of survival what works specialization optionsbefore the apocalypse i was amazing at making one damn good apple pie while that skill is useful i doubt apple pie will do me much good in fortifying my base scavenging treasure hunting mowing down enemies with an ak or creating workstations the way the skill tree is designed as of a16 gives an incredible amount of customization options for your player if working in groups skill sets can be split between your friends one can specialize in creating armor and weapons another can specialize in using those to survive another could be the expert hunter and scavenger while you craft ammo by the cratefull even in single player the options of wisely selecting what skills to use and when due to the limited skill points available every level and the increase cost per rank will assist in keeping you alive and perhaps help in making your base feel a little bit more like a home what works noisezombies sleep like people except some fancy sleeping standing upright in the most inconvenient position for you as you attempt to get into a room while there aren t as many undead crawling around on the streets scavenging large points of interests or houses can prove lethal without preparations for run ins with sleepers breaking down doors breaking glass or destroying safes creates noise and that can make your neighbors unhappy thankfully sleepers can be taken out with relative ease with careful aim and silent weapons what works always evolvingi ve got more ammo than i can fit anywhere plenty of weapons a massive fortress of a base and still bloodmoons prove challenging the game is great in keeping players from becoming unstoppable survivalists while players can remain on top of the game getting cocky will often get you killed and very quickly bloodmoons will become more and more difficult as each week passes while you may not lose as many defenses or be scrambling to kill zombies before they arrive at your doorstep feral variants and radiated variants of zombies may be a test to your friend s defensive handywork and to your aim the further you get into the game what almost works sleepers are a bit temperamental in a16 proving difficult to predict at times or even absent entirely from poi s and occasionally spawning in behind the player as they scavenge the area that was clear only seconds ago while easy to handle if they stay asleep with a clean shot to the head the buggy mechanics can prove frustrating for players learning the ropes or even for seasoned survivalists traveling with them what almost works usually you see a bird and a dog and don t pay much mind to them however 7 days to die offers us a rather disgusting taste of both dogs wolves and vultures are all very glitchy and can prove frustrating to kill and deal with turning a normal stroll to the trader into living hell not to forget that a random heavy pack of wolves will spawn in some biomes every few days including the large black direwolf version of the smaller pack wolves the additions of vultures to replace massive wasps was at least an improvement in a logical standpoint though i m not sure how to feel about the addition of wolves on top of zombified dogs is it fun 7 days to die is ridiculously fun in my book while i prefer the game when playing with a party of one to five other people even on your own the game proves challenging without much frustration rewarding for what you ve done and keeps you engaged graphics would you look at that view i can see the entire apocalyptic landscape from here while the game isn t top notch in graphics having mainly geometrical shapes and repeating textures on many of its poi s cars and boulders the game is surprisingly nice to look at perhaps i wont frame it on the wall above the mantle where the family photo was but for what it is considering it being in alpha there is a lot of potential for graphical improvements sound i could ve sworn i heard a zombie but maybe it was just my stomach the sound quality makes up for some of the lack of gorgeous graphics though it too can be a bit bugged at times overall however it proves itself well in creating a creepy atmosphere when you re sneaking through houses for what was left behind sleepers most notably make some disturbing noises if you begin to wake them from odd groans to even human like snores it s also worth mentioning that i ve lost count of how many times i ve been in a very dark place only to hear footsteps of something that i cannot see controls the controls are very simple and easily customizable via the pause menu s option tab total control over movement and activity is fully at your fingertips using wsad to move space to jump ctrl to crouch and mouse to look it is an easy game to pick up without the need for ten million keybindings or memorization tl drin summary 7 days to die is going in the right direction it s a game that has no true end giving you the ability to play it over and over for as long as you d like multiplayer capabilities are stable and reliable and the skills tree allows you to customize your player to suit the situation at hand with the use of limited skill points both the graphics and sound quality aren t stellar but they go hand in hand in making this game easy to look at and even creepy and unsettling at times as you dive into old abandoned homes scouring for much needed supplies your actions can create noise alerting nearby sleepers to your presence and giving you some rather unwanted company the more you play the more you re able to do and the more you re able to do the more the game will throw your way a perfect balance of easy to follow controls challenging but not frustrating gameplay and rather decent quality sound and graphics 7 days to die is a recommended play for those wanting an interesting and somewhat realistic survival and crafting game
