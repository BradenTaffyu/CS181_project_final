2021 this is rough diamond of a game i am pretty sad that it seems so unknown there is barely anything on youtube or twitch about it and flew under the radar of so many people because it is largely one of the top 5 games i have played in 2020 this is a tactical rpg at its core a bit of x com meets fft with an anime like story huge amounts of content hundreds of hours worth and one of the most extensive character customization system i have seen in years nice art and music amazing characters that was for the diamond part now there are rough spots indeed i can t speak much for the stability issues because i wisely chose to play in offline mode but yes the translation is a bit amateur ish which makes the story hard to follow at times but it is not a deal breaker imho also even if the story is pretty enteraining all along the campaign opens all of its systems and possibilities at a glacial pace especially when it comes to expanding your party as an example it takes 10 15 hours to get your 3rd character but your patience will be rewarded if you stick with the game past its inital stage besides you get guests in your party before that and character recruitment has a weight and an impact in the story that would not be there if it was expedited too fast but overall those are small defects that can be expected by an enthusiastic independant dev team and they are largely made up by the amount of labor and love that has been obviously put into the game so it is a big yes for me
