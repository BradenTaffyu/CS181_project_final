2014 early access review one word amazing the fact it s in beta and it has this much content makes it incredible plus the in game map is only an hour from where i live so i kinda have that special bond with it devs are constently updating the game they listen to their consumers and they try to help fix every bug and take in request for items and things to put in the game 100 hours plus and still chugging along
