2023 putting this on steam is not really fair to the play time of my other games i have lived and breathed this card game for the last 30 years it s been everywhere in the spectrum of quality from cut throat constructed formats being unbalanced to oblivion to limited formats being perfectly tuned for player enjoyment while this version isn t perfect it seems to be getting better it s f2p and uses most the same shady business tactics as those but if you have patience and self control you can get a fulfilling magic experience from it suggestion for newer players grind some coins the free in game currency watch a few draft videos then use those to try to get 4 5 wins before 3 loses in a best of 1 premier draft if you can do that you can draft almost indefinitely while building up a constructed collection if you fail start a new account and get a draft worth of coins faster than waiting for more quests on the failed account you can do this a few times until you get a good run then just go back to the old accounts in a few days when their quests have built up again for free coins if you enjoy drafting it s a great way to play edit i recently started a new account to prove the above was reasonable and the results were better than i expected there is a path from the start to a lot of free stuff there are probably 3 4 free events available to new players that will give them dozens of rares from the precons some of which are format staples after the first day and about 4 hours of play i had over 5k coins for a quick draft you are also even 600 gems which is 150 shy of another quick draft so if you don t complete bomb out of the 1st draft and manage to get 2 wins you will have enough for 2 quick drafts on the very 1st day of play after this point i find i can grind 2k 2 5k coins per say so roughly another free draft every 2 5 days good luck out there
