2022 to be honest i was really skeptical about this game i really thought it was going to be really boring due to the fact i thought it was going to be just a simple cards game turns out it does have a history behind that the history its pretty creepy and complex you d think how a cards game would have such a complex interesting and creepy history but it does i really loved it it is the type of game that after you complete it you wish you could play more it does have replayability tho but i almost played the 13 hours in a row since i got so addicted to it i do recommend you to give it a try you ll see its worth every penny
