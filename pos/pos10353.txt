2020 this is for v1 3 10 overall this is the simulator i ve spent the most time with and still going back to it and i ve been on all major titles except ams so far i should probably also mention i ve always preferred open wheelers so factor that in too i e their lack of within acc physics and feedback are great imho the best and the rating system makes for a very welcome online experience it pushes you to improve even when offline i actually didn t expect the ratings to apply offline welcome feat i personally enjoy one click blind matchmaking which as you would expect gives better and better racing as i improve my ratings i also enjoy special events were you can set your times in the online leaderboard while taking your time practising and setting up your car if any of the following is your top priority though you ll be disappointed offline career mode individual offline races with ai are still fun smooth and high frame rates on low to mid end systems any other discipline except gt3 drifting or moddingeven though i m a bit disappointed myself on the first 2 points above it s still worth every penny other than that can t think of anything negative to say a few glitches here and there don t bother me too much every title has them devs are quite active and ambitious and there is a good community around it pretty educative stuff with aris drives or nils naujoks not just for this game alone oh and i almost forgot dynamic weather conditions and night are awesome actually came here to check intercontinental pack and thought why not leave a review never do but i remembered wondering should i buy it myself so hope this helps
