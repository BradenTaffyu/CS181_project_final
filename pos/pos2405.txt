2021 despite its rough start i can honestly say that this is one of my favorite games with a rich story and developers that listen to the players and their suggestions you ca honestly lose track of time playing around with friends which brings me to my second point play with friends yes you can play solo if you want to but to truly enjoy this game and the environment it creates get someone else to enjoy it with you as an online game its specifically designed with multiplayer in mind i ve seen too many people waste hours on their own and complain about how boring the game gets after a while this world they ve created its stories and people they hold so much more meaning when you share it with others and the game is far from dead updates continue to roll out and the seasons are a good way to keep you preoccupied while you wait for new content i highly recommend this game to anyone looking for something to enjoy with friends ps god bless the enclave
