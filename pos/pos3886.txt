2021 this is the most enjoyable game i played for a long time sometimes i can t believe the lengths the developers have gotten to give the exact experience they desire the characters are awesome the story is intriguing and the many mechanics make this game very unique for me for sure a game think about x com and final fantasy tactics but with a thing that i love that is it management of an organization and the impression that you are really living the story with the character it s a slow pace game that is delightful to sip slowly and try to understand the many mechanics and trying new play styles if you like turn base strategic game with tons of mechanics that make sure that each action counts this is a game for you put your mask and a spoon in your hart and dive into this game
