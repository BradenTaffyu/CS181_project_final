2018 after 500 hours i m finally getting round to writing a review of this game and it s expansion rise and fall civ vi flawed in many ways fundamentally it is a game that has so much potential so many excellent ideas to expand on arguably the greatest turn based strategy game of modern times in civilisation v brave new world but falls short in a few key areasgraphically the game is stunning the aesthetic issues some people seemed to dislike moving from v to vi are moved past easily once you see the fluid unit leader and wonder animations the day night cycle looks good albeit a little unnecessary and annoying at times and everything is clear on the strategic and world maps the music is also excellent each civ having their own theme that develops as the game goes on america s theme being notably one of the best pieces i ve heard in a video game for a long time rise and fall simply added to these with more leaders and more units all of which look and sound top notchgameplay wise there are a lot of positive improvements districts make city planning a lot more strategic and long term than in v where you could broadly keep your city up to date by chopping and changing tile improvements as you went the change to workers that means they now have limited uses fulfills a similar purpose wonders similarly use up space on the map though their value is disputable in far too many cases policy cards make changes to the fundamental bonuses your civ is receiving feel a lot more involved and a lot more intricate than just the government or policy tree changes of previous games combat is essentially unchanged from v if you re going for a domination victory the only major change is the addition of the encampment district which is vital to any warmonger loyalty means that expansion is tempered by a need to either snowball completely or heavily garrison your gains however which is a good addition but all those good improvements come with downsides the early game is even more heavily weighted in importance than in v unlucky starts can cripple you in comparison to your opponents wonders can sometimes skew things so far as to remove major challenges to expansion and teching entirely the colosseum adds both loyalty and culture to cities in range making it an absolute monster and religion despite having a victory condition now is less powerful than in v by virtue of its bonuses being a lot less passive and a lot more focussed on that victory spies are either useless or broken depending on circumstances siphoning funds is meh but completely stopping a space race part or outright stealing works of art is insane and often arbitrarily extend games the ai has no real idea seemingly as to how to use most of these elements which further reinforces the players ability to abuse such mechanics it says a lot that the developers made massive improvements to the ai s ability to use naval combat a year after release because it was frankly so easy to win with fleets before that patch and still isn t that hard to just steamroll them now all that being said it has the same one more turn addictive quality that it predecessor had compounded by the city planning elements that make you want to go back and try again with a new setup and synergies i adore playing greece and trying to find ways to beat the ai s to wonders around my parthenons to create powerful districts that dominate culturally and have done since release balance is actually very good though there are definitely currently civ s that are extremely powerful korea greece russia germany essentially any with a specialised district of their own and tech is still easily the most reliable route to victory because by its nature it provides two routes to easy victory space and domination in multiplayer i ve had issues with desyncing since release but it s never been fatal unlike in beyond earth and v where games would just collapse after some desyncs sometimes that s unavoidable so the relatively stability of the game on release and since is good overall civ vi is not an improvement on v but neither is it a huge step backwards it won t feel enough like a new experience if you re still enjoying v and sometimes my nostalgia for bnw kicks in hard but i don t think i could go back to it civ vi changes how you view the civilisation environment and that alone means it s gets my recommendation as something to try if it ever goes on sale
