2021 early access review there is a traditional essay style breakdown at the bottom of the page if you prefer that over the bullet point lists graphics paint exe needs a little work it looks nice enough its beautiful gameplay is it though meh acceptable enjoyable amazing audio cruel and unusual punishment it was not good doesn t add or detract from the experience it was decent eargasmic audience everyone kids teens adults whales pc requirements ti 89 its my moms exceptionally average water cooled rgb sunway taihulight for most players its not too bad but it can become a lot more demanding if you are an extreme player difficulty cookie clicker cakewalk challenging but forgiving dark souls guitar souls grind absolutely none non essential its not unbearable there is a little gameplay on top runescape story i guess that qualifies technically it was kind of bad its alright no story it was enjoyable i m not crying your crying game time that wasn t a demo my coffee is still warm it took a few hours it took a few days wait this game ends price value its literally free shut up and take my money if its within budget i guess if its on sale you could also just burn your money bugs literally unplayable literally unplayable frustrating but manageable its reasonably polished flawless thoughts summary as a veteran of the factory building genre i came across this game with fairly tame expectations decided to buy after watching someone else link removed twitch tv oversimulated play on twitch it was absolutely the right call the game is quick to pull you in and you find yourself entering that classic factory builder endless just gotta do thing first then i m done for the night loop it was the source of many late nights for me the spherical planets and multi system aspects of the game really brought something new and interesting to the genre adding a whole new layer of logistics to deal with personally the biggest thing for me that set this game apart from others is its end goal factorio you build rockets satisfactory you unlock tech all of these games have binary goals you have done the thing or you have not done the thing this game has that too in a way you technically win by completing a research but the central premise is around building the sphere the official victory requiring that sphere but the sphere is not a binary state objective you can win with a fraction of it done if you want but the satisfaction comes from building it and even in that you set the goal yourself through the design and size of the sphere you make want an easy and quick job no problem want to build a sphere so big it consumes the orbits of nearby planets and takes galaxies worth of resources can do that too furthermore you are rewarded not just for the task completion but rather instantly start benefiting from the sphere as you progress in its development so too does its power output and as such you feel as though you are constantly progressing and achieving things even though the task itself can take a staggeringly long time to fully complete i found the progression through this game exceptionally rewarding and have found myself returning after every major update for another playthrough on that topic the devs respond to feedback quite well and have put in a lot of work supporting the game since release these folks really care about and love this game i 100 would suggest this game to anyone that likes the genre
