2021 mixed feelings i ve had a ton of fun with this game but it can be frustratingly time consuming and impenetrable regarding some game mechanics you ll have to survive in a huge procedural map filled with resources mysteries and foes while dealing with the given and future circumstances that meaning you ll want to find resources to craft warm clothes during fall to not freeze in winter while overcoming fall itself you ll have to deal with the dangers of each biome with hunger with the long dark night and not less important do not let your poor character fall into insanity days and nights go by quick but the game forces you to stop and think if you dawdle the world will devour you in no time it rewards knowing what to do and when and taking advantage of the environment rather than aimlessly exploring and stacking stuff and it does pretty well my problem is that there are two ways to look at this game you could be aided by external sources like being lucky enough to play with friends that make a good introduction or opening tens of wiki tabs beforehand there s no pause option even if you re playing alone so you shouldn t look for anything in the wiki or go to the bathroom during the session trial and error this translates into investing a ridiculously high amount of time to gain knowledge you could make use of for later runs there are no explanations of any kind no crafting nor cooking recipes you re clueless there are a lot of mods to minimize these lacks so i recommend having a look at these before starting to play while it s cool that i had to get paper and pen to aid me and i did learn a lot learning the hard way was so much time consuming progress in exchange felt tiny and pointless to me so i took the next logic step which was abusing the wiki yet i don t think doing previous research or installing mods should be mandatory for a game like this to be played nicely don t expect this to turn the game into a breeze though that s the reason why i m not considering to revisit the game unless a friend is willing to play but if you don t mind the mentioned i d say go ahead it has a lot of personality and infinite replayability world and gameplay are full of challenges and they ll hook you with ease they are interesting enough and hours spent weren t torture whatsoever
