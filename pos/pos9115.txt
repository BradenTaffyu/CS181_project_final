2018 i ve been playing this game since day 1 that it came out at 290 hours of play i consider it a gem a rough misshapen gem but one that is always being polished and improved as you ve read in many other reviews the early game is fantastic but it starts to flounder the further you get into the end game this can make the game a living hell if you do one thing try to win there is no winning in this game the amazing parts of this game are the early game exploration the mid game crisis that was added in one of the dlc the late game awakening empires and the end game crisis the terrible part of this game is trying to conquer the entire galaxy i would recommend building up a formidable empire that has a dominate position in the galaxy and then start a new game knowing your people will eventually dominate the galaxy if the continue with the path you ve set them upon this issue becomes less of a problem with every updated version of this game as the developers try to improve the mid to last game the newer versions have been getting review bombed because they removed certain features multiple types of ftl to improve gameplay these features made for a more interesting universe with more diversity but that increased diversity led to increased balancing issues that left the game broken it was really cool when your worm hole civilization had one neighbor who got around by warping and one who got by using hyperlanes however it was impossible to plan static defenses with all of these options the ai was to stupid to use wormholes factions that used hyperlanes were doomed unless they could survive long enough to research a new form of ftl so they scraped the diversity in exchange for better gameplay while i do miss the stories you could create for yourself playing in the old complex universes those stories were ultimately broken since the balancing didn t work and it would unravel the further you progressed in the game i would highly recommend this game i decided to write this review to say thank you to the developers for continuing to improve this game i also wrote this review because this gaming community is a little toxic and i m hoping someone will read this and get so angry that i don t agree with their point of view they piss themselves if the recent reviews are putting you off on getting this game just remember that the developer is still releasing major paid and free dlc regularly they would not still be doing this if the majority of the playerbase had rage quit this game all your seeing is whiny toxic minority of this playerbase most of us still love this game and replay it every time a new dlc comes out
