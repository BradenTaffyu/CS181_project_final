2018 the game is good and i ve enjoyed hunderds of hours of fun playing it however the practice of cannibalising your core product to be sold piece by piece to the consumer as dlcs that ca and sega employ is shamful the total cost of dlcs when on sale is higher than the cost of the entire game most of these are unit packs which look like they have been torn out of the base game and cosmetic changes like the blood gore pack which in normal games are an option in the settings rather than a 1 99 dlc the campaign packs are mostly original and the creators deserve to be paid for them
