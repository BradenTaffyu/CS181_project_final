2016 early access review i don t normally review early access games and as we all know steam reviews serious business but seeing as i m already more hooked on this than a bunch of feminists on cheap alt right bait i just can t help myself from writing this surprisingly necessary message in a bottle about why you should or shouldn t buy this game and throwing it into a sea of messages in bottles about how much peeing and crap sucking is in this game so for starters there s a lot of peeing and crap sucking in this game if you didn t know already and really needed to know there are other things to do not an awful lot mind you but that doesn t matter because this dev plays the forbidden card mechanical depth while in a game like gta most of what you re allowed to do involves killing and driving and don t get me wrong i love killing and driving it will only reluctantly allow you to do things that don t involve killing and driving such as being a functional adult gta is like that friend of yours from across town who keeps offering you weed and gets you to do the stupidest crap more for his own entertainment than yours why would you eat drink and wash yourself when you can run a bunch of people over blow up a bunch of cars up and still get away with it in this bizarre slice of life analogy my summer car is more like your dad there s no damn food in the house do the damn groceries and don t forget my beer like the last time and get a damn job you slob and i mean a real job not that rally driver thing you keep babbling about except dad forgot to tell you who you are where you are what language you re speaking how to drive a car and how to get to the store but you know what will happen if you don t listen not knowing how to do things is a huge part of the fun and i don t want to spoil any of it but let s say if you think euro truck prepared you for anything trust me it didn t suffice to say getting things moving in this game is quite the realistic procedure and doing the most mundane of tasks generally involves fumbling at first and not really knowing what inputs are expected but once you get in tune with the game you ll begin to figure it out instinctively based on your combined knowledge of the real world and the game s eccentric control scheme rather than relying on established videogame norms then the real summer can start my summer car will make you responsible for your well being and provide real consquences for not obliging you pee and drive a crap sucking truck not because that s what all the cool steam review guys did for laughs but because if you don t you won t have money to buy gas for grocery trips and your bladder will explode and don t think it s that easy i mean peeing is obviously quite easy don t forget to force it out when you start dripping but to do pretty much anything else in this game you have to drive some type of vehicle several kilometers down some of the most treacherous roads in gaming history not that there s lava around or anything they re just really narrow and generally have a ditch on either side where if you get stuck you re stuck for good it s a bit cruel that not even ai will stop to help but that s scandinavian hospitality for you i guess and if you do get to your destination don t expect fanfares or an xp bar increase or anything of the sort you just do your job collect your money from the npc drive back home if it s starting to look a lot like the game took a page out of dayz s book with the whole do a bunch of mundane yet immersive stuff and get a slap across the face for reward that s because it kinda did but this game has ca oh wait dayz also has cars but this game has car building i mean good car building of all the overly complex and daunting yet strangely fun in the end parts of the game the car building is perhaps the most of all those things you walk out of your house you see a garage and in front of that garage an empty car frame no suspension no interior no engine no nothing then you open the garage and find all of those things broken down into hundreds of different parts neatly showcased on the shelves waiting for assembly this is the point where you begin to regret your purchase but don t refund just yet it gets worse tens of hours later full of finnish swearing sauna sweating firewood chopping engine building gas stealing tractor driving beer drinking road raging part ordering vehicle rescuing and falling into septic tanks you have your car in front of you beautiful shiny just the color you painted it with your custom parts on all the bolts tightened all the fluids poured in it doesn t start
