2023 edit 4 this will probably be my final update regarding the whole controversy the current list of factual information is still correct and i want to add that i still cannot find information on vellmori s gender i will use the pronouns they them when referring to vellmori projectmoon finally wrote a statement regarding the controversy the statement is vague which is what pmoon should have done in the first place unfortunately it doesn t help us with clarifying anything it s unclear whether vellmori is still working at for pmoon or not if pmoon truly did not dismiss vellmori then why is the july 25th statement not rescinded the fact that it s still up leads me to believe that vellmori s contract won t be renewed but technically they weren t fired 1 vellmori was pro feminist unclear on the spectrum of how radical they are they rewtweeted korean rally s relating to hidden camera filming photo taking of women in private and public areas 2017 2018 some of these retweets were a little questionable but could be taken as someone being edgey in one example of the tweet there is a post saying i wish you will die with the subtext all korean men have to stress again these are retweets and not any posts or comments made by vellmori themselves 2 the above posts were deleted privated before their work on limbus company but were dug up by korean sleuths through other means very hard to confirm or deny whether these were fabricated as the only source of the information is from them 3 on their instagram account vellmori state they are 22 years old this would mean they were publicly a feminist between the ages 16 18 years old 4 dcinside is an unreliable narrator a lot of information can only be gleaned from them and while not all boards on dcinside are conservative the majority are by young adult conservative males 5 vellmori is the cg artist not the character one they did not make the swimsuit art that people keep mentioning they are completely different artists 6 in the same article 10 korean individuals presumably dcinside users went to projectmoon headquarters to speak directly to them you can find documentation of it here is all the factual information i could find and updated as of 8 03 2023 there are a lot of other uncorroborated information out there some examples include 1 korean users brought this evidence to vellmori and they doubled down on their feminist ideals telling them to die etc cannot be substantiated anywhere 2 the korean individuals who went to projectmoon hq were violent one can make the argument that the act of 10 individuals being there is violent but i would call that intimidation not violence 3 vellmori spoke briefly to a korean news station in the statement from vellmori they were fired overnight on the phone at 11 00pm kst they will be given a written notice of termination at a later date this was later shown to be half truthful and vellmori was not fired over the phone but given notice on the situation 4 projectmoon was partially funded by korean taxes in their province labor unions are saying they should be held accountable because of this a livestream was done 2 days after this announcement and found mostly nothing regarding this if you want a pastebin of parts of my old review it is linked here edit alright so you may have noticed the huge swing in reviews what was once one of the few positive gacha games is now on the downtrend english reviews are mostly positive but east asia china and korea are mostly negative so what exactly happened and how is this affecting the game well i m here to do a bit of a deep dive into the situation and will give my own thoughts near the end the situation is is more of a festering of a long list of problems that have come to a head because of the recent fiasco the fiasco is mainly about which using google translate means submarine patch for english speaking countries this is similar to the term stealth nerf limbus company received a major patch last week wednesday for america where both old and new units received updates as usual with project moon updates this was riddled with bugs and unintentional side affects one of these was the apparent downgrade of units this varied from stat decreases to actual character kits being broken talisman sinclair gacha games almost never buff let alone nerf paid units this is seen as an atrocity by the korean community and led to the huge swathes of other issues the game has had being brought into the light these range from things like quality of life features to optimization problems for both pc and mobile this also brought out players claiming that project moon are or shorthand which is the word for feminist another major issue is the high cost of upgrading units to the new tier something that chinese players feel strongly about again some of these are reasonable statements but some are ridiculous this boils down to koreans upset that it feels like players are being treated as qa testers and feeling like the game is early access where sweeping changes like last week have happened more than once and consecutively sanity changes that were reverted after backlash and mirror dungeon 2 hard mode which added difficult content also response to the problems were not fast enough and they felt the stealth nerf was only reverted after the backlash they received there are a lot of reviews stating different things but this is the major point that a lot of koreans are upset about my personal opinion is that this is blown out of proportion projectmoon bungles updates frequently if you ve played early lobotomy corporation and library of ruina when it was in early access there is some merit to this but i do not believe they were being malicious updates happen on wednesday for america thursday for korea and they responded to the problem on sunday monday korea time basically they took a break on the weekend and came back to work to deal with problems with the patch this is how normal work days happen in america i m unclear if the same applies to korea are people expected to work constantly even in the weekends 4 5 days to address problems is a pretty reasonable timeframe as far as the uptie costs that chinese users are upset about this is a legitimate problem i don t think it s enough to review bomb but it s one of the long list of things that project moon needs to improve on and they probably will based on their track record i don t think the costs need to be addressed so much as players need more ways to obtain the resources to upgrade characters i noticed this review was less about the game and more about the recent drama surrounding it most players have already given their 2 cents on it so i don t feel i have too much to add here i m not a mobile gamer in fact this is only the 3rd gacha game i ve ever played limbus is a bad gacha game they do the complete opposite of what all gacha games do there are minimal pop ups the gacha is optional you can freely grind for units and it isn t overly exhausting to do so and projectmoon aren t afraid to make drastic changes to the detriment or better of the playerbase if you do want to participate in the gacha pulls are given very frequently and there are pity systems in place to guarantee the character if you want to spend money and are unlucky enough to not get the character there is a reason why the game has such high steam reviews it s just a shame that the playerbase is not willing to give projectmoon more breathing room despite how well they treat the playerbase
