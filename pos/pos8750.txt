2023 1st i m 67 years young my son got me involved in world of tanks i am enjoying it the player base is toxic to new players when i ask a question i would get ridiculed for asking so real life versus game totally different so all you young folks help others instead of being irritated i have lvl 8 tanks because of my son the reason why it is because to play together you have to have tanks of same level would love to play with players that will assist in learning how to play at any level it is my only gripe be compassionate thank you
