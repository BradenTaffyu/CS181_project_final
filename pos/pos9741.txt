2022 i hate this game so much you spend hours taking care of these little guys and catering to their individual likes and dislikes you watch them grow and develop into productive colony members and formidable combatants you see them fall in love and get married and then divorced and then they lose their and go on a week long bender then they get their back together again you watch their little lives unfold and you get attached to them then cassandra sends some merry band of comes along to blow their limbs off and you have to sit there and watch them die this little individual that i ve been taking care of for 30 hrs is laying on the ground with his leg torn off he s in mind shattering pain and i have to sit here and watch him slowly bleed out because if i send someone to help him they will suffer the same fate how the am i supposed to keep playing after this what kind of sick designs a game like this how in the hell do all of you sick just let your people die so callously i m in shambles every time i play this game 10 10
