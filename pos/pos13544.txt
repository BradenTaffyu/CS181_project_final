2017 ksp is a weird one it s exactly what i subconciously always wanted i guess now the current pricetag is in my opinion quite steep i bought it during the beta so i suppose i was lucky during a sale i would highly recommend you to pick it up if you re interested in spacecraft orbital mechanics space in general et cetera it doesn t take everything physics related into account for example it does not calculate multi body physics that s too bad but the game is still great it s a build your own space program simulator a science em up what should i say add more boosters
