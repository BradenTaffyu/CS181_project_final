almost seven months after launch this game is still not were it is supposed to while some of the new features like the amazing road building tools quality of buildings and assets and the addition of seasons are great it still lacks other features that the first game had at launch and bugs and smaller oddities happen frequently however there is no denying that the developers have been hard at work fixing the performance and other issues and i commend them for that their transparency towards the community is also appreciated i believe that at least some of the blame for the catasrophic launch must be put on the publisher paradox interactive the developers were clearly unhappy with the state of the game in october but were not given the time they needed and now cs2 will probably live with a negative stigma forever what keeps me playing right now is not the developer s work though once again the cs modding community is coming to the rescue while mod support should have been there at launch the speed at which mods and assets have now become available is nothing short of amazing it feels like every week there is a new exciting mod that enhances the game futher sometimes adding cs1 features into cs2 sometimes going beyond what was prevoiously possible from fixing land value problems allowing for more freedom in road and prop placement or improving control over the traffic system and of course providing a range of visual tweaks there is something for every play style with all of this i find myself playing for hours on end again something that i simply couldn t do at launch due to all of the constraints now thanks to mods which are easily accesible through the game cs2 has come much much closer to the game i d like it to be if you pefer a non modded experience don t buy the game wait for future updates which introduce much needed features overground metro stations please but if you re like me and you love building detailled cities and don t mind installing mods then wait for a discount get the game at a good price watch some mod reviews on youtube i recommemd city planner plays video and have fun
