2014 early access review great game finally a game that you can join with your friends and the best point and unlike single game ports with local multiplayer yes monopoly i am talking about you you piece of useless junk you can play any tabletop game mods or not and play what you and your friends want it s still in its early stages but the developers seem to be full of energy to add many more features and gamemodes for this beutiful and well done concept also if you enjoy screwing around with your friends or them screwing with you the game has no rules you are the one who needs follows them if you want giving you free will of your actions i highly recommend it so please do purchase the 4 pack and enjoy it with your close friends or be a loner and play with yourself or other randoms from the interwebs
