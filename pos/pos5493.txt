2019 early access review caves of qud is a masterpiece roguelike that deserves your attention it is exiting beta soon and while the game has been fantastic throughout it s active development now is definitely the time it will be shining the brightest the graphics are done in a style that emulates the 8 bit era with a distinct style and aesthetic that radiates the games grungy cybertrash atmosphere in an evocative and effective way this is set to improve with the finalized release of the new combat animation system and sound effects adding a new heft and tangibility to the experience while from a game system standpoint the game initially can feel really overwhelming and even cruel the game rewards exploration and experimentation in a way that is incredibly befitting in a game about the evolution and subsequent soft annihilation of humanity through cybernetic enhancement and mutation once you have familiarized yourself with the game s system and character builds it becomes possible to build engaging and sometimes horrific character builds in terms of their destructive power also worth mentioning is the game s principled dedication to inclusion with the in game world and the developer emphatically supporting unconventional identities and their rights to exist this game is cyber punk af and i m here for it it s greatest strength is undeniably the rich atmosphere and lore of the story and the way it has woven a strong narrative fabric through a meshing of procedural and handcrafted content the stories that you witness and create through gameplay are by far some of the most amazing things in gaming i ve ever seen and reminiscent of dwarf fortress in a lot of ways this is a game where it is possible to get your face sliced off by a furious giant mutant tadpole then pick up your face and wear it as a mask to enhance your mindmurder powers a game where your evil twin is always lurking in the shadows of space and time to emerge from an alternate universe and assassinate you because it is a clone of you who s dna is made of hate a game where you can use the power to disintegrate the cyborg nazi truescum who have attempted to put their boots on the necks of mutants within your personal bubble a game where you can sip water beneath the barren wasteland with a sand kraken in order to make him your brother in arms in this game no matter how you choose to walk your path you can always be sure that you will end up more human than human as you do everything in your power to survive the collateral damage left behind by the dark calculus and a mind shattering ghost of psychic evil whose contours faintly emerge in the dark mirror of your daily struggles live drink and swallow an entire bear whole with your elastic mutant snake jaws friends
