2014 early access review unlike a good bit of the other people writing the reviews that i ve seen i actually have time playing this game ie more than 15 hours any respectable gamer knows that isn t even a chop shop games amount of time to beat with said time i ve been building the best fort ever mining crafting getting a handle on the zombie horde times and how to survive them and playing each and every game mode all have a great way of balancing the fixes of the other mode for example survivor leaves you with a map that will eventually be looted out of all objects left around for you without going into folder files and changing things when you switch to the zombie horde mode you get care packages filled with a bunch of random weapons tools accessories to survive the upcoming battle the only problem i ve seen so far are the glitches like in zombie horde where the zombies just stop appearing this could likely be due to not overtaking my strong fort on the first wave and giving up when you finally feel burnt out of the crafting scavenging etc you do have the cheat mode option for your survival game where you can place just about if not everything in the game this fixes your loot problem as you can simply go into cheat mode fill up bags with these items while on a password basis and then switch it back to public playing and no cheats it s great for the server host to keep things fresh fair or even down right crazy i highly recommend you buy this game if youre a fan of the sandbox crafter games it s a huge step up from other said games with a zombie mode counting graphics ai and everything else in the mix
