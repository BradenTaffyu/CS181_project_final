early access review met a neat little plant vendor named yurl kinda weird about fungi but whatever then i contracted a fungal infection that grew gills on my head and hands while i was out dealing with an evil goatman sorcerer when i returned to sell my loot the saw me across the road and flew into a fury started summoning plants and they chased me and my floating robot buddy out of town i cured my fungal infection so they like me again but now kyakukya is full of explosive seed pods as a reminder of my indiscretion 10 10update i grew some roots out of my arm so i went back and killed that yurl now i m wearing his clay pot as armor
