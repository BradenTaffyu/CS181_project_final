2019 good game and i do love it despite its many problems but i have a major issue with one of the quest types photography a suggestion don t force this photography nonsense into the main questline for a given preservation i want to advance but that would mean getting within thirty yards of a black bear if you re just starting your character in layton lake as i did kind of a pain in the ass especially when you need to be a high level to even unlock the option to buy a caller for bears and when the game doesn t recognize the photo unless you re up close and have a completely unobstructed view to a dangerous game animal you probably aren t well equipped to deal with in a charge situation that early in the game make all photography a separate side mission type this is supposed to be a hunting simulator not some namby pamby nature photography simulator
