2020 early access review the game is still technically in early access so there are a few things missing like end game kingdom functionality and some dialogue options for companions but overall it s entirely playable in its current state coming from warband this game is a true successor that improves upon the previous game in several ways those who are fans of the previous game will find much that is familiar to them here proxies for different western powers in the land of calradia each with their own cultures strengths and weaknesses and the ability to aid or hinder them there are some quality of life improvements as well such as the ability to speed up map time by 2x and food not rotting towns and castles too feel much more fleshed out though like in the previous games there is no real need to walk around them and you can avoid doing so the whole game given you never buy a workshop on top of that there are some amazing additions most notably smithing which allows you to custom create weapons how you see fit and some others like siege weapons some aspects of previous games become much more commonplace here namely tournaments and trade now tournaments provide unique items in addition to the gold you bet and trade is much easier to get involved in and serves an important part of the beginning to mid game all in all much of the game has been smoothed over and polished retaining much of the older warband feel while still being an improvement in most areas last but not least the combat for all the improvements to the base game mentioned above combat remains one of if not the largest draw to the series i have to say they did a damn fine job at it too the combat here is so satisfying warband was fun and it functions much the same here but like everything else it has been improved upon hits feel a lot meatier as you ride by and cleave someone in twain with a polearm from horseback duels feel much more tense as weapon handling has been refined and troop controls have been improved with the ability to select different formations as well as delegate troop command to the ai sergeants the battlefields look gorgeous although with noticeably repeating layouts and the large scale battles are breathtaking a pattern is repeated here where troop commands were present in previous games but not quite as fleshed out or as central as they are here the only thing i miss is the ability to tell troops to advance or retreat 10 paces as well as the fact that the ai seems to have much more fine control of the troops than i can possibly manage all in all the game is great so far as a warband junkie it feels like much the same game only better in almost every way the economy feels more involved game mechanics more polished and the combat more exhilarating i can t wait for mods
