2021 fallout 4 or skyrim with guns as some say others just call it garbage compared to new vegas i have very little to add to what this game is about everyone knows it already love it hate it mechanics you know them so i say this enough with new vegas comparisons and waiting for next messiah fallout it is obvious by now with 76 that there wont be another nv bulls eye story heavy game anytime soon not even with new owners for bethesda for the moment being they have lost the vision so it seems we are stuck with what we have here and it has more content than people give it credit for basically if you want a good open world game there isn t exactly a lot to choose from if you want a persistent single player experience with lots of missions been there done that is the mantra for many lesser games that have come and got uninstalled by now yet this game i have exhausted twice already when it comes to content only to re install it and play it some more after learning about missing a lot of content hmm strange skyrim is a bit same at this time i do recommend getting it on sales with the season pass to get all the components you need for a as it was intended experience on sales that s about 10 bucks plus and definitely worth it look into settlement building yes i know we all hate it and i was luke warm to it as well but now i see it as much as 50 of the game content why well look at the game map all those unmarked places to explore and a good part of the marked ones as well what is the point of going to these places you find junk literal junk without settlements suits and weapons using those resources there is no point in looting junk armor and weapons for your settlers read the wikis about settlements from a personal viewpoint going for the magazines and unique weapons wont keep you motivated beyond mid game with settlements you will soon learn how valuable oil aluminium circuitry is i really do recommend you don t spend time trying to guess how certain places work or don t work if you are having motivation problems with settlements settlements got the most bugs in the game and sometimes they have restrictions airport for example that pretty much force you to think differently to make it work specialize settlements some settlements are excellent recruitment and outfitting centers others simple fortifications while others provide resources for other settlements that cannot produce enough what they need it is a grand networked system when running properly and learning to setup it right is fun periodic scaling attacks on the settlements will show you how well your setups work or don t work generally speaking the settlement building aspect is a demanding mid to late game activity early on you can t really do much due to big costs on everything you are given literal dumpsters to build a flourishing settlement and default is that you will fail to get much done it takes a lot to build on a dumpster a settlement that not only survives against late stage gunner mutant robot attacks but also thrives enough to generate thousands of caps for you to use on further development elsewhere upgrade those shops but i find it worth it by the time you have strong settlements generating resources and caps and your provisioners circling the edges of the map connecting every settlement it is much better game play as it is much safer to move around without having to fight alone all the time heavily armed settlements tend to help a lot in big fights as well seeing the slog settlement put up a fight with saugus ironworks which then spills over to auto wreckers gunners camp is just spectacular to see and join in i find this very motivational to strive forward to as the difference to roaming alone is considerable if this would be fallout 3 i would have quit a long time ago yet here i have over 330 hours and still counting i got plans visions and things to do and i have not exhausted all mission content either post main plot find out what motivates you use wikis to help you don t try to figure out all on your own if motivation is low those unique weapons they don t mean much beyond mid game later in game finding those random star weapons that have that specific effect that supports your personal game style and perks becomes so much more important along with weapon modding late game perks note that even as your level is over 90 you still get perks that are useful and add new strategies i only use 2 unique weapons in late game the rest is already shelved and i now rely on my own builds so i guess what i want to say is don t handicap your experience by giving up on a major part of the game experience there is a reason to develop settlements as they directly give you a reason to find specific kinds of items at locations settlements give you goals reasons to go explore things so don t overlook that buy the game play it as you wish and read up on wikis as the game is vast in content and has tons of bugs that can be overcome i play vanilla btw i see no need to mod this game although there exists those options too
