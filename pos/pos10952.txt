2016 epic game one of the bests a huge improvement over the previous games the music and atmosphere are great and its optimization is really good the game is challenging more complex intricate and deep well hearts of iron is far from command conquer it has lots of buttons for starters hoi is a big serious series where players take control of any nation to rewrite history through diplomacy industry and force across the entire globe it s a big simulation starting with the war in its historical state but able to diverge massively from history hearts of iron 4 is shaping up well it s slick and clever and while there s not much visually to the moment that troops clash the point of conflict in hoi is an almost incidental result of a vast continent wide engineering effort it s a game about careful detailed state organisation and top level strategy you pull arrows across the map with a push of the mouse painting out your strategy with sweeping gestures that give physical form to the feelings of power and control that drive a good grand strategy game the new 3d look is swish the old 2d style was practical sure but this is proper pleasant this game is extremely superb i like the game very much and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the previous games 9 10
