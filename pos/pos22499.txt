2016 this is everything dark souls 2 should have been still not as good as the original dark souls mainly because the gameworld is not completely interconnected like it was in ds1 it is more linear but the levels themselves have become much larger and more intricate save your estus because if you waste it you ll be left looking for a bonfire like it was an oasis in the middle of the desert also poise poise should apparently be there in the game somewhere because a lot of items and skills give a poise bonus not to mention armor but it just doesn t work i m not going in depth because there are countless threads and videos about this what matters is fromsoftware s statement about this saying it is working as intended i don t know how to feel about this but it s clear they up on this one somehow still overall this is the worthy sequel to the original dark souls finally after ds2 and its expansion left a bitter aftertaste ds2 in comparison looks like an indie fan made game and its lore sounds like straight up fanfiction well what is it ds2 fanboys u mad fite me
