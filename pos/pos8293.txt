this game is a treasure to me i ve always yearned for a free to play yu gi oh card game where you can play against and alongside others the animations are mediocre leaving ample room for improvement one major issue this game faces is the lack of content there s a poorly designed solo mode meant to introduce you to all the cards as much as possible however once you complete the solo mode it quickly becomes tedious an option should exist where you can select the ai s deck and play against it preferably with one of the most renowned decks the second significant problem lies in the duration of a player s turn currently set at 5 minutes 60 seconds should suffice the last issue mirrors a common problem in many card games an abundance of npcs playing the same deck one potential solution could involve adjusting matchmaking so that you alternate between facing decks you re weak against and those you re strong against however at my current rank of diamond 1 i find myself playing 10 consecutive games against the same deck it drains the enjoyment from the game and transforms it into a pay to win scenario as the npc army purchases gems to exploit the same gameplay fix these problems make the cards tradable like steam trading cards and this game is going to be legendary
