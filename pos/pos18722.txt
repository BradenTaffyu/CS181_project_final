2023 gaming experience without dlcsthe game by itself isn t inherently bad without dlcs there just isn t any depth to the game however for example event chains or trees and some mechanics are missing like that of moving troops across a ocean with a single click and ultimately i wouldn t say there is anything wrong with that gaming with dlcswhen dlcs are added into the game it feels like a good whole new game but just a single dlc wouldn t do much for especially for me but when having a collective dlc of the essentials then it truly do feel like a different game the the experience is outstanding being able to role play as england the papal states and so much more downsides honestly it s too expensive having let s say the most essential dlc to me art of war if there isn t any discount it cost 19 99 usd which basically means that you can buy another game which has a more different experience i myself can t understand the reasoning for such high pricing but let me do some math for you let s say you want to have the essential dlcs right now in my point of view full price without collection dlc namepriceart of war19 99 usdcommon sense14 99 usddharma19 99 usdemperor19 99 usdrights of man19 99 usdtotal94 95 usdthat basically you can buy a 2 triple a games but if you really want to buy those dlcs please buy it during discounts and buy collections such as europe universalis iv ultimate bundle or starter pack note thanks for reading this and feel free to message about what i miss i am not perfect and i do make mistake apologize in advance
