2017 i didn t think i would enjoy this arpg as much as i did i couldn t stop playing it till i d seen and done everything it s incredibly good fun to play the combat is fast and fluid the backstory is different and interesting the art design is top notch and the soundtrack alone is worth admission there are so many unique and well thought out ideas it s clear to see just how much real effort the developers put in even the end credits has more care put into them than some entire games i ve played in the past seriously i highly recommend nier automata even at full price
