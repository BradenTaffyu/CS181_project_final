2018 if you go back and look you ll see i was one of the few people who responded to your intital post on steam asking for beta testers and wondering if the game was good enough to go into early access i ve been around since the first day basically and the game has come a long way and here on release day i can say that i ve been nothing less than floored with the quality of the game called dead cells the genuine respect and integrity that has possessed the folk at motion twin during their 400 days of early access has been remarkable to say nothing of the game itself should every dev team in the land aspire to meet their standards the ground would tremble and part and overfloweth with quality gaming experiences for all the good people of the earth there is no doubt in my mind that if you are reading this that you will enjoy this game too the art is a beautiful blend between the old and the new the music that accompanies it is just as good both are composed in such a way that together they shine even brighter a symphony of sight and sound for the splattering of the minds of mobs theres jumping doublejumping running rolling slashing dashing whipping tripping knifing strifing dying crying buying lying and most of all retrying but the continued playthroughs aren t a chore they are a pleasure it never feels like a grind or a waste of time but a sharpening of skills and a good time to be had congratulations on the release motion twin i wish you the best of luck on the updates to come in the future which are going to be f r e e to any curious readers take a few days off now ps dead cells comes out on switch tomorrow the 7th of august what a wonderful world i ll be dying and rebuying on there too
