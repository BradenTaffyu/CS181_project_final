2017 old feb 2017 review this game has a lot of bugs needs serious polish and feels like a beta that being said this is the 1st decent hunting game released since thehunter the market doesn t really have any competition cabelas hunting unlimited and games like that are too casual to be taken seriously this game has potential its still fun even with all the bugs if your a nut for hunting games like i am this game is for you if you don t like hunting games or like arcade hunting games this isn t for you so don t buy it updated 12 6 2021i recently started playing this again and logged a lot more hours since my last review and felt i should update this for anyone who care not much has changed on the main points of the old comment if you like hunting games you don t really have many options out there while this game still doesn t feel as serious as the original thehunter it s still not bad and i haven t seen anyone make anything close to as good the good lots of maps maps are large it was exhilarating to be surrounded by a pack of wolves irl i ve gotten 3 deer some desert pigs 5 elk and lots of rabbits and quail this game nails the feel trying to spot game then have it disappear on you well at least until you figure out how to exploit everything since you ve clocked 50 hours in but it s still impressive that it can do that as haddocka in the comments below has pointed out it was a problem that all animals previously looked the same they did i think only last year or so add a patch which made animals with different racks so that s been resolved there s a quad and a dog in dlcs there are trophy rooms where you can display your kills now the bad still a lot of bugs game still crashes every 2 3 hourshuntermate bug where screen goes black or gets frozen happens ever hour or sooner and requires a restart to clear up luckly you don t need it for muchlatest map the rancho del rojo has an audio bug where everything is louder by 1 barall animals are basically reskins of the prexisting typesquad is only means of getting around and is necessary if you want to do main missions and not waste your lifedog isn t useful for what you d use it for irl like pointing or flushing rabbits or retrieving conclusion if you like hunting games and have concluded that thehunter is outdated as i have then you don t really have a choice but to play this one it s not perfect but it isn t bad and especially when it s on sale you can have a lot of fun with this one if anyone knows a better hunting game i d like to know so feel free to tell me in the comments
