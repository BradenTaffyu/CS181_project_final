2018 for anyone leaving a negative review because you did not get rise and fall for free for buying the deluxe edition kindly off when you bought it you paid for what was there nowehere on the page does it ever say that you will get future expansions they did the exact same thing for civ 5 you had a deluxe edition which contained content available at the time no future content the game is fun it s a huge step over base game civ 5 is it worth more than civ 5 currently not really 5 has been out for way longer is now cheaper and simply has 2 expansions and 3 years worth of content do i think civ 6 will be better after catching up with expansions and updates hell yes
