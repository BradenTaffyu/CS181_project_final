2023 i m a 51 year old single father to my 14 year old son it s always been hard for us to find common interests and i often feel left out as my son spends most of his free time playing video games with his friends last christmas my son s friend gifted him a new multiplayer game that quickly became his latest obsession i watched as my son spent countless hours immersed in the game and i couldn t help but feel left out determined to find a way to spend more time with my son i decided to make a steam account and get the game for myself however i quickly realized that i had no idea what i was doing and needed my son s help my son happily showed me the ropes and soon we were playing together i loved exploring the game s vast world and completing quests with my son and it quickly became the highlight of my day playing the game together not only brought my son and me closer but it also helped me rediscover my love for spending time with my son we laughed joked and bonded over the challenges we faced in the game as we continued to play i started to notice that my son and i were spending more time together outside of the game as well we would go for walks watch movies and just enjoy each other s company the game reminded me that there s fun to be had in everything and it has brought both my son and me many happy memories it s given me a new sense of purpose and has brought us closer than ever before i m grateful for the gift of the game and even more grateful for the gift of time spent with my beloved son
