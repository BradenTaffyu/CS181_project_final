2023 to start as someone who has been horrifically addicted to the entire project moon catalogue as of late it is easy for me to identify where these games manage to succeed to a stellar degree however it is also very easy to notice where there are moments that the games slightly fumble in their execution and as their most recent title in the franchise this is very apparent with limbus company to start the story as of writing this review is incredible and is exactly the sort of story that i ve come to love from project moon due to the chapter by chapter release schedule of limbus it is indeed a live service game there are moments that the tone can seem relatively inconsistent at certain times however while highly enjoyable the tonal shift between chapters such as canto 2 and the intervallos can seem a bit jarring but this is easily mitigated by the top tier storytelling that is frequent within the other main chapters and the humour is inoffensive enough to ruin the feeling and emotion of the entire game the main cast of characters within the game is one of the most varied and distinct in any game i have played as of yet and the game manages to bounce them off each other in such a manner that they do not feel as if they are dead weight are endearing in some of the best and worst days heathcliff 3 and each have a compelling background be it implied or explicitly shown to us through the character focused main chapters simply put the current writing of the game is easily on par with that of the previous project moon catalogue and if this continues i can see the game having one of the most unique and entertaining stories in any game i have yet to play while i am able to sing the praises of the storytelling for how well it is writ it is only a portion of the experience in whole the actual game play of limbus company while certainly not a masterpiece is enjoyable enough to ensure that segments in between the main parts are not too much of a burden to sit through the game play manages to hit a nice balance with the gacha system while the characters that you can potentially unlock are very entertaining and are certainly one of the main standouts of the game the base characters and abilities are of a calibre where the entire current game can be beaten with them solely and can remain mostly enjoyable despite the lack of the wide array of characters the unlockable abilities and characters that are obtained through the gacha system each have their own unique quirks that can make each one interesting some more than others however and the gacha system is incredibly generous with how it rewards the players the unique characters have a very generous pull rate and the top rarity ones are not laborious or agonising to pull additionally the gacha system can be completely ignored if one has the patience to play the game and obtain resources which can be used to simply purchase them in summary of this segment the game play while not groundbreaking is fun to play overall and is well animated and the gacha elements are incredibly lenient when compared to other games which can be seen as more predatory however through my current hours in the game i have identified where i believe the game falls short in certain aspects one of the major points of contention around the game is the periods of content drought that the game suffers from sometimes between main chapter releases while the game is updated on a weekly bi weekly basis a lot of endgame content can rely on grinding the harder stages and dungeons which operate very similar to certain rogue lite games in order to keep the game entertaining certain decisions in game can seem a bit asinine and irritating when first implemented and played through and while these can be an issue i am hopefully optimistic that features such as this will be ironed out over time as project moon finds their footing some late game content can seem frustrating due to how it can rely on characters of a high level which in turn encourages grind but can admittedly feel satisfying to overcome additional elements of the game such as the art music and events are all of the expected project moon quality incredibly well done certain tracks composed by mili are naturally standout pieces and i am hopeful that they continue to work together in future in short summary the story is incredible and characters are highly enjoyable and likeable the game play is fun but not extraordinarily so art music and animations are very high quality gacha elements are well implemented and the game can be completed completely f2p the live service aspect of the game is able to promise the potential for much more stellar content game play can be unintuitive and frustrating at times content drought can be evident at periods and late game grind can be tedious certain decisions implemented in game can seem unfair or irritating sometimesas someone who has been hopelessly addicted to this game since picking it up i feel like i have to attempt to ensure that i offer a well rounded and honest take to the games pros and cons i immensely enjoy this game and it is my only hope that project moon is simply able to build upon their successes and right their wrongs in order to create a masterpiece of a video game 8 10 as of now
