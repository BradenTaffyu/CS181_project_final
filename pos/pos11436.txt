2022 early access review considering this game will probably enter beta by the time the polar caps have melted and all hell has broken loose in our by then collapsing society on the edge of barbaric feudalism this game provides a good insight into things to come dysentery and all the game is and always has been in alpha with that tagline comes a plethora of janky stuff bugs that are both hilarious and rage inducing as well as an ever expanding vista of things that will be implemented sooner or later if you like survival games and can endure the janky nature of early access this is a fine hot mess however be aware that you are purchasing a demented dream of a post apocalyptic zombie survival game that have very little to offer outside of a companiable multiplayer basedefense and looting minigame currently alpha 20 6 b9 might update if things really hits the fan
