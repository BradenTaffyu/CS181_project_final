early access review an absolutely astonishingly beautiful game its a factory game like satisfactory or factorio with the similar kind of mindset of the factory must grow it differs from allowing interstellar travel between stars in your system as well as the planets around those stars the mindset in dyson sphere is the power must grow where factories flourish with new power developments and stutter when to many factories are built too fast without sustaining enough power generation be it solar nuclear coal or a hydrogen mixed fuel to use at the start the ultimate goal is to build a dyson sphere but getting there you ll have to start off with basic resources like iron copper and coal as you progress traveling to other planets will yield different resources as well as specific planets having abundance of rare resources over others with this you can set up interstellar stations to automate long haul resources around your systems to expound on your growth of factories towards building your first dyson sphere once you ve progressed through the technologies enough you ll be able to start setting up a system to either launch solar sails and the dyson frame structure itself collectively the sails will go to the framing structure and web a solar mesh around the sun thus building the dyson sphere structure the dyson structure is designed completely through the players artistic will allowing for unlimited amount of themed and coloured dyson sphere structures you can build growing further you can layer the spheres in a layered mesh like an onion to build another structure around or inside the original sphere although there s a reduction of power generation on the outer sphere you can create gaps designs or alternate rotating structures to allow for another artistic dimension allowing for even more ideas of structure designs collectively the beauty of watching logistic ships travel between systems the solar sails launching into their solar orbit awaiting to fall into your framed structure and the spidering of growth as your design comes to life all in a silence of space with a chill tune it s stunning and rewarding 10 10 gamerecommend it to all my friends
