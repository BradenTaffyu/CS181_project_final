2016 early access review project zomboid is a survival game first and a zombie game second surviving requires resource management and good decision making food and water are both important and within the first month the water supply is cut off and power is gone one day is an hour of play on default settings for reference water sources such as sinks will still hold a bit of water after the water supply is gone but for the most part it s up to the player to provide for themselves at this point most food expires and this requires planning of when to eat what there are many interesting mechanics that make surviving fun such as the ability to freeze foods so they last longer or growing crops and canning them in summer so they can be used in winter yet there is still plenty of fun to be had in this game by rushing hordes of zombies while trying to loot a warehouse with powerful weapons and rare construction materials early on there is a perk system in place that requires players to give themselves negative traits in order to obtain positive ones this allows for a variety of playstyles you can create a loud character that has poor senses and is more likely to be seen by zombies but is incredibly strong and can tackle large amounts of them at once or create a weaker character that can sneak around easily and survive in the shadows the immense character options are coupled with the fact that there is a sandbox mode with a healthy amount of options want more zombies set the population to very high and watch as they overwhelm you even on the outskirts of town don t like how zombies tend to spawn within urban centers make them spawn uniformly and you ll find random ones lurking in the woods the settings also include whether or not to begin with basic supplies how long it has been since the outbreak began and how long it will take for the power and water to shut off there are many more and i encourage anyone who enjoys survival games to pick this one up for themselves and take a look all of that being said it is important to note that project zomboid is still in early access there are some bugs around and in my opinion the interface is still relatively clunky to use the game takes some getting used to but has a big payoff in the long run the developers have improved the interface in recent builds and have weekly mondoids where they keep the community up to date on what s what development on the game can feel pretty slow at times we ve been periodically promised npcs that are fellow survivors for several years but they are still not implemented for example if you can handle all of this then by all means i recommend picking up this game it s worth the price and more
