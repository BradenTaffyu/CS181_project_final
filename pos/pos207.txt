2016 at what point can you write a review for stardew valley can you ever finish the game would you ever want to for reasons that are hard to explain this is one of the best games i ve ever played this title is about nothing except escapism you will trade your life ideally on a temporary basis for the life of your self designed character in stardew valley in the game you escape your boring cubicle job to live a simpler life as a farmer in a close community that is struggling to stay relevant in an increasingly conglomerate dominated western society the game manages to argue an anti corporate america wal mart is bad but not inherently evil agenda in such a real way that is impossible to ignore all the while providing you the opportunity to choose for yourself and unabashedly encouraging you to embrace capitalism to maximize the value of your labor and intellect the game succeeds in this alternative reality in much the same way the sims captured so many gamers hearts in stardew it seems you are able to achieve things that perhaps you cannot achieve in real life however you will leave the game feeling happy uplifted and hopeful beneath this existentialism is a day to day deluge of strangely addicting activities mine farm make friends help the community cook craft equipment manage your finances fish oh how i love to fish forage ranch etc etc by providing more structure than say minecraft s survival mode the game succeeds in guiding us something much more fulfilling the aesthetic think of it as an improved 16 bit legend of zelda you will soak it in it is my phone s background you will learn to love the bright colors and simple sprites while despising the grittiness of real life the music it s so simple it should drive you mad but it s so happy it will soothe your soul reading discussions you will hear of gamers who are self treating their anxiety depression mental illnesses there is something very special about this game there is something very important about this game it will brighten your days and provide you with a measure of joy the saddest part is i feel like i might be ready to move on
