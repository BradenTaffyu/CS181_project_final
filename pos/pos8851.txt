2016 i could write a review for stellaris and go into a great deal of depth about its gameplay and aesthetics but i m not going to instead i m going to tell you the story of admiral cax the tale of admiral cax hero of the blessed light of torobalong before he was born cax s people an atomic age civilisation of reptilians called the netraxi had noticed something odd about their leaders sure they seemed fine from afar but on closer inspection they were just a little bit too mushroom y still they shrugged and kept on doing whatever nuclear powered reptiles do and then the day came when the disguises fell and the netraxi were taken over by the fanatically religious empire of slave taking mushrooms that had quietly infiltrated their society using some questionable shapeshifting magic the netraxi were aghast they were enraged and then they were enslaved these conniving chantarelles known to their friends not many as the blessed light of toroba and their enemies quite a bit more as the doom shrooms were to be masters of the netraxi for a hundred years for this darkest of centuries the netraxi slaved away to supply their overlords with ambiguously defined but evidently useful minerals their labour rewarded only with contempt and a reminder to worship the god emperor of toroba at all times the unhappiest netraxi were sent down the mines the happiest were released allowed to be outraged about their situation for a bit and then enslaved again just for fun and when the torobin went to war the netraxi were chained together and dropped as a welcome mat for the toroban armed forces to march over those hundred years passed and the torobin began to see the netraxi in a more enlightened way it was decided that some though not all should be emancipated to test their loyalty to their god emperor surprisingly they were indeed loyal within ten years the remaining netraxi had been freed but this was only the beginning of the struggle for freedom all across torobin space a dozen other races remained enslaved and the blatantly racist policies of the torobin meant that there was only room for shroom in positions of power and then the great glorious and eternally enlightened god emperor zifin i may his spores find warm soils decided that one but only one filthy xeno would be given the opportunity to lead toroban forces his case would decide whether or not aliens were worthy of being equals to those they had once called master they chose a lowly netraxi called cax cax was a badass hired at the age of 41 he was immediately thrust into the toroban war of conquest against an alliance led by the bavi a technologically superior race four fleets were deployed three led by torobin and the fourth led by cax almost immediately the fleets were heavily engaged taking severe casualties cax was sent to support a toroban admiral but when he warped in he found the admiral s fleet destroyed the gallant mushroom shredded and scattered across the system undaunted cax sent his fleet into the attack and smashed the admiral s killers securing the system as the torobin lost a second fleet to the bavi it was only cax holding the line that gave the torobin enough leverage to force a white peace and retreat with their dignity intact this was only the beginning cax was sent back to torobos to rebuild his fleet and upgrade it in the expectation that the torobin would soon be having a second go at the bavi five years into the refit however he received the chilling news that a portal had opened up only a few systems away spewing forth energy demons that wished only to feast upon the mortals planets the unlucky star system was consumed and then another system fell and another and another and then it was netraxis turn cax could only look on via his monitor as his beloved homeworld his people that looked to him for salvation everyone were all annihilated in a heartbeat as the torobin military crumbled he took his fleet to the furthest sector the malthin bulwark and gathered his forces for a desperate counterattack and then the fox nation attacked either through cold malice or a hilarious inability to perceive the danger of frickin world eating energy demons the race known only as the sly foxes decided to attack the toroban glorious alliance with overwhelming force right along the line of the malthin bulwark cax found his reinforcements cut off his spaceports attacked and his empire still dined upon by the dreaded unbidden it was then in this darkest of hours that cax made his move with the bulwark crumbling behind him cax launched a desperate attack against the unbidden portal with every warship the torobin could muster it was do or die if he won the unbidden would no longer be able to spam doomstacks to conquer the ungrateful galaxy but if he lost the galaxy would be lost with him at the age of 54 with a hundred warships in tow this would be his finest hour he did it he frickin did it surrounded by no fewer than three unbidden doomstacks admiral cax somehow fought his way to the portal and shattered the demons grip on the galaxy destroying two of the doomstacks as he did so with his mission accomplished he warped away to safety fewer than a third of his captains made it out but the galaxy was saved for any ordinary admiral this would have been a time to celebrate but cax was no ordinary admiral cax was a badass badly damaged from the battle for the portal cax immediately returned his fleet to the bulwark and smashed the sly foxes in a series of fleet to fleet battles taking the war deep into the enemy s heartland a little too deep some might say because there was the slight issue of his fleet being surrounded and utterly destroyed but cax made it out and his heroic counter attack had once again turned a losing situation into a white peace by now cax was pushing 70 time to retire the torobin said but badassery doesn t retire cax immediately took command of a new fleet being built to purge the galaxy of the unbidden for once and for all armed with the latest weapons and cutting edge technology taken from the sly foxes cax s crusaders came together from all corners of torobin space to follow their inspiring commander the liberation was long and bittersweet as although cax was proud to be the admiral chosen to drive the unbidden from his homeworld he knew that only the dead would greet him on netraxis but liberate he did and at the age of 100 he destroyed the last unbidden installation and restored the lost worlds to the torobin in gratitude the god emperor transformed toroba into a mega corporation and emancipated every last slave all thanks to cax s heroism and they all lived happily ever after right wrong happily ever after is for people who haven t tried hard enough cax had a score to settle with the bavi they had destroyed his companions in the bavi war they had stood back and watched as the unbidden destroyed his homeworld worst of all they were just kinda there y know and so at the age of 108 cax set out for one final war the names and legends of that war still echo down the ages at zabeem it was cax who ambushed the 12th bavi fleet and smashed it to scrap at gandaros it was cax who rescued the allied fleets from certain doom at kovin it was cax who held the line as fleet after fleet warped in and were suddenly but unsurprisingly vanquished and it was behind admiral cax that the entire allied fleet mustered for the final assault on hydrobius that ended the war best of all the surviving netraxi were given permission to colonise the new worlds opened up by the second bavi war cax hadn t just saved his people he d given them a future too when he died at 113 the mourning was brief and efficient he would ve liked it that way rip cax
