2017 early access review on the surface this is a base building survival game somewhat like terraria where you mine blocks and build you base with it you build living quarters research labs water reservoirs farm etc when i first bought it i was expecting it somewhat fallout shelter but it is so much more this is one of the few games where you have to plan for both short and long term a couple other being factorio minecraft with industrial mods etc want short term gain by placing your toilet closer to your base your base will smell like after a couple cycles in forgot to build ventilation in the rooms you ll have co2 build up and your duplicate the game s residences will choke did not build insulation around your batteries you base will heat up and make all your plants die everything you do will have short term mid term and long term effect on the survival of your base in fact it s fairly hard to lose short term unless you trap everyone in a room full of chlorine but it s also very hard to fix problems if you let it manifest and become a long term problem other than to start over tl dr if you are looking for a great macro management strategy game this is the game for you edit apparently wasn t my first review l
