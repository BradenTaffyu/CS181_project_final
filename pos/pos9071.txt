2022 sometimes i like to imagine im the scientist hurtling towards a dimensional horror then it would finally be over other times i like to pretend im the space khan about to take another space woman as my concubine most of the time im sat in my underwear managing serious intergalactic affairs its got something for everyone but not really my friend chris says its repetitive without mods i say be true to yourself and never walk away from the past even if it means giving up on your dreams the higher we fly the higher we can achieve the wandering worm has no peers the striking eagle has no perfect feathers the snoring ox has no respite from windpipe expansion i closed my borders to him go now with the wisdom of stellaris bestowed 11 out of 10 would move all food production off planet again
