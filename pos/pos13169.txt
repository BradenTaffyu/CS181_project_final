2023 kerbal space program is one if not the best game to learn about the basics of space flight on steam it can be complex sometimes specially when doing long distance flights i remember struggling just to get to mar i mean duna but it still is very accessible even for those who are unfamilliar with the flight simulation genre the best way to play this game is to make your own experimentation the first time you will boot ksp you may build a rocket that will fly but it won t fly far and that s totally fine because it s all part of the learning process each time you launch a rocket you learn something new heck even with my 450 hours of play i have yet to land a rocket on eeloo want more parts for your vessels well here s the best part of ksp mods and believe me there are a tons of them and since ksp s last major update was released in 2021 you don t need to worry about mods not working anymore due to obsolescence to end this review here s a quote you should always remember in case of doubt add more boosters
