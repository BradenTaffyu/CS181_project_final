2018 and another solid hack n slash by platinum games and easily one of their best at that easily one of my favorite games of 2017 but one must still keep in mind the various potential issues that come with the port that sadly have not been resolved because square enix don t like patching their games on pc for some retarded crap ex fullscreen issues stutter inside of cutscenes and demanding global illumination that brings many older gpu s and even modern ones towards their knees to be able to get the most out of the game in terms of performance be sure to avoid anti aliasing altogether and instead enable ambient occlusion if you wanna get rid of the jaggies but without the major cost in performance then use the far mod to tinker the level of global illumination as needed and you ll find a solid hack n slash with easily one of the best stories i ve seen in gaming as a whole in a long time
