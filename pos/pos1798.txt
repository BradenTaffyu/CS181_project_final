2017 this game reminds me why i think video game is the best medium for storytelling absolutely brilliant well written rich story the side quests in game novels and weapon story even the iron pipe can overwhelm me with feelings magnificent dynamic soundtrack impressive va s both japanese and english simple and creative environmental design haunting lore and story progression one of a kind credits ending ending e is the best ending of anything ever i never experience this kind of satisfying feelings by completing a game before truly one of a kind journey its kinda sad that the pc port is kinda broken for some people and the asia launch price tag sh t square enix indeed
