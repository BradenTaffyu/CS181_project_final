2017 now i understand orbital mechanic this game is mainly a space simulator that will show you that getting something in space is hard let alone landing it on another celestial body now i know why space shooters make no sense i understand why the gravity movie irked space geeks now periapsis and apoapsis mean something to me but beward the learning curve is harsh but oh so rewarding first rendez vous and docking in space took me 2 hours and about two dozen reload i had exhausted every swearing word i knew and was moving into creating new ones now i can rendez vous and dock together two space behemoth in 3 minutes with minimal propelent usage i don t even remember why that was ever hard a must buy if you like space and the science about space exploration
