2017 early access review i felt like i had to share my experiences with rimworld so far so i had just established my young but promising new colony ashton a quite ironical name in the end the basic needs were all covered everyone had a nice place to sleep decent clothing enough to eat and time to relax the people of ashton were prosperous they lived in harmony with nature and each other their wide fields provided them with plenty of food and they sold the surplus to the passing by caravans now and then a few warriors of a near tribe the pig face men attacked the settlement but the people of ashton were safe relying on the strength of their automated defence systems and so the colony grew and i thought this is it i finally have a colony which doesn t collapse after a few hours as if remember when i told you about the harmony between the people and with nature i meant there were no rivalries between the colonists most were friends and there even was a married couple tali and waltz the harmony with nature also seems pretty coherent the people relied mostly on their crops eating only those animals which died by natural causes e g old age or other animals so the animal population in the near forests remained stable so far so good but taking those dead animals in meant of course someone had to leave the safe area of ashton and wander through the wilds normally that wouldn t have been a problem everyone was equipped with guns and armor of the pig face men so they were quite ready to take on anything coming in their way but then came the tortoise waltz left ashton to get the still fresh corpse of a chinchilla which had been killed by some other animal so waltz has just grabbed it when a tortoise nearby turned mad i thought ok those aren t that fast waltz will be able to safely carry the chinchilla inside and the turrets will take care of the tortoise nope i m not quite sure what exactly happened maybe this animal was on speed or something like thak anyway when it saw waltz it charged at him at a horrifying pace waltz had just lifted his weapon when this damn creature reached and hurt him badly however its hard shell was no match for waltz gun and so he came back home injured but happy that now there was even more meat than expected but the wraith of the tortoise was unforgiving the bite wounds in his upper body infected themselves the medical treatment didn t work and he got weaker and weaker if the infection at least would ve been in one of his limbs that might had saved him but you can t just amputate someones chest at last he couldn t fight any longer the infection overwhelmed him tali his wife carved his story in the sides of his sarcophagus the burial ceremony was heartbreaking everyone had come tali his sister julia his friends vas jones stephan boyd and leia vas tame wolf nevile and bacon 1 and bacon 2 in the light of the evening sun they all waved a last goodbye to their fallen husband brother and friend before the people of ashton went to bed with waltz dead or not they had to cary on but apparently it was all too much for tali not very surprising if you think about it there was only this one little problem she was a pyromaniac when the rest of the colony slept she left her big and empty bed driven crazy by grief she did the only thing able to ease her pain she set the forest on fire finally exhausted almost to unconciousness she fell back into her bed again while she slept the others waken by the crackling fire desperately tried to put out the flames which already started to spread over to the buildings but they simply weren t enough they could either try to save the buildings or the forest not both of course they tended to the buildings to the food storage to be exact however it gave the fire the chance to spread through the forest completely sorrounding the settlement in the end it was all too much tali died in her own fire that she refused to extinguish jones and boyd followed when they collapsed in the infernal heat and then when no hope was left the gods the ancestors the flying spaghetti monster or whatever thi people of ashton believed in heard their cries rain started falling down putting out the fire but it was too late more than three quarters of the colony had been taken by the flames vas stephan and leia were unconcious julia was the only one still able to stand she did what she could but with all the medicine burned she had no chance leia died first vas second this caused his wolf nevile who had been laying loyal by his side to turn mad like the damn tortoise and he ripped the still unconcious stehpan into pieces before he went on attacking a herd of muffalos some kind of marshmellow like buffalos which was his end traumatised julia who managed to flee when stephan was killed wandered through the burnt ruins of ashton blackened stone walls and pieces of charcoal everywhere all the food they stored for the winter was gone the fields empty with no medicine left and her own wounds hurting worse and worse julia found a last smokeleaf joint in one of the destroyed buildings she leant against her brother s sarcophagus and lit it so she didn t feel anything when the pig face men attacked with the solar panels a loss to the flames the turrets didn t react when ashton s last inhabitant finally exhaled her last breath 12 10 creates more immersive storys than many rpgs looking forward to my next colony and possibly its desastrous destruction thanks for reading if you made it this far
