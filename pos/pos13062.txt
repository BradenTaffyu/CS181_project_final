2022 kerbal space program ksp has been since it s release and likely will forever be my favorite game of all time very genuinely i am in my late 20 s now and have been playing the snes since 6 years old for reference as a mentally disabled person i found this game to almost be dark souls hard i remember countless failures at the launchpad and countless kerbals lost forever in orbit of kerbin let s not talk about the sub orbital trajectories i remember almost giving up almost thinking well maybe this game isn t for me that s not what this game is about though to me anyways i would go to bed dreaming of maybe landing on the mun seeing the sun rise along the horizon i had to do it i never gave up i kept trying persistently learning against my tiring wishes to quit i remember it so clearly the sun behind the mun as i approached it for the first time the eerie silence adrenaline spiking i was hooked for life next thing i knew i was studying ap physics in my high school i aced the exams next thing i knew i was studying college maths sciences i aced the final on math i will for the rest of my life contribute that yearning for knowledge to ksp looking forward to playing ksp 2 with my fiance it ll be her first ksp if you want a game that can change your life forever you found it
