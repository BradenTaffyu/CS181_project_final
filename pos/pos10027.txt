2023 amazing game it s leagues better than pretty much every other game in the genre where it really shines though is it s extensive mod support and the community that has developed around it i highly recommend this game if you are at all interested in colony simulators it s like a more cohesive and user friendly version of dwarf fortress combined with all the best parts of minecraft and cards against humanity i love this thing
