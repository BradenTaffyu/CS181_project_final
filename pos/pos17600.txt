2016 man are these some troll reviews this is the best total war game ever warts and all i haven t bought the blood dlc i don t think it s worth 3 bucks i haven t bought beastmen either that sure as hell isn t worth 19 would i tank the game reviews with a negative because i m not happy with them hell no i ve already not bought them i speak with my wallet people who did can speak with their reviews of the actual products they re unhappy with this is not a game of copy paste infantry and cavalry to alter slightly between near identical factions some tw games are completely comprised of such near identical factions others have two or three significant variations that comprise all or most of their lineups being actually unique from others the four base factions are epic utterly different units from start to finish combat is a blast it would be even without magic and monstrous flyers i have plenty of complaints about the game i think city design has been overly simplified agent behavior is terrible as usual and the battlemaps are also hugely simplified boring affairs compared to what they used to be the game is still great though there s no excuse for giving it a negative because you don t like the dlc the dlc have their own reviews use them this is supposed to be here to help people decide to buy a game by getting relevant useful information they can see how much the horribly received dlc costs without review bombing it out of existence
