2020 give a round of applause for bethesda actually investing time and money into this game to fix it rather than completely abandoning it while they were the laugh of the industry fallout 76 while not a perfect fallout game is still extremely enjoyable and i hope to see it continue to grow my only gripe is with the modding system where you need to collect lots of one weapon scrap them and then unlock mods for said weapon at random if there was an event at like the ammunition factory or something where based on what weapon you used you got a couple of mod plans for it that would be great
