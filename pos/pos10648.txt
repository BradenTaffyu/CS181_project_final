2018 so i saw a bunch of youtubers play this game alex the rambler drew durnil he played too and isp and i thought of giving it a try i went in the tutorial done the first 2 parts out of all 13 and went straight to the singleplayer since i thought i knew enough i was wrong i ended up doing the tutorial again so i made sure i know the basics now for the first game like many other people i wanted to play as my country romania and it didn t end well i capitulated to the soviet union anyway the second game the one after reading all the tutorials i guess this is technically the first actual match went better still as romania and i ended up making an alliance with hungary and italy went facist and capitulate both bulgaria and greece it was really fun but i needed to fight greece later in the game and it took me ages so don t try to go for countries very late in the game this very game took me about 5 6 hours to complete or something the game didn t actually end but i stopped playing since it was just so hard to conquer contries at this point so i have learned the error of my ways and i started my second game with poland which i am still doing at this very moment of writing this review why because i have played about 12 hours and i think that s enough to say my opinion first of all the game is really hard i won t recommend this to people who aren t good at strategy and multitasking in some cases but for those who enjoy strategy games go on you have nothing to lose the game might be a bit expensive but christmas will come and so the sales so just wait for that i personally think this game is worth the full price 40 euros since of how fun it is and how well done it is the community is also great with different fun mods to play from time to time good job paradox well made game edit 1 still fun after 500 additional hours of playing
