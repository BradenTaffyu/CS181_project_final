2018 do not i repeat do not name your colonists after your family friends favourite tv characters etc you get so emotionally attached to these parcels of pixels that it really really hurts when one of them succumbs to a man hunting alpaca this is the finest game on steam and well worth paying full price for how many games can you say that about it s an adventure game par excellence first and foremost but has elements of strategy survival and base building thrown in as well yes the learning curve is steep and yes the graphics are from the 1990 s but that all adds to its appeal if you are a fan of the i ll just play 10 more minutes genre knowing full well that you ll still be playing long into the small hours then this is for you this the sort of game you think about at work because working out how you will plan your base is far more appealing than your normal 9 5 this game will make you laugh cry scream and swear all in the same session and that s its appeal straight after losing your colony to tribal nomad raids you ll want to jump straight back into the next to apply everything you did wrong previously buy it
