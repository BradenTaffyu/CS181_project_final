2018 this is one of the best game i ever played it is not a fps it is a combat simulator if you want a fps this is not the game you are looking for if you want to use strategy drive and pilot tanks and helis and also use ballistic to hit your target over half a mile away then this is your game the graphics are amazing and you can create your own missions that can be played single or coop pvp the amount of mods and extra missions is unbelievable i started with operation flashpoint and since that game i played all new versions and releases
