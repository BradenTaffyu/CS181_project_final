2018 engaging and complex empire management game with enough dlc to make your wallet run for the hills definitely worth getting the empire builder package but don t get any other dlc until they re on sale many of them like rule brittania or conquest of paradise are only useful if you plan to play certain nations or strategies so research what you want in the game before you go buying everything if you re coming from hoi4 or stellaris prepare to get utterly destroyed as you fail to understand anything if you re new to paradox games god help you
