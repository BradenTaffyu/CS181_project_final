2022 my experience after 80 4 hours in 3 4 weeks its great i love it already played it on the game pass of xbox had fun on both hated how i switched from xbox to steam and had to completly restart i had nothing but an massively outdated unsold porsche on the market which i cant remove because its not on the same plattform you can feel its an arcade game its fun overall but the time you spend in dont feel like it i spen 80 hours on it and it feels like ive been 40 60 on it but overall a enjoyable game i can recommend if you have the money and the mentality to grind for nothingpositives graphic photomode livery editor story missions very chill racing gamenegatives takes alot of time your data is lost when changing from xbox to steam car sounds tbh
