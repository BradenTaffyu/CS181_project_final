2019 the words of introductionthe time has come for me to touch the pen again and write something about the game where i spent the good last weeks i want to add that this review is based on my personal experience and opinions the following review is also based on my only one playthrough of the game including dlcs i would also like to thank the person who bought this game for me as well as the person who also gifted me the available dlcs before starting i will state that i have not previously played any of the souls games series or similar which may have contributed to how i played and how far i came but let s not beat around the bush it is time to enter the world of lordran where the flame of life begins to dim controls interfacei will start the review by mentioning of what i have heard so much and with which i personally did not have major problems a lot of people have spoken in a environments where i m active that the control are terrible i played on the keyboard and mouse myself so i do not know how it is on the pad but the game allows you to change everything in options although it is very intuitive by default and you can get a feel by the first two locations what to press to achieve the effect we intend to achieve i would like to say that the character that i eventually played was a pyromancy knight so i did not have much contact with what it is like being an archer mage and so on as for the interface of the game it lacks a forced tutorial for the first time because many things can be overlooked and all this is caused by one of the biggest drawbacks of the game all interface buttons are still shown as if we were playing on the pad not once in the game did i rate the messages because i could not figure out which button suits it nevertheless it did not prevent me from enjoying the game when at the fingertips we have souls wikipedia containing information about subjects whose descriptions are not very clear and i really recommend reading these descriptions i sold a special shield myself which increases the renewal of stamina just because i did not read its description and that would help me a lot gameplay battle systemas i mentioned earlier this is my first contact with the souls like game which is why i slowly began to understand how the gameplay looks like within those the world of the game is limited to closed locations and most of what we see is really amazing views but more on that later the game as a whole is one to two lined where the task is to move through the mazes of rooms corridors and swamps to unlock shortcuts illusory walls or more bonfires until the end we encounter a boss fight although for some people it may seem monotonous all locations are diverse thought out and work well together the exploration through them is not so satisfying by the enormity of opponents which we have to repeatedly have to break dying more often from the hands of monsters than bosses is a normal thing the combat system in this game is almost precise although you can complain about hitboxes of some weapons or monsters based upon my game as a knight wielding a light and a great swords was intuitive however everything was releated to the most important rule of these games greed every opponent in this game is different so an attempt to kill him immediately can only result in an unfortunate death the most important is the analysis of what movements they do and the appropriate response time often you must dodge a few times before you attack and the ds3 game is very punished for greed in an flurry of attacks however when we have enough of opponents although i recommend fight with lots and the unique ones for special loot there is always an escape option which i used and somehow i managed to root out through many locations until the next bonfire story questsin the world of lothric a bell sounds signaling the fading of the flame which protects everyone from the infinite darkness with the roar of the bell wake up the undead whose task is to tame the lords of cinder and bring them to their thrones that s all we learn from the intro of the game and in fact what we should remember because during our wander we will not see such a development of the story it exists in the world and it depends on us how well we will be exploring to discover secrets and know more about story of it all if we re talking about story exploration most of what we ll find out are side quests that are completely different from what you would encounter in other games of this type scattered around the corners of the world npcs offer us their services as long as we find them alive and we will not get through the game too fast the slight problem is that during the first wandering we can practically omit all side tasks through their complicated and multiple paths design hidden from our eyes outside of beloved wikipedia steps that we must do to be able to complete them rewards for tasks are usually the constantly increasing offers from buyers however if we skip a well or do not look at every angle it may turn out that we do not know the full potential of the game bossesi mentioned this part a few times in the previous parts of the review and it does deserve a separate category the diamond upon the crown of this game is undoubtedly the bosses with whom we will face from cursed trees meetings with the vatican and swordmasters the diversity of bosses requires us to learn how they move what attacks they perform find a way to read the best opportunities for attack and how many of them can be done although many internet lists rate some bosses extremely low i had a lot of fun against most of them although i had to take a break from the game for a while to regenerate the batteries before fighting the last obstacles some fights are a bit short in the context of how easy they can be for many classes though they can cause problems for others a good example would be ancient wyvern which is definitely one of my favorites but it would be best if killing her would require two or three beats each time with a different path taken a couple of battles are also dependent on the roll of the dice but i am fully aware that this is not something that happens only in the third part of the trilogy audiovisualsgoing toward the end of review the second most precious gem of this game is this through catacombs cities and valleys all the locations we meet and explore during the game are beautifully constructed many of them merge with each other in intricate corridors and in many places we can stand and for a good few minutes to enjoy the view exactly like the first visit in irithyll of the boreal valley i would like to mention that in terms of design on the part of the game some of the locations do not evoke such emotions however if you remove opponents only to be able to enjoy eyes they would also find inner beauty as we are talking about audio as well i have to mention the music and sounds that fill the universe of this game although i have not experienced music in the normal world which was an unpleasant surprise for me the music that plays during the main menu or all bosses significantly compensates for it when church choirs or massive instruments warm up in our interiors in order to overcome all difficulties ending wordsat the end of the review i would like to say each of its aspects gave me great fun and i hope that i will find the strength to be able to continue my adventures certainly i will rate the game on solid 9 10 and this is only when it comes to the base game cause there are still waiting recommendable dlc content about which separate reviews do not plan to write due to lack of that much content and trouble to write off them like this for now
