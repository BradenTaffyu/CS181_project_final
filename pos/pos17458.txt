2019 i ll get out of the way and just say that this game is good short sweet review over right not exactly there s a depth to the game that i haven t seen in any other total war to date and i ve been a long time fan since rome not to say that i ve played every incarnation of the series but i ve played a lot i think the biggest titles right now would be this or warhammer which i also have first of all the game itself is beautiful the layout of the maps in battle and not are very lively with nature being able to see it go through the seasons is very refreshing and each has their own appeal the animations in the game are really good too ca has done really well to capture battle animations and this really shines in the new officer dueling mechanic it s a little over the top on how pretty much your whole army will just ignore the two generals and let them duke it out but i love it speaking of the generals you can t really talk about this game without thinking about dynasty warriors at least i believe that is the case for most people it has pretty much every famous name your familiar with but not all of them are unique legendary characters like cao pi and so on i do really like the dueling mechanic but i haven t actually used it that much a lot of generals just won t duel or can t so i don t find myself using this very often so to talk about the depth i mentioned earlier they ve added some new features with diplomacy i actually really like this as it adds a deeper level of strategy that you won t find in let s say warhammer or any other total war the ability to make vassals and force weaker powers to join you by threatening them is just great there s a problem with this in the a i however as they will often submit to other a i and it just kind of snowballs as it is making it harder for you to expand later in the game i think ca is working on this but it s a problem as it stands another thing is after coming off a game with such varied factions and unique play styles like in warhammer this game feels a little dull in comparison as some others have mentioned when you have played one faction you have kind of played them all sure they might have some different special units and unique buildings but there s not enough variety of this to make everyone feel unique it s honestly a little unfair to compare a fantasy game to a historical one though so i can t knock it down too much for that but maybe as it grows we ll see different strategies and new ways to play overall if you are a fan of grand strategy historical strategy romance of the three kingdoms dynasty warriors and especially all the above i really recommend this game it may not be as flashy and over the top like warhammer with all the magic zombies dinosaurs and etc but this is a good down to earth strategy that you can sink a ton of hours into
