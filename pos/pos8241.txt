2022 this is it this is the game yugioh players have all been waiting for this is not a knockoff game like duel links this is an actual official online yugioh videogame of the actual game it has all of the mechanics it has all the cards this is the real gamethere are many ways of playing yugioh online i e the manual simulators like duelingbook as well as the rules enforced programs sites i used to use duelingnexus when i was active you don t have to play this game you can very well continue playing on whatever site program you were using before as you were so this becoming a thing is sort of a pleasant surprise despite the already available availability of yugioh master duel has proven to be extremely popular when it released causing a store issue of people unable to receive cards after buying them because of an increase in traffic which was swiftly fixed and affected users compensated as well as a notice given to everyone along the lines of hey guys we expect a ton of people to start logging in at the same time after the maintenance ends so you might not be able to get in right away after the maintenance we will be staggering the logins cause there s so many of you maybe it s because it s on steam and on a lot of other platforms other than pc for that matter maybe it s because a lot of players who used to play in the past are discovering this and giving yugioh another spin maybe it s the power of master duel s officialness i don t know for sure but my guess is it s a combination of all of that and here we have it master duel can be another avenue for you to enjoy the game other than the above there s nothing more i have to say to any established yugioh players here instead i think the review has to be directed towards new or inexperienced players or older players experiencing these new cards and mechanics for the first time for these players there are more things worth mentioning the game of yugioh has been around for more than 10 years there are now over 10 000 cards in master duel the trading card game releases sets of new physical cards about after every few months or so the game is evolving and of course has evolved throughout so long of the game s history after 10 years of a card game s existence you can imagine that the game s rules and mechanics have increased in both number and complexity it s still easy to grasp the basics but there is a lot to wrap your head around before you get a full comprehensive understanding of all the rules and advanced mechanics e g how chains work activation resolution problem solving card text structure when simultaneous effects go on chain obscure interactions between specific cards etc on steam you may come across statements like my opponent s turn takes too long my opponent summons too many monsters and kills me in one turn and playing yugioh is similar to playing solitaire you can see this by scrolling down and skimming over the negative reviews which is what i ve just done to get these examples i suspect these sentiments are more held by normal steam users or e g someone just looking for a card game to play online rather than the active players of the game or booked up tournament players for whom there is no need for me to expound my review for while these may be legitimate concerns to a new player these are problems addressed to yugioh the card game instead of the independent value of master duel in itself and are of little to no concern to the latter mentioned established population of players who already know everything about the game what this does show though is that there is a learning curve to modern yugioh and that perhaps this game is not for everyone for a gamer taking yugioh dueling purely as a gaming experience you can if not just by reading others reviews of master duel conclude that it is an easy task to gauge whether or not this game is right for you navigating all this yugioh stuff as a new player can be difficult and daunting if you only stick around the steam discussions and reviews section for too long around sentiments about losing too fast winning too fast people deciding to surrender people deciding not to surrender as well as turns taking too long despite others disliking the number of turns being too short you ll probably end up saying some permutation of those things as well and quit yugioh is better with a friend hang out with a friend who s been into the game and knows what they re doing they ll teach you the ropes recommend a few good deck archetypes to play and set you off on the right track don t sweat it if you initially can t win in multiplayer ranked again this card game has been around for 10 years there are bound to be veterans and other players with varying levels of experience don t mind the starter decks it doesn t matter which starter deck you choose they re all bad it s about the gems they give you a bunch of gems and this is good because you decide what packs you buy that contain the cards you want with your gems and use crafting materials out of the rest of the cards you didn t want to obtain any card in the game out of the 10 000 cards there are maybe only 1 000 cards that are useful enough to see play and only about 10 different deck archetypes you might ever want to try out throughout your dueling career you can easily build 2 to 3 different decks with the gems you receive for signing up and for your first few plays one word of caution if i could only give one piece of advice to my friend who s new to the game my advice would be to choose your deck wisely 1 000 playable cards means there are 9 000 useless cards you should take extra care to make sure that the deck you want to get because you think is good is in fact actually good so you won t regret your decisions later as much as i ve written in this review already some part of me thinks this review shouldn t be over and i even think i ve barely begun to review master duel like right but it does play yugioh the card game and there are a lot of things you can say about yugioh the card game like at this point you can bet there is always someone somewhere who is very vocal about something whether it be a certain card or deck or type of opponent or what they had for lunch or what have you there s just a lot of things you can say about a 10 year old game like yugioh well what do i have to say we got an actual definitive online cross platform game of real modern yugioh as it is actually played welcome to yugioh master duel after 9 years of development we hope it was worth the wait edit the solo mode is so enjoyable i forgot to say this in my initial writeup and this review is so long so i ll just put this here please keep adding to the solo mode and make the world chalice arc an anime
