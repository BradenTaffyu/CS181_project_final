2023 what started off as a rather empty game with random disconnections repeatedly crashing during certain missions no npc s and events that bugged out fallout 76 has eventually turned out to be a good game unlike previous fallout games this one is a mmo so you ll be playing alongside other players but the majority of the game can be played by yourself with a some events benefiting from being in teams crafting makes a return but instead of settlements you now build a camp but also weapons and armour that can be crafted or scrapped for components and recipes food beverages meds and chems can also be crafted with the correct perks and recipes the most noticeable difference is your character now has a thirst hunger gauge equipment wears out and breaks catch diseases mutations ammo weight and dealing with a stash limit so you have to balance your scavenging with what you need levelling up is also different with perk cards so you can tailor your character to your play style but still have the option to change them as required there is microtransactions with the first being the paid currency atoms these can be earned in game but at a slower rate and the other is a subscription that provides unlimited stash for materials ammo and extra cosmetic items the game can still be played without these with little to no problem probably wait until a sale but it s fun to play with a lot of issues thankfully ironed out
