2020 as someone that s been playing since the beta the game has had a lot of rough spots but wastelanders has made it much better there s still some bugs that need ironing out and all that good stuff but hopefully they ll get there all in all if you have some people you know to play with it s a great time and even if you don t most of the community is very welcoming
