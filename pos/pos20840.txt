2023 for someone that s never been interested in the harry potter world and has never consumed any media about hogwarts this game has been an absolute pleasure to play graphicly it s just about what you d expect from a aaa game in 2023 even if you re not playing on the absolute highest settings on some next gen system the game still looks gorgeous for the most part on top of that the game takes place over the course of a whole year which will take you through different seasons that change the look and feel of the world and it s really just a pleasure exploring the same places but from a different perspective storywise the main plot is pretty simple stop the bad guy from becoming the most powerful wizard that being said it s still pretty satisfying and it takes you on quite a journey to achieve your goal besides the main plot there are a few side plots that do a great job of keeping you engaged in them in my opinion these side quests are the real highlights of the whole story gameplay and exploration is where this game shines the most the combat contrary to how i expected it to be before the game came out is really satisfying and engaging with plenty of spell combos and multiple ways to approach it whether you want to go head first or take it slow and stealthy you can do so enemy variety is as it should be it doesn t need any more or fewer enemy types exploration feels rewarding and there is a lot to explore collect and interact with where there are puzzles they are simple enough as to not get too confusing but also not so easy as to become boring there are a lot of different mini games world events scattered all over the map which is quite large from doing merlin trials which are themselves very diverse and have a good amount of diversity to not get too repetitive to constellation spotting at night broom flight challenges rescuing beasts and caring for them treasure hunting through all kinds of places or just freely flying around casting revelo every 5 seconds they are in most cases fun to do unfortunately it does lack one very important and crucial activity a fishing mini game but i guess nothing is perfect the worldbuilding and npcs are pretty complex with plenty of small towns to explore and charming side characters each with their own little story and dialogue and lots of houses for you to rob from facing no consequences whatsoever every shopkeeper has their own life story that are eager to tell you about overall while hogwarts legacy might not be the absolute best rpg out there it is a really solid one and for what little it lacks in some aspects it makes up for tenfold in enjoyment and pure fun there are very few issues with the game and i can t really recall any major bugs if you are a fan of the harry potter universe this game will certainly meet all of your expectations and will satisfy your hogwarts student dream and even if you aren t a fan of the universe i m pretty positive you ll find a lot of enjoyment and entertainment from this game if you are just a big fan or rpgs and you don t know what to play anymore this will be a very good pick and for any completionist the achievements are simple mostly straightforward and will have no problem 100 it
