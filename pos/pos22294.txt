2016 dark souls 3 is pretty cool i guess you play as an ashen one a champion destined to defeat the lords of cinder and link the first flame a sort of beacon that keeps the light in the world while at the same time keeping the darkness at bay i think after beating up a large man with a coiled sword in his stomach and a very angry tape worm living inside him you find yourself in a temple called the firelink shrine which is looked after by this cute lady that has a very long list of chores for you to complete while you re out the firelink works as your home of sorts it s the generally safest place and all of your friends live there but it doesn t have a couch or broadband internet you could probably sit in one of those giant chairs that one of the lords of cinder used to sit in i guess i can t really go into much detail about the plot without spoiling a lot of things so instead i will dance around talking about it like i m playing the floor the lava dink rolls 3 like it s predecessors is an action rpg in the same vain of games like blade of darkness and crusader might and magic while making your character there are a multitude of options outside of just making them look like gargamel from the smurfs you can choose where this character comes from which doesn t do anything but change the general back story and appearance but you also get to pick a starting class in the long run and much like a communist state class doesn t really matter but it can be used to give a head start to whatever stats you actually want to level up during the course of the game combat handles almost like two mustached gentleman having a boxing match unless you re fighting one of the many monsters that lie in wait in which case in turns into you hoping that it doesn t try to eat you with its horrific chest mouth your characters left and right arm are assigned by default to the triggers or bumpers on your controller or to your mouse you can also lock on to your enemy so you can strafe around them and you don t end up being smooshed because your shield just so happened to be pointing the wrong way there is a surprising amount of diversity to the combat you can play as a shield bearing knight or shotgun wizard to be sure but the equipment and stats really help how you shape your play style you can just go it as a knight or mage sure but weapons are assigned to your hands rather than your character itself like other rpgs putting a staff or a charm in one hand and a sword in the other will allow you to cast spells as well as whack anything that gets too close just like using a shield in both hands will let you block doorways for others and giggle at them like the massive jerk you are drake souls 3 hotline bling also has this neat online feature like it did in the other souls games others playing the game can leave messages that can warn inform or screw with others the game will also leave blood stains on the ground to show you where other chumps had died so you can either avoid the danger or stand in amazement at how some people can get killed in this game but most prominent and arguably most important is the coop and pvp features in the game while embered which is this games equivalent of having humanity you can find summon signs on the ground that allows you to summon others into your game this other players will help you defeat the area and it s boss in return for an ember upon success or more than likely they ll be killed in your place so you can trek on while they make a splat on the floor kind of like a loony toons episode but maybe you aren t going to be a helpful little ghost that beats up monsters for others maybe you want to be the bad guy throughout the game you can find these little red orbs or one big infinite red orb if you do something for someone these red orbs allow you to invade other peoples world as a red phantom as a red phantom you must kill the host player in return for a few rewards you don t even have to kill him yourself actually you can just have the world do it for you though be warned because that can backfire through another of the games items i ll leave for your to discover all these online features really work to enhance the general experience of the game it makes the lonely journey not feel so lonely now that you know there are others on the same crusade as you are it can also work as a motivator showing you that it s not as hard as you thought if others could do it there are also these groups in the game you can join called covenants which work as a sort of guild system for the online community each covenant has their own thing going on as well as their own goals the world of dan souls 3 is fairly large and expansive in it s own way while the world of dark souls 1 was like a ball where everything is connected the world of dark souls 3 is more like a branch with a main road that breaks off into a plethora of curious locations there s always this sense of wonder and treachery when you embark on a new quest through a dangerous area something that the second game seemed to lack since none of the areas didn t seem all that connected like how the top of a windmill led straight to hell getting immersed into dark souls 3 almost makes you feel like a witcher if that makes sense while you can just go through the game and reach the end there is a lot of reward for exploring and finding secret areas and dungeons that you may have not had to visit during your journey you learn about the world around you by paying attention and scrounging for lore through various npcs and items you obtain along the way the items and equipment you pick up each have a description ranging from just the use of the item itself to the origin and history of the character it may or may not be related to they don t seem all that important but sooner or later things begin to click and you start to understand the world around you a little bit more the boss battles is where dark souls 3 really shines some of them are lame sure but most of them feel like a climatic end or halfway point of your expedition into a dungeon or a cave or a castle or whatever bosses are fast vicious and hit hard forcing you to think on your feet they challenge your reflexes and decision making skills and you feel like a true hero when you manage to make a boss look like a fool by dodging all of their flashy and powerful attacks butshould you play don king souls 3 screwing mike tyson it stands as a nice end to a series as much as i would prefer if from was known for their games about robots dashing at one another aggressively i can see how dark souls became their most venerated series it s a game that i can see pulling people into the series and making them interested in the previous games in the series is it crushingly difficult as some people make it out to be no but it s challenging it expects a certain amount of competency from the player and doesn t want to just hand things to you its kind of lame to see articles and videos floating about on the internet of people who s entire job revolves around playing video games wishing that the game had a easy mode just because they were unwilling to learn and adapt to the games mechanics which is why you should listen to me dirk dark souls 3 is the kind of game that expects you to actually sit down and play the game be engulfed in it s dark and foreboding world learn and connect the pieces that make up it s lore is it the best rpg ever made no and if you didn t like the other games in the series i doubt you d like this one but is it a fantastic game definitely dark souls 3 gets 5 heavily armored camping trips out of 5 and the dirk dickbutt stolen oscar award of approval
