2021 early access review this has very quickly become one of my favourite games of all time i absolutely recommend buying it 15 is a steal as with any game i feel that it is fair to present a list of my observations both positive and negative whilst playing pros incredible construction management mechanics reasonably factorio esque impressive graphics given the context of the game having tens of thousands of solar sails simultaneously displayed whilst maintaining their textures upon closer inspection is stunning masterfully programmed i have yet to encounter a single glitch in almost 100 hours of gameplay surprisingly smooth learning curve i found that the initial complexity faded rather quickly absurd levels of playtime replay value i have yet to finish my first playthrough at the time of writing very satisfying the feeling when you begin to launch solar sails construct your first dyson sphere and get to actually see the results of your gradual resource gathering on such a scale is amazing regular updates too many early access games are abandoned and unloved the developers of dsp are evidently passionate and skilled brilliant early mid game gameplay i can t say i ve ever had the first 40 50 hours of a game fly by so quickly the urge to expand my supply chain to reach the next tier of resource is immense cons some localisation issues i am sympathetic towards the game s developers as it is a chinese studio and i do not possess the mental fortitude to learn any another language let alone the ability to speak english and mandarin still it can sometimes be somewhat glaring to see a grammatical error out of place sentence and it is occasionally confusing requires a reasonably beefy pc runs smoothly on my 3080 3600x but at about 50 70 gpu cpu usage repetitive endgame compared to the previous progression the dyson sphere building involves an awful lot of waiting and boring resource repetition there is a balance to be struck between making the megastructure feel as immense and resource heavy as it would theoretically be in the real world and scaling it back a bit for the purposes of gameplay whilst there is a weak victory condition in the form of the universe matrix it is actually quite far removed from the dyson sphere and the paths to make either are very different an arguable lack of depth this is a somewhat complicated point as i m not suggesting that there has to necessarily be hostiles in a game such as this but i feel as if the endgame suffers from a lack of things to do with the absurd amounts of energy that you are now producing perhaps it could be an idea to slowly increase the reliance on energy and decrease the reliance on specific resources towards the very lategame to avoid the aforementioned resource repetition overall this is a very good game and i am amazed that it was only released into early access 6 months ago dsp has an astounding amount of potential and i am excited to see what the developers have planned in future updates
