2019 anyone here old enough to remember operation flashpoint that came out back in 2001 well i had that back in the day and absolutely loved it and arma 3 is it s spiritual successor seeing online streams of this game along with dcs world were the kick up the backside i needed to save up and finally get a new pc after 10 or more years being strictly console gaming when you first play it instantly feels like operation flashpoint all over again but with more polished visuals the size and scope of the maps the amount of vehicles and the squad commands etc this isn t as fast paced as call of duty or battlefield it s more of a sim you have to actually plan and execute your missions carefully rather than just running in and shooting anything that moves i haven t tried multiplayer yet as i m still trying to get through all the campaigns and dlc first but if i have one major criticism it s the a i i m sure most of us are yet to play a game with perfect a i but you d think with all the years of experience bohemia interactive has with these games that their a i programming skills would be a bit more seasoned there s nothing more annoying than shooting from around the corner of a wall only to have an npc squad member start doing the same thing from the same wall but right in front of your line of fire you then fail the mission for friendly fire also on some missions there s been incidents of squad members lagging far far behind the rest of the group when the the said member is given the order to regroup he confirms the order but just goes prone on the ground and doesn t move at all you quite literally have to go all the way back to his position before he get s back up and begins to follow you again and that brings me to the menu command system yes there are lot s of commands which are laid out pretty much exactly the same as operation flashpoint s i wasn t a fan of them then and i m still not now there surely has to be a more user friendly and efficient way of getting these commands into the game and for the user to implement them quickly and efficiently anyway that s it is it worth getting yes i think most pc gamers have this in their collection by now it s a great game but the a i and menu command system feel out dated and they re what let s the title down ever so slightly for me personally other than that enjoy
