2017 i m gonna start off by saying yes i don t have that many hours on arma 3 but i feel like i should put out this review so you can get my opinion and give a short story on what led me to playing arma you can skip the story if you like arma 3 is an amazing game more like an amazing military simulator i been playing games like call of duty most of my young gaming life i was eventually shown battlefield and moved to that since it was much better than call of duty i been playing on the xbox system for a long time before getting into pc gaming i seen a lot of videos about arma here and there but never really cared eventually after long years of school i graduated and got a gaming desktop as a graduation gift a good one to because it runs arma pretty good with the 40 i had in my wallet i went out got some steam cards and bought arma 3 i have played arma 2 for a bit when i got my pc but i really wanted arma 3 after waitng for the 2 hour download and spending that time watching how not to be a noob in arma 3 videos i was ready to play arma 3 is fun but very hard at the same time there is a lot to learn and even playing for a while not everyone will still unserstand all the controls and mechanics the story mode is ok a nice vr traning to help you get use to about everthing in the game you ll need to have a good time now multiplayer is really fun the standered modes or even the community servers are great the community is ok no community is good people will give some pointers if you need it best to play with friends to have a good experiance the game is great it ll take many hours and anger and fustration to get use to it but over time you will improve and it ll be fun i really recommend this game if you want a military game that has a lot of vehicles to choose from a decent ammount of weapons amazing fun community mods get arma 3 you will really enjoy it i hope i was able to give a good refremse for the game thanks for reading my review 3
