2023 early access review ark survival ascended is a good game if you like the ark franchise it s literally the same game as ase which is no surprise since it is a remaster if you are expecting a new game unreasonably do not buy it if you are unwilling to deal with the pitfalls of early access lag bugs crashes glitches limited content scope do not buy it save yourself the complaining but if you are okay with progressing the process of basically paid beta testing and want to enjoy that feeling of going through original ark s life all over again do buy it it is a straight upgrade in terms of quality of life and will continue to operate as the ever green version of ark with new content would i recommend the game on two conditions 1 as noted above if and only if you are okay with it being early access and full of bugs glitches and poor optimization 2 you have a good system the game is hard to run and requires very good system specs if you have anywhere near the min specs don t bother even the recommended specs aren t that great running the game if you do not have a very good gpu at least a 4070 rtx with preferably 12 16 gigs of vram and a good cpu with lots of ram you will unlikely be able to experience the game to its fullest vram is also very important 8 gigs of vram does work but is not optimal for max settings and on the highest settings will likely lead to crashes even if you have good fps on my 4070 rtx i can run the game on mostly high at decent fps due to dlss and framegen about 50 70 but the game is very unstable and will randomly crash be warned you can go days without crashes playing 6 hours a day or more and then you crash every 10 min logging into the game but i like the game and am willing to see it through up to you
