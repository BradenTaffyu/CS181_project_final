2022 i could never properly articulate my feeling for this game so i m going to leave this one slightly open ended this game is one of the major reasons i steered my life towards game development it proved to me the power of interactive fiction it is the bedrock of the mountain i will die on that games are the greatest form of storytelling you are not voyeuristically watching someone else s experience like film you re not being told it like a book it s your experience your joys monumentous victories your brothers in arms your sorrows your pain regret and remorse i miss them i did what i had to do this is a game about the meaning of life that is an overused phrase but it s true it s about orders and power and lies and propaganda and who put us here why we fight what we devote ourselves to be it a greater will or each other every boss in this game is named after a philosopher marx engels beauvoir kierkegaard the list goes on the ship of theseus pascal s wager is anyone left i would say play this game live this life know these people maybe it ll change you the way it changed me
