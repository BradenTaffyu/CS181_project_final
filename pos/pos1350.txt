2016 early access review tl dr zomboid is an immensely intricate challenging rewarding game supported by a dedicated team of indie developers and is a must play for anyone interested in the zombie survival genre many people choose to turn to the fps genre for their zombie apocalyptic survival games but with project zomboid i feel that the developers at the indie stone scratch that itch perfectly for starters and i feel that this is sorely mentioned in reviews the indie stone has been consistently developing this game since it was released on steam they continue to show their passion for this project with regular updates developer blogs videos explaining new features and much much more they have provided a strong example of how early access is supposed to be done and i fully anticipate that they will have a full release of this game at some point though as far as i m concerned the game in its early access state is worth far more than the 15 00 asking price as for the game mechanics can be read about here in other reviews found online particularly in the zomboid wiki or learned as you play they aren t that difficult to grasp and their simplicity makes the game that much more charming however do not be deceived by the surface simplicity this game is incredibly challenging and as a good game should it rewards those who get it with a truly unique gaming experience every time i start up a new character i get further than i did on the last let that be a testament to the game s consistency you re not going to die constantly from zombie bites if you know how to evade fight them you re not going to bleed to death if you know not to climb through a broken window or how to patch yourself up if you do virtually any building can be made into a shelter doors and windows can be barricaded ropes can attach to upper story windows for security furniture can be moved taken from other buildings and brought to yours or built and with tools like the sledgehammer virtually anything can be destroyed you can even build entirely new structures once your carpentry skill is high enough and you have the supplies to do so how do you get the supplies looting this game s inventory system is simple and repetitive at times but it gets the job done backpacks and hiking bags help you deal with the large amounts of weight you re going to be carrying looting houses diners warehouses and even banks requires thought and skill to decide what you need and what you don t supplies are finite so there s always the constant thought of well maybe i ll need this box of paperclips sometime better grab it now while i m here when looting be careful of your surroundings zombies are almost always present and while at times the game can feel like more of a general survival simulator rather than a zombie game they re always lurking around the next corner i could go on and on about the intricacies of this marvelously crafted game but suffice it to say that if you re looking for a zombie game that surpasses the norm and want to support fantastic indie developers look no further than project zomboid
