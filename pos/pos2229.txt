i recommend the game positively because i spent 150 hours on it two first weeks that i took the game and in total 200 hours so saying the game is bad would be a lie a year ago i wanted to play fallout 76 by a free weekend steam offering acces of fallout 76 during 72h but the game was so unintuitive that i didn t even play for one or two hours before uninstalling it after in early march 2024 before knowing about a upcoming fallout series on amazon prime a friend suggested i try the game again with him so bought it on instant gaming and after a few hours i ended up playing alone why it s complicated to progres with a friend because mission and progress is only tracked for the group leader this means you ll get a message asking if you to assist leader when you will enter in a building or cave even if u was at same progress than your friend you will have to go back by yourself afterward in same building or cave for do your progress this is why at end i finish to play it alone friend given up the game we can consider that fallout 76 is more an fallout 4 with player vendors the interactions between players ramdoms if you can call them that mostly involve being in a group to get the xp multiplier while continuing your own adventure aside from events where you have to kill mobs come boom boom kill every mobs win and leave there is no vocal proximity so communication between players is done solely through emotes not even a proximity or server chat there is a vocal group but most of the time no one talks or you ll hear background noise from players with poor quality microphones based on my experience despite everything even though the game is marketed as a multiplayer experience it is more playable like fallout 4 as previously mentioned i didn t necessarily feel like i was always doing the same tasks or missions even though like in all games you need to take a quest complete it and come back in that aspect all games do that i think spending 200 hours for 10 is more than fair i didn t buy any dlc or opt for the subscription service as i was initially skeptical about the game at start i believe the game still offers a good experience for anyone wanting to play a fallout game the release of the series has brought in many new players and bethesda decided to release a major bug fix patch after the series on amazon prime ps i still find it unfortunate that it took an amazon series for them to release a bug fix patch that players had been waiting for several years
