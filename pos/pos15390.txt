shared struggles are a great way of cementing your friendship or convert you to impromptu cannibalism the games title is basically a great pitch for the entire game you run around in a slightly spooky twilight zone with your quirky friends trying to find enough calories to pass around before the monsters find you and drain your life and sanity in equal measure dst revolves around the same great loop of exploration resource management and crafting that was the hallmark of don t starve only now you can do it with a bunch of equally deranged pals and it is so much better with friends the intricate dynamic that emerges from a spontaneous division of labor sprung straight from marx s manifesto combined with the creepy victorian atmosphere and gorgeous hand drawn art works wonders balancing out the ever diminishing levels of hunger sanity and health the entourage of characters all with their own powers and weaknesses enables you to gather a dream team of quirky individuals and start building an utopia in the otherwise dreary wilderness a graveyard of seeds a screenshot of don t starve together by l msk kr ka now if a buyer should know one thing about this game is that the learning curve is quite steep and since time passes in game with seasons that quickly can turn a chill vacation into a nutrient starved death trap one must be aware of a few key mechanics to even survive the first year into the game the reward for mastering this game however is in my humble opinion oh so sweet in the end this is a game i keep returning to and not only for the daily login gift that is an economy in itself but for the emerging narrative that is so vibrant there are so many hilarious ways to fail in this game and each and every one of them leads to a great story so try to remember that when you get harassed to death by murderous frogs and tentacles trying to get enough paper to write your final will recommended but be aware that it can be quite daunting to get into especially if you have never encountered the first installment of the game
