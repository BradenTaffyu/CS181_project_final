2022 early access review as other more articulate people have said better than i could this game appeals to all those same glorious pleasure centers that factorio does what i d add is something this game helped me to overcome in my perception of these kinds of games factorio factory town satisfactory and dyson sphere program are the automation city builders that stand out to me from modern indie devs all of them have this interesting quality the game is fun for a certain reason when you start out then there s a difficulty spike somewhere down the line and then the game is fun for a different reason i ve always found it natural to play with the first phase of the game but i ve always had a hard time with the second one what that translated to in factorio was looking up tutorials online it opened up my ability to engage with the endgame to have the early game smoothed out and min maxed a little however i always had this nagging feeling that i d deprived myself of something you can t unlearn the knowledge of how to do things efficiently certainly that doesn t mean i couldn t possibly refine my early game any further or try other things but it did mean that i sort of skipped part of the journey of maximizing efficiency on my own along comes dsp the thing about factorio is the end game of building the rocket is barely an endgame at all you can stop when you launch the rocket but it s practically as big a change for your factory as adding in your purple and yellow science are in dsp finishing the ostensible goal of the game building one or more complete dyson spheres is somewhat more monumental it s an aesthetic victory remembering my situation with factorio i told myself i wouldn t look up dsp content online because i didn t want to spoil the growth curve for myself and i faltered a bit right at that difficulty spike i mentioned before somewhere after making my first yellow science i realized i needed to rework my factory that its layout was flawed to the core and i went to restart but i found myself not wanting to try i tried again some time later same thing just stopped after half an hour and moved on i started again recently and decided to just look up some tips for base layout fine game you win i lose but as i got going and as i reached that spike it felt different it was still a spike even if i knew what to do next efficiently it was still a challenge but more importantly i realized how badly i wanted to get that sphere built that s when i had my important realization about city builders i m not a build your own crazy cool thing out of legos guy i m a build a pirate ship out of a pirate ship lego set guy i want that sphere done i don t want to invent it i didn t lose i just started playing the dsp i wanted to play i liberated myself to enjoy this game by allowing myself to engage with community content before beating the game on my own if you want to figure out how to get to the something and you re someone whose reward is the journey instead of the destination by all means challenge yourself in this game it certainly gives you that journey but if you just think wrapping a star in a massive superstructure would be cool to witness with your own eyes and would happily accept some help in making that happen just be that person this game s great it s a spectacle it s a puzzle of optimization and efficiency and scalable design just like its contemporaries but i d say that you can tell just from the prologue narration that the designers wanted to afford you the chance to bear witness to something just as much as they wanted to present you with a challenge enjoy it how you want this game is rewarding just from engaging with it you don t have to play it a certain way to get the full effect
