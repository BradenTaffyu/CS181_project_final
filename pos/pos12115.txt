2021 easy review the best racing sim in the world for serious sim racers full stop and yes its bloody expensive and yet for some stupid reason i keep sending them my money so must be amazing damn if only someone else could remotely match it for cheaper don t even start though unless you plan to drop at least 300 into it in the first few months and if you don t already have a proper sim rig i would say look elsewhere rather spend the money on better gear first of all
