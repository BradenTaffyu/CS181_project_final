2016 i zapped undead teletubbies with my wiimote yoshis saved the world from a wild waluigi horde i trapped some armed soldiers inside a fenced area and placed oil barrels and bombs all around them and watched them commit suicide i roped myself to a speeding kart and didn t even get a scratch i knocked a tv over with my crowbar while everyone was watching sm64 bloopers i organised a party at a nice old wooden house and then burned the entire place i threw my friends around the world with my physics gun i sacrificed thousands of test npc s to my dubstep cannon this game provides so many possibilities to crack up with laughter even in single player but especially when playing with friends so epic
