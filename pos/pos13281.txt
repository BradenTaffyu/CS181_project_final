2016 one of a kindi started off with this game quite some time ago back in the days when kerbin was still neon green and all the fuel tanks were an off putting shade of blue given the hours i ve put in so far the time has finally come for me to offer some decent feedback on this title so that others might know what to expect graphicsthis game isn t extremely impressive visually and while its art style is mostly consistent that doesn t change the fact that it suffers from both somewhat low resolution textures and a general lack of detail for example the lack of settlements on the earth analogue planet i won t criticize it too heavily though while orbiting a planet or moon the game does shine quite nicely literally as the sun rises over your celestial body of choice despite its flaws it definitely gets the job done better than its closest relative orbiter orbit medphys ucl ac uk and one should keep in mind that it is an indie title there s enough detail here to be satisfied and that s without installing modifications high speed low drag a screenshot of kerbal space program by lavernius regalis audiothe in game audio design is decent but it gets repetitive eventually the explosions are particularly satisfying though given the nature of the game they are something you likely want to avoid causing the music is calming but it too will start to grate on you as you hear the same song yet again i would suggest modifications or to mute it and put your own music on instead there isn t a ton to talk about here performancethis game s performance has improved considerably lately previously i would ve had a bone to pick with kerbal space program but it has made a turn for the better in the past year or so it still won t run on just any pc but even unimpressive laptops can run it on low settings fairly comfortably i should note that performance is highly dependant on what is currently happening in game if you construct a large ship the framerate will drop due to physics calculations also the newest version of the game at the time of originally writing has some issues with regards to bugs and glitches so you might want to wait for another patch or else revert back to an earlier version via steam beta gameplaythis title is in a league of its own with regards to gameplay i m still not sure that i ve ever played anything like it it features a relatively realistic representation of orbital physics and revolves around a sandbox building experience where you construct virtually anything ranging from space shuttles to fighter craft to rovers or even boats out of rocket and aircraft parts naturally some people will spend all their time using aerodynamics mods to create realistic aircraft designs others will recreate historical rocket missions some might colonize another planet and others might just spend most of their time crashing into the ground or fumbling as they try to understand how space works no matter what you like doing there s almost certainly something for everyone with kerbal space program if you re up to the challenge you can even begin a career managing a space program accepting contracts and missions to fund your launches in my opinion the only game that comes close to rivaling this title s gameplay is orbiter and that title is a much more in depth space flight simulator that does not allow building your own ships out of different parts community contentthis game is absolutely phenomenal with its support for community content from its humble beginnings the aeronautical parts in game were directly inspired by a modification and the author of that mod was later hired by kerbal space program s development team there are now mods for virtually everything realistic aircraft engines weaponry ranging from machine guns to ballistic missiles careful recreations of historical spacecraft complete redesigns of the physics system to feature full fledged n body gravitation calculations in game computer systems to automate your vessels audio and visual modifications that completely change how the world looks and of course complete overhauls to the solar system bringing things to the scale of real life the game doesn t even have multiplayer and someone took the time to code a fully functional mod to make it happen the possibilities for community driven content are seemingly endless in this game and more is created every day verdictthis game is a perfect example of everything right in pc gaming and is probably one of my favorite titles on steam i gained a better practical understanding of orbital physics from it than i did by reading about orbital physics in textbooks and encyclopedias thanks principia and i still marvel at all the possibilities in this game it is astounding how kerbal space program has progressed from its early access days and despite its flaws and any questionable decisions made by its publisher it is a fantastic title that i recommend everyone try i recommend kerbal space program
