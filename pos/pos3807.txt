2022 i stumbled on to this game while looking for something similar to ogre battle 64 which is one of my favorites i greatly enjoyed symphony of war and it definitely scratched the itch for a tactical squad based combat game i played it on hard with perma death off which was a good combination for me the gameplay is incredibly fun if you re a fan of the genre as some others have mentioned the menus could be more user friendly but they didn t slow me down or frustrate me in any way the story and character dialog weren t incredible but i enjoyed the overall story and the twists and turns along the way there were a few small things that really stood out to me in many games like this you are pretty limited to the number of squads you can deploy which can be frustrating when you have a larger army than you regularly get to use sow did a great job at eliminating this by consistently increasing the number of squads you can deploy at once which allows the player to create new units over time and play around with different strategies the other is that the final battles in some of these games are far too easy and leaves the player unsatisfied the last battle in sow is appropriately challenging and quite enjoyable to see all your squads contribute together if you enjoy tactical rpgs i highly recommend this game just remember to play it on hard if you re an experienced player
