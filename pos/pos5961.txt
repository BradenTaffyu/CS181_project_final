2022 i ve bought the packs slowly over the years as they released on origin bought the base game here so i could start launching from steam but man does looking at how much money i ve spent during that time on the store page hurt please i don t need to face the amount of money i ve dropped spending hundreds of hours making virtual people s lives as miserable in a video game as mine is irl edit they did indeed announce the base game as free not too long after i bought it here truly i am the world s favorite clown
