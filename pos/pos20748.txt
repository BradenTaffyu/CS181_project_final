this is a strange game on the one hand it gets the world and the combat very right on the other i m supposed to be a new student starting as a fifth year at hogwarts and before christmas i managed to take out a sizable portion of the wizarding world population he who shall not be named has nothing on me every time an npc suggested we stealth through a mission i couldn t help but laugh why would i stealth i was a god after only a few months of edumacation story is okay but predictable game play is fun but repetitive enemy types are repetitive side objectives truly felt like busy work for the sake of busy work breaking into locks opening chests for some type of cosmetic felt pointless on the other hand i liked how gear was handled here you could apply whatever gear you wanted but then tweak the gear to look like any piece of gear you had previously acquired i thought that was a nice touch and added to character customization most of the students and professors are interesting and well acted in the movies all slytherin are instantly racist and evil here the slytherin characters had depth and were genuinely interesting then there is the trans character included because of the jk rowling controversies this character added nothing to the story trans character has a name but i don t remember it and will refer to the character as trans character the writing of trans character felt like something homer simpson might have put together in an attempt to salvage poochie and when trans character isn t on screen the other characters should ask where s trans character i just love trans character trans character was only included as an attempt at calming controversy it was obvious boring and added nothing to the story or the experience but at the same time it stood out because the writers gave trans character more dialogue than say quidditch guy beast shop owner potions seller or most of the professors a lot of dialogue surrounding a very inconsequential npc voice acting is a skill and the actor portraying trans character wasn t very good at it pointless pandering from a performance standpoint i encountered no crashes game could have some frame rate inconsistencies i had weird audio glitches with the main character it felt like my character s voice actor was being auto tuned at times was a bit off so yeah strange game loved the world enjoyed many of the characters i think combat might have broken the story many elements of the game felt unnecessary and trans character felt out of place but outside of that i think i liked it 6 10
