2022 early access review i would recommend this game to other players pros has a little story you can get into that introduces unique islands and moderate challenges you can build decorate and paint your raft any way you want make it big or small lots of things to grow and cook it s a fun concept and can keep you busy for hours has lots of things to craft and a few nice things to find like a captain s hat cons the islands start to look the same after a while not including the story islands which there aren t enough of in my opinion not enough variety in islands too much similarity you can t customize your character at all for a game that allows so much freedom to decorate and customize your raft having a pre made character seems at odds with the spirit of the game story is too short the sea water goes over the raft too much a raft would sink with that much water washing over it good thing you can build it into more a boat if you get creative tools weapons equipment break too quickly is everything made of marshmallow why do bowls disappear after one use overall i enjoy the game and am looking forward to updates i just hope the development updates don t take too long
