2017 thanks to the free weekend and 67 off i gave this game a go even though most of the recent reviews were less than flattering of fallout 4 i figured hey what the heck i have actually enjoyed it so far 16hours gameplay as of right now it feels an awful lot like farcry 2 4 with a lot less game ruining monotony don t get me wrong there is a lot of doing the same kind of task over and over again but it s different enough to mean you don t want to put your head through the screen like farcry 2 4 the playable area is pretty impressive as i have only hit one of the invisible walls once whilst getting completely lost finding my way back to sanctuary i ve got to say that the hardcore fanbois of fallout really have painted this as the deus ex 2 or f1 2015 of the series it simply isn t what it is is a little less gruesome rendition of the series which i personally appreciate it has it s bugs eg when you place an object on terrain that isn t completely flat it sits on one edge and floats in the air on the other 3 or when the dog dogmeat runs into a rusted up car body the car body is pushed around not the dog do these detail glitches kill the game no yes it is a little aesthetically displeasing and in some cases humorous but not game killing at all the story is pretty vague you get thrown into a world that has very little forward loading but once you emerge from the vault there is very little story to follow i could imagine that if you were actually cast into the role in reality there wouldn t be a narrator close by to fill you in with what s happened anyway so again not a deal breaker and that s from a guy who loves a strong story line and finally to the often whinged about choices available in the game yes there are limitations there are things that bethesda doesn t allow you to do my favourite complaint from one fanboi was that he couldn t shoot the children in the game if he wanted seriously if this is your biggest concern maybe it s time to go and get professional help you ve got issues i like the game its fun and with plenty to do build and explore would i have bought it at full price probably not but this genre is not my most enjoyable it s something i will play on and off when the desire strikes
