2021 early access review not gonna lie i am quite biased as i see many games that fail at launch and disappoint even after that this didn t i bought it full price 3rd day after ea release after having seen fotage that it was indeed already playable i clocked in about 200 hours in those first 2 3 month in an unfinished game and enjoyed it a lot i then put it aside to wait for more features and of course the mods the mods the modding tools i heard should be real good so i cannot wait to be playing bannerlord in the middle earth and in westeros and in warhammer and in medieval europe etc etc now i picked up the game again 9 10 month after ea launch and the game is close to full release i d say it s awesome if you liked m b you ll love bannerlord it is intuitive yet not dumbed down it is immersive yet still a sandbox it got great character development faction building and natural early to late game development i recommend you buying it if you as i like an atmospheric single player game with a succesful symbiosis of rts and rpg elements in it
