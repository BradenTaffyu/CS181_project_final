2022 early access review this is probably one of the best games i have ever played the gameplay is incredible unlike other zombie survival games guns are more of a hindrance than something actually useful a well prepared survivor with a good handle on all of their moodles alongside a stockpile of ammunition can surely eliminate entire hordes however an unprepared survivor with a revolver and a handful of bullets will soon find themselves chased by the entire town with hundreds of infected chasing down the player surviving is difficult in a world where nowhere is safe sometimes it s better to walk away than to try to face a group of zombies that comes banging on your door the character progression is amazing starting out obese causes your character to be unable to climb tall fences or scratch themselves badly when hopping over smaller ones starting out underweight makes your melee damage feel like you re poking someone with a squeaky toy hammer instead of a metal one surviving long enough to improve all your skills makes you feel unstoppable until a zombie sneaks behind you and you get that one fatal bite that ruins everything while there is no story aspect to the game the world itself alongside the details within every house and building supplemented by the annotated maps tells a beautiful and horrible story of how the world went down when you get the chance listen in on the emergency radios or news television or travel through one of the busier highways you ll see hundreds of infected wandering on a highway that seemingly is empty and without any vehicles until you find an endless roadblock of wrecked cars and a few more infected lingering about the visual storytelling behind just that sunday drive really makes us feel like we are a part of this apocalypse the sound design is just wow there s only a handful of soundtracks in the game but every single one of them goes hard the atmosphere feels thick especially as a newer player as zombies would bang on every window and door around you the sound of every weapon feels substantial along with that sweet watermelon squashing sound of an infected finally dying the high pitched jumpscare sound that follows up with the heightened heartbeat of the character causing panic of the same caliber for the player even the calmer moments in the game listening to the mumbling of a television or radio broadcast while turning through pages on an educational book and shoveling graves to throw the hundred or so corpses outside of your newly established base establishes this sense that you are really a part of this world also there are a lot of amazing community made mods which enhances your experience in the game quality of life changes or just fun extras or challenges definitely give them a try
