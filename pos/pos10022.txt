2016 11 11 20181 0highly recommended best indie game that i ve ever played period 17 07 2016 early access alpha 14highly recommended this is my review after 20 hours of intense gameplay rimworld is a sci fi colony simulator where you ve to survive in an hostile stranger planet everything is managed by a fantastic a i storyteller who creates dynamic events during the gameplay simulating interpersonal relationships psychology trading climate biomes diplomacy and a lot more a typical scenario you can have in your first game your colony is formed by three mans everyone of them with positive and negative traits you re on a stranger planet so you ve to start to build a base or at least a refuge for your colonists there are a lot of dangerous things out there such as wild animals snakes bears wolves and many more or bandits once you ve finally your base you ve to survive and mantain your colony happy otherwise they ll start to fight each other and it s not the easiest task of the game believe me gameplay and graphics is very similar to prison architects and dwarf fortress who ispired the devs actually is early access and probably someone of you could be scared of this but there is nothing to worry about the game is fully playable and bug free or at least i ve not encountered a single bug in 20hours of gameplay very stable and light scenario is procedurally generated by seed and events are always dynamically created so it will never happen to have a game like the previous one not even if you load a previous savegame well in the end it s very rare to say in a review that i can t find a single bad thing in a videogame and this is one of those very rare cases absolutely recommended to anyone of you who loves games like dwarf fortress prison architects and simulation games base building strategy games 9 5 10 waiting the rest of the content during the early access
