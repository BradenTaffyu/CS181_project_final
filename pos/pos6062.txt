2021 game became free on 18th october 2022 personnaly bought it on sales works fine on steam deck but for myself i need to play in desk mode because of origins can t launch ea games without it i now own way more dlc not so much but time to time i grab them on instant gaming or steam sales when they are nice ea still greedy but it s still nice to make fun situations for your sims or create stuff to post for people to eventually use need also to say thanks to the modding community who does a great job at giving us tons and tons of stuff to use
