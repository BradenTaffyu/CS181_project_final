2016 early access review as i reviewed the single player version of don t starve i think this one should have a reivew of it s own because it s very different and yet similiar so let s begin with the core of the game the gameplay whilst most of the stuff remains unchanged or majorly unchanged the dst version feels a bit laggier than the sp single player version even when hosting your own dedicated server using the built in server hoster and not the external one it takes about 0 3 seconds for the server to get the command to harvest resources and after these 0 3 seconds it will initiate the picking up sequence the time used to be smaller but since they introduced the caves to the built in server hoster the servers have started to lag compared to the older version enough with that let s skip to the combat as with the core gameplay of looting the combat still remained unchanged though the feel of it is worse remember what i said about the delay when picking stuff up it probably won t affect you that much when you only do that but in combat you will feel it much more kiting is 200 harder in dst which i assume is because of the server lag also the feel of the combat is very different compared to the normal game i should also point out that if you haven t played the sp version of the game you won t feel like anything is wrong until you do try it as its the superior version of the game the game is also much harder the mobs can absorb much more damage and they inflict more damage aswell making this game built for a team of players i d recommend for people with a group of 3 people and above to play it the giants got their health doubled and damage aswell making this game impossible without a group this version of the game has stuff which the base game doesn t have for example beefalo riding the feature was added in order to add more fun to the dst version i suppose as it might be fun to ride them with friends but while i have about 30 hours as of now i have yet to even use this feature the built in server hoster is excellent it actually allows you have mods in your server without the hassle of extracting them to a folder installing them using a mod loader and such all you have to do is download them from the workshop and enable them in the mods tab and you re good to go the built in server hoster also allows you to customize your world like the sp version which is great because you can choose how much of what will appear in the world and also allows you to make the game work as you wish also this version has skins which as well as all the other games with skins are only cosmetic i must admit i even bought some dst also comes with the rog reign of giants dlc which adds a lot of features to the game i can t even think about the game without it and by purchasing dst you get a free copy so that s great all in all this version is good for a group of people to play as i said 3 should do the trick while playing it alone is impposible hence the name together this game is good if you re already familiar with the game although i recommend buying the sp version of it as its much better for learning the game if you ve never touched it it offers a smoother experience and it also has the sw shipwrecked dlc which is fun but its still in early access so many features are still being added this game is great nonetheless it is by far one of my most favourite games of all time i recommend you to get the mega pack as its worth every dollar you spend on it
