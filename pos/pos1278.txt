2023 early access review this game can get you sucked in for months this game has evolved a lot and with mods being a must this game is amazing you can play however you want in sandbox but a huge piece of advice is to make food scarce and power and water turn off normally aswell research how to make zombies feel more realistic i e no zombie re spawn and no migration if you adjust the other setting to be easier the experience will be dull and wont feel right
