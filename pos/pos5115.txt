2018 i understand this game is different than previous fallout games and i get it isn t a good fallout game as people say but i like it it surely is different and missing stuff it makes up with solid combat breathtaking enviroment and actually fun story and quests plus modding i did play fallout 3 and new vegas but i didn t get hooked sadly i get that creation club is crappy and i agree however it doesn t take away from how fun fallout 4 for me is and i don t like rpg s that much my story with rpg s started with witcher 3 i was more shooter simulation racing type of person rather than rpg then i ve played the new prey then skyrim then fallout 4 and i am hooked i quite like this game and i feel it really is something i will spend hours in i did read people s opinions and i get where they came from but i am a newcomer to this series despite my brief contact with previous fallout games however if someone wants to get into fallout fallout 4 is good as a starting point because of how easy it is to get a hang of then it s time to play older titles and i may do just that try again and see if i will get hooked thanks bethesda for a fun game i will get other games from this company for sure in future becuase they seem to know what they re doing even if their games have obvious flaws i just hope this company continues to produce games with such depth as fallout or tes
