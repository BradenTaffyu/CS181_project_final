2017 early access review this game is not easy this game will test your willpower this game is grindy this game is ing fun so i kinda knew what i was getting into because i watched a lot of youtube videos before i got this game the only problem is the videos i was watching made this game look a ton easier than it is i guess thats the power of editing if you don t know about cars i suggest looking up a build guide for the engine you can do it yourself and try to learn but its going to take you a long time there is a build order that you can mess up some parts can be put on before they re supposed to be which will prevent you from putting other parts on so you ll be stuck either starting a new game over and over or taking the engine apart over and over this is only the beginning of the struggle though another tip for anyone looking into this game when you are putting your name on the license there is an option at the bottom of the license to turn off perma death i suggest you do this for your first few saves you will crash driving to town you will get hit by npc drivers you will break down flip your vehicle and die of dehydration so back to the struggles i ll describe one of the many adventures i ve had in this game i was in town mucking around and ended up getting sent back home i won t say exactly how because it would be a spoiler to something i found quite funny so i get home a little frustrated my van is in town with my moped inside of it google shortcuts to town find out theres a boat near your house i jump in the boat and drive over to town grab my van start heading home flip my van just outside of town great take my moped out of the van drive it home grab my tractor to flip over the van tractor goes like 20km h get to where the van is takes 15 minutes of messing around to flip the van leave the tractor there drive the van back home take the moped to go pick up the tractor drive that back realise i m almost out of diesel in the tractor so i decide to take the jerry can to town to fill up its not until i get there that i realise the green jerry can is for gasoline only and theres a black jerry can at home for diesel drive back decide to take my car i built to fill up both jerry cans and grab some other stuff make it to town in my car fill up the jerry cans grab a bunch of supplies beer food etc load up the car make it halfway home and my car breaks down try to walk home end up dying bring my pumper truck to tow my car to the mechanic show up to find the grocery bag from the store had exploded the contents inside my car so my car is loaded with sausage pizza milk sugar yeast beer everything tow the car to the mechanics manage to only lose the rear bumper on the trip there damn car moves like a water skier behind a boat left to right to left to right grab a small amount of the stuff out of the car and head home to wait for the repairs to be done repairs done i decide to head to the mechanics with the pumper truck to tow the car home so i don t have to go back with the moped and retrieve one of the vehicles make the genius decision to take the highway car driving towards me decides to come into my lane i swerve with the pumper truck but he nails my car i m towing behind me muffler beer sausage jerry cans everything goes flying all over the road at this point i decided to load what i could find into the car and drive it back and pick up the pumper truck later because towing sucks balls barely make it home in the car its overheating again check fluids its out of oil coolant and won t hold either another trip to the mechanic but now i gotta wait by the phone for people to call jobs in so i can afford to sorry for the long review but if you aren t willing to do what i just described then this game probably isn t for you hahaha i got 26 hours played as of this review in less than a week its fun if you can handle it enjoy
