2023 i completely beat the game thus at this point it doesn t hide any more secrets from me tho it doesn t change the fact that it had been a huge fun and hogwarts legacy was the game i really needed and i don t exclude replaying it in the future as it s become my personal favorite game of the 2023 it s not perfect but absolutely deserved a positive review pros beautiful addicting world full of satisfying but often undemanding fights using magic was exteremely fun and gave multiple possibilities of having a great combat experience you can try stealth defensive plants potions choose to learn unforgivable curses or just use mastered spells quite nice character development you can spend talent points on improving your magic skills and upgrading your equipment items absolutely stunning beasts and landscapes offering tons of activities side quests puzzles exploration the room of requirements being in general your base where you can prepare your gear brew potions grow plants and breed beasts it can be also decorated both by conjuring items from the collections and by changing its style with the help of your own slave i mean house elf engaging and fun side quests full of unexpected twists and sometimes heartbreaking situations compensating for the boring main story quests unlimited in time or by the main story despite not giving actual moral consequences of your actions in some cases you can get a better reward and or piss off the npcs large freedom of action the possibilities of customizing your character from their appearance voice to the gear they use various and interesting side characters at least some of them fun but again quite simple puzzles versatile game for many hours and for every generation thanks to the fact that you play as a fifth grade student the plot seems more mature and at the same time it gives the opportunity to learn all the basics decent optimization beautiful graphics and atmospheric music great on steam deck cons my biggest complaint is in spite of a huge level of immersion the lack of an actual moral system we can pour out dark magic all over hogwarts and no one will even bat an eyelid and no we can t be bad per se just rude even if you choose a bad ending and decide to open the repository except for the mysterious death of professor figg there are no consequences and you can still win the house cup and be praised for what you ve done there is no penalty for robbing houses or using unforgivable curses i think the biggest consequence i had was natty asking calmly bloody hell how did you learn this spell choosing a house is a small matter apart from making friends from your house faster i suppose or getting an additional quest when it comes to hufflepuff little varied life at hogwarts the first night will be the last you spend in your dorm i feel there could be more interactions with fellow students and more activities within the house you belong to you can t really storage the loots or use your room also the character can t sit so furniture like sofa and chair are just a decoration boring main story i get you re supposed to feel like a gifted chosen one but the result was average for me no actual storyline from ravenclaw there could be more potion ingredients etc so it d be more complicated to find them many npcs were boring unlikable and poorly written characters i won t miss like for example i wasn t even sorry when figg died no quidditch maybe a chance for a dlc in coop in the nearest future you can t romance sebastian and poppy but i get it s a family friendly game cutscenes in ancient magic and merlin s trials spots cannot be skipped no photo mode therefore you can t take beautiful screenshots it was a great adventure that gets you back to your childhood dreams and reminds you that your inner child is still there evoking many pleasant memories as a potterhead i m really impressed by the whole universe and how smart the devs created a story before the chosen one and only harry pottah play it and see for yourself
