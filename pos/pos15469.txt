i went into car mechanic simulator 2021 knowing next to nothing about what s under the hood of a typical car 60 hours later and counting i ve learned a lot and i m enjoying the experience tremendously this is a polished and well constructed game and after an initial learning curve it becomes intuitive and highly addictive it is very satisfying to troubleshoot and complete a complicated repair job and enormously satisfying to buy an abandoned husk of a car from the junkyard and repair it into a gleaming beauty and make a lot of money doing so my only quibble is that the in game music is really bad and best turned off very highly recommended
