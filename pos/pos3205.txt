2020 a delightfully addictive role playing game if you fall in love with the game during your first playthrough as i did you will revel in beginning additional playthroughs to experience the different characters classes etc with how much there is to discover it is unlikely you will see everything the game has to offer in your initial playthrough it is almost imperative to play the game more than once fortunately there are so many ways to approach quests and battles which adds to the replayability and reduces the monotony however if you ever grow a little tired of the base game there are so many wonderful mods you can add to reinvigorate the game they ll give you the encouragement to spend another hundred hours or so in an extra playthrough
