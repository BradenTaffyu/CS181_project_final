2019 product received for free 2024 update house flipper is a casual renovator that paved the way for many simulation games that followed primarily revolving around living spaces dlc added bunkers pets farms tools many decorations and workshop support i ve left the contents of this review with minor edits because i feel it s still pretty much the same as a whole as if some hgtv show got game ified house flipper burst onto the scene mid 2018 with a surprisingly mundane concept you army of one must clean up fix up dress up and up sell homes of different shapes and sizes sounds boring don t knock it til you ve tried it flipper streamlines a series of simple tasks into a cohesive whole topping it off with enough options to let your inner decorator run wild the magic here isn t in the fun of manual labor but rather the ease of which you re able to complete it and the satisfaction of a job well done flipper grants you a private virtual oasis in increasingly turbulent times and therein lies the secret to its success watch two mission gameplays here welcome to the neighborhood a screenshot of house flipper by drifter pros immersive atmosphere fair graphics very streamlined controls breaking tasks into simple mini games upgradable perks to accomplish just about everything faster more efficiently over time a large catalog of furniture decorations tiles panels paints to customize with one free bunker dlc adds basements 3 buyers properties new workshop items and custom image framing support new dlc features building custom homes from scratch pets garden lawn mowing drone crops easter egg homes such as a recreation of the house from home alone modern art a screenshot of house flipper by drifter cons there s no real challenge to the game you can purchase a property and immediately sell it garbage and all for a meager profit poor optimization long start up time high memory usage may tax older gpus it s hard to coordinate your designs the virtual tablet catalogue doesn t suggest matches and you have to know exact names to find things i wish they had added themes or similar suggestions tied to specific colors after completion of the main and side jobs it s sandbox mode you can flip houses forever but there s really nothing to spend your money on long term no multiplayer if you care about decorating with friends dlc locked achievements garden hgtv luxury pets farm bunker is free read my garden flipper review here roach problem grab a vacuum a screenshot of house flipper by drifter flipper is fun accessible and very easy to get into but just like the homes you remodel you ll always find some surface flaw that could be patched or a feature that could be further improved to name a few the game may trigger your ocd when you find out that tiling wallpapering has quirky behavior around windows and doors and doesn t give you control over orientation when applied many of the objects and appliances limit your color control speaking of color you can t mix custom ones so you re likely to encounter situations you wish you could go beyond what s provided and no matter how hard you work on your home your limited pool of potential buyers actually don t care about the aesthetics as much as the presence absence or number of rooms appliances and features so why has this game cemented its space in casual game sellers because it fulfills a specific niche in a very simple way you can escape to a virtual oasis with no rules or deadlines and feel like a pro designer with a few clicks of the mouse put on the radio or listen to a podcast while you work and you can enter an almost zen state this game is wholesome and family friendly for the most part although parents might want to screen the meyers home for its rather tame spooky surprises the value of your purchase depends heavily on you if you like sandboxes and don t mind digging through the thousands of player added workshop items you can create some really impressive stuff but you ll need spare disk space for all the bloat this includes as well as good notes to remember names as your in game pda doesn t organize these effectively you can share your creations with others for bragging rights and visit the palaces others have built as well as for the pets personally i found these more a hinderance than help whilst cute they often block your construction spaces so i opted to tell them to stay put and disabled their needs to not have to refill water and food more of an issue with farm animals especially gluttonous pigs harvesting crops and animal products don t earn you nearly as much as actually flipping homes so i pretty much got rid of them after the interest wore off though i can see this appealing to younger gamers recommended on sale all content combined is not cheap the franchise bundle is probably your best bet as more dlc has been announced likely to be added to it and subject to a stacking discount whenever sales take place achievement hunters aru s guide is the flipper s bible it s all in there as mentioned earlier the dlc is mandatory for 100 i have about 60 hours total after completing all the new content one time saving tip you don t have to finish jobs 100 as soon as you meet the threshold cash it in you can revisit any location for specific achievements and once you get what you need you can even quit the job so as not to repeat the extra work as i learned the hard way lastly i was frustrated with chickens they only lay eggs in the house shaped coop you must open the small door for them to enter and if they don t lay right away restart the game note that you need exactly 20 eggs if you somehow skipped over to 21 it won t trigger this review was commissioned by the pcgame t curator updated daily
