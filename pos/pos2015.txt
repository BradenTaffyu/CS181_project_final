2022 played this on and off for years always really enjoyed this especially as a big fan of kotor and the early bioware games like the mass effect trilogy and dragon age this can technically be considered kotor 3 in terms of the storyline and considering how much of it the kotor storyline carries over might as well consider it as such the base game storylines are incredible for a mmo its clear to see why the game was so expensive to make its such a shame though in recent years the game has been declining in quantity of content the new expansion for example was less than 2 hours long and im not exaggerating honestly though this game is great for being in the star wars universe regardless of what you want to be from jedi or sith to smuggler or trooper i dont have enough time in the world to review each and every storyline this review would be a novels long just know if you like the star wars universe there s a good chance there is something in it for you even if the combat can be a bit dull at times just please bioware sort the development out for this game i really don t want it to be shut down and the recent size of updates has been atrocious
