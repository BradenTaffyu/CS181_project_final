2019 do you have a vr headset get this game do you have a racing wheel of some kind get this game this is by far the best racing sim i have ever played it is no hand holding full on sim action although if you enable all possible driving aids then it s also suitable and fun for beginners or arcadey racers too i now have a monster of a pc but back when i had an old i5 with a 1060 gfx card this game still ran beautifully it is impressive how well optimised assetto is like in vr you can crank up the super sampling and the pc barely flinches the modding community are excellent for this game too lots of downloadable cars tracks and loads more if you enjoy a good drive whether it be hardcore track racing drifting or even just a free roam cruise then honestly this game won t disappoint p s i use an addon called content manager to launch the game and sometimes use oculus home to launch it therefore my hours played on steam is no where near what i ve put into this game probably more than 300 hours
