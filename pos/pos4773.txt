2022 fallout 4 is a wonderful shooter but not so much a rpg the perks system is pretty good but its large so expect a bit of a grind to complete it the weapons are fairly customizable and there s a good number of them the human enemies are balanced according to your level but their ai is a bit wonky the monster enemies are also balanced and their ai is a bit better than the human ai the main story is okay but the real fun comes from the sidequests and dlcs there are so many places to explore from map waypoints to unmarked areas it s great to just walk around and discover new things this game gets insanely better with mods downloading only 20 of them will make the gameplay and story better it has good replayability and great graphics 8 10
