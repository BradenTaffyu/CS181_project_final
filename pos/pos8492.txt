2020 the game is the most realistic hunting simulation game i have played the graphics are compatible with most modern laptops and desktops even the low settings are pretty good only wished the animals ai was more realistic for example in real life animals will take the path of least resistance same way we walk in worn down paths instead of overgrown grass right next to it i d like to see something like that implemented instead of the animals taking a generally straight path through bushes and what not also the maps don t accurately define edges of water sources other than those minor details its a great game 9 10 rating from me
