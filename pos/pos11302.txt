2022 early access review i ve played quite a bit of this game and just this last session with two friends it surprised me yet again we were holding out in a barn difficulty was cranked up zombie spawns on blood moons up and this was bloodmoon three the barn had several floors and we were expecting air attacks we smashed trapped the ground floor made one entrance and waiting on the second floor at first it was shooting fish in a barrel one guy had to go to the third floor and repair the roof to keep the birds out while myself and the sniper wracked up the kills at first the only downside was that two of us ran out of ammo and there were several more hours to go the birds started putting holes in the roof and we were running out of materials to patch them then everything started to fall apart the roof literally collapsed as the spine was shredded by the birds and the rest of the roof couldn t support itself we shredded a dozen birds when zombies started pouring into the second floor from a point where they had stacked up and managed to jump up as we handled these two threats we had less than an hour to hold out and we thought we d dealt with the worst of it then the zombies collapsed another support on the building and the floor started to crack abruptly one side of the barn just collapsed taking one of my friends with it the rest of the floor started to crumble as the collapse moved across the house i had time to run to the last edge with my other buddy and watch the one on the ground surrounded and eaten my surviving friend said to run for the motorcycles and i reminded him that mine was out of fuel i d have to run to the nearest building he wished me luck and we hit the ground running sustaining only minimal damage from the fall with nothing above us to collapse on us his motorcycle was close and he zoomed away as i jumped a fence and climbed on a truck as they destroyed the fence and charged my position i realized i was dead if i stayed and i dashed into a nearby building and slammed the door behind me shooting two zombies who were already in the building i had time to turn to the door and watch as the bloodmoon mob ripped it open my friend feeling guilty circled back on his motorcycle and drew his spear ready to rush the mob from behind and go down with me but i had a few seconds before his arrival i unloaded my pump action shotgun into the doorway as the door gave out and in desperation pulled out my baseball bat to smash the few from that wave still on their feet i then ran through another door taking me back outside and reloaded my shotgun as the room filled behind me at that moment i heard the game sound signaling daytime and the end of the bloodmoon the zombies are slow in the day and i could cleanup without any more coming it was over we wiped the sweat off our faces and the blood off our hands i drew out my shovel and started excavating the collapsed barn looking for whatever we could salvage from the gear we had in there the whole thing was incredible and entirely organic when the game is rolling it s a 10 10
