2019 part colony management part rts part rpg rimworld carves it s own place in gaming as a unique experience quite unlike most other games with difficulty setting ranging from a walk in the park to oh god please stop hitting me and those difficulty setting extending deep into the game s mechanics rather than just enemy units do more damage and have more hp rimworld delivers a satisfying experience for all moods perhaps just as impressive rimworld boasts a massive and active workshop with hundreds of mods it s not unusual to see people with 200 mods on a modlist take your already impressive base experience and add cults and eldritch abominations total overhaul to star wars universe including jedi sith twi leks wookies and ewoks magic convert it to medieval times add nuclear power change how your a i acts change your interface the list goes on truly a callback to the golden age of gaming and an experience that this writer hasn t had since the days of warcraft 3 once you start modding the game will never be the same amazing experience
