2020 early access review this game is about survival you start from nothing you don t have weapons food water you are basically piece of sh t in time you get powerful weapons build bases to defend from zombie hordes get vehicles to travel faster explore towns villages military bases collabsed bunkers and buildings etc the only thing i don t like is not that good hud and that my character needs to eat and drink 100x per day summary it s awesome even better in co op 9 6 10
