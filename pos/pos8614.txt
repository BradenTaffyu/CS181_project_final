2022 i ve got to say i am not a real life hunter but boy do i like to sink some beer and sit in my hide waiting for the prey to come to its drinking spot i look through my binoculars and gauge the distance to help with my shot placement beads of sweat form on my forehead as i gently move my right thumbstick to bring the recticle inline for a lung shot i hold my breath and gently sqeeze the rt button on my controller the shot rings out like an explosion of ecstacy in my headset and my heart is pounding at 150bpm according to my fitbit watch once the dust is settled i realise i have once again missed my shot and promised myself i wont drink and shoot ever again until tomorrow game is a solid 10 10 have some fun and some beers you wont regret it
