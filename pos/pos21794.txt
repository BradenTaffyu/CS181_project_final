2022 i am new to doing big reviews i will try my best sorry for an incorrect spellings or poor grammar i first played dark souls 3 in 2016 couple of months after release some friends mentioned how difficult the game is some gave up some got good so i went out and brought it for the playstation 4 i decided to stream it i think i was expecting to be sort of good at it i was wrong so i create my character spending around 20 minutes doing so he looked cool i liked it i think i chose the knight class at the time so i get up out my grave walk down the path check tutorial messages kill my first enemy gained confidence miss a few details i am now at the ravenous crystal lizard i die over and over again i die so i thought what am i doing wrong games an issue its not me yush it was me so i actually learned his attacks when to dodge and managed to kill him i am at the 2 hour mark at this point and have not even arrived at the first bonfire i get to the bonfire light it sit try out my new emote and i feel good i kill all the grave wardens grab the firebombs jump to the coffin grab that item now i am walking down towards iudex gundyr i have no idea who he is at this time what his name was i pulled the sword out i did not move i wish i started swinging attacks whilst hes getting up he stands up swings at me and i get hit i run away use estus flask run back oh wait no hes right behind me i get hit and sent off the edge i go back failed attempt again i die i think i died around 10 15 times now remember i am streaming a family member is watching me die over and over he is motivating me it helped alot but in the end i could not git gud i quit went on fallout 4 pc spoke to preston on my way to a settlement that needs help a month later i thought about going back on so i did made a new character forgot where i left off and got through the first area in around 30 minutes less than the two hours before haha killed the crystal creature second try i am now at iudex gundyr this time i am not streaming i m not a streamer just did it for a group of friends that literally watched me die over and over this times a lil different i realise don t get hit loli won t lose health if i don t get hit what a genius i try slashing iudex whilst he s standing up and i see blood slashing sounds good sign when he finally stands i see he lost health from that i am happy fire bombed him at second stage ill just round it up to an estimate of 5 times i died to him the second time i came back from a rage quit a month later so the starved hound scared me sword master brutally murdered me i lost my ember i go back to sword master die die die yup you can tell i have serious issues with learning at least something about the moveset of the enemy be patient nah games never taught me that this is what made me fall in love with dark souls i played bloodborne after my playthrough on dark souls 3 that went actually well considering ds3 basically trained me so i am now in high wall of lothric i die so much fail at almost everything i end up with a game time of 20 hours seriously i just could not get my head around the move set stay patient the right stats weapons its like through my life of gaming dark souls 3 actually taught me something my favourite location in dark souls 3 undead settlement everything about it just perfect so beautiful yet so terrifying i loved it this is the area i decided to git gud stay back roll when need to learn every enemy s move set before committing to an attack don t go crazy with attacking just take a damn breather give myself space lure them out if needs be why was it that every enemy i see i charged in like i am literally the dragonborne well i am gonna one two miss a few in this review nameless king ended me a few times i could not figure out how to escape aldrich s arrow attack until i did crystal sage yup chase the purple one one hit the fakes mimic s fail at mimicking a chests chain my ps4 playthrough ended with ng 7 few achievements missing items from covenants needed now were gonna do a little bit more of a jump in the future i buy dark souls 3 on sale pc 2021 december grab all the dlc i am ng 11 stops scaling at 7 probably gonna start again in the future what i say my friend what is that concord kept grind vertabrae shackle uh i did it all of them i wanted the achievements all of them and i got them everything else yes great fun i did it all offline i loved pvp on ps4 the amount of hours i spent in arena anor londo invading summoning mad spirits red soapstones placed i probably spent 10 hours of the 170 at review time in pvp on pc the moment i learned about the hack sending players into ng gaining access to files big nope so i researched if i could get all the covenant items offline and committed to it all achievements unlocked now finally i have done all of bloodborne i completed all parts of dark souls 2 sotfs just need grind npc for covenant items spells dark souls 1 remastered is what i am currently playing i love it dark souls really opened up my eyes to gaming especially on a game that to me was difficult i started a no hit run managed to get as far as nameless king no armour needed idea is to not get hit fashion didn t bother me when attempting this run ancient wyvern nameless kings pet did its fire thing at the ground i should have ran out of the way but i was a second too late i love the drakeblood armour set paired with the farron keep helm plenty more armour sets i like as well do i recommend dark souls 3 well i had never played a souls game ever before starting ds3 for the first time i got deep into it loved every second of it well the dying got me at the start but i appreciate it now the dying taught me to not do that i recommend dark souls 3 i love this game after this review i am on a mission to 100 dark souls remastered then sotfs thank you so much for reading i really appreciate you i hope if you decide to buy this game you forgive me for the spoilers i dropped and also i hope you have a blissful playthrough that brightens your life f it i wish you well in life either way edit thank you all so much for the awards likes you are all so amazing i am
