2016 i know the fallout series from the promotions of fallout 4 when it was announced it is a great game as a fan of fps games i can t deny the fun of fallout 4 until i bought and play fallout new vegas fo nv i start to realise what an rpg should be like it would not be exaggerated to say that this game is the best among fallout 3 nv and 4 the goodsbeing a real rpgin the game when you talk to someone else there are usually at least 3 dialogue options to be chosen different dialogue can lead to different ending of that mission or even brings good bad impression to the ppl in that area in contrast the dialogue options in fallout 4 is limited to 4 only in some situation different dialogue options will lead to the same consequences fallout 4 has been focusing on fps too much and forgotten the rpg part fo nv has shows what a good rpg should be like the player can immerse in playing as the protagonist attention to detailas mentioned before what the player has done can affect the reputation of him her in a town settlement for example if the player has completed a lot of side quests assigned by the residents in the settlement residents there will be more polite to the player and may even offer discount to the player when he she purchase stuffs there if a player wears a certain cloths in a certain place npc may recognise him her as a companion enemy and stops shooting start shooting the player these attention to detail warn players to be cautious when making a decision in the game and immerse into the game similar to fallout 3 player can choose a skills when level up and unlock unique dialogue options in certain circumstances this makes the conversation goes smoother or deeper player can also explore the history of some special characters or some places by talking to the residents there those details in the game makes the game a lot more immersive than the fallout 4 fabulous storylinei don t want to spoil the story too much the game offers a wide variety of options for player to choose so that the story is driven by the options made by the player a little tip upgrade speech first as it will be beneficial when the story progresses the badspoor optimization to newer operating systemit happens with fallout 3 too bethesda softworks simply doesn t give a about the game running on newer operating system to even start the game properly player needs to search for fixes on the community forum i run the game with the fixes found on the internet and the game will still crash periodically such a great game is sort of abandoned by the developer in contrast i can still run half life 1 on my windows 10 pc smoothly without needing to fix the game by myself i don t think it is that hard to make the game run on newer os smoothly bethesda softworks please fix this minor flawsthe abbreviation of certain ammo does not have any full name with it and sometimes may cause some confusion to the player it may be a good idea to display the full form of the abbreviation when player select the items also some bugs are presented in this game i get stucked behind the wall and can t get out sometimes it is really frustrating overall impressionthis is a fabulous game if you can patch the game yourself and tolerate the bugs on that game i really hope the developer can publish an update to the game so that player can run the game flawlessly on newer os this would really make this an undeniable masterpiece
