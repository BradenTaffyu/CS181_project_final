2023 the short review mixed feelingis cities skylines 2 worth it yes but it still needs some work and time the longer review the 100 hours i put into cities skylines 2 kept revealing new complexities and problems to solve while revealing new great feature more short comings and performance issues if you are like me have spent years playing cs with mods and dlcs you will instantly notice a big difference and a bit of disappointment but to be honest cs vanilla was not fun to play either the mods and dlcs made it fun they have included many dlc from the first game in cs2 already but moding and the editor is not available yet and we don t know when the editor will be released i really miss all the mods and am waiting for themi can go on about the details of the game but there are bunch of youtube videos explaining how to play it and optimize what is already there i think the developers need more time to optimize the game and include more things so far they have been listening to people and acting towards fixing issues i think colossal order should gift everyone a dlc as a sorry for the early release and performance issues spending 100 hrs also means that i m hooked already and am hopeful for better fixes and bunch of mods to optimize my game
