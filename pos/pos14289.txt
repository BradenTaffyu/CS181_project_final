2022 early access review after a few hours 275 i can say i love this game it is huge factorio on steroids i love the fact that there is no rush just play as fast or as slow as you like the only thing to do is build a giant factory spanning multiple star systems in a galaxy far far away sounds boring but it really isn t the interface is excellent the graphics are very nice nothing negative i can think of but beware it burns away the hours like crazy going for achievements makes it even more interesting but it is not a must very much recommended as others also say and i agree a true masterpiece
