2019 early access review okay so i ve been 23 hours on this game and will give an impression to be remembered this game is still in development easy to understand the gameplay mechanism fun to play with your friends could expand your creativity on how making a beautiful raft on sea lot by i mean a lot of grinding basically this game itself is like grinding simulator at first it ll be boring but when you get grasp of it it ll be fun for a while repetitive coz when you ve done big things you just dunno what to doit s a great game but need more content for the start and some kind of things so this game doesn t feel really that grinding simulator ah also i wish there is a new island where we could find a radio or somewhat so we could listen to songs
