2016 excerpt of my review here only a mere 20 or so hours with the game i have barely begun to scratch the surface in stellaris if i know paradox and i think i do there are many many more hours of entertainment to be had because of the dynamically generated gameplay where every universe you create is unique in my opinion stellaris brings a much needed breath of fresh air to an otherwise stagnated 4x strategy genre where almost every game is in part inspired by either civilization or the master of orion series it s done with a finish rarely seen outside of big budget big studio productions with a very small team stellaris has an excellent combination of freedom of design and deep political system that we don t see nearly enough of in my opinion the pace of the game is great for the most part starting out with a complete hands on control of the empire early on while slowly handing off more and more power to local governors that can administrate entire regions of systems for you in exchange for more autonomy and a reduced tax rate your neighbors react in a very realistic manner to your world views which can very easily lead to war i can say from personal experience that being pro slavery is not easy when you re surrounded by pacifist hippies who suddenly seem less interested in peace and much more focused on plotting your inevitable demise and raising war fleets to accomplish that i ve really enjoyed my time with stellaris and i m sure i ll be having many more late nights of playing it over the coming years i have minor gripes with how automation of ships work or the lack thereof where i definitely think it should have been an option information about mechanics and choices is also a little on the light side at times with all of that in mind i ve come to a final score for stellaris of 9 and a half appendage it falls just shy of a full 10 at current but knowing paradox s dlc model they will easily make it there in time and maybe more
