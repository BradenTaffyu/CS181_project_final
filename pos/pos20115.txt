2015 this review like my fallout 3 review will be long for my fallout 3 review go here new vegas still stands as one of the greatest games ever to be enjoyed not only as a fallout fan but an rpg fan as a whole the game brings together combined elements from fallout 1 fallout 2 and fallout 3 while adding a few things of it s own here and there to make the game even more exciting to top it off this game presents hardcore mode which basically turns fallout new vegas into an almost realstic game combat combat has seriously improved since fallout 3 the combat in this game instead of a straight forward shooting up your enemies with vats with a few grenades here and a rocket launcher here and a lazer gun here and last aid of your companions or the other faction that is fighting your potential killer you will have to rely mostly on special ammo for example if you are attacked by a deathclaw the only way to kill it or bring down it s defeneses the name will have a shield icon right next to it is by using armor piercing rounds music the music of this game is both combination of western and vegas style you will need music mods to make that list grow even larger but in the end it doesn t really matter because both music pieces presented in fallout 3 and fallout new vegas are great either way quests there is a barrage of quests not only from the modding standpoint but also dlc and the game overall you will spend a lot more hours with these quests as the same amount of hours you do with fallout 3 and the other fallout titlescompanions companions are no longer lydia s with guns they are actually smarter and with the aid of the companion wheel it makes life so much easier when talking to your companion for him her or it to move back go non agressive wait trade equipment and maintain distance bewarn if you play the game in hardcore mode your companions will still be smarter but they will end up dying and staying dead till you reload your save or you restart the game after you finish it there are also companion centered quests which by the way some are fun but others are just boring and tedious to do world exploration unlike fallout 3 where it really shows the post apocalyptic side to the world fallout new vegas really doesn t have the gritty atomosphere sadly it is more of a homage to movies like mad max 1979 and the book of eli with denzel washington 2010 all desert a few settlements here and there hostile areas here and there with random events you only have the new vegas area as the dc ruins of this game but unlike d c ruins of this game it is populated also the game map itself is huge rpg the rpg elements in this game are heavily seen for example faction armor depending upon what faction armor you wear the other side and the neutral party might be offensive or hostile to what you wear the choices you make in game also shape how the faction looks at you leveling up is much different from previous games it goes on an odd or even level of leveling up so install mods to fix this little issue and make it more like fallout 3 s leveling up system lastly the perks within the game that you obtain either through challenges or leveling up really make a difference so choose wiselydlc the dlc within the game are extremely well done if you want to put your skills to the test play dead money if you want to play a dlc that touchers your inner nerd play old world blues if you want something more faction oriented and exploration play honest hearts and lastly if you want all three combinations except the inner nerd part but offer a much more bigger challenge play lonesome road there are also player add ons that gives you basically starting gear voice acting fallout new vegas not only has a huge celebrity cast but also the voice acting for the different npcs ranges differently so from settlement to settlement don t expect about every odd or even number of npcs to sound the same the modding community the modding community has been ever helpful to make this game not only challenging but more prettier and much more longer also of course the usual mods weapons armor companions etc massive spoiler alert because unlike in fallout 3 where you can free roam after broken steel dlc all dlc takes place before the final battle at hoover dam so make sure you really take your time with this game because there is no going back when the final quest begins conclusion like in my fallout 3 review fallout new vegas has things that fallout 3 should ve had but again fallout 3 had things that fallout new vegas should ve had as well but regardless of that it is really an enjoyable game to play and this game is a definite recommendation
