2017 this has to be one of the most realistic games i have ever played if you are a hunter at heart this game will fulfill that void of not being able to experience the thrill daily i ve already put a lot of time into the game and i know i will be putting a lot more into it i ve read in some of the negative reviews that there are some issues with bugs or graphics gliches yet i haven t noticed them or they seem too trivial compared to the absolute beauty this game delivers on i don t need to list a set of pros and cons because realistically this is the closest thing you will get to being outdoors and yet still sitting on your computer at home if you want the full immersion experience you can turn off all the helpers in the settings and play the game how it should be played after 30 hours i m still in awe of how beautiful this game is the design is perfect and while you may run into an occasional bug with the ai it doesn t take away from how realistic this game is
