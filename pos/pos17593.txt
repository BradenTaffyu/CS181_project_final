2022 fun game but 2 is better do not buy this at full price as ca s current pricing model is terrible i think they are just trying to bait some people in for the 3 game map but they have yet to even get the third game in a reasonable state do not be suckered in with the promise of a giant sandbox when the current state of the combined map will likely be a bug filled mess i have a lot of hope for the series but it will take time to get the 3rd game up to par and incorporate all the previous content
