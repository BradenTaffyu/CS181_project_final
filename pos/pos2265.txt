2020 fallout 76 despite it s terrible bug infested launch and quite infamously negative reputation both online and amongst the playerbase for a plethora of reasons 76 has recently had somewhat of a revival due to continued support from the developers addressing game breaking issues and bugs while also releasing free content updates increasing the longevity of the game continuously i was unfortunate enough to purchase fallout 76 when it was released and endured my fair share of game breaking bugs infinite loading screens and continuous broadcasting from other players in proximity voice having apocalyptically loud domestic arguments but alongside the typically frequent mentioning of it s technical faults 76 at release was quite an empty game there wasn t really much to do that did not seem repetitive the challenges were quite repetitious and unimaginative kill 30 scorched there was a noticeable lack of n p cs that weren t robots due to giant mutant bat disease which lead to this apparent empty world which was quite ironic considering this was the first online multiplayer fallout game but there could be other reasons for that also don t even get me started on the initial pricing for cosmetic items and decorative objects within the atomstore at launch i returned to fallout 76 what seemed like decades later tempted by the notion of owning a free copy on steam to celebrate the release of its free expansion and when i began playing again i was quite surprised to see a large amount of improvement most of the gamebreaking bugs crashes and infinite loading issues that plagued me were gone leaving but a small minority of infrequent crashes when travelling to certain instances but no longer did i observes hordes of roaming t posing fire arm wielding scorched or creatures half consumed by terrain instead there were people both n p cs and playerspublic teams had become a thing with players being able to opt into groups of other players getting rewarded for taking part in events and being given stat or xp bonuses that increased over time spent in group player c a m ps houses buildings to the layman had access to player vendors where they could sell their weapons plans recipes etc with very little restriction alongside the ability to find your own crashed astronaut who will gladly nag you to death about their headaches and never leave the house just like a real companion would in stark contrast to when i first started playing fallout 76 i found myself actually enjoying going on quests for my allies and seeing the changes to wasteland both in actual locations like foundation becoming a settlement for settlers and new creatures lurking around like the sheepsquatch as it stands fallout 76 has dramatically improved since its infamous launch added free expansions cosmetics and seasonal updates and has become a game that i m not ashamed to recommend albeit on a sale ofcourse don t go in expecting a revolutionary fallout game with high expectations nor a standard run of the mill title in the series rather a different more action rpg feel in an open world with all things considered if bethesda continues to support the game with hotfixes additional free and cosmetic content the seasonal expansions and more allies quests i see no reason why the game would not flourish
