2021 let s get this out of the way first is this game better now yes everyone knows the history of this game it released buggy boring and left a bad taste in everyone s mouth did they fix it yes how did they fix it what s good the wastelanders update free essentially replaced the entire original main questline from the games original launch it added countless new armor weapons clothing c a m p items new areas new creatures new features and most importantly quests with compelling npcs and a storyline that didn t have you chasing ghosts dialogue that hearkens back to the fallout games predating 4 s controversial dialogue system with replayability and choices that actually effect the main story the brotherhood was reintroduced its lore was explained in a believable way that was obviously thought out and they tried their best to work with the existing lore to make it happen while it may be controversial to some lore aficionados it s nice seeing a fan favorite faction worked within a new title rather than having to skip out on them due to lore reasons it also adds new quests npcs weapons events allies and your own personal miniature vaults called shelters tons of quality of life improvements and fixes with stability that even improve over fallout 4 seasonal events a seasonal scoreboard that mimics that of a battle pass to unlock free stuff daily ops daily events challenges to earn atoms for free and public teams that give you exp bonuses along with other buffs nuclear winter the battle royale mode that you can go into with friends or alone rank up win exclusive armor and c a m p items for the adventure mode and any exp carries over to your character in the adventure mode one of the most creative and friendliest online communities i ve ever seen the atomic shop while not for everyone is completely optional never feels like its forced on you and all of its contents are mostly cosmetic and usually are all pretty damn cool stuff while on the topic of the atomic shop i want to clarify a few things there are items that benefit you in game that you can purchase i ll explain the existing ones in question scrap kits these kits allow you to break down your junk into its raw materials on the spot without this scrap kit you can just as easily teleport to your camp which is free and break them all down at your own workbench which is free so really it s only saving you a few seconds that you could normally do for free anyways repair kits these kits allow you to repair a broken piece of armor or weapon or you can repair them yourself and most objects have relatively low costs to repair that might only take you one trip to a random building to find the needed materials anyways scavenger protectron the scavenger protectron is a robot that walks around your camp collecting and finding junk while this can also be seen as pay to win he doesn t gather much and usually only finds a handful of things that are commonly found in that area you can just as easily take over any workshop in the game for free and have one of them generating you junk that generates way more junk over time and at a much faster rate lunchboxes these usually give a small buff that is randomized and sometimes aren t even buffs at all and are purely just for fun opening one may have a random effect for one hour where all enemies explode into confetti for one hour or one may make it to where you can jump higher for an hour though i think there is one that gives you 5 extra exp for one hour but you can lay down in a bed for 15 seconds and get an extra 25 exp for an hour in the game for free anyways fridge the fridge does what you would think it does it preserves your food for longer but with food and drink no longer being a complete necessity in the game meaning you no longer take negative side effects from being hungry or thirsty only small buffs when you do eat or drink it s an optional item for a now optional mechanic fallout 1st subscription this subscription costs 13 a month it gives you a free set of clothing cosmetic only discounts on the atomic shop and 13 worth of atoms you also get the survival tent this tent allows you to drop it where you please on the map and creates a free fast travel waypoint the scrapbox probably the most controversial item of them all which allows you to have unlimited storage for your junk items it also breaks them down to their raw components for you and the private world option which essentially loads you into a server where only you and any invited friends can play you do not have any options to mess with you can not change anything about this server so to summarize the pay to win items most are completely optional for optional mechanics and are mostly just time savers except the scrapbox and survival tent but to be honest for 13 a month i feel as though you at least deserve something of substantial value i d say fallout 1st is only for those who play this game a lot and want to save some time and some minor things that i ve noticed that i think are nice about the game great soundtrack one of the best maps i ve seen in a betheseda game second to oblivions great voice acting a lot of free content that you never seem to be short of things to do c a m p system is fun for builders and seems to keep getting improved on newly added lore is interesting in my opinion it is now a more true feeling fallout game than 4 is in my honest opinion a lot of returning things and mentions of lore from previous games like new vegas and fallout 1 2 and 3 now the negatives some are just my opinion usual bethesda bugs though usually not game breaking and won t disrupt your experience just goofy survival mode was removed instead of finished making nuclear winter the only true way to experience pvp in the game while there are tons of new armors and weapons there are more reused assets from fallout 4 than i d like but it was developed alongside fallout 4 so i guess that s to be expected atomic shop prices are still far too much you are able to start the wastelanders quest line at level 1 but after you ve finished a handful of quests you are locked out of continuing until level 20 while leveling up to level 20 is not hard and will come quicker than you think it is really annoying to not be able to continue just when the story is picking up speed and getting interesting all in all i ll end it with this is fallout 76 worth your time it depends did you like fallout 4 s gameplay do you want more fallout lore do you want to play a new game with your friend if you answered yes to all 3 of those then yes play this especially with a friend but if you are one of those fallout fans who thinks that fallout new vegas fallout 1 and fallout 2 were the best games in the series and that bethesda is ruining the franchise and you want a true single player rpg and don t want to be around anyone then no don t get this you won t enjoy the changes made to some of the lore you won t enjoy being around people and it ll probably only fuel your hate for bethesda more this is not a true fallout game it is essentially fallout 4 but with a better map better story and online features hope this helped anyone
