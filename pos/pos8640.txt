2021 kinda like real life takes a bit to get used to most of the time you will be at about the 150m range killing things unless you want to crawl xd sometimes it takes for ever to find a kill but that is because you have to learn the need zones and times etc do not kill more then two things at a time in a need zone it might will delete the need zone do to hunting pressure that is the dark red purple marks on the map just follow some water and go hunt there keeping an eye on wind get the perk zeroing asap being able to zero to 75 most guns when something is close is like a god send 150m for mid this is the default the gun is zeroed at for most guns btw and the second part of that perk 300m most bullets are only effective till 150m or less i do not use often but it has come in handy learn the milidots at a shooting range every scope is a little different check you tube for videos online is kinda stupid multiplayer ppl just shoot next to you to be jerks or the host kicks you only good thing is you get to try the other dlc maps for free as for the guns you do not need dlc for most of the game i wish the 22 was not dlc because you need a class 1 rifle oh well we got he shotgun i guess anyway if you do want to buy dlc to get a decent start buy the smoking barrels dlc use the m1 for a while the accuracy just feels the best then the 7mm can carry you i like to keep in my inventory the 22 for class 1 or the bow shotgun if no dlc and the 243 for class 2 4 and the 7mm for class 4 9 or you can learn the bow and just switch ammo all the time over all can be a fun game but until you learn the ropes the game feels a little empty 8 10 can pet the dog
