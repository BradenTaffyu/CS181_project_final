2019 i have played this game 3 times and have watched 2 friends play it from start to finish i cannot stress enough how good this game is it captures you right from the very beginning and there s so many choices to make that lead to all kinds of different paths so it has an incredible replay value my one and only flaw with this game is that the lip syncing could be a lot better but other than that it has a super strong story line fantastic voice acting and an amazing soundtrack buy all five episodes you won t regret it
