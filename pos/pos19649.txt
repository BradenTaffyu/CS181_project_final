2016 this is the easily one of the very best story driven games that exist with decent gameplay and presentation you probably already know all the pros but i ll skip to the cons outside of poor optimization engine low effort on legion path lots of things unfinished thanks bethesda 1 year time limit mojave outpost is pretty not nearly as important feeling as everyone hypes it out to be there s like 5 voice actors in the entire game and 2 3 lines that repeat for all the soldiers npcs you can t interact with but luckily you can fix all of these with mods and more and the dlc for this game is also fantastic especially for the mods some recommended mods new game is probably necessary and some of these may clash without nexus mod manager also this is not the mod load order important and you probably need all dlc for this to work get it anyway it s great new vegas redesigned iii project nevada core rebalance cyberware nmcs texture pack prioritize in first couple mods use small texture pack if your computer is weak nevada skies new vegas bounties i ii iii get all more traits perks weapon mods expanded interior lighting overhaul populated casinos mojave outpost redesigned fallout character overhaul a world without pain anti stutter lag new vegas anti crash some desert eagle mod trust me here new vegas killer weapons of the new millennia vurts wfo bad mother fu cka all other npc additions improved companion sandbox someguy series master required for some mods better loading screens is the name of the mod freeside open immserive karma enchanced blood wasteland flora overhaul wave radio new vegas strip connected eve weapon particle retextures overhauls especially for laser weapons optional as if the rest weren t unlimited companions i just wanted boone and cass at same time with the doctor guy perk every level i liked an easier game gg ez run lucky 38 great but takes time to figure out level cap 100 self explanatory if you haven t played the game yet i highly encourage you to get the game with all dlc s and to definitely get it on a sale like 100 if you re not brain dead i also encourage you to install all of these mods before playing the game once as it makes the experience much better also even if you have finished the game on vanilla but want to play the game again you should definitely get at least some of the mods listed above
