2022 early access review as a factorio enjoyer and having tried other factory games that were good but not good enough as factorio i am surprised to see that this game stands on the same level if not superior as factorio the progress isn t tedious and daunting if you are a seasoned factory planner and i could imagine if you are new into this type of games it will be an amazing discovery for you in fact it s quite achievable you still have to pour your hours and brains in to make a good and efficient factory but it doesn t feel like a task nor something reserved for the very best logisticians the part that dsp made me fall in love with it are the orbits and the planetary systems it s innovative and refreshing you must do interplanetary interstellar logistics to attain certain assets you may place some infrastructures in strategic places on the planet solar panels at the poles to recieve a smaller but constant flow of energy or put them around the equator put the dyson rail guns on the bright side of a rotational locked planet to constantly build the dyson swarm etc these are just a few examples of what this game has to offer where i have to disagree with other reviewers is that this game doesn t have a game over you are dead mechanic it does in a way that is to me at least way scarier you can run out of resources if you are a careless spender and don t plan ahead for example you can run out of resources if you start the dyson swarm too early solar sails have an expiration time unless you pour them into a dyson sphere what i mean is that it is very possible to get planetary locked if you don t rush certain techs and prepare to achieve a planetary interstellar logistics chain to support your main factory planet i still have to build my first dyson sphere and i can t wait to do it but i have to be very careful not to forget about my real life responsabilites it s scary to see how the time goes by in a single game session and you don t even notice so dyson sphere program is a yes you should buy it
