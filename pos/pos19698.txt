2017 where to start fallout new vegas offers a level of role playability and replayability unlike any of the other fps style fallouts which is why in my opinion it is better than 3 and 4 when it comes to that and in my opinion is completely better than 3 in every way pros lack of player character voice acting allows for far more dialogue options and the ability to role play a character with whatever voice you want perks have a real effect on gameplay and perks like terrifying presence adding lines to dialogue present a lot of vaiation between save games if they re chosen there are 4 factions which all have great depth and loads of side quests as well as interesting main quests not to mention the almost two dozen other minor factions which you can get to join with you or wipe out the main quest of the game is entertaining and interesting introducing you to the major factions also all the main quests are fun and interesting and the majority of them require you to do a fair bit of exploring as the game doesn t push you necessarily towards places like jacobstown however when you arrive there you discover a surprising amount of gameplay great dlcs which all serve to add to the game with new items and background to your characters origins etc the radios all have good selections of mid 1900s music which will get you singing along and in the mood in no time absolutely huge modding community on nexus with something for everyone from complete overhauls of the game to concrete wall retextures or lighting mods quests for followers allows for a bit of character development though no where near that in fallout 4 having a reputation system including all the factions allows for backstabbing however also the ability to build a real relationship with a certain faction whether its simply because you taught them how to disarm land mines or because you did some huge mission or even just because you killed a crap ton of their enemies absolutely massive variety of weapons fallout 4 had a lot of mods and relatively few individual weapons this game is the opposite karma system though having little effect also just adds a bit of roleplaying to the game as it means that when you do something bad the game notices and tells you off resulting in perhaps a feeling of achievement or otherwise depending on your character build generally good voice acting for npcs satisfying endings which cover using a series of slides how every faction you met is left at the end of the game ron perlman s classic voice during the intro and ending immediately drawing you in and then later giving a strong sense of closure cons combat can feel very clunky and unsatisfying however that is inevitable after playing fallout 4 as one of that game s only innovations was the combat and weapon modding system also vats pausing time really slows down any exciting combat however mods can fix parts of it and make combat more fun weapon mods are so rare to find and imo should have been put into enemy loot lists etc because its kinda weird when no one has any mods besides you and merchants it can be quite obvious sometimes that obsidian spent more time on one of the factions the new californian republic than another caesar s legion because of the depth and number of side quests available to both of them some of the armour pieces can look really stupid i m looking at you metal armour however some are really badass there s a reason for ranger veteran armour being a mod for fallout 4 as the game is quite old you have to be really careful with the number of mods installed as fnv can be quite unstable if you don t leading to frustrating crashes your character can only reach a certain level before capping out some people may like this however i prefer how in fallout 4 for example you can level to an indefinite number the game s graphics are awful even compared to other games of the time especially when you realise that mass effect 2 bioshock 2 and just cause 2 came out in the same year and their graphics are nowhere near this low the character creation absolutely shockingly ugly characters are the only result tl dr buy this game it is absolutely brilliant and better by far than fallout 3 and 4 when it comes to its story and replayability as well as player choice not to mention how deep this game can get in terms of world building and faction politics etc i give this game 10 10 as the issues presented are all fairly minor and for the most part fixable with mods quite honestly if you don t have this game then buy it you will never get bored as you can look around on the hub and you ll see hundreds of different builds you can try out not to mention the builds online such as fudgemuppet s builds on youtube i can t recommend this game enough so buy it download a couple graphical mods and enjoy because unless you only want to shoot people and have no care for anything deeper you ll be hooked on it
