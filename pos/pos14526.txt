2019 i am copy pasting megaphone man s review because you need to read it to everyone jumping on the eula band wagon i just want to provide some facts that you can check out for yourself if you re still mad after that totally fine but just hear me out the section that people keep quoting is not from civ 6 s eula it is from take 2 s privacy policy the parent company for 2k which can be found here this means a few things this is also not new at all the last change made to the take 2 privacy policy was in may 8 2018 at the time of writing this review i have literally no idea where people are getting the notion that this was changed in accordance with gathering storm but these policies have been applying to you that entire time this policy applies to every single take 2 game that means it applies to any rockstar game so time to hang up your cowboy hats and rocket cars any 2k game say goodbye to rapture thin men and any incarnation of nuclear gandhi and the brand new title by obsidian outer worlds every single one of these games is affected by that privacy policy not just civ 6 the most helpful review states that he has played his last game of civ 6 well then i guess he s played his last game of all of these as well it s not just written for games this policy also applies to their storefront the reason that they need to collect payment information as well as any forums or sweepstakes the reason they might need your address if they need to ship you something take 2 s privacy policy is not radical at all if you look at ubisoft or even steam there is a lot of incredibly similar language if you don t want to read it all just control f some keywords if these privacy statements frighten you go and look up the producers of your favorite games because there is a very good chance that they have a similar privacy policy the section that the most helpful review quotes is taken horribly out of context he takes it from the what personal and other information does the company collect section at first glance that sounds like exactly the right context until you look closer he starts his quote right after this the types of information collected in connection with the activities listed above will vary depending on the activity what activities you might ask anything literally any interaction you might have with the company is listed above from requesting tech support to purchasing a product in the store to subscribing to a newsletter the people review bombing this game are trying to make it seem like this policy turns the game into some sort of spyware sniffing out your personal details in fact the most helpful review purposefully misleads you to garner more fear he specifically states the game is collecting your address it is included in his quote that is taken out of context however this is directly contradicted by the what gameplay information does the company collect section where they state very plainly that they do not collect your name or address during gameplay look i m not saying that you aren t allowed to be mad or suspicious but please do research and think critically before your are led into being mad for the wrong reasons edit also one of the top reviews mentions a web process running in the background which i can find absolutely no evidence of again fact check these people it s a little strange that the top three reviews spreading this misinformation all have their comments turned off 2nd edit firstly thank you to everyone who voted me helpful i love that this post is getting more comments and discussion many people in the comments seem to think i am defending take 2 s policy i can completely understand how that might come off but that is not my intention my entire point in making this post was to highlight the fact that this is not specifically a civ 6 problem but rather an industry problem that is why i said at the beginning and end that it is totally reasonable to be mad but to make sure that you understand the full scope of the situation i love the debate in my comments because it means that people are thinking critically about the problem rather than taking any of the reviews at face value also many are calling my separation of eula and privacy policy misleading since the former has to be adherent to the later again the reason i am hitting this point so hard is because i am trying to hit home the fact that this is not a civ 6 issue it is an issue that encompasses the entire company i personally feel that the top negative reviews mislead in that they insinuate that if you avoid civ 6 you avoid the problem which simply isn t true i also want to address the fact that my review is positive i like civ 6 and will continue to play it that is the entire reason that it is positive because i like the game i personally do not agree with the sentiment that a negative review of a game that a company makes is an appropriate way to speak your mind about the company but honestly if i were in a more personal debate i can see my mind being changed that being said the current negative reviews do not paint an accurate picture of the situation and there is no place to correct them since their comments are turned off this post is meant to be a public discussion of the issue so that we can all share our opinions rather than just have one person shouting without anyone being able to respond
