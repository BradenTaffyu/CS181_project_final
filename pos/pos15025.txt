2016 early access review been alive for a good number just about to hit winter me and my friend had everything stocked up tons of bunnies in the chests two ice boxes filled with food from our farms and drying racks two crockpots just for those nights that you needed really filling food two themal stones enough clothing to keep warmth for a decent distance away from base camp had a wall built with three or so beefalo corralled in so that we could get manure and beefalo wool during the night honestly we had this entire thing down set winter wasn t going to beat us he said he was going to the bathroom and left me to tend to the fire to keep us through the night naturally i didn t have any problem with that surely we were set for a night and then my character heard something in the distance something that was getting closer increasingly faster thinking it was just a wolf i grabbed my spear and armor wolves weren t anything to worry about except the ground shook the closer it came rattling every item on the map until this amalgamation of horror came onto the screen giant antlers protruded out from above a single wide eye every exhale this creature took gathered in a fog from it s mouth hole every single stomp from a gigantic hoof sent rows of jagged ice along the ground like piston when my friend came back from the bathroom everything was gone he died instantly unable to move or defend himself from the deerclops a sad ghost who could only haunt my already dwindling sanity through the duration of the very short fight the deerclops knew how to get me too chasing me around my own camp until the fire inevitably went out unable to throw anything into the fire for fear that the behemoth creature would kill me instantly just as he did my defenseless friend blind now in the darkness all i could do was run around some more in a desperate attempt to find my fire pit before charlie bore down on me snuffling out the last vestiges of health i had before it was all over what happened my friend exclaimed when he came back incredulous that this much could happen in a span of a few spare minutes the monochromatic view on his screen the same as the utter failure that was on my own indeed my friend what happened 10 10 would play again
