2019 product received for free before i begin my review i would like to thank my friend jason for gifting me this wonderful and amazing driving game i would have never picked up american truck simulator as i m really not into driving games other than need for speed or forza series should you buy american truck simulator american truck simulator is exactly what the name suggests driving from place to place obeying the traffic laws watching the beautiful scenery pass by listening to the radio it s very relaxing i was instantly addicted to ats american truck simulator comes with three states i e california nevada and arizona everything else is paid dlc add on content which really really sucks i ll get more to that later you can visit iconic cities like los angeles san francisco las vegas and number of small towns and country side areas there are two ways you ll be playing it the first one will have you working as a freelance trucker for hire this is the most ideal one but you also can t avoid it as you ll be starting by taking on delivery jobs for various businesses and merchants your truck and fuel expenses are provided by your employer this is the easiest most accessible way to play and as you level up you can spend xps to unlock more difficult and complex jobs including heavy shipments like houses flying jets longer hauls and fragile or dangerous cargo like chemicals and explosives these earn you money that can be spent unlocking skills and upgrades and also the other side of the game running your own business once you earn enough money to buy your own truck or take out a bank loan if you re impatient you can start your own company you choose which city you re based in and can customise and upgrade your truck eventually you hire drivers and create your very own haulage network it s a fairly involved business management sim but that s entirely optional there s satisfaction in owning a truck and being your own boss but i prefer being a contractor so i don t have to worry about buying fuel or crashing my truck and spiralling into debt when the repair bills come in that s where the good part ends ats like any other game isn t without its flaws the first one of them is of course heavy monetization on paid dlcs and other add on packs this is one of those rare games where you d have to spend full price for a 20 game to have the full experience only 20 58 achievements count from base game 34 the rest as you guessed are exclusive to dlc owners which is sad now the graphics although look good at 4k at 300 scaling the aliasing is really poor like its really bad for those who care for sharp and clean textures the game is also very unstable at times this is subjective to every person crashed a few times when running at directx 11 mode dx9 and open gl still work fine for the most part also another negative aspect is that ats is pretty much the same as european truck simulator 2 the devs didn t even care to overhaul the graphics engine and u i its like they just dumped the old game and made american locations to qualify as a standalone new game the game was a bit harder for me initially i ve played entirely on keyboard and mouse and it s playable a bit annoying at times no idea how it works with a controller or wheel but my friend says its damn fine so i would advise playing using a controller or wheels and gear if you re the racing pro d if you like driving games then you will like ats2 get it and try it out if you re a collector get it but do play it don t let it sit in your steam library i would say no if you already own european truck simulator 2 as it s more superior game compared to this the developers are really passionate about their games and it shows with regular post launch support and events my rating 6 5 10 thank you for reading if you have any questions comment down below
