2016 early access review combines my favourite parts of rust with my favourite parts of minecraft lacks polish but i ve definitely gotten my money s worth the best way to play is to set up a server and work together with some friends to survive the ever increasing hordes but solo survival is definitely a fun challenge too don t be put off by the early access label if pve survival crafting is your thing there s plenty of value per dollar here even in its alpha form it might not be finished but it s a ton of fun as it is
