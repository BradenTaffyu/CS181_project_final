forza 5 is an open world racing game with freedom of exploration and a massive foundation to build from previous titles they made a step forward in content and quality a worthy successor for the series in the following review i ll try to share my experience from my playthrough and i ll start with the freedom to explore and the map with a significantly larger map forza 5 introduces new biomes each with its own characteristic to name a few i ll begin with the volcano providing winding roads with volcanic rocks and ash that provides a great terrain for dirt racing or dirt drifting this gets better with tropical coasts jungles and oceanic views the list goes on with a canyon and a desert what i m trying to say is that the terrain variety and contrast between the zones showcases the geological beauty of mexico and it gives the player a complete racing experience talking about mexico this fictional and miniature representation incorporates numerous elements of culture from murals to traditional architecture from hidden ancient ruins to colonial era buildings you ll find beautiful landmarks and places if you look for more local flavor just open the radio the soundtrack is just amazing and it s not just about music the overall sound quality is great the voice acting is combined using both english and spanish this is something you either love or hate the dynamic weather and seasonal change again sold this game to me it s just great to experience the same map in different conditions like snow or summer rain also i noticed something different from previous titles the localized weather parts of the game can experience different weather conditions simultaneously this provides immersion and realism depending on where you are on the map it s worth mentioning the new extreme weather events for example driving through a sandstorm is not just spectacular but also a challenge with reduced visibility in terms of progression and structure i feel forza 5 is the best of the series by far creating different festivals each focusing on a different type of racing this makes it easier for the player to focus on a specific discipline if you re new to the game the tutorial is great and there is less confusion on what to do next the story is once again told through mini chapters each with its own unique theme such as historical racing events or local culture there is a lot of content to do from showcases to seasonal content that changes every week and the event lab is a feature that allows players to create their own race events and share them with the community the expansions for forza 5 are hot wheels and rally adventure i personally enjoyed the first a lot because of the high speed tracks and stunt oriented racing there is something i don t like and i ll never understand the car packs that you need to purchase even if you own the ultimate edition of the game i understand new content and future support require work but for a premium and finished product this should come as free updates for everyone in conclusion forza 5 is a great game the best racing experience i had in this genre forza horizon 5 a screenshot of forza horizon 5 by liviu forza horizon 5 a screenshot of forza horizon 5 by liviu forza horizon 5 a screenshot of forza horizon 5 by liviu pros graphics gameplay sound seasons and weathers event lab seasonal contentcons car packs my scores story 10 graphics 10 gameplay 10 sound 10 overall 10
