2016 early access review so i just realized i ve had this game for 4 weeks and as a result have a ridiculous amount of playtime on record i regret nothing i am absolutely head over heels 100 in love with this game if you like city builders if you like management and simulation if you are anything like me and like games that you can play while you binge watch parks and recreation this is the game for you the depth of this game surpasses first looks its mechanics are similar to prison architect people moods needs coupled with the resources and supply lines like banished that need to be overseen in order to complete tasks at the same time the breadth of the game creates the charm and engagement of stardew valley skill trees and backstories of the tiny characters create another layer that you can dig into or not one of my characters was paralyzed braindead after to a gun fight and i tirelessly searched for a brain implant so he could return to work it was amazing it can be an epic colony extravagantly decorated with all desired amenities or it can be a derelict barrack built for war the base game is still early access but everything in the game is smooth and there is plenty to do if you enjoy additional control over the creation of your colony or if you would liketo add in more options and asthetic possibilities the mod community is very active and i have added 40 playtime hours and counting with the ones i ve downloaded i m excited to see what the developer includes in the future this is a wonderful game and i would recommend it to everyone
