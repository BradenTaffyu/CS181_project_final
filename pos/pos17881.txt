2023 i wish there was a thumbs sideways for a 50 50 review while this game is amazing and i have been a fan since coh i can not say that i would recommend this game for a full price let me tell you why that is as of it s current state pros 1 the coh game play we all know and love relic has expanded on fundamental game play that we all love such as cover now most engineer units and even some basic infantry units can build sandbag cover for fortification that small detail adds strategic value to the game play 2 each unit has an ability that is unlocked through veteran status relic has given each player a reason to keep each unit alive as each unit ranks up they unlock their ability those abilities are no longer unlocked through the upgrade feature 3 each faction has a three commander type infantry armor or mixed each commander has two tech trees that the player can then build off of this gives the player the ability to shape the battle as it unfolds cons 1 the game was released incomplete relic kinda screwed all of the loyal players with some simple features missing on release examples of those simple features are custom loadouts and skins for the players profile such as the plates for the players profile with the new update they attempted to fix that but fell short extremely short 2 with the new update operation sapphire jackal relic also added challenges which would promise the players with currency in the shop for cosmetics mentioned earlier the downfall of those challenges they reward a small amount for a large grind and the shop has very little to offer in return for the amount of time 3 paid content most of the material in the shop requires the player to pay in war bonds which the player can purchase with money i for one have no problem supporting relic or any studio that has a great product in return for my investment but since the game was delayed and the store was released after the game then i feel hesitant on supporting more lazy content in the future overall this game is great if you want a slightly better version of coh2 with very little content including maps i mean 4 maps per player count relic has left me feeling empty and bored with coh3 which is a shame because i was extremely pumped when it was announced now it s hard for me to even look at the desktop icon and muster up enough self dignity to double click and watch as i waste another 45 minutes of my life on a match in order to kill 50 tanks as a certain faction trying to receive 400 dollars towards a 1000 cosmetic skin if you haven t purchased yet then wait give this game a year and i m sure relic will figure out their mistakes if not then i m sad to say this is the end of coh
