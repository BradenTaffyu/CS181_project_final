2018 so far the best installment of the series most of the bad reviews are due to major issues at launch which have been fixed as well as the redshell spyware which has also been removed as far as the game civ6 adds a ton of depth with several new mechanics a few major tweaks of old mechanics and a multitude of minor adjustments and quality of life fixes to the core civ style the first and most heavily discussed is the introduction of districts districts are sections of your city that are placed down on physical tiles outside of the city center tile that gain bonuses depending on the surrounding terrain for example commercial hubs gain more gold if they are adjacent to a harbor and or a river and industrial zones benefit from mines and quarries developing your cities and planning district placement is always a puzzle to be solved that rewards good strategy and forethought another major addition in 6 is that the tech tree has been split into two the tech tree and the civics tree technology works the same but many of the things you might expect from a cultural or civics development is placed in the civics tree new government unlocks religious perks and the majority of world wonders are unlocked in the civics tree which you advance through culture rather than science the mechanic is done very well and as a civ veteran i welcome anything that makes science less important the last major change worth mentioning is the new great people mechanic in civ6 players compete for great people there are only so many classical era great generals so if the other players work hard enough they can deny you great people entirely also each great person is unique galileo is always a renaissance era great scientist and he always has the same ability which is unique to him science gained for each adjacent mountain whereas hildegard is a medieval era great scientist and always has his ability holy sites generate science too this gives a lot of character to what was previously a very boring mechanic the biggest complaint about the game i have is the pitiful excuse of an ai when playing a comp game the computer controlled civs are even dumber due to the higher complexity of civ6 and rely on even larger starting bonuses and global buffs at higher difficulties to counteract their stupid play habits but as anyone who has been a longtime civ player bad ai has been a hallmark of the series so this is to be expected overall i would recommend civ6 to anyone who has played and enjoyed previous civ games the bad review scores of the game i believe come from a bungled launch that i wasn t a part of to be fair and a knee jerk reaction from the community
