2021 it s basically forza horizon 4 5 the map is new the graphics are slightly better most cars are carried over from previous games in the series and gameplay modes are almost exactly the same as in horizon 4 there are some quality of life improvements in the ui some new multiplayer centric activities but overall it plays the same as the previous game that itself is not a bad thing as obviously the devs stick to the tried and tested formula that works but this time it feels like they played it too safe who knows maybe the dlc will introduce more new content and changes while the devs focus until now was to get the base game done ready for the november release slot to sum up if you haven t played horizon 4 buy that one on sale instead of 5 it looks almost as good it s sold at a good discount it has more content and less bugs and the online community is still active if you liked horizon 4 or you want to run with the cool kids and play the newest game then i can recommend horizon 5 if you didn t like previous horizon games there s nothing new here that will change your mind
