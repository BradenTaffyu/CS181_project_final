2021 this game is literally so amazing it s definitely my go to when i need to relax this game does require alot of work time patience and effort to actually complete it but you can pretty much go at your own pace basically your goal is to revive your grandpa s farm in stardew valley while doing quests on the side such as mining and helping the townies with certain tasks honestly if you are contemplating whether or not you should get this game just get it it s definitely worth it i only have 50 hours on steam but on my phone i have over 250 hours lol it s super duper addicting and overall just a super chill game
