2021 i don t normally ever write reviews for games even ones that i like however undertale is probably the best game nay best piece of any form of artistic medium i have ever experienced when undertale first came out i automatically pushed it away because of the fan base that was the worst mistake i could ever have made this game changed who i am this game helped make me who i am today before undertale i was a bitter kind of hurtful person i bought the game when i was a freshman in high school and my friends made fun of me for it they reduced the game to its then toxic fan base i heard overwhelming good things about the game and decided to give it a chance ignoring its fan base my best decision i have ever made in terms of a simple purchase was at this moment the game itself is a very humorous and wholesome game the game legitimately made me realize i should treat others with respect and friendliness because of how warm inside the game made me feel the soundtrack reflects the wholesome humorous themes in this work of actual art tracks like bonetrousal and temmie village are on the more humorous side of the soundtracks and there are also the more serious heart string plucking songs such as home undertale and save the world undertale in particular really could be considered a piece of art in itself toby fox is an absolute musical genius without the soundtrack the game just wouldn t be the same undertale is the only video game i have ever become emotionally invested in and i ve been playing video games as long as i can remember i truly believe that this is the best game that has ever been made there is so much passion and soul put into this small 200 mb game toby fox poured his heart into these characters and this soundtrack if i could forget playing undertale so i could play it for the first time again i would do it in a heartbeat this game changed me and i think it might change you too thank you toby fox for this wonderful game you changed so many lives and lit up the world
