2018 i only see 2 negatives with this game 1 the bussiness model monthly subscribtion you only get couple of tracks other tracks cost 12 16 each you only get couple of cars other cars cost 12 each if you want to compete in a championship with multiple tracks you gotta buy all of them to participate2 lack of races this is more understandable because its limited by the amount of active users you only get a couple of races unless you want to invest serious money into the gamewhat iracing does better than other sims 1 scheduled online races2 dirt oval oval racing3 competetivness ranking of each member overall if money is not a big problem there is no better option for a multiplayer racing sim if you are going to stick to a single series like only nascar you can spend way less than buying senslessly everything you think looks cool
