so i finished the game after 140 hours this is a great crpg the game overall is great it lacks in some departments can it hold up to the graphic fidelity of baldurs gate 3 no it cant same with the voice acting which in itself ist good but only very few core scenes are voiceated mostly with your npc companions most other stuff is not so there will be a lot of reading however what you read is well done quests story just normal lore stuff all great and fitting in the 40k universe overall this is a great 40k game in terms of lore accuracy and also a good introduction into the w40k universe the d100 system and general leveling system takes some getting used to there are an almost overwhelming amount of option when leveling you can respec as well however once you get a grip on the system you can make some truly game breaking builds as for the game itself act 1 is a good tutorial introducing basic game systems and the whole of 40k pretty well act 2 introduces the rest of game systems and expands the story from there on out your have 3 more acts of varying length after act 1 you can fly around small part of the universe the game is set in kind of like mass effect explore systems scan planets for resources and point of interests besides main quests you have companion quests can follow up on rumors you collect throughout the game dialog etc some might be fruitful and lead to more quests or loot some might be duds while running around the planets you might encounter some puzzle which can be fun bugs rumor has it that after act3 the game becomes noticeably more buggy that the first 3 acts not in terms of the random t posing character but broken quests etc personally i havent encountered any of that or at least i didnt notice but that doesnt mean you wont too the game has loads of branching quests and permutations in the story depending on your decisions however the devs are patching the game constantly and fixing stuff might take a while to get it iron clad though i think its known that the game was a bit rushed and stuff got cut but that might be reintroduced later in that process some stuff got broken like the moral system has 3 flavors with 5 ranks each but i think on some of the flavors you cant reach max level balancing in the beginning you are fairly weak and with a lack of understanding for the level and skill system you might struggle a little however the higher level you climb the more gear you aqquire the stronger you get there are some game breaking builds and combinations of gear skills classes etc that make loads of fights trivial even on the hardest difficuty might get patched might not if not i recommend have some fun with it and when you get bored with it respec your character s for pc users there is a mod called toybox that allows for some tweaking if you run into some bugs tldr overall the game is very good sound and music is good voiceacting too but sadly only few scenes get that treatment graphics are ok the style and art is good but it lacks a bit in fidelity however you will only notice when zooming in the story is great and has room for several different playstyle and repeated playthroughts it has some rough edges but is good enough that i put 140 hours in to finish the game
