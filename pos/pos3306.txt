2016 early access review buy this game even in alpha it feels complete it has stunning visuals compelling characters with arcing developments fully fleshed out and complicated but familiar battle schema this game is so much fun its retarded its like baldurs gate had sex with dragon age and their baby was way too good for them so it decided to do it better 10 10i wrote my first review because you need to know this
