2016 by admission of the dev himself this game is harvest moon at its core a formula that is purely addictive and satisfying as hell but there is something stardew valley has over harvest moon and that s a heart the intro to the game is incredibly human and relatable i sympathized with my character right off the bat i think we all know how it feels to want to escape the mundane grind and in a funny kind of way this game does that a moment i felt that the game truly had a soul was when i was walking to the mines on a rainy day when suddenly i was greeted by a cutscene of coming upon abigail my romance interest playing a flute next to the lake it s a very quiet scene with nothing but the sound of rain and her flute playing after some dialog my character who is a silent protagonist by the way pulls out a mini harp and joins abby in a duet something that really surprised me as there was no indication that my character had any musical talent prior to this scene it was a bonding experience and it felt incredibly real memorable and touching i ll always remember it and when you realize that there are ten love interests in this game with different scenes like this for each of them man that s an intimidating amount of content maybe i shouldn t be saying that harvest moon doesn t have any heart at all but when it comes down to it this is the game that i m going to remember more fondly in the end i made memories with harvest moon as a child now i m making memories with stardew valley as an adult you should too the game is worth full price and then some
