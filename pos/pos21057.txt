2018 this game has got to be the most effective anti depressant i ve ever seen what you see is what you get a bunch of cute blobs hopping around on a planet you happen to inhabit and explore the developers put their heart and soul into the game and it shows it keeps being updated there s seasonal events and it keeps on surprising you until the very end of story mode despite being very simple in its design i recommend this game very frequently and very loudly to anyone and everyone who wants to play a game that will give them a break
