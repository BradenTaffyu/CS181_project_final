2022 every time someone asked me if the game is worth it or wanted me to explain what makes it so good i couldn t answer the only answer i could give was i can t explain it you have to experience it by yourself to understand but now that i have played the game for the 2nd time i think i can try to explain why it s so good and unique if you give nier automata the proper attention you will have more questions than answers that s because the game wants you to think rather than to give you actual answers it addresses things that are not easily explainable or clear things that everyone will think about or face at some point in their lives the experience i would say is like one of those late nights where you sit under the night sky talking with your best friend and for some reason the basic conversation you have turns into a deep philosophical conversation about life existence psychology etc nier automata offers a lot of food for thought each player s experience depends on their response to all the subjects and ideas the game presents that s why lots of people have different thoughts about certain things the game addresses i am sure a lot of people will give the game a try only because of 2bs booty but in the process i am sure they will eventually enjoy more its combat soundtrack story etc and hopefully they will give it the attention it deserves to eventually experience the whole game also except from the lore and the deep meanings the combat is really smooth and fun once you get used to it the soundtrack is memorable and unique generally top tier the graphics are not so good but to be honest it doesn t matter nier automata is the masterpiece you probably won t play but you definitely should
