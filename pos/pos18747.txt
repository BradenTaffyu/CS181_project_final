2017 if you are interested in history geography economics and that sweet sense of accomplisment then look no further there simply isn t any alternative to what europa universalis iv offers however beware of the leaning curve my story began back in 2013 i read about it somewhere and was so hyped and the moment it came out in local game store i bought it it is worth mentioning that this was my first paradox interactive game and that i really had no clue what to expect so i installed it chose teutonic order for my first playthrough guess knights seemed cool enough and got destroyed by poland so i restarted it several more times to no avail it really felt like i was playing with microsoft excel compared to total war games i have been actively playing before so i chose france then as it was highlighted as a beginner nation and i failed miserably again after that i rage quit and uninstalled the game it wasn t until year later that i installed the game again and decided to actually do my best to understand the basics and i started as castille which greatly helped me learn a thing or two about eu4 ever since then i am an avid fan of this game it s by far the best strategy game there is in my opinion pros 1 you get to pick any country which existed during this period and that includes a vast amount of countries i guess the most obvious choice is to start with your own country if it exists and try to bring it to its greatest historical extent 2 you pick your own goals there really is not predefined goal sure if you start as byzantium you are bound to face ottomans or if you are one of irish nations england is not going to make your life easy but what i mean is that there is a vast array of choices you can make in this game and change the history make ottomans convert to christianity conquer all of russia as let s say the golden horde become the biggest colonizator as songhai etc anything is really possible 3 achievements unlike most of other new games this game has some quite tricky achievements and they give you a sense of direction should you not make your own goal also that way you are being encouraged to learn about new countries by playing them you might find your favorite this way some are ridiculously hard and might require several restarts but that feeling when you manage not only to survive as tabaristan but to from into formidable persia and challenge ottomans priceless i managed to pull few tough ones but my favorite is definitely a kaiser not just in name 4 this argument is direclty linked to the previous one you should get this game for hre mechanics if for nothing else i have always disregarded these features until few months ago when i decided to try to unify holy roman empire which i did now simply put you feel like you are in game of thrones itself that vibe is incredible there are so many ways you can lose but once you push through the reforms you are pretty much unstoppable 5 always learning something new there is always a room for improvement and this game greatly depicts that 6 soundtrack it is awesome however i have to say sabaton is beyond awesome when the lion from the north song popps up you know it s time to wage a war honestly i found out about sabaton from this game and even managed to go to concert this month so i am very grateful cons 1 the game has too many dlcs now i am not bringing that argument it is too expensive etc with enough waiting you can get it for a good price just like anything on steam what i mean is that the game has been greatly changed in its current state it resembles little to its original vanilla form 2 it keeps adding more complexity which in my opinion greatly limits your options of expanding especially as opm or any small nation if you miss dlcs you are still affected by new game mechanics but have no way of influencing them back 3 it is too eurocentric granted its name is europa and i am european myself but there simply aren t enough reasons to play or be remotely interested in asia for example whereas in europe many countries get unique events i understand this will change with the upcoming expansion mandate of heaven so i guess that problem will be adressed so all in all you can find this game fequently on sale try it out and if you get past few dozen of hours you are in for an endless entertainment
