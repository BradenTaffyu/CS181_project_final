2022 i think a lot has been said already about this game so i don t really see a point in writing down the pros and cons all over again what i want to add though is that i really dont think this game deserves all of the criticism it receives it deserves some of it especially for the slow patches in the beginning but a lot of this comes from comparing it to aoe2 to a game that has been in developement for over a decade and received patches over patches so if you wanna try out this game do yourself a favor ignore the critics at first and don t compare it to aoe2 just play it make your opinion and consider it a new game after you ve done that and make your opinion feel free to dive into the rabbit hole of criticism and evaluate it yourself i personally believe with all the ups and downs this is one of the best rts available right now don t let others ruin it for you
