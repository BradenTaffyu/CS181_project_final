2018 you ever finish a game and feel empty inside sitting there staring at your computer screen thinking did i beat the game or did the game beat me i have never been so emotionally invested in a game and i don t think i ever will again or at least not to this level yoko taro and his team s games have always been thoughtful but often broken and underfunded automata is neither of those things yes the game has some issues out of the box namely clunky mouse keyboard controls if you don t have a controller and the mediocre ps4 port quality crashing and such neither of these is a problem which is absolutely gamebreaking if you have the patience to spend maybe an hour before you start playing to fix both things with the means quite readily available online then they shouldn t really be issues at all as such if you look past the couple fixable problems and spend the time to play the game all the way through you ll be rewarded with nothing short of a goty worthy masterpiece first the good nothing that i m going to gush about but good enough to warrant mentioning the graphics and scenery are the right balance between looks and performance nothing to gawk at but more than enough to make you appreciate the game s setting while still giving you more than enough fps to play comfortably i really loved the overall aesthetic of the game even if some of the visuals were lacking at times the amusement park might just be one of my favorite locations in any game ever the overall ambience of the place combined with my favorite song from the ost is fantastic the first time you head to the park is a really memorable moment it s really a sight to behold gameplay wise the game is rather unique while the combat is pretty straight forward for the most parts the pods pod programs and the entire chips concept is a really cool mechanic which can really adapt to the playstyle of the player the amount of chips available and the variety of pod skills combined with the variety in weapons spread across four types means you can go in so many different directions with your setup depending on the character and the way you want to play them where the game shines however is well basically everything else i ll preface my spiel by saying that more than one person i know who bought this game thought it was over by the end of route a and or b it s not route a sets the stage for the story route b builds on it via a different perspective and hints at what is to come and route c rips your heart out and smashes it with a sledgehammer you don t just play through the story of this game you experience it it draws you in plays with your emotions and spits you out unceremoniously it s almost as if taro speaks to you on a visceral level the androids don t have the luxury of mercy why should you the androids you take control of aren t unaware of their fate they know they were built solely to fight to protect humanity from the scourge of the aliens and the machines they re soldiers after all so how does one live when their life s path is predetermined how can someone possibly make meaning out of their existence with that cloud of inevitability hanging over their head nier automata and the android trio you play as confronts these questions with a somber poignant and at times downright tragic storyline a story which is as a whole next to none taro spins an eloquently heartbreaking tale which only gets more emotional and heart wrenching the further in you go as aforementioned there is no way you will ever understand the full impact of the story if you don t play through the game the full three times at the very least and even then there s still more to learn about the world the machines and the androids by doing sidequests and gathering data via items scattered around the world and by exploring the backstories of some of the major npcs as an extension of the story with the game evolving through each playthrough so do the characters on an abandoned planet now overrun by the enemy the androids grapple with the truth that they must live with minimal guidance from the human creators they have been tasked with protecting all while the machines they fight begin to emulate the humans of past forming religions governments relationships families concepts so foreign to the androids that they often fail to understand why the machines hold on to such foreign concepts on a planet which has long forgotten its previous inhabitants and yet in the midst of the endless fighting operator 6o 2b s mission control is able to almost seamlessly transition from giving 2b all kinds of dangerous missions to talking about her horoscopes and the crush she has on one of the other operators one of the side quests involves finding flowers to take a picture of to show this space bunker confined girl the wonders of the world below it s a strikingly idyllic quest which is in a sense a microcosm of the game as a whole nier automata juxtaposes both the pain of an endless mindless war with the playfulness and fleeting moments of joy few and far between as they may be and compresses them into a highly personal emotional story about a trio of nameless androids forbidden to express emotion who are struggling to understand themselves their purpose the ruined world they re fighting to save and the continually evolving enemies they must hack to bits at every turn in the cruel cycle of life and death no one is safe not from the enemy not from fear not from the unknown and especially not from themselves but of course for all i ve said about the story this game would be nothing without the powerful stirring soundtrack to accompany it every song in the soundtrack is masterfully crafted perfectly fitting for the situation or location in question enhancing the overall feel of the game at any given time in any given location emi evans use of chaos language is fantastic as ever in case you re not familiar taro told her to predict how human language would have evolved 9 000 years into the future as morgan freeman once said in shawshank redemption i have no idea to this day what they were singing about truth is i don t want to know some things are best left unsaid i d like to think they were singing about something so beautiful it can t be expressed in words and makes your heart ache because of it i tell you those voices soared higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream you don t always have to know the meaning of the words in a song to appreciate the song sometimes it s even better to not know the meaning and let your imagination make of it what it will the music of automata will run you through the full gamut of emotions uplifiting and cheery to dark and depressing and everything in between weight of the world is far and away my favorite song in the soundtrack and the one which will never fail to make me emotional if you ve finished route c you ll understand why the music is beautifully composed and it s so magnificently intertwined with the game the locations the story you can t ask for anything more from an ost nier automata weaves an intricate web of hope despair failure the cruelty of life the inevitability of death and rebirth it is at its essence is at its worst a maddeningly depressing tragedy that somehow improbably manages to go beyond tragedy into something much better it dramatizes the terrible cyclical nature of life while simultaneously breaking from that focus to find fleeting moments of joy and pathos within a seemingly hopeless situation in my eyes it is next to none it is the pinnacle of storytelling through the video game medium i implore you to see this masterpiece of a game through to its bitter end you will not regret it glory to mankind
