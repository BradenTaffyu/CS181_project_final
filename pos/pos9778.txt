2018 crash land on a mountainous ice sheet be a single 21 year old cannibal named toasty stay warm by becoming roommates with a steam geyser people just keep raining from the sky in drop pods often bleeding out within hours or freezing to death free food toasty keeps living up to his name lounging in bed as the steaks freeze for him to later collect toasty now lives in a mediocre mountain home still alone but apparently playing horseshoes is an alternative to socializing nowadays eventually find someone peculiar a 20 year old sanguine nudist woman named suttles who has a fervent passion for researching toasty s heart goes bump a bump toasty remembers his purpose he decides to heal the woman s frostbitten body solely to increase his medical training yes suttles makes a full recovery immediately rushes to the nearest research bench toasty turns up the heater a little bit for her since you know this delicate flower just keeps being naked in the middle of an ice sheet foolishly make the research room the same as the dining room uh oh toasty walks in with his latest snack suttles smile doesn t even dip when he starts going ham on the frozen corpse of some rando they talk toasty between mouthfuls and suttles between paperwork toasty makes a joke about her body kids don t try this at home which suttles responds by literally turning her back to him inadvertently furthering the comedy they laugh they hit it off eventually the bodies start running out should be noted that toasty doesn t actually have any food other than frozen human meat suttles doesn t mind all that much she has to eat too meanwhile toasty is grim why did he rescue this woman he knew he couldn t support another mouth to feed for long was he just fattening up his prey toasty decides meanwhile suttles is trying her luck at creating a sculpture she will never finish it in the middle of the night toasty sneaks up on suttles sleeping form using his previously learned medical skills and secret stash of actual scavenged medicine toasty surgically removes her heart she dies in his arms without pain or suffering toasty despite having a sub par construction ability crafts an absurdly excellent sarcophagus walks past the unfinished sculpture it will never be whole toasty entombs her in his backyard out in the snow in a haze he goes straight to bed toasty wakes up to hunger the hunger the very same hunger he had only questioned once before toasty immediately exits his fortress of solitude once more great bow in hand walks past sarcophagus he searches and surveys for some wild game but to no avail toasty gets hungrier toasty makes his choice toasty lays in his bed yet again just as he had many times before the food rains when he lounges in his cozy bed right why did that seem like some long forgotten myth starving toasty like all people who are alone and in pain fantasizes toasty will not do it he thinks to himself toasty will survive this he thinks to himself some fresh game will come eventually he thinks to himself toasty pries open the lid the meat is still there perfectly preserved unblemished untouched slowly toasty lifts her up toasty gnaws on her bones a ritual like a twisted corrupted hug in his twisted shattered mind as he finishes his feast 20 simple meals fall from the sky right outside his front door randy random 10 10 best narrator ever one month later irl six years have passed in game don t question the space time again toasty currently lives in a truly magnificent mountain home his old steam geyser one purpose serves all room now houses a geothermal generator and a vast variety of crops growing in hydroponic basins the third official person to join was tater a master raider he was 78 when he first joined now 84 despite him being basically a grandpa he lives up to his title with his absurdly high combat skills he is also incredibly incredibly charismatic despite being staggeringly ugly thus proving looks are not all that matter the only reason tater can put up with living with a cannibal is because he is a night owl he is very happy to be up and moving when the sun goes down when the sun comes up he really really hates it so he simply sleeps during the day should be noted that while sleeping a person s mood is does not change until they wake up he is effectively only awake when he is at his happiest role model material he had a heart attack when he was 82 instead of trying to save him toasty seemingly consumed by some far off distant memory surgically replaced tater s heart with a bionic one utterly superior in every way to a normal heart apparently death by old age might be a myth instead old people die from heart attacks tater is now immortal probably fourth colonist was rescued from a pirate camp thanks to the valiant efforts of tater maya a human computer is 32 and was rescued because she happened to be toasty s mother she is beautiful which settles well with tater she is also a cannibal which does not settle well with tater i m was more concerned how she had a child 4 years younger than her until i realized she s actually 61 due to cryogenic sleep questionable cougar i dunno speaking of cryogenic sleep the fifth colonist was sophia tater s sister she was utterly useless so i put her in cryo sleep did not butcher her due to the fact tater would ve become extremely upset and having a veteran grandpa going ballistic wouldn t go down so well by the way tater has a power claw for his left arm because reasons again doubling down on the disincentive realize after two in game years that instead of having her occupy a colonist slot i could actually gift her to a different faction i do so tater with his metal heart grizzled veteran experience and being old possibly senile didn t care as long as she wasn t dead or in danger for whatever reason raids have reached absurd difficulty being invaded by 4 9 mechanoids per raid now being invaded by a minimum of 15 pirates per raid now i keep running out of steel to build spike traps so i ve resorted to using granite traps instead kinda running out of granite now in this mountainous map aaaaaand i get a quest to rescue sophia as she had apparently been kidnapped by pirates heck her sarcophagus lies in a distant dusty corner of the rock walls undisturbed locked away away from the chaos absolute silence despite previous claims a chunk of her remains remain there is an absurdly rare item in the game that can raise the dead even complete regeneration of lost body parts still searching raids keep getting harder i need you more than ever suttles gotta research that space ship gonna fly through the stars together
