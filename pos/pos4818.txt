2019 just to preface i already loved this game i dumped around 300 hours into fo4 across a handful of playthroughs without the dlc and recently bought myself the goty edition on sale just for kicks i ve already put another hundred hours in and i haven t started nuka world yet i don t know what it is but i ve always had a problem putting this game down yes it s got problems it s a bethesda game so it s got quite a few in fact despite it s issues it s stayed my go to timewaster for well 400 hours i spent most of my adolescence playing games like minecraft terraria etc and grew a strong love of just building for fun as a result and for me fallout 4 scratches that itch so well it s not a masterpiece so don t go into it expecting one but i d be a liar if i said i didn t love it
