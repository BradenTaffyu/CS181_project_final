2017 early access review after venturing too far underground and getting myself hopelessly lost wandering for ages without finding a stairway leading back up i came across a space time vortex weighing the options of taking the time trying to retrace my steps back to the surface continuing forward in hopes of finding an upward leading stairway or taking my chances with where the vortex decides to send me i chose to take my chances with the vortex i emerge in the middle of a river with vicious madpoles not far away i frantically take one out with a freeze grenade and my mind lasers which grants me enough experience to level up giving me enough mutation points to invest in a new mutation one of my options is the space time vortex ability with more madpoles than i am currently prepared to deal with closing in i take it and make another rift in space time in a bid to get to safety mercifully i am swept away to within a couple of screens from the starting village a gameplay would bend time and space in a desparate bid for safety again
