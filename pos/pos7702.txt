early access review graphics you forget what reality is beautiful good decent bad don t look too long at it ms dos gameplay very good good it s just gameplay mehh watch paint dry instead just don t audio eargasm very good good not too bad bad i m now deaf pc requirements check if you can run paint potato decent fast rich boi ask nasa if they have a spare computer difficulty just press w easy easy to learn hard to master significant brain usage difficult dark souls story no story some lore average good lovely it ll replace your life game time long enough for a cup of coffee short average long to infinity and beyond price it s free worth the price if it s on sale if u have some spare money left not recommended you could also just burn your money bugs never heard of minor bugs can get annoying ark survival evolved the game itself is a big terrarium for bugs 10 1 2 3 4 4 5 6 7 8 9 10beamng drive is a successor to rigs of rods the game itself is two steps ahead other games in terms of realistic vehicle simulation and its soft body physics so thanks to this it s unique driving cars is easy just press w but controlling them is a whole different story disabling automatic clutch gearbox safety and playing on a manual gearbox using a steering wheel makes the game a lot harder to play but that s the fun here tuning cars especially with mods is really fun and rewarding once you master it i ve never seen a game with this much car tuning capabilites so that makes it stand out among others mods make the gameplay 10x better as there are infinite possibilities to play the game for now there are only short scenarios and freeroam that can get boring after some time but a career mode is in the making since the game is in early access the game in its current state is really fun as is and it will continue to expand in the future the devs are updating and hotfixing the game frequently so that is a big plus also i hope beamng will get optimised more and more because rendering and calculating physics is really cpu intensive so playing with more than 1 2 cars will drop your framerate especially on big maps like west coast usa overall if you like cars you need to play this game it s really fun once you get into it
