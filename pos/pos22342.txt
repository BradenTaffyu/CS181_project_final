i just finished my first playthrough on dark souls 3 in around 40 hours of playtime and i have to say that in all of these 40 hours i had the most enjoyable satisfying time in gaming and it instantly became one of my top 5 favourite video games the game was so good i am willing to keep playing it going further unlocking everything even if i know it will be a pain but pain was already there considering this is a souls like game seriously if you want to play souls games and you don t know where to start this is the best one to start with
