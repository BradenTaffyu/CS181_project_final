2021 dark souls iii so here we are friends at the end of an era it has been a long and glorious journey together but as it always is all good things must come to an end i have been sitting on this review for a long time now because i definitely didn t want to say goodbye to the series that has to date defined my adult gaming years but with elden ring just around the corner and the hype beginning to rise from the overwhelming excitement i thought this would be the perfect time to finally put this review to rest so with no further delays dark souls 3 storydark souls 3 is a beautifully written tale that perfectly captures the essence of sorrow and urgency that you would expect in such dire circumstances this couples nicely with the smaller individual stories you will explore along your journey with the finale bringing them all together for the emotional end of the series the game takes place in the fictional kingdom of lothric you are the ashen one a being that was without the strength to rekindle the flame you fell to its power you were buried in an unmarked grave and forgotten until now as you awaken once more from your promised rest you are given one last task by the fire keeper as the first flame begins to fade to gather the existing lords of cinder who have abandoned their duties to the kingdom and together decide the fate of lothric once and for all gameplay movement as with any good adventure game especially a souls like which essentially forces you to always be one the move or die movement smoothness is key thankfully dark souls 3 has taken everything it has learned from the previous games and implemented it all perfectly here movement is fluid and seamless and provides you an optimal experience as you traverse the world combat essentially the bread and butter of the this genre of games combat is fast and rewarding while constantly teaching the player that mistakes can sneak up on you if you aren t prepared this is one of those scenarios where practice makes perfect and with each playthrough of dark souls 3 you will become a far more proficient manifestation of destruction bosses in a game that has you forcibly bring to heel great beings with lord souls infused into them you can imagine that boss fights will play a major role in this game indeed they do you will experience your first boss fights rather early on and the experience you gain from them will carry you to the next and possibly to the end as you learn all the intricacies of combat and behaviour along the way items dark souls without a huge variety of equipment wouldn t be dark souls dark souls 3 has elegantly pursued this mindset with its variety of weaponry and armour that simply put has turned killing into an art form from giant hammers axes swords daggers and even magic for those inclined dark souls 3 has something for everyone and will let you comfortably test them out as you progress world design i ve always been a great admirer of fromsoftware s world and level design in many ways perfectly capturing the essence of every moment dark souls 3 has really excelled in delivering such an experience with the help of better graphics and the knowledge derived from the previous instances the world is masterfully developed to provide the perfect storybook experience coupled with the uncertainty that is always present in souls games character development this is where the real niche of dark souls is born to be entirely honest the character development not only defines how difficult or easy the game is for you but also gives you an enormous repertoire of paths to pursue as you find your own personal build that will carry you to victory not every build will work spectacularly for all scenarios however so evolution and development are crucial to your success player vs player while i m not a huge fan of the player vs player side of things i have come to terms with their existence in these games it works well with the game world and can easily be avoided if you aren t interested in pursuing this game aspect killing bosses does ember you up allowing invasions to occur but the competition is often fair and well placed so it s not an overwhelming disaster no hand holding it has always been a downside for many gamers that there really isn t any tutorial or hand holding in these games while i like that you have to discover everything on your own it can be off putting to many that you aren t provided any basis to learn the game before the real challenges are set upon you lack of map there really isn t a map for you to pull out to navigate the world this can be a real deterrent for many gamers as being lost is never a great feeling especially in dark souls where almost every corner has an enemy hiding in its shadows or a trap lying in wait visualsnobody can deny that dark souls 3 looks beautiful it has been lovingly created from the ground up so that every single aspect of the world captivates you in some way whether that s by bringing you further into the experience as a whole or by just stopping you in awe at the glorious scale of it all dark souls 3 offers you a steady frame rate on mid end hardware capped at 60 fps dark souls 3 is still a console port however and suffers from that with its limited scope of graphical choices there was no visual distortion during my substantial playtime across both the console and pc versions the world is vibrant and gorgeous in almost every facet of its design and that is clear from the moment you start playing right until the moment you finish dark souls iii a screenshot of dark souls iii by preator audioi often wonder what makes a game s audio truly spectacular i believe it s the essence of it that lingers with you possibly forever it has been a while since i played dark souls 3 yet if i close my eyes and remember the different fights i can hear the cacophony of the orchestra rising and falling with every slash of my sword the bass as i roll in and out of danger coupled perfectly with the clank of metal on metal the jingle of armour as you traipse across the landscape and the overall atmosphere that you are in a world on the very verge of toppling to the ground at any second dark souls as a whole has captivated me to my very core with its stunningly designed soundtrack and atmospheric audio i had no concerns with the audio quality at all during my play time final thoughts excellentoh how badly i wanted to rate this as flawless i unfortunately couldn t as perfect as the game world is for me it fails to deliver that seamless experience for all gamers it is a challenging game world designed by passionate developers for their fans this doesn t really allow easy access to it for the broader audience with this in mind though the game world is masterfully designed and developed the soundtrack captivates from the first moments you hear it and every single fight leading to the very last will feel as epic as the first this is more than just a game it s an experience and a journey of your character and for you coming to terms with the dismal decisions that will be laid before you this is a must play experience that cannot be simply spoken about because words really don t do it justice it is best enjoyed in the heat of combat and for the countless hours you will spend exploring and daring its treacherous landscape
