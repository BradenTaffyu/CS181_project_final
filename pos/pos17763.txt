i personally love total war pharaoh have always been addicted to total war rome i and ii and the egyptian setting is a dream come true i don t think this version has revolutionised much compared to rome ii but i personally wasn t hoping for that to be the case so highly recommend if you liked total war rome and are excited about the prospect of it being a newer version in an egyptian setting
