2021 early access review graphics lowendpcstory very beautiful finger you got there really i am not kidding multiplayer only with mods i give 10 10 my summer car is simulation type game in which you build your own car from 0 details and graphics of this game are good for the year it was released overall the game makes you feel scared not to destroy your own car and not to screw it up i can confirm that if you die in this game your save will be deleted as my final words i recommned this game to those that like playing simulation games
