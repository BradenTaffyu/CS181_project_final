2023 i rate this a yes recommend with caveats you ll see from the 120 hours i ve got in the game and my achievements list i finished up through to the end of the first dlc and this is where i ll rest before i begin i ll say that it is likely that the developer is going to come in and apologize profusely for any issues i ve raised so i ll pre emptively say that i ve recommended the game it s a good product one that the team at dandylion should be proud of and based on how much i ve enjoyed it it s likely that i ll purchase any relevant sequel that comes out and i look forward to that day it s valid to be critical of something that is enjoyed in the hopes that the following offering is all the sweeter that out of the way there are three major issues with the game that i found grating the first issue is the storyi ll be up front and say that to an extent i enjoyed the story but the story feels at best scattered unfocused what it does well is character arcs humanizing your team demonstrating the inter personal relationships that grow between them even inter personal relationships between opposing factions is elaborated upon very well what the story does not do is provide any form of closure character relationships are developed through we ll call it canon events pre post mid battle sequences and through an in game mechanic that lets you build camraderie between teammates and unlocks specialized talents however in spite of that there are so many protagonists that the game desperately tries to bend multiple ways to give them all air time the first dlc introduces two more and the most recent dlc i m told introduces yet another character this is not a bad thing but it leads to the story feeling a mile wide but an inch deep which is unfortunate because the actual story is relatively engaging with good world building and an interesting narrative this lack of closure is something that is being remedied overtime by way of dlc and so i ll say it s something that may end up being fixed in the future however i personally found the ending of the first dlc disappointing without it being clear what happened to both the drifter clowns hanson or even giving any closure to the titular characters of the dlc s primary goal the second point is something others will have raised but i feel compelled to say it nonetheless the english translation is less than stellar it is i m told vastly improved upon where it was many moons ago but there s still lots of little things that read like nails on a chalkboard at times this isn t a dealbreaker but i hope that this game s success is such that any hypothetical sequel will allow the team at dandylion to pair with a competent translation team the last part is balance and this may be controversial because there are steps to remedy this the balance in this game feels finnicky the game loves to throw wave after wave of mooks at you and you hew through them like a scythe through wheat but it can feel overwhelming and many of these enemies seem like they only exist to overwhelm you i say this may be controversial because ultimately this is actually a solveable issue via in game mechanics such as challenge mode or various options that increase the difficulty of the game so i simply raise it as a potential issue that if you re like me and playing through on normal for the story you may find the lions share of the game relatively easy until you hit the end game levels to end on the positives the character build possibilities are staggering the gameplay is engaging i heartily recommend this game with the above caveats in mind
