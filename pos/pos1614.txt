2019 before we get into this there are a handful of things to mention first off the pc port is pretty atrocious the far mod is essential for a good playthrough and a controller is highly recommended to avoid frustration check out this guide for more info on setting that up with updates the mods are a lot less relevant but you might want to give them a look over either way for performance improvements second this is a sequel to the original nier game on consoles you absolutely do not need to play the original as the story in automata is largely self contained but some references and plot points exist that tie the two together the original nier s story is pretty fantastic despite the aged gameplay so it s worth giving it a try either before or after automata if you enjoy yoko taro s writing this is a lot more accessible now that the first game got remastered tl drfluid gameplay top notch audiovisual presentation and one of the best game stories around make this one of my favourite games period in spite of the bad pc port and some dull segments the game offers enough twists to the story and gameplay to make it an unforgettable experience and it offers a significant amount of play time to go with it gameplaynier automata follows in the footsteps of nier as a third person hack and slash with an emphasis on melee combat along with a secondary ranged attack and some ability use there s quite a lot of variety in the weapons and abilities you can use and they are all wonderfully animated which makes combat a treat the enemies have simplistic ai but there is a decent variety of them and the difficulty mostly comes from the mix of enemies in encounters especially as many of them have a tendency to turn the combat arena into a bullet hell encouraging the use of the full ability set to clear them out safely much like its predecessor there is an emphasis on perspective shifts and the game will swap between third person top down view sidescroller and more these changes happen fluidly in combat and they offer a lot of variety to the combat encounters aside from the combat there are a number of rpg elements thrown in as you scour the world you can find sidequests crafting materials weapons and upgrades to collect and plug in chips which are a system that allows you to upgrade and customize many aspects of gameplay from automatically picking up items to health regeneration or slowing down time after dodging a hit there s a huge variety in the loadouts you can make with those chips and i only scratched the surface of the various upgrade mechanics ingame but they definitely add a lot when it comes to customizing your gameplay style as a downside to the exploration aspect the game s fast travel system unlocks about halfway through the game and it s a real chore to move around and do sidequests that require a lot of travelling beforehand so i d highly recommend delaying some of the sidequests you get until you can unlock this feature one last note i d like to make here is that once you beat the game you unlock a fairly detailed chapter selection menu which keeps track of sidequests and progress and you can freely jump to any point to work on stuff you missed or go for those achievements it s a fantastic feature and it came in really helpful to pinpoint a few of the sidequests i wasn t able to finish the first time around storyi ll avoid going too far into the story as i believe it s the main reason for playing the game but the game puts the player in the middle of a long war between robots and androids you play as one of the androids and throughout the course of the game you get to interact with a cast of well written characters both on the android and the machine sides as you attempt to put an end to the conflict for good typical of taro s games the game has multiple playthroughs and as you go through them you get the chance to uncover new information or cast new light on events from the previous one on your way to one of the endings and while some sections of the game can get a bit repetitive it s definitely worth powering through those since this is a nier sequel playing that game first can spoil a few of the reveals from automata however the game s story is still self contained and can be followed without playing the original first visuals audiothe visual department is a treat with a lot of attention put towards the effects and animations in combat and they reinforce some of the most memorable moments throughout the game with that said some areas of the game tend to be very lackluster when it comes to decor and generally come off as monotonous the various perspective changes can spice some of those otherwise boring areas up but there are definitely times when i felt a bit more detail could ve gone a long way the soundtrack however is absolutely stellar even as a standalone ost in the game most songs have multiple versions the game cycles between depending on whether the characters are in combat doing a hacking minigame and so on and they are a huge contribution to the key moments of the game whether it s to set the mood after finishing a quest or key moment or really accentuate the theme of an area a special mention also goes to the voice acting which is just as high in quality and comes through in some of the most emotional scenes completioncompletion can take a while but isn t excessively tedious as mentioned the game allows you to go back to any point in the story once you re done so you can redo anything you ve missed with a single exception ending y it s something you need to go out of your way to do however so you can safely look it up once you re done with everything else
