2021 the last game which frustrated me this much was also the very first computer game i ever played zork a text based game from the 80s played on a commodore pet if you are not old enough to remember zork it was a game of blind man s bluff puzzle style text based maze game where you had to do and figure everything out in text as there were no graphics for computer games yet it was even before dungeons and dragons in fact my zork friends were the core later of my first d d role playing group at the university of alabama in the early 80s in any case whether you appreciate it or not this is a compliment most games i have figured out ruining the fun in under 15 minutes i am days into this game and still growling in frustration thank you may i have more please
