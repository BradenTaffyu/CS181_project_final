2019 i wanted to finish the game before i wrote a review on this about the game this game is turn based combat with free movement outside of combat this allows for you to setup interesting scenarios with ambushes and terrain by having some characters in combat and some outside of it it is a roleplaying game which is not dungeons and dragons but is in many ways similar to d d there are still dialogue checks and skill checks combat however relies on flat reliable values allowing the player to plan things out better rather than that depending on rolls of the dice the game is programmed in such a way where you are always moving towards the same end goal but you can get there in vastly different ways this is a refreshing take on allowing players choices and playstyles without having to write completely separate games for separate choices for example let s say the game sets before you the task of acquiring 3 of some important thing how you acquire those 3 things can be vastly different if you want to kill people for them you can if you want to steal them you can if you want to do things for people to get them that is also viable now onto weighing the game specifically pros environment matters physical environment like high low ground and line of sight are taken into consideration same with elements like water fire oil gas etc elements can be combined in order to make effects such as water and electricity to shock anyone standing in the water turn based combat i don t know about other people but turn based is my favorite combat mode for party based rpg s i do not like real time combat when you have to manage an entire group characters have their own backstories which add to the game and effect what happens as you play combat encounters are challenging enough to play out like a puzzle on higher difficulties it s like higher difficulties of x com 2 but much better in that you also have all these environmental factors and possibilities added in dynamic nature of combat keeps combat as engaging by your 60th encounter as it was on your 6th doesn t suffer from the staleness of most rpg combat interesting rewarding storyline which kept me engaged well written unlike the low effort lipservice drivel written by certain popular rpg game developers quite a lot of content good value for your money one thorough non rushed playthrough if you don t make the combat too easy on yourself should take in the range of 110 130 hours mine took 200 hours but i am as thorough as it gets and i would intentionally take on combats that were too high or difficult for my party on purpose and work on ways of beating them the ability to play a couch co op rpg on your pc rare and appreciated also appreciated that it works fine that way or as a solo experience cons final fight balance is off i get that final fights are supposed to be epic but if you make certain choices at the start of that fight you can beat it maybe once out of every 45 tries with a decently prepared group essentially those choices are not a viable option for that fight even if they are what is completely logical if you make a less logical choice to make it easier on yourself your path to victory is still mostly via hiding it was a real let down after how fun the game was leading up to there the ending panels do not reflect your romance in your character s future with regards to the fate of locations you visited it doesn t explain in any way why they turned out the way they did if this was supposed to be along the lines of the end panels of fallout 1 2 and new vegas it failed miserably due to lack of detail or consistency with what actually happened in the game dialogue while generally good was fairly railroaded it would ve been good to have some more exploratory dialogue in the game that would let us learn about the characters two of the most interesting npc s in the game i never got to find out their motivations despite working closely with them the ending in general felt rushed and seemed like they were forced to choose between a robust ending or an extra zone the crafting system is clunky and needs a search feature final impression this game overall i would highly recommend if someone is a fan of well written rpg s or games with turn based combat i would say this is a must buy my issues with it mostly stem from an unpolished and railroaded ending but the game leading up to that is fantastic and i understand that there is only a certain percentage of people who ever finish a video game especially one that can be as long as this one i would still urge companies to spend the money it takes there though because the people who are willing to finish games like this have loved the rest of it enough to devote the time into getting there it can make the difference between them giving glowing recommendations for years versus them playing it and mostly forgetting it personally this game ticks enough boxes in such a good way that i still will be giving it glowing recommendations it s the best turn based combat game i ve ever played it also has a decent enough storyline and content that the combat isn t the only thing to recommend it when if a sequel is made to this i will definitely be playing that as well if you have a decent amount of money this game is good enough to buy not on sale if you are less affluent or aren t so much a fan of the gameplay style i have described pick it up on sale buy this game if you like turn based combat you want a co op game to really get into with a partner or roommate or friend you like the idea of being able to use your environment to your advantage you like combat to be something to think about and plan around don t buy this game if you like mindless hack n slash combat that plays out mostly the same for hours on end action rpg s you don t like rpg s with storyline you thought fallout 3 or 4 was better than fallout new vegas
