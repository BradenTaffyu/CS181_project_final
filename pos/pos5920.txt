2021 early access review update this game is about to be fully released in october i love the game its biggest flaw is that people wanted it to be everything they wanted it to be a total war game civilization game grand theft medieval a full on rpg game more more more game was never gonna be good enough it is a great game that wont satisy everyone and but will still be enjoyed by manythis is a solid medieval war game with combat party and kingdom management elements thier is tons to do and lots of things have been added this indie studio delivered a aaa title with a lot less bugs then the big boys do and they are making it modder friendly and they built thier own game enginei do not regret purchasing this at full price siege towers and ladders work fine for me economy is much better than it was 1st thank you taleworlds for a great game this is one of the few games i ve purchased at full price because you deserve it old review yet still relevanti cant believe some of the complaints i see i saw these every update 1 mods now longer work after update ummm hello it s a game still in development if your gonna use mods right now u should expect this 2 game needs more content ha i saw this from someone who has already logged more than 250 hrs in the game this complaint is a joke 3 gmae is always got between two groups of the minority and they are release game now group and this needs more features and time group lolthe gameplay is fun and compelling allowing characters to age creates an ever changing world game has gotten better over time less menu lag etc taleworlds is an independent studio focus on perfecting this game on pc before porting to console already better practices then a lot of triple aaa studios cant wait for more improvements and the finished product thank you taleworlds dont get caught up in the negativity of gamers who will never be satisfied
