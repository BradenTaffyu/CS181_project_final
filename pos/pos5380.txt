2023 early access review one thing i don t see people talking about enough is just how immersive this game is for me caves of qud comes very close to replicating the freedom and immersion of playing a table top rpg being a very open ended sandbox game there s a lot that can be done within the game s systems however all of these mechanics are presented in such a way that nearly everything you could do feels natural in the context of the setting this is already a very impressive game from a technical standpoint with the level of simulation that s going on beneath the surface what i find even more impressive is the fact that the game doesn t seem to entirely revolve around all of these complex systems but rather uses them to flesh out its core gameplay and game world additionally this is a very text heavy game not that you necessarily need to pay attention to much of it to play the game or even to have fun with the game but i believe that you d be doing yourself a disservice to gloss over the reading the methods of description used by the writers are incredibly rich vibrant and unique in a way that gives the world of qud a very distinct feeling to it this is all supplemented by incredible audio always fun to see in traditional roguelikes and a brilliant tileset that gives just enough visual information to convey a stylistic personality while still allowing your imagination to run with the text blurbs essentially caves of qud makes it very easy to visualize the fantastical events you are experiencing beyond the limitations of the medium and does so with an incredibly distinct personality
