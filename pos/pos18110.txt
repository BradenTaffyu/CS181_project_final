2017 i have been apart of the total war series for most of my life and i can tell you this i have loved every bit of itpros good campain smart ai frames do tend to pose a problem somtimes but not muchvery awesome battles i love the new addition of slow mo it just add to the battle even morethis game has taught me alot about rome and the nations that were around then and i am thank full this game was the best game in my opinion out of the franchise even better than shougun series becuase of the amazing graphics cons after playing this game for 4 6 months gets boring i am not going to liethere was a lot of negitivity on release final thoughts give it a try total war warhammer did not live up to its potenial so i would strongly reccomend this game
