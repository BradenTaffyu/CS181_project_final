2022 symphony of war s fantastic presentation in its spritework is amazing and it s backed up by an even more amazing game on top of this tl dr amazing ost sick spritework satisfying to min max or structure your army an absolute joy to play if you like tactical rpg swow what a game how do even i begin i have played the game through twice now on warlord highest difficulty before the option to remove permadeath if i were to play again i would be too stubborn to turn it off due to having played with permandeath twice already which was the default for me this game could have been easily priced at 29 99 so i opted to buy the extra dlcs to support the devs since it isn t in an age where games are more about the presentational front and marketing power symphony of war easily stands as a testament to what small developers and a lot of love can accomplish if they lack that power it still confounds and escapes my mind that symphony of war was created within rpgmaker and each time i start the game i am only ever reminded of this when a cutscene occurs whenever you get to see the iconic character or chibi sprites of rpgmaker fame if the initial art style and screenshots of its highly stylish sprite work didn t captivate you at first then this game is most likely not for you this game is a love letter to the presentation love and work that went into the older games with its style like fire emblem and advance wars as the most glaring examples there haven t been many faults within the art style that i ve taken any deep notes on the style is consistent and you ll notice a small difference and quality between certain units such as sorceress and paladin and the animation differences between certain classes being much more visceral probably due to different artists interpretations these details are however minimal on the whole and the consistency throughout remains with its fantastic presentation gameplaywise it is an absolute joy for people of all different styles who love tactical rpgs or would very much like to get into one the game is backed up by a fantastic ost that gets you into the mood to watch your army fight the only downside is that enemy turn ost is the same throughout the game which isn t a bad thing but it gets boring when it doesn t loop change either the tutorial explains everything that you could need so i am not going to go too deep into the gameplay in general but if you are familiar with both advance wars and fire emblem then the game will very much fall into place it s satisfying to spend time thinking about the purpose of each group what units they should have what affinity is best suited for the role you want them to have and then seeing it shine there is nothing quite like watching your 6 7 archer units rain down a hailstorm of arrows when fully upgraded with extra arrows or a shield wall of sentinels taking on 4 groups of enemies as bait while healers are in the back formation stitching them back up to full the plot does what it s supposed to it s to the point and it s sweet though the pacing falls off slightly towards the end if this is the buildup to a sequel or something much greater i am more than ready to play it i thoroughly enjoyed this game and i wish to see more from the developer going forward the game is so fantastically well structured and creating your own ultimate army is its own little game i d rate the game a 9 10 it s so satisfying to play and the amount of work and love that went into it is abundantly clear i still can t believe it s made in rpgmaker 9 10 would play a third time again old review back when i first got the game what a stupidly amazing game i d make a larger review if i weren t playing the game right now and enjoying the toughest difficulty even if i am losing and i have to reload i am not even mad things to note before full review what an amazing ost the sprites are sick and consistently cool with the artstyle i forget 99 of the time that it s an rpgmaker game this is hands down the best rpgmaker game made yet
