2017 hands down one of the best crpgs in recent history i m willing to say i liked this even more than pillars of eternity and i m a infinity engine rpg nut it s a bit different than your classic crpg the main story doesn t seem that extraordinary but it grows on you it s not what makes the game good the journey is you have multiple ways to achieve things want to steal a chest without being seen teleport it away from affar want to blow up a door but it has too much hp blow it up with an explosive barrel want to escape a keep of evil clerics well i ll let you figure that one out for yourself you ll have many ways to chose from the voice acting is great considering how little budget they had compared to triple a companies every npc has something to say the writting is just right and very immersive remember the combat in torment tides of numenera wipe that nightmare out of your memory with the combat in this game it s fun complex and actually makes you look forward to battles each companion is unique and complex great char development as well as you proggress i could go on for ages the bottom line is they have outdone themselves immensly with this game go buy it and support larian so they can make more
