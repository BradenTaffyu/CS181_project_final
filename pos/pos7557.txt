2019 anno 1800 is an absolutely delightful game a worthy addition to the anno series i first tried this a couple of days ago in the open beta and was impressed enough to pay for this on steam the campaign mode introduces you to the basics of the game with a fair amount of guidance to get you going voice overs are lovely and very well done also performance for me has been really good i have read some reviews of the game running not so well for people however i can t say that has been my experience i m pleased with performance 3440x1440 60hzcurrently running on amd ryzen 7 2700xnvidia geforce 1080 ti32 gb ram i highly recommend this game but if you wish to purchase it on steam please be quick as after the 16th of april the game will no longer be available on steam dlc will be purchasable for people that already own it on steam though i m happy i was able to purchase this on steam myself oh and before i forget you must try ctrl shift r it brings up first person you can actually wander around the game world and explore your town up close it s amazing
