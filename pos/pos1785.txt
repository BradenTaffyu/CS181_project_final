2017 spoiler warning contains almost insignificant details about how ng works and details about the backstory that leads to the nier universe but without discussing nier replicant nor spoiling automata nier automata by yoko taro is not going to be an easy to make review taro in an interview discussed how in a game just a different camera angle can completely change its genre and this game is proof of that statement while nier is technically a third person arpg likely hooking people in for the looks of the main protagonist subverts any expectations by opening as a bullet hell space fighter the game continuously switches camera angle and genre going from 3rd person to a platformer 2d to a hack and slash isometric diablo like the camera is one of the strongest tools of the game instead of a limitation as it often is the way all these camera angles and genres work so well when other titles struggle at the one thing they should do really shows the mastery not only of the team of yoko taro but platinum games as well the gameplay is probably one of the best and most refined arpg platinum games ever made so fluid and satisfying to fight in satisfying with each movement and character feedback to my actions i loved every second of it and never backed out of a fight the game is full of secrets and often they are also well hidden but not unobtainable nier s story begins with the alternative ending of a completely different game drakengard in particular the e finale path here drakengard s protagonist and queen beast end up traveling through space and time to a modern day tokyo where the fire breathing hero defeats her the death of the queen beast unleashed what is known as the white chlorination syndrome the disease known as wcs started in downtown shinjuku and quickly spread causing devastating effects most people who contracted it would gradually turn into salt while others became violently insane by 2009 the country had become a warzone with uninfected humans fighting against a mad unstoppable horde known as legion this eventually leads to the events that take place in nier replicant which i won t get into as important yet not necessary to enjoy automata eight thousand years later in addition to all the issues caused by the wcs and discussed in nier replicant earth is invaded by alien machine life forms eventually the remaining human population decided that they had had enough and fled to the moon where they could be relatively safe from there they can send combat androids to fight against the machines and reclaim their homeland this is where our story begins following around 2b an android part of the yorha team and her adventures featuring her companion 9s and another android these are all playable characters at some point the game has 26 endings the canon ones being a through e and the rest are non canon a bit more on the funny side the game is heavily focused on the concept of a pseudo newgame inviting the player to finish it and start again using the same save file so much so that the game must be completed several times to see all the endings including the true ending like many ng in games items are carried over and so are side mission objectives beating the game the first time will give you the a ending but instead of simply restarting and increasing in difficulty the game will offer a different pov to the story in the second route and wildly change in the third route etc as a player who started this game without any knowledge of the previous work of taro this took me by surprise and i have never found a title using a game machine so brilliantly the soundtrack is something absurd always spot on and catchy keeps up with the moment and mood you are going through very well tracks from this game years after when reviewing this review are still some of my favorite music sadly the pc version used to not be perfectly optimized when launched hell we didn t even know it would come out a week after ps4 until days before launch it had some flaws for example in fullscreen the game would not be rendered at the targeted resolution but stick to 900p as on the console but many of these problems were solved with the far mod quickly after release the great news is that after the release of nier replicant on pc square came back to this title patching and optimizing the game as it should have always been fixing many optimization issues and adding support to fsr and 4k icons for the hud the game also has a dlc that is primarily an arena mode with unique objectives and costumes for all characters fun overall the game is well deserving and i don t think my describing it further would only spoil what a wonderful experience the game is just know it s hands down one of the games i suggest to anyone i know it is without a doubt one of the best gaming experiences i ve ever had 9 5 10
