2022 finally got some use out of my 6 years in engineering undergrad jokes aside oni is deceptively difficult no other game i ve ever played required the amount of real world understanding of physics and engineering concepts like this one while the game isn t a perfect physics simulation far from it it caters to a lot of the more intuitive things in physics that i enjoy a lot heat dissipation the ideal gas law conservation of energy and mass all of these core concepts take center stage when trying to save your duplicants from a cold icy death starved of oxygen my favorite example is when i first picked up this game i was taking an electronics basics class the very same principles of logic gates boolean signals and feedback i had just learned at school i was using in the game to help automate machines one bit of advice is that when you buy this game try it on your own for the first few colonies you attempt oni offers clever and imaginative ways of dealing with the problems that arise in the early game need food grow some plants duplicants need to use toilets cordon off a septic tank running out of oxygen well water is just hydrogen and oxygen electrolize it and use the hydrogen to power the production need water condense some steam from that steam geyser coming up with novel solutions to problems is very rewarding up until the real antagonist of the game starts to take hold heating see every machine in the game produces heat even using water as hydrogen and oxygen is dangerous as the gasses emitted from the electrolizer are above 60c once things get too hot food production stops no food bad if you can get to this point in the game don t feel like an idiot for heat killing your base be proud that you solved so many other problems before tackling the big one my next recommended step would be to take some time to read or watch some guides about in game heat dissipation and heat exchangers learn something once you understand the mechanics of the game better your enjoyment goes up 100 fold and you just might learn something along the way
