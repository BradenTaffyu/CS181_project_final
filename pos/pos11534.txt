2020 early access review i am constantly on and off with this game because i have been to busy to play at the moment i have to say honestly though out of all the games i have in my library if i had do delete all but one game i would keep this game 306 hours in game stretched out for years and guess what i hope this game never gets finished because the content they add keeps me constantly coming back for more and i love it 3i love a lone survivor feeling so i play by myself a lot update 622 hours in i am about to jump into a new world with my wife 10 10 great game with a lot of replay ability
