2017 tl dr a damn crab on the beach is more deeper character than any npc in skyrim or fallout 4 ever gameplay is so much more enjoyable and deeper than for example the witcher series characters are relatable and funny like in mass effect games makes me so salty to think about it that they stuffed all this to one single indie title pros after finishing my 14 hour tutorial edit nvm i m still in the tutorial i can already say this game does everything right and i ducking love it this is the game that made me belive in the game industry again i didn t like turn based combat until now i didn t like isometric point of view until now i didn t care too much about ingame conversations until now an rpg game you can play with friends and even cause drama in the scale of mario kart dialogue is far from monotonic and doesn t take itself too seriously voice acting is excellent to the point i found myself stopping to listen to the dialogue even tho i had finished reading it a while ago i haven t had this rewarding and brain stimulating singleplayer experience for as long as i can remember i haven t enjoyed this deep different and open ways of approach to different situations ever in a videogame before if you re being like me and see all the reviews and think should i buy this what if i don t like it it s so expensive just buy it in the name of source you won t regret it meow cons can t play accordion steals your life
