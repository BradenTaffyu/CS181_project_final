2021 calling this game good is an understatement it was great back in 2014 and throughout the years it s only gotten better it s the game i ve gotten steam for and i ve spent countless hours on it which aren t logged in because i played mostly offline it has a metric ton of achievements of all kinds symptoms combos coop and comp multiplayer and tons of interesting extra tidbits like news ticket easter eggs necroa virus and shadow plague branching backstories special combos that make countries bomb eachother even in multiplayer hell some scenarios both official and custom ones might as well be on the disease screens with the real ones if you re a fan of such strategy games 15 bucks is a steal sure the graphics aren t triple a realistic graphics so real you d think real life is fake but the sheer amount of content justifies it imo and it s often in sale i m glad it may get people interested in pandemics even moreso as we re currently still experiencing one good on ya ndemic creations
