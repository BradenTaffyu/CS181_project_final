2023 the occasional slow fps having to lower the graphics to make it playable no props or even a line tool for trees and the fact i have to turn on auto save every time aside this game is just so much fun the tools and the way it plays are just absolutely too good for me to even consider going back to cs1 i have so many hours in cs1 so many assets downloaded but the fun i am having in cs2 is unmatched the photo mode the level of detail it s all just so gorgeous i want to stare at it for hours i m so so proud of the cities i build in cs2 and the tools we re given to make such fantastic regions are unmatched once this game is fully optimised and they start releasing updates dlcs that add to the experience it s going to be immaculate i feel very very sorry for the devs on launch as to call it a bumpy launch is an understatement i appreciate their transparency and their honesty and i am grateful that i haven t had anything game breaking happen to me in the 88 hours i ve played since launch i ve had one crash to desktop that s pretty good going for a game that s not super well optimised and one that i m constantly having to figure out what settings work best for which map i can t wait for this game to reach the potential it promises and since i received this as a gift for my birthday i can t say if i feel it s worth the money currently but i definitely can t stop playing it
