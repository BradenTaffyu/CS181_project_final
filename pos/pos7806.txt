2018 early access review this game is more than a crash simulator beamng just might be the most realistic vehicle simulator i ve ever played the customization is deep you can pretty much add a turbo to anything the physics are close to realistic including assigning a variable clutch and you can grind gears overheat coolant and break pretty much any part of an engine the updates lately have made the game even better the sounds now sound absolutely amazing i really like the sound of the v6 it s so realistic cars can now backfire and the new map which is west coast usa i definitely recommend this game to any gearheads
