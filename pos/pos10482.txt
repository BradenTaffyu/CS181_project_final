2018 still pretty new to it 119 hours including idling in port but i love how tactical this game feels big fan of the old battlefield games 1942 2 2142 so having no auto heal and friendly firealways enabled feels refreshing nowadays i agree to what other people said it is slow paced and you need to be able to enjoy that the game does get hectic in your mind though e g if you maneuvered yourself into a bad spot and need to keep track of several enemy ships while escaping at the same time some bombers are coming for you and your turrets are closing in on being ready to fire again so you are tempted to fire a salvo but at what ship which ship can you afford not to angle especially in ten seconds when you ll be forced to evade the torpedos from the bombers yes the movement is relatively slow to very slow depending on your class but you still need to make decisions and pro re act to something almost all the time it s just shifted a bit from reacting to stuff to constantly planning ahead of things and then reacting quickly when everything fails this is where team coordination comes into play and the game reminded me again of how battlefield felt while this game can be fun tinkering around solo it starts to shine once you play in a division squad should you even be in a whole team which coordinates it becomes a different animal this is true even for low tier battles having mostly new players in them so who would i recommend this game to in my mind i always distinguished cod and bf by you win bf matches with your cerebrum and cod matches with your cerebellum let the flame war begin but i don t mean that in a derogative way both games need experience training and skill to be good at the games just reward support different types of skills playstyles assumption people who favor the old bf style might like world of warships people who lean towards cod might not only my humble opinion though the game is f2p go check it out and make up your own mind f2phas to be addressed on a f2p game imho to me it feels pretty fair do you get ahead by forking over money sure and quite a bit if you want to but more important for me is does it get the whales anywhere the casual can t by just playing grinding and to that the answer in my opinion is no cash shop exclusive ships do have better stats but while still being an ensign i feel that in end game battles those advantages will most likely only carry you so far skill and teamplay will be way more important fingers crossed then again you get a full blown game for free giving some money back if you like it play it a lot seems reasonable and you can fully participate in endgame without paying a single unit of your country s currency just limit your expectations regarding the number of ships simultaneously in your inventory and don t expect everything on a silver platter but should you truly expect a f2p game with unlockable stuff and micro transactions not to be grindy you are probably new to online gaming in general
