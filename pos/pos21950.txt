2018 5 hours in i was like this is so unfair why isn t there an easy mode and ahh i hate multiplayer why won t these evil spirits leave me alone 50 hours in now i m deliberately under leveling my character to make it more challenging and i m doing all sorts of online activities like crazy dark souls has the power to convert people to make you love what you used to hate and that s a very transformative experience i m glad i didn t give up on this game i hope you don t either it s going to be worth it
