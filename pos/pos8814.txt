2019 as a new player to stellaris i have no historical perspective to complain about changes games like these are not normally ones i play that being said i very much enjoyed playing this game i appreciate that i can pause the game in single player and take the time to set actions for everything before unpausing the anomolies are fun to explore awakened empires were a pain in the beginning because the game doesn t warn you that out of a 200 year game an empire will awaken within the last 30 years to absolutely dominate and ruin your game if you re not prepared a warning or heads up for that would have been nice i do wish the 10 dlc s were not so expensive per piece i m not convinced to buy them unless they go on sale edit i d like readers to note that i have spent nearly 150 hours in this game as of writing this any game that can provide 100 hours of entertainment for 30 is worth it in my book
