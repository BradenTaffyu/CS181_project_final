hogwarts legacy without a doubt the best wizarding world game to date not a super in depth review and no spoilers this is now the gold standard of wizarding world games going forward sure there are things that could have been better but this is an incredible starting point for things going forward fantastic graphics gameplay story and characters the devs were clearly fans of the source material the world and especially the castle is so well made and brimming with easter eggs and fan service the amount of lore in this game is huge long term fans are in for a treat all 4 houses have massively fleshed out common rooms and each house has it s own twist on the main story line too the combat is meaty and satisfying very similar to arkham in a way which would make sense due to it being a wb game all the famous spells including dark arts lots of side missions and collectables as a harry potter fan i loved this game but it could totally be an entry point to non or new fans i am really looking forward to whatever comes next from avalanche portkey gamestrail dave revelio revelio revelio revelio revelio
