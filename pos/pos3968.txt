2021 the crown of cardgames a healthy addiction one of the very best games ever my favourite game as of 2021 normally i tell a bit about the story however in this game it s kind of a mystery during the game you receive bits of clues what s going on but this is open for interpretation and imagination i wouldn t want to spoil that experience all i can say is that your character must climb the spire mechanics every run starts with five strike cards five defend cards and two special cards specific for your character you also get one start relic tailored for your class after every battle you can choose one of three cards there are three degrees of rarities that can drop common uncommon and rare all cards have of itself more power than the starting cards and so it s imperative to add new cards remove bad cards and preferably find some powerful synergy there are three types of cards attack cards power cards these buff your character giving a bonus during this battle the power card is consumed upon use while other cards typically are discarded skill cards these can be many things like defend draw or create cards basically everything that s not an attack or a power cards can drop in upgraded form or can be upgraded at campfires random events or during a battle throughout the spire there are also elite monsters which give a greater chance of high quality cards but more importantly they give a relic relics provide powerful bonuses all the time a permanent power sort of they can dictate what the best strategy will be or what strategy absolutely will not work like cards relics also come in three rarities and the rare relics are very very powerful you typically obtain around five rare relics each run besides monsters and elite monsters there are also vendors campfires and random events you can choose your own route selecting which types of events you prefer for me i always choose a greedy route with the most elites and often pay the price for my gluttony every 16th level is a boss which can be seen beforehand so you can prepare your deck if you climb all the way to the top you unlock a new ascension level each ascension level makes the game progressively harder there are twenty ascension levels aside this your character also receives experience this unlocks powerful new cards and relics four protagonists ironclad the ironclad is a warrior with a two handed sword her key features are big attacks exhausting cards from her hand exhaust is remove card from deck this battle self damage for several benefitsshe starts with a relic that heals her after each battle making her the easiest to start with because healing is not widely available the silent the silent is a thief or a rogue with a dagger her key features are creating shivs in large numbers zero cost attacks which can be boosted greatly poison a damage over time that does damage at the start of your opponent s turn discarding cards which enables other cards the silent deals a lot of damage but has very limited ability to heal her starting relic draws two extra cards on her first turn making it easier to find powerful combo s the defect the defect is a robot it s key features are orbs orbs are changed to provide damage armour or energy they can be triggered by cards or charging orbs when you have no empty slots for an increased effect triggering consumes the orb power cards it has power cards that boosts or create other power cards since many cards of the defect work indirectly it is very easy to die it s very tempting to choose the wrong cards early in the spire because you have memories of shining successes in previous runs however lack the support for playing said card it starting relic gives one lightning orb the watcher added last year the watcher is a monk like class she is generally regarded as slightly easier than the other three her key features are stances stances can give an immense bonus to damage while the calm stance gives energy upon leaving the stance retain trait on certain cards meaning they don t discard at the end of the turn these two features scream combo her starting relic generates a card each turn that creates 1 energy and can be retained besides this she has cards with scry look at x cards from the top of your draw pile and either return or discard them combo combo combo the spire beckons i find it very fulfilling to play this game although i loose most of my climbs it s always very tempting to do another run the average winrate of the best players is around 60 so it s no shame to fail i find passive effects really charming so i have played mostly the defect and failed a lot o boy even when you play bad choosing a questionable strategy sometimes you just get lucky the other side of that coin is that some climbs are doomed to fail such is the spire and we accept this fact generally when you reach ascension 20 you ought to have a good understanding of the game along the way we all make the same mistakes super multi attacking a character with thorns omitting healing because of preferring upgrading cards closing paths with elites while your deck is utter garbage choosing only attack cards or only defense cards i generally choose too many cards because i like cards every run brings something new i could literally play this all day it feels a bit like many big free to play games can make you feel but without the terrible business models this is one of the best games ever made period 97 100for me it s almost perfect but i can think of one thing that could be improved and it s a very personal thing when selecting a next encounter you have to give a very short mouseclick due to my illness i am not always able to do that frustrating oh and for having a speedrun achievement which is impossible for some people more reviews at omnivore gamer games that are easy to control for handicapped gamers
