2020 used to play this and love it back after it had not long come out which feels like a while ago started to get back into it in the last week or so when i noticed it had gone free to play and the nostalgia came flooding back still plenty to do and has a decent population still from what i ve seen on the darth malgus server obviously theres alot of perks etc if you subscribe but thats your call i m happy enough as a preferred play for now
