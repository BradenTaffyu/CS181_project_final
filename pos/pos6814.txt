2020 i bought this game a while back just to try it out because i was on the search for a simulation game i found euro truck simulator on youtube and bought it back then and i can say i m more than satisfied with the game rn i got around 500 hours of gameplay now i almost only play it for the multiplayer mod but some years back i really loved the aspects of driving so many different cargos and buying trucks after trucks i can really recommend the game
