2021 the hunter cotw is an amazing game for those who have the patience for it it takes alot of practice and knowledge to learn the game and it s mechanics at first glance the game might seem very slow pace and boring and i dont blame anyone for thinking that once you purchase the game you will be able to play two diffirent maps layton lake and hirschfelden these maps have a total of 16 diffirent animals species for you to hunt all the diffirent animals are split into diffirent weapon classes from 1 9 so diffirent animals require a diffirent caliber for exampel a whitetail deer is a weapon class 4 there are five diffirent ranks for all the animals bronze silver gold diamond and the great one only applies to some species you start from level 1 and progress ur way up to 60 as you level up you will unlock diffirent perks and skills to help you hunt animals more efficient you will also unlock new equipment such as weapons animal callers and binoculars there are 19 diffirent dlcs you can get for the game with maps and new equipment tip get them on sale this pretty much sums up my review thanks for taking ur time reading my awful review and i hope it helped you in some way
