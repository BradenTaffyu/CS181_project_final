2015 early access review of all the games in my library i find this one the most thrilling pros challenging alright character combat system plenty of possibilitiesthe gameplay is to my oppinion better than minecraft and in some ways it is what i would call an upgrade to it the level design is lovely but the graphics could be considered struggling compared to games like rust but of course given you can destroy almost anything you see the graphics remain stunning cons zombies often bug when killed though it looks fun there is only one map so far besides the automatic map generator bugs sometimes happen like items disappearing from your inventory the game offers a lot of hours of fun playtime but to my experience the game can quickly run dry of fun if you play singleplayer though with friends it is way more fun especially if you play online with many people just keep in mind that playing this game on an official server may require patience as people will try to kill you and you might then lose all your items having to start over once more a bit like rust at this point i would without doubt recommend this game due to the game s potential and overall gameplay
