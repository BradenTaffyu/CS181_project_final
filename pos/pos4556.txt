2018 not for everyone but definitely for me i love this janky weird game it has some flaws but the game itself is so fun so addicting and delivers such a unique game experience i couldn t help but spend hours on this game imagine playing an entire real time strategy game on the map of a civilization game except you re just a small fry mercenary leader trying to survive in the midst of warring nations you have to learn to deal with rapidly changing alliances and wars trying to juggle the approval of leaders and win the approval of a betrothed so one day you can go from a worthless nobody to the leader of the world that is mount and blade positives gameplay a combination of a real time strategy resource management and 1st 3rd person combat all rolled into one its seems like a cluster but it works so well when you finally understand the mechanics of the game and what you need to it just comes together 30 hours in i was amassing my giant army managing my fiefs pooling resources to capture a castle gathering allies then i personally lead my army against the enemy stronghold destroying the opposition and claiming victory its wonderful detailed rpg mechanics you can choose which faction to join shift alliances create your player character and manage the stats of you and your companions there s extensive army management too mod support mount and blade has a very active and talented modding community always a plus mixed combat the combat of m b w is functional and once you get the hang of it very fun but it s far from perfect they tried to implement limb targetting by pressing the attack button and drag the mouse cursor in the direction you want unfortunately melee combat is janky its unresponsive at times and doesn t control very well ranged combat could be more responsive too negatives the visuals even for a 2010 game m b w has some ancient looking visuals voice acting is non existant and character animations are stiff depending on how much you value presentation this could mean more or less for you personally i didn t really care tutorial the tutorial for m b w is far from adequate you re taught basic combat mechanics but nothing about amassing resources courting potential spouses maintaining your warband how to capture a castle or anything else m b w is an incredibly deep game with many things to learn and i just don t think the tutorial does enough to prepare you for it its absolutely necessary that you look up guides if you want to get anywhere in this game
