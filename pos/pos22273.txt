2020 overall everyone already knows dark souls but don t let its reputation scare you away these games are not overly difficult they are punishing but are mostly fair you will die quite a bit but don t be discouraged if you re looking for a tough but fair rpg there s no better series and i believe dark souls 3 to be the best of them the combat is the most fluid and fast paced in the series and has some of the best boss battles i have ever experienced there is a lot of weapon variety and there are many possible character builds there is a new feature combat arts which are attacks unique to each weapon that add some depth to the combat the game will not disappoint in the gameplay department furthermore the game looks and sounds very good some of the environments from software have created are breathtaking such as irithyll each boss also has its own unique orchestrated music track that makes taking down these foes feel all the more epic and satisfying if you have any interest in the series i highly recommend you give this game a shot online the online components of this game are mainly invasions and co op summons invasions are fun but can be very unbalanced co op summoning is fun if you want help getting through a tough area or if you want to play with a friend you can also let other players summon you to assist them the pvp arenas also provide a good amount of value but they are dlc exclusive in the arena you can fight 1v1 2v2 or 3v3 battles against other players you can also fight in 4 player or 6 player free for alls some people have reported cheaters messing with their games and banning them from online play but i have not encountered any myself dlc the first dlc pack ashes of ariendel is a bit short but ends off with one of the best bosses in the game the ringed city is longer and has boss battles of similar quality the ringed city is a fitting sendoff for the series i found both dlc packs were worth the money but if you could only pick one i would get the ringed city although once again i do recommend the season pass getting either dlc pack will give you access to the arena
