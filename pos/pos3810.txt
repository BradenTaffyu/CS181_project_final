2022 this one is an easy recommendation for me yeah the story is mediocre the plot predictable but man the gameplay is amazing it reminds me of tactic ogre and fire emblem you set up your units formation control the development of individual members of the units down to fudging with stats and alignments units have special categories they fall into depending on their composition light units can ambush for example and to get a light unit the unit itself has to consist of more light armored units than other types but that doesn t mean you cannot have a unit of 6 assassins guarded by 3 heavy infantry tanks it would still be a light unit benefitting from ambush and increased movement while still having the heavy armor for defense in the front rank positioning of individual members within the squad is important while you can have up to 9 members in a unit you do not necessarily want that depending on what you want the unit to focus on a wedge formation can be beneficial you will also get a number of named npcs many of which will have unique abilities but that doesn t mean you cannot make your own squads lead by no name people of course it takes a bit more investment as you need to train these no names a bit harder than you would need some of the named npcs which already start out being unit commanders and have according leadership values the story is serviceable and to me the weakest point of the game but the gameplay is so good that i actually wanted to replay the game the dev is also active on the steam forums seems to take feedback to heart and i cannot wait for a sequel all that has to do is give me more of the same and i happily give them more money i fully recommend this game it is one you do not want to miss out on if you like turnbased games with a deep unit customisation
