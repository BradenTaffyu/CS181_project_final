2016 product received for free this game was fine that s all fine the story is simple kind of nice but predictable the radio music was very good as always in bethesda games there re a lot of bugs i was 10 minutes trying to open a door then i realized it was open but the animation never changed and other little things like awesome plants breaking walls and people getting stucked on invisible walls or floors as a shooter it was okay i still think pickman s blade or any bleeding damage weapon is so op advice don t buy this at full price the game doesn t worth the price not even a 50 discount at least that s my advice there re better games for less money cof cof accidently reviewedwas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful either way join this group for more free keys and reviews weekly steam group accidentlyreviewed
