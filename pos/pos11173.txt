2023 i went into two point hospital frankly with low expectations the art style and atmosphere prominently displayed in its marketing materials feature a parade of gurning sub aardman plasticine figures and a facebook feed s worth of dad jokes a distinctly british kind of cringeworthy i am also one of the seemingly few millennials not to have played theme hospital in my youth meaning i come to this unapologetically nostalgia fueled management sim with a skeptical eye then opening up the game it promptly spams you with sega branded ads for sonic the hedgehog and the dev s follow up game the opening trailer features an american drawl and ker azy antics at odds with the rest of the game s humour to top it all the ecg trace on the logo isn t accurate but if like me you have the intellectual fortitude to overlook such superficial blemishes how does two point hospital fare as a management game it s fantastic two point hospital offers a series of satisfying nested micro challenges that add up to a supremely satisfying whole patients will first trickle then flood into your hospital with an increasingly challenging array of ailments these sickly human cash machines will need to be filtered through a series of gp appointments and investigations before a diagnosis is made and treatment is delivered for big bucks at first a few doctors and nurses can staff a handful of clinic rooms and a pharmacy to quash basic ailments as both each level and the campaign progress however you ll need to expand an array of diagnostics and specialised treatment rooms in order to keep financially afloat patients will cr ah defaecate vomit and die inconsiderately unless their needs are met covering the hospital in filth and more importantly depriving you of the payouts associated with treatment this means you ll need to employ assistants to keep patients happy fed and watered and janitors to scrub the decks but they in turn will demand wages break rooms and even decent working conditions all of which costs more money so far so realistic adding nuance are detailed systems of interior design training research and upgradable equipment all involve interesting trade offs training makes your staff more effective for instance and allows you to cultivate the specialist diagnosticians psychiatrists surgeons and radiologists needed to keep your machine operating efficiently in the latter levels but also pulls both teacher and student out of the workforce for the duration of the class to increase efficiency you can train multiple staff in the same field provided they all need to study the same course but this will deplete your workforce more acutely call in an external tutor to take off some pressure or learn a new skill and you ll need to cough up a quite chuck of change each of two point hospital s systems likewise offers an array of balanced options to juggle and while the game will rarely punish you irrevocably for failure disaster can spiral outward in fun and unpredictable ways a horde of prematurely mummified patients descending but nowhere to treat them no worries take out a loan throw up a couple of decrypters hire some skilled nurses and get to it ah but your janitors were busy cleaning up ectoplasm on the other side of the building and can t maintain the machines now one is on fire that s okay build an extinguisher and hire more janitors ah but now you re in debt again and your only surgeon is threatening to quit because his promotion hasn t been matched by a salary rise best sell the research lab just for now and fire your researcher what s this mysterious new illness and what do we need to treat it oh every session of two point hospital offers a buffet of addictive i ll just fix this management challenges nested within a generous and varied campaign the ui is wonderfully designed drawing your attention seamlessly to any impending crises offering buckets of data to drill down into or ignore as you wish and with a refined suite of quality of life features like room template saving and copy pasting what makes the game sing is its atmosphere which is a far cry from its cringeworthy marketing the visual style is clean and almost restrained though with thoughtful animation and a dedication to visual puns that suggest it was something of a labour of love the jazzy upbeat soundtrack perfectly matches the good humoured gameplay and can really get stuck in your head it s interspersed with radio dj voiceovers and spoof ads that barely repeated for me more than seventy hours in and often raised a smile there are lots of running jokes that reward close attention but could be happily overlooked two point hospital in short leans into an understated and convivial kind of humour that s distinctly british with notes of both monty python s absurdity and peep show s nihilistic self deprecation wonderful stuff add a generous dessert of dlc for afficianados and well integrated steam workshop support and two point hospital offers a huge sandbox in which to optimise systems muck about or watch your ant farm bustle it s the most fun i ve had with a traditional management game in ages beyond its offputting first glance my only real criticism is that the core gameplay loop can become repetitive and with challenge that tends to decrease once you ve vaulted the early game s hurdles it can become a battle of attrition on even the most challenging levels yet watching the game s hundred moving parts tick with obvious care and attention gone into realising every one offers its own meditative pleasure a wonderful jumping on point for the genre as well as a feast for veterans nostalgic for the tycoon games of the 90s don t miss this gem highly recommended
