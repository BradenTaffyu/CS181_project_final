2023 after over 600 hours played a few months extra via gamepass im ready to drop a goodbye reviewi ve bought this game knowing what im getting myself into as i was playing fh4 for roughly 500 hours being in a discord community that is very engaging with the game and players and is in an overall high quality it made me want to keep playing both forzas for way more time than initially intended so im really grateful to these discord groups and their staff and members for this reason with that being being said playing on your own will make your experience way quicker to be burnt out than with a community and i aint talking about co op convoys but just getting more content by other players you can befriend with and talk to online community wise the game feels kinda the same like gta v online where you re dropped into an unnamed massive server with random players around you yet arent given enough tools to properly communicate with them add to that the horrendous platform that is called ms store xbox console companion that feels so damn clunky that even befriending and chatting with other friends is a gauntlet on its own and makes you feel like you really need to find an actual community on a 3rd party platform discord is generally ideal for this or else you re being left to play alone even if the game is in online mode these hurdles can be felt regardless if playing the steam version or ms version as making a ms account is necessary for this game to work and be connected online ok enough chatter about friends the game itself is great and welcoming for the car newbs and car nuts alike and no matter where you are on the car spectrum irl and in the gaming world you will feel the fun of this game especially if this is your first or 2nd forza horizon experience i e you havent played fh 1 3 fh4 was quite similar to this one but had a lot more passion put into it while fh5 has been given lots of qol updates over its predecessors things like increased amount of props and the ability to put props in route creation so now you can design your own tracks with props involved turning this game into a gmod like experience if you re so inclined alongside adding rules to the driving experience turning any typical race into a minigame of its own with different objectives than just finish first important side note this game is mostly for arcade fun and not designed for sim racing in mind meaning that any gripes you have about its physics sound lack of competitiveness etc are quite redundant as there is always a fragile balance between fun and realism also this game will not fulfill your mid 2000 s nfs vibes at all this game is its own sub genre of sorts and is less about weeb car upgrades tho there are plentiful overall and nitro and more about car veriety and making new builds the game is structured with a playlist system each month is divided into 4 seasons 4 seasons per month one per week the months are called series which the game devs are pushing into the game and you have a month long content to enjoy with a weekly reset time for each season happening every thursday afternoon each month has its own theme e g japanese cars offroad racing classic cars high performance track cars etc each week season you get a new playlist of objectives to do this is generally referred to as the weekly grind like certain tournaments and other stuff playing with no pause would take you about 5 10 hours to finish an entire weekly playlist in a typical non tryhardy playstyle other content in this game over 700 cars in total and more are being added every month with new free updates a spacious open world map of mexico where you can drive freely with other players randoms or friends either as freeroam or as a grouped convoy co op mode with random lobbies or friends you invite ahead of time online racing when you re playing against upto 11 other players no bots in typical fashion racing for xp and money in game currency called cr for short community made tracks this is where the real fun begins especially if you re a member of a group that delivers high quality custom tracks these tracks can have any theme in them like high low performance cars any road type etc auction house you can buy and sell cars in an auction with other players forza official radio stations with genres like edm pop music hip hop rock and lots of latina based music community livery and tunes you can create and share your own car tunes and liveries and take others from the community database countless other minigames like capture the flag zombies super7 custom objective based challenges and even a full scale battle royale mode my gamertag is avees128 so check out my custom tracks tunes if you feel like it game versions and dlc expansions which to buy this game has 3 versions standard deluxe and premium in general you should only be thinking to buy either the standard or the premium version as the deluxe only gives the base game and car pass which is a free access to a bunch of some other cars you could eventually get in game anyway without paying for that game version the premium version of the game also adds some other meaningless car packs and more importantly 2 expansion maps now you could see the fairly negative reviews these 2 expansions hot wheels and rally adventure have on steam and this is because the reviewers have compared these dlc s to the dlc s from the past fh games which were objectively superior to these current ones in most ways do you care about hot wheels at all if no skip it are you a rally fanatic if no then skip this one as well imo these 2 dlc s dont give an enjoyable content and im not even a fan of hw nor rally especially when being compared to the past dlc s from fh4 personally played and loved every inch of it and fh3 have not played at all but i only hear positive things about it and its dlc s which ironically one of them was hw performance i have a ryzen 9 5900x amd rx 5700xt when testing the built in benchmark a year ago i was getting the following results 1080p high 113 fps1080p ultra 79 fps1440p high 99 fps1440p ultra 69 fps nice upscaling fsr dlss in this game is really bad both for amd and nvidia tech so avoid these if you can i cant comment on ray tracing since i cant run any rt features with my gpu but from what i can tell its minimal rt at best which also means minimal performance drops the game really loves smart access memory rebar so make sure you have it enabled if you can for a great fps boost of about 20 in conclusion the game itself is great and is a legit time sink for better and for worse but if you re not engaged in a welcoming community it will be a relatively short amount of time 50 100ish hours till you ll feel exhausted from the endless grind of everything so bare that in mind if you re unsure if this game fits your flavor of racing game i would either opt for the standard version or just try it out via gamepass and see how it feels like just note that there are no cross saves between the ms store platform and steam so you will need to start over if you re switching between versions
