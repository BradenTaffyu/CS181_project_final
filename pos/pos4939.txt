2023 late review for an old game ik but this game is simply amazingi ll list all the pros and cons down herepros 1 near infinite amount of open world content which you can enjoy while not even playing through the story or any main questline2 huge modding community that cranks the gaming experience to beyond maximum3 interactive and overall entertaining open world questlines4 looks incredibly amazing with some great gunplay5 pro for some fallout fans who have played fnv or f3 the power armour is incredible as it makes you feel like you re walking in a massive humanoid tank which gives a completely unique experience different from that of the other fallout gamescons 1 highly unoptimised i m a laptop user and was unable to run the game at 30 fps without stuttering every second and crashing but luckily mods help to solve some of those issues2 the greatest staple of all fallout games bugs tons of them everywhere but just download some community made mod patches3 this may just be my opinion but i think only nuka world and far harbor were good dlcs but still weren t enough to give an amazing experience such as dlcs from previous fallout games released by bethesda such as the lonesome road dlc honest hearts dlc the pitt dlc broken steel dlc operation anchorage dlc which were all fun and interactive while also making them have a massive impact on the main storyline which i won t touch on so as to not spoil the dlcs for those who haven t played through themconclusion the game is certainly amazing with the pros outweighing the cons by a huge margin but i recommend you to just wait for a sale like every steam game if you re extremely poor like me who has no budget to buy it at base price while you could be spending that money on higher quality games that are more recent such as elden ring rdr2 etc
