2019 i have to say that at first civ6 didn t appeal to me so much the art style i found unappealing and the fog of war confusing all in all the strategic oversight was lacking because the map was filled with too much clutter with the latest dlc the game has improved significantly the weather and natural disasters are well done the one thing that bothers me still is the amount of cities that the ai churns out it becomes more of a race for settler building than anything else sometimes plus i find the ai really aggressive to the point where i lose my fun playing so i still am undecided as to wheither i like the game sometimes i am enjoying it immensely but often only to be frustrated again by aforementioned problems still the fog of war bothers me in my oversight in the way that it is displayed so i wish i could change the way the fog of war looks it is a mighty game still but i can t help but feel it could have been so much better still
