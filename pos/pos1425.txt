2015 early access review project zomboid this game is about surviving in a zombie apocalypse in rural kentucky and you are tasked with doing it alone or with a friend in the very rare pc local multiplayer i would mention the online multiplayer but this game requires fast reactions in order to stay alive and i can t find a server with a decent ping to save my life as it were this game has many realistic elements about it such as exertion injury that halts all progress panic as a game mechanic zombies hearing your footsteps and following noise sight and smell and perhaps my favourite touch of realism the inability to see all around you at once you need to rely solely on your senses in order to gauge the number of zombies currently breaking down your door and surrounding your base there s no minimap with radar you just need to run out and hope for the best another great element of this game is that it is permadeath which in case you are a dunce means that when you die you re in sandbox which i heartily recommend over survival as you can tweak the settings after you die you respawn in another random location in your spawn town and have to work your isometric ass off to get back to your base and rebuild your skills one large issue with the game right now which will in fact be fixed is that the world is rather lonely there are currently no other npc s to hang about with the biggest flaw of the game is that once you have nailed the perfect farming cycle got all the guns and fortified yourself to the point that a nuke couldn t dislodge you there s nothing left to do you re done at that point i mean if you set the zombies to never respawn i guess you could clear out all of the zombies in the game but that accomplishes nothing at the end of the day some might say that you could explore the vast map and look for all the best items but you don t really need to if you use the pz crash map like i did finding your way around is no longer a challenge now i know that i shouldn t have used the map but i thought it made the game more realistic i mean i know my city very well i know where things are and even if i didn t i could simply raid a gas station and get a map so overall this game is worth dumping your time into it s a great zombie survival game and i personally think that it is underrated i am still super amped to have vehicles and npc s but that s not happening for a while get this game 8 7 10
