2020 man oh man i m in love with this game however i m not so in love with the developers and gaijin itself thems greedy bastards keep releasing op at top tier which happens to be my new milestone for the game after a year ish of grinding although it doesn t show in my in game hours mainly because i had played most of it on a separate account the game s tons a fun with friends and especially if you and them have good chemistry and coordinate well teamwork can literally change the entire outcome of an already lost match as it happened with me and one of my friends last night sure the game has a few minor and severe bugs here and there and the devs may take their time patchin em up but eh i won t suck on gaijin s toes at all i just like what they did with their game graphical wise it s very nice you don t require a beefy as setup to run this game at a nice n steady framerate but if you re a total graphics nerd then yeah you will indeed need one though as i mentioned before the fact that they keep adding more and more op vehicles at top tier is just bad horrible way too greedy it is because of things like those that i recommend that once y all reach br 6 0 6 7 to stay there because past that point gets real bumpy and almost p2w not gonna lie tho some of the lower tier vehicles are also op as but not as broken as top tier ones so uh yeah if you were to give this game a shot you gotta take into account that it ll take you quite sometime to grind out each tank airplane naval vessel unless you sell your soul to gaijin don t expect the best of teammates especially if you play past midnight experienced players sealclubbing at lower tiers may spawn camp you from your very first match if you don t play well it will literally take you days to research a single component for each of your vehicles having said so many negative things about the game well it makes me wonder why on earth i keep playing it and the answer to that is well i enjoy this game i simply do maybe i m a masochist god knows hope this review was sorta helpful
