early access review i can see this becoming my favorite farming sim the positives the characters are an absolute delight when talking to someone about the game and cast i quickly realized i was speaking about them as if they were close to real people in the sense of they ve got so much personality a variety of interest and particular dislikes and they actively engage with each other the nights visiting the inn are my favorite to watch everyone interact with each other and keeping up with the story lines that happen there these characters know each other live along side each other and they act like it you can access a kitchen construction table and blacksmithing table right away until you can buy them for your farm as someone who loves hoarding cooking items to make meals for mysel for to make money i absolutely love this feature the bulletin boards are things i barely engaged with in other games as i saw no worthwhile reward in it for me when i can usually talk and gift give to build up relationship status however this game gives me incentive as there are tools gear recipies and other goodies i m actually wanted behind them it makes me want to go to the board each day to see what i can find quests also have no time limit the museum is huge and best part it has a tracker items that can be turned in have a checkbox next to how much it sells for and if it s checked you know you already turned it in if it doesn t you can turn it in and if there is no marker or box at all then you know it doesn t need to go that far to check this is incredible you can change your character s clothes hair eye color name accessories pronouns and farm name any time you want this is a qol feature i had modded into sdv and i m so happy this is just in base game there are so many accessories to decorate yourself the cast is diverse in both color body types and personality which is beyond a breath of fresh air no one feels like a token either people come in all kinds of ways and it s nice having a game that reflects that while having people just simply be people with their own likes dislikes hobbies and more the tutorials are not invasive and easy to understand should you select them actually reading dialogue the characters speak to you gives you additional insight on the games mechanics to assistance in likes and dislikes the cons thus far the days feel a bit too short but this may be due to the fact i am only in summer perhaps i will get a mount later like a horse or get tools to get things done faster so i have more time in my day but early game if i have to turn around because i forgot something at my farm i feel punished by a few hours for it my game did crash once and i had to redo the game again that has not happened sense but just be cautious when going to bed i recommend saving at night before bed just in case the dialogue of my character does feel out of place and admittedly corny at times which is a stark contrast to the npc s there was one instance when speaking to the doctor i didn t like either option of dialogue choice because they felt rude and nosy and when i selected the option that felt less intrusive woe and behold i was asked to please keep my questions to my own concerns which is what i would ve rather done but i was given no choice i wish my own character had just better dialogue options other than being a go getter or being ignorantly rude or ditzy a concern i have is the longevity of a save file with seeming to have an msq to follow i wonder how the devs intend to keep players coming back to the same file once the msq is wrapped up i very much desire things to be done at end game but it is far too early to tell such things yet i am excited to see how this game continues to develop to what it will be like when released into 1 0 there is plenty to do in early access and i believe it is worth the buy if you enjoy farming sim games that have strong characters with a community to enjoy being in i am currently at the end of summer at the time of writing this review and wanted to spend a fair amount of hours within it i do a handful of things while gaming and accidentally leave it up sometimes when afk so 40 isn t my actual playtime to give it a fair evaluation so much love and care and attention to detail was put into this game and i am invested excited for its 1 0 potential
