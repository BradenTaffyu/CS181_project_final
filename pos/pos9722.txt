2023 be me finally get a good run going far enough to f ck around a fair bit with prosthetics realize using my extremely basic critical thinking skills that i can use a joywire and a psychic harmonizer to make a colonist that exudes nothing but happy vibrations to help my colony also realize that joywire f cks up the colonist to the point where they re completely useless decide that when the next raid comes i ll try take a prisoner to use as my guinea pig for my experiment proceed to wait like 15 f cking decades because randy doesnt want to send me a raid when i actually want one when it comes i capture a guy with the abandoned child back story and turn him into a slave its showtime i preform all the operations on him and now this poor poor soul who has more than likely never had a nice day in his life has now been reduced to a mere mood booster for my colony he walks around without a care in the world like some kind of human pet basking in forced pleasure too euphoric to think of his situation clearly realize the gravity of what i have done start wondering if a man who has been reduced to a happy idiot via brain implant truly lives a happy lifewho the f ck needs to do a college course on philosophy when this game exists this sh t destroys your moral fibre
