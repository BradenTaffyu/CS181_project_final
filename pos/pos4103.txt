2019 tl drget this if you like games that use cards for moves you like games that are easy to pick up but hard to master you don t mind butting your head against an rng until you figure things out don t get this if you want complete freedom to tinker with your deck you want every playthrough to have an obvious way to win you re easily frustrated by randomness how do you slay a spire anyway slay the spire is a randomized dungeon crawler i won t call it a roguelike since it lacks too many elements of a traditional roguelike for that where you fight using cards which you obtain with one encounter at a time this is not a deck builder where you re free to pick and choose the cards you re going to use throughout the rest of a run each defeated enemy gives you an option of three random cards of which you are free to pick one or none which is often the better choice besides fighting enemies there are also random events that can give you cards and shopkeepers that give you the option of purchasing cards or removing a card as well as pick up helpful other items at first sight it may seem like this means you re completely at the mercy of the rng and a common complaint of new players is that the game serves up impossible situations but it s more subtle than that the choice of what cards to pick and what cards to leave is still up to you as is the encounters you choose on your path and over time you ll learn various archetypes and card synergies that will make or break a deck slay the spire is big on the metagame it s not so much about how you use the individual cards tactics but how you ve learned to build decks out of them strategy experienced players can make almost any run work but expect to invest a lot of hours if you want to become one of those players to give you an idea i m far from an expert myself and after 165 hours of playtime i barely win 1 in 6 runs whereas pros can actually boast a win streak slay the spire is not for everyone it has a seductively quick loop where every run takes at most an hour giving that just one more run feeling every time you die horribly halfway but that s all the reward it ll give you early on there are some cards and relics that will unlock but after that you re only in it to win it and winning it requires that you enjoy looking back on what you did wrong so you can improve next time or else you ll just be left cursing the rng and how things just aren t fair if sinking a lot of hours into carefully refining long term strategies for winning a game sounds like fun to you slay the spire may be just the thing if you want a card game where you build decks in complete freedom or something that offers immediate gratification you may want to look elsewhere as for recommending it that s easy i first saw people streaming playthroughs of the game and after getting annoyed at seeing them make bad plays i knew i had to try it myself now i can make bad plays and lose on my own this is the first and to date only game i ve bought in early access and it s been more than worth it
