wont waste time detailing how much the hate towards this game at launch was deserved just here to judge the game as is now it s alright i ll parrot the same sentiment that others have about steam s review system i wish there was a meh option instead of a thumbs up down best to get it on sale it usually runs really cheap the game is pretty much in the same vein of fallout 4 only with a multiplayer adjacent aspect you re essentially just playing a single player game with social elements they ve back peddled on the whole notion of no human npcs by adding factions and have also gradually introduced expeditions bethesda s unique take on the mmo dungeons though you can tackle them alone as with many multiplayer additions to the game bugs existing since fallout 3 are somehow still present hilariously as if you couldn t fathom how much lower on the incompetency scale they could drop bethesda does not fail to deliver atomic shop while not pay to win is slightly predatory with it s pay for convenience model you get plenty of atoms this game s micro transaction currency through normal play but eventually that resource runs dry which brings me to fallout 1st this game s subscription model and yes you read that right a subscription model in a fully priced game with a micro transaction shop fallout 1st includes a monthly allotment of atoms on top of a scrap box ammo box and a survival tent things not present in the base game while not necessary they do leave a sour taste when you find yourself victim to the bethesda s we ll invent a problem to sell you the solution approach to game design these days don t feel too bad on skipping out on this one but don t knock on it too much it may not be a no man s sky level of redemption but it s clear the game has had some time to really tackle some of it s glaring problems at launch as of writing this bethesda also announced a battle pass lol
