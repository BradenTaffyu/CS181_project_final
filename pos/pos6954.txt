2019 early access review 13 hours in i have built everything explored every major island done everything there is to do in the game the mechanics graphics atmosphere crafting etc are all pretty good but the game is just barebones at this point this is obviously to be expected in ea just want to make potential purchasers aware that you are buying a game with less than 20 hours of content and no end game content in sight edit revisited this in chapter 2 and a lot more content has been added i will say that playing solo is very tedious and not nearly as enjoyable as playing multiplayer highly recommended multiplayer
