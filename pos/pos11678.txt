2013 early access review don t listen to anyone saying this game is broken or full of glitches i was one of the skeptical ones reading mostly the negatives over the postives of getting this game but the urge to play every time i watched the video was too much so i bought it best decision i ever made i played 6 5hrs straight into the early am only problem i have seen so far is when you try to break something your marker sometimes isn t always correct and you end up breaking a torch behind you instead of the wall infront of you this game zombies are still gps d you have you not watched the gameplay video zombies hear see and smell think about it for a second then say you were wrong zombies are meant to be that way also to make this game more realistic i turned off running zombies on the settings giving you a more the walking dead kind of zombies which is what i believe to be the real zombies this game is beautiful and what is still to come is so exciting get the game
