2018 early access review the game tells a great and realistic nevertheless hilarious story the player gets immersed into the life in countryside in finland in all it s beauty in all it s pain it s not only a driving simulator it s a car owning simulator with it s full depth from tuning the rockershaft to passing out drunk actually the game feels like it s built around drunk you get to buy alcohol make alcohol sell alcohol get paid with alcohol the game does a great job at being realistic in this aspect it also does a great job at showing the survival side of life satire of the game is on the next level even though the game is based on a finnish environment it is very plain thanks to english translation by the developer overall the game s world at times feels barely distinguishable from reality my summer car is built on unity game engine and has the simplest graphics that can be made however it feels atmospheric and not out of place simple graphics is also understandable due to an extremly small developer team even though the game s graphics looks extrmely cheap the my summer car looks beautiful and deeply detailed the car simulation in my summer car is worth an award the depth of car building is something you won t ever see anywhere else the game simulates every single part of not only the engine but the whole car transmission chassis wheels body you name it you ll have to build the car from bottom up control liquids battery charge change broken parts etc another challenge is visual damage as you get to drive a car from 1972 it s very fragile the amount of country roads makes it extra difficult to keep the car in perfect condition that leads us to car control and physics i personally had no idea that such an amasing physics cheme could be build on unity engine vehicles in game feel extremely realistic which makes offroading and rally challenging though fun the game is super cheap though deep and wide amis tech games did a great job and the game is absolutely worth buying
