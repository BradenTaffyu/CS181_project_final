i am obsessed with this game i love it so much when my sims game broke my husband suggested this for my new fixation and i ended up logging 90 hours in just a couple of weeks its hard but in a fun way its got random acts of nonsense and the pawns do things that make me shout why it is the best you get to build camps watch them be destroyed hope enough people survive to rebuild and start over its fantastic i also really enjoy the dlc and mods available but the vanilla game is still super enjoyable oh but if you play don t name the characters or animals after anything anyone you know and love you will end up crying
