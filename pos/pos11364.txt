2019 early access review alpha 18 is a major improvement to the game and brings back the fun that i enjoyed when i played a while back looting is way more rewarding you no longer need to spend ton of points in the intelligence tree and there are no longer an army of undead in tiny houses the beginning feels a lot better now that stamina cost had been reduced there just so many changes and good things done with this alpha 18 for me to cover i felt like giving game a thumbs up after seeing what alpha 18 has to offer on experimental if you given game thumbs down because of alpha 17 please reconsider it with a18 changes i really want to support the devs here because they got a fun game here and are making the right decisions with a18 me thinks
