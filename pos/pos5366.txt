2018 early access review i m not generally one to play games or even to write reviews but on this occasion i ll make an exception because this game is something quite fantastic to be clear this is the polar opposite of bejeweled or temple run if your style is for quick and casual games do not buy caves of qud although there is still quite a bit of temple running you can do in this game but i digress probably this game appeals more to those who enjoy the intellectual rather than the visceral although you will still have a lot of laughs i hope this review proves helpful to those considering purchasing caves of qud i highly recommend it the worldcaves of qud probably fits most into the post apocalyptic science fiction genre with a good touch of the absurd the world and descriptions are well written even poetical at times the world has been fairly ruined and salt dunes scatter the earth mutant creatures roam for prey plants and animals have become sentient the world is factionalized cybernetic and mutant humans dislike each other giant albino cave bears are at the forefront of technology sandworms roam the deserts plants have allied together except for fungi which they unfairly exclude every creature in qud has a faction and each faction has its own likes and dislikes of other factions the map itself is staggeringly vast and is different each time you play so you will have vastly different encounters the factions are not static either you can befriend or try to befriend different factions by giving gifts or water for example ruins scatter the map which you can stumble upon and find anything from angry sawtooth robots who will hunt you down to sentient doors who welcome your arrival then there s the underground the tunnels and rooms and who knows what else under qud as far as you can explore on the surface you can also go down as far as interacting with the world goes it is very interactive you can pick up a box of crayons and draw on walls you can equally pick up a flamethrower and melt those walls because everything has a melting point the tar wells for instance if there you poorly place a campfire to cook dinner it may set off a chain reaction that will have the entire screen filled with nothing but smoke and fire or if your enemies are stuck in the tar perhaps light and run gameplaythis is a game so i figure this section is probably necessary caves of qud is a turn based game where you move and then everyone else moves fighting will pit your armor weapons strengths etc against that of your enemies with some randomness in the dice roll but there are so many tactics to use that it s not just what level am i against them even with the sword you can lunge be on the defensive or aggressive leap attack them etc or use your time manipulation powers to slow them down or be superman and fly with laser eyes or tell your pet goat to attack in the same way your opponent has a fully simulated inventory and abilities not infinite powers aside from the fighting there is a great deal of exploring to do looking for quest items navigating ruins or the underground trading upgrading eqiuipment there is the tinkering skill which will let you learn how to make items from scratch such as automatic turrets or the many villages will often want to employ you to retrieve their prized doorhandle or such from a fiend who stole it there is a main plot arc to follow but you can diverge at any point and do whatever you want to do or ignore the story entirely the quests are challenging and very different to one another if you contract a sickness you will need to find ingredients for the cure and before that you will need to find the cure itself there are almost uncountable items from rifles and bows to solar powered batteries and grenades also there is a wide variety of food and cookery available and to learn such as the prized 1000 taco suprema then you have folding lawn chairs to sit on bracelets to trade with containers to carry water oil tar or lava almost everything interacts it is a difficult game but this is a good thing as it means you can start out small and as you get better can progress to farther parts of the world and the plot it is a roguelike and this means that each time you die you start a new game and character the learning curve is quite high so make sure you follow an online guide when starting that said once you understand the basics which is where a guide is necessary the game opens up for you video soundi think this is important because many games are purchased for their high end graphics caves of qud has much more stylized and retro graphics where each character item etc is represented by a tile don t let the graphics put you off they all make sense when you know what they are i would go far as to say the lack of graphics makes some of the interactions in the game so imaginative and humorous but if you need everything rendered this is not your game you can also look at each tile and have it described to you if it s going to be a problem there are free graphics mods available that will change the look of the game you can also mute the game music and play your own soundtrack if it s not to your liking i do humorthis is by far one of the most humorous games i have played and for this reason deserves its own section the world itself is quite amusing especially reading chronologies where one ruler fought another ruler because she slandered her pet dog or because they could not agree on the eating of starapples or such then you have falling in love with yourself because you drank love potion or a sentient sign telling you to go away because it doesn t like you or your evil twin appearing from nowhere and being caught in the crossfire between warring apes and hyena things or if you would rather be a fish you may or grow several arms and wield four swords convince a pack of elk to join your cause and fight alongside them discover that baboons hate the issachari tribe because one of them put a plastic tree in their sacred well then you have all the fights the game will bring not bejeweledin summary if you enjoy a good strategy game humor and a very in depth world to explore and fight in and don t mind the difficulty caves of qud is worth purchasing sale or not
