2018 i had a rough month with anxiety and playing stardew really helped relax me and get me through the rough patches it gives you something to focus on a goal to work towards my only complaint is that the dialogue at the festivals don t change from year to year actually much of the day to day dialogue repeats itself there are a lot of lovable characters but even after getting their stars up they say the same thing they said to me on week one when i pass them on the street i d also like to see added items at shops and festivals from year to year but it s a nice game to get lost in anyway
