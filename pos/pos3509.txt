2015 most laughs per dollar spent i had in years addictive soundtrack with distinctive themes flowey also an interesting battle system firstly because of the you don t actually have to kill anyone part turning each new enemy into a puzzle waiting to be solved if you wish to handle things peacefully secondly due to the bullet hell inspired defending turn you d think it would get stale eventually but subsequent enemies and bosses introduce new patterns and twists that keep it fresh thorough the game graphics are clearly the bare minimum they do however do the job when it comes to accurately presenting characters personalities and emotions so there s that most likely a personal goty 2015 but don t just take my word for it when i recommend it instead check out the free demo undertale com for yourself it s pretty much the first chapter of the full game taking about half an hour to finish if you ll like it you owe yourself to get the game as it s basically much more of the same type of amusing experience
