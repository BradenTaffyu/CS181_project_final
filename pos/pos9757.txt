2017 early access review the short of it don t let the early access tag put you off rimworld is as good as finished but still expanding and it s an engrossing and captivating colony sim a labour of love that offers hours upon hours of playtime and is a must buy for people who enjoy building a community from the ground up and watching it thrive in the face of adversity or wither and die because of a few poor decisions the long of it rimworld puts the player in charge of a few crash landed settlers stranded on an unknown world after their ship crashed because of course it did after the player makes sure the colonists immediate needs are met such as food and shelter the real work commences and in order for the colony to survive it will have to evolve expand and research as well as trade with neighbouring settlements for the resources it desperately needs or desperately defend against them what sets rimworld apart from other colony sims is its colonist system colonists are all unique and the player will have to make sure to keep an eye on what they re good at what they like and don t like and which colonists need to be around or avoid each other occasionally enemy factions will attempt to raid your settlement and you will need to keep evolving in order to withstand their ever strengthening attacks meanwhile your colonists will be busy crafting items constructing buildings tending to the animals hewing stone researching new technologies sowing the fields hauling lumber and countless other tasks which they execute more or less automatically according to the priorities you give them a player who sets his priorities carefully can take up a monitoring function as the colonists take care of everything that needs doing if s he decides to the right of it rimworld has many very strong features and one of them is the personalities it gives to your colonists they are semi randomly generated with a diversity of looks skills and traits making them all unique and possessing an actual personality and they develop social relations with other colonists sometimes good sometimes bad and these social relations can lead everywhere from joining another colonist in marriage to starting a fistfight at someone else s marriage keeping them all happy is involving without ever becoming a chore and you just can t help but care about every single one rimworld s gameplay is very solid and the priorities and areas function lets you automate work but still gives you a lot of control eliminating the tedious parts of managing a colony but keeping the interesting ones you can manually command colonists whenever you want or even take full control of them when you need to give them detailed orders for instance when they need to defend against a raid even better while rimworld is by itself already very polished the game is fully modular with an active modding scene which constantly delivers all kinds of content ranging from small quality of life tweaks to big content adding mod packs another nice touch is that instead of simply choosing from a shortlist of cookie cutter difficulty levels like easy medium hard rimworld also offers you several narrators to choose from who don t really make the game harder or easier but different and yes the narrators too can be altered or expanded upon by mods tynan sylvestre and ludeon studios regularly update the game often incorporating mods or acknowledging their ideas and including them in the base game and so far it seems like the influx of content both official and from the modding community is showing no signs of stopping anytime soon the wrong of it there is really very very little that is wrong with rimworld but the one thing that i did notice was that in the late game you re often forced to remain mostly static as you wait for opportunities to get a hold of some of the resources you can t grow or craft yourself like plasteel and uranium and that s a bit of a shame but honestly even static time in rimworld is enjoyable the last of it rimworld is well deserving of all the gushing reviews it s one of those rare jewels an indie game crafted by a developer who kept going strong and never lost interest in the project made with pure love for the craft it really is one of those games you sit down to play just for a half hour and before you realize it it s three in the morning your tea is cold and payment of your taxes is four weeks overdue
