2018 this game is honestly my most favourite game of all time it s amazing for calming me when i m anxious or upset and my friends constantly complain about how obsessed with it i am as an autistic person i can definitely see this game being well recieved by autistic children as there are clear rules and logic of the world as well as many characters to get attached to if your child likes games like minecraft they will definitely enjoy this even if you aren t a child this game is still very fun as an adult it always suprises you with new things and does not spoonfeed you how to play you learn through experience and experimenting i have never needed a tutorial for this game yet i constantly find new things every day about it i cannot reccomend this game enough it s a brilliant game for everyone
