2019 this game is a profound exploration of the human condition it s a game that asks us to confront the harsh realities of life in a post apocalyptic wasteland but it also offers us hope and the possibility of redemption now some might say that new vegas is just another violent video game but i argue that it s much more than that it challenges us to make difficult moral choices do we side with the tyrannical caesar s legion or the corrupt new california republic do we help the struggling communities of the wasteland or do we pursue our own selfish interests these are tough questions my friends but they re questions that we must ask ourselves in our own lives too the game forces us to confront our own values and to think deeply about what kind of person we want to be and the characters let me tell you they re some of the most well written and complex characters you ll find in any video game they re flawed they re human and they re struggling to survive in a world that s gone mad but they re also capable of great heroism and great compassion so if you re looking for a game that s more than just mindless violence i highly recommend fallout new vegas
