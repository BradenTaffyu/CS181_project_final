2020 your merry first tycoon one could argue that a tycoon game about creating a chain of private healthcare facilities is in a bit of a bad taste a notion two points studio tackled with a peculiar sense of humour leaving the somber reality of healthcare behind to instead pursue cartoonish visuals and cheesy jokes the caricature is not only the game s most defining trait it also contributes to a truly soothing and heart warming title welcome to two point hospital a place where having kitchen utensils stuck on your head is called a pan demic and cured with a giant magnet starting small two point hospital is a game that gradually grows on you both in terms of gameplay and atmosphere the campaign starts slow with the first few hospitals dedicated foremost to learning basic gameplay mechanics which you will then need to use all at once further down the line while playing these tutorial levels i was surprised by how flexible everything in two points is at any point of the game you are free to move replace or rotate any items and even the entire rooms granted you have sufficient space to do so it is possible to move the entire wing of the hospital to another would you like to build a nice looking hospital but you are afraid it won t meet the practical objectives of the level no problem you are free to remodel the entire facility once it has earned enough you might want to get a wider set of items first beside mundane money two points also has kudosh a currency that allows the player to unlock aesthetic and practical additions to the hospital kudosh is scarce early on so it is advised to prioritise hand sanitizer and treatment books over the dragon statue the primary source of kudosh are the hospital stars and career goals e g promote 100 doctors and later your hospital can generate them too at first the mechanic serves as means of visible campaign progress though the longer you play the more kudosh unlocks fade into the background the currency is also related to the limited multiplayer capability of two points hospital you are allowed to challenge your friends for hospital performance e g most money made in 180 days or contribute to community spanning research project where all two points players are required to perform specific actions to unlock new items for all the participants a really nice community building touch if nothing else reach for the stars to give you a more immediate idea of progress every hospital is rated with stars a maximum of 3 to earn these each facility has tailored objectives on the early stages they are mostly related to specific sicknesses or mechanics introduced at the given level once the 3 stars rating prerequisite is met the level is considered maxed out though mostly there is plenty of room left for the player to linger the opposite is also possible if you find a level particularly tedious progress can be made after reaching only 1 star beside level objective each part of the county has its own gimmick some parts are cold others are hot and yet another is plagued by a steady stream of natural disasters does it suffice to provide genuine diversity in the opinion of yours truly it s a nice touch but an insufficient one and you would have to pick up one of the dlcs for something properly inventive on the up side there are quite a lot of illnesses in two points and not until about 70 of the campaign will it run out of new tricks remarkably fitting summary a screenshot of two point hospital by alvarion in order to match the relaxing quality of the game tutorial levels really do go easy on the player and frankly the early lack of difficulty goes to the point of being deceiving i picked up a few bad building habits there realising only much later that perhaps i did get my completion stars but those hospitals were quite bad alas roughly at the half point of the campaign is where the greatest challenge of two points appears the transition from making a cosy hospital to one that doesn t go bankrupt the game does get more challenging in time and especially some of the 3 stars ratings can be tricky to get and require double the amount of time it took to get the first 2 stars that said once you get a proper grasp of the game s economy and rather simplistic yet very necessary micro management you are free to build as you please cheesy gobbins the joking tone of the game simply cannot be overstated two points hospital s brand of humour definitely isn t for everyone to be honest it wasn t my pair of shoes either still there is some undeniable endearing quality to it and as the time passed it simply grew onto me cheesy jokes encompass every part of the game the illnesses wacky treatment machines ghosts vacuumed by janitors down to minute details such as names of the songs there is a brilliant consequence to it all though the definite highlight of the game is the two points radio being a tycoon game two point hospital takes a while to beat the campaign especially that there is hardly anything about this game that would prompt you to hurry quite the opposite during these long hours two point radio becomes a perfect companion not only serving suitably cheery tunes but also delivering 3 lovable radio jockeys be it ostensibly posh sir nigel bickleworth upbeat ricky hawthorn or paranoid harrison wolff each character breaks the monotony with their seemingly endless radio entries it would appear as if every map had its own set of auditions and they don t ever seem to repeat two points radio comes complete with jingles and advertisements equally absurd as the rest of the game while the music is somewhat limited it is believable local radio station and possibly my favourite part of the game two the point being a newcomer to the tycoon genre i enjoyed two point hospital as a refreshing change of pace if you have a taste for slow burn forms of passing time this is a great way to ease the mind after a busy day at work that said i believe that veterans of the genre will find two point to be too easy and simplistic the ai of both workers and employees is quite dull and most of the micro management in the game goes towards preventing people from roaming too much there is a rather odd survival style mode where the patients try to overwhelm your hospital in waves but this is as far as challenges go on a similar note those among you used to playing high paced action titles should only approach this game if you look for a vastly different experience all in all two points hospital was a highly pleasant time rather than being a satisfying car chase scene the game is an equivalent of a warm blanket and cup of coffee on a rainy day do give it a try
