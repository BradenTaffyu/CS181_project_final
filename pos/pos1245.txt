2017 early access review this game defines zombie survival it s amazing it s unbelievable at first i was sort of thinking the game would be another meh game but boy was i wrong this game isn t even finished and you can do so much it is just like surviving in a world of zombies with cars and new animations on the way i can tell you i can t wait for the final version of this game at first you learn the basics and later on you get better and don t die in one day over time you start building and discovering new things you didn t know were even in the game this game is the most realistic and most fun game i have bought the multiplayer never seems to disconnect me either like other games getting together to survive is the best expeirence i ve had ever playing games in my life so far
