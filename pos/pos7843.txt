2021 early access review absolutely fun game if you think that you can only do crashing and stuff like that then you are wrong they are multiple stuff to do like scenarios racing download mods and there is even a online where you could play with your friends trust me if you think this game is bad then make photo s and show it to your friends just like how i do if i am bored grind out achievements in scenarios and just do whatever you want to do in with this game it s your game you bought it but trust me when this game gets career mode that s going to get my interest even more high on this game honestly i give this a 8 10 not that a bad of a game
