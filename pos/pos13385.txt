kerbal space program is a spaceflight simulator game it s based off of realistic physics so the gameplay is very challenging when starting if you can actually learn how to play the game it s very rewarding however at its core its a spaceflight simulator not a space exploration game sure you can land on planets and moons but once you re there there s not much to do besides enjoy the view mods helps either way it s a fun game that i ve spent a ridiculous amount of time learning the gameplay mechanics to would recommend
