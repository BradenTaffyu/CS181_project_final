europa universalis iv is old yet it has also been constantly worked on since its release with dozens of dlc stacked onto an ancient engine held together by hopes and dreams there s a massive learning curve and many obscure sometimes janky features to learn about there are some annoyances like rng sieges to name one example but overall it s a game i love greatly there s a certain magic to it that i find hard to describe once you get the hang of its mechanics seeing your small or big country reach new heights feels tremendously rewarding one nugget of advice i offer to any player new or experienced is to pace yourself you can snowball very fast once you start winning removing all challenges by the time you reach the year 1600 or so with no adversaries that can match you your enjoyment will decrease real fast because there will be no natural narrative of struggle and victory take things slow every now and then focusing on the economy and peace instead of rampant warmongering and colonisation and you ll find the game a lot more enjoyable as a whole rather than just in the early stages
