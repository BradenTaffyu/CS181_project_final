objectively the best game i ve ever bought it might be expensive with every dlc but as many others have said it s absolutely worth it you re getting way more than you ve paid for you want to play as goody two shoes ranchers you can want to roleplay a cannibal genetically and cybernetically augmented samurai dynasty go for it maybe you want to play as puritan slave runners this game has got you covered you can engage with absolutely every element of the game building a robot army ranching selling drugs raiding containing demons from outer dimension cyborgs gene tailoring warhammer psy magic etc at the same time or focus on something particular and build your colony around one two aspects this game is truly endless it took me over 1000 hours to beat it for the first time don t look at my steam hours i ve played the game on gog before buying a second copy on steam and even then i only got one of 4 endings if you can t afford or don t want to buy all dlcs at least buy biotech as it adds the most content another huge perk of this game is its mod friendliness now don t got downloading hundreds of mods right off the bat play at least two three times before getting into modding
