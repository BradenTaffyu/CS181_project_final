2018 hgtv dlc reviewgarden flipper reviewhouse flipper starts off slow until you upgrade your equipment and skills then it s a lot faster except for tiling this game may not be for everyone especially if you hate cleaning because that s how you start making money for buying houses to fix and sell them this game reminded me of viscera cleanup detail with how it plays except for the blood and gore and all the crazy stuff that you re cleaning up in that game instead of that you get to clean and design homes which is actually more relaxing than viscera cleaup detail and that s saying a lot for me it almost feels like the sims in first person because you get to custom build so much except more hands on in this game and i love the sims i like this game because i love interior design plus helping people find their dream home it is really relaxing and the thrill of smashing walls is so much fun being able to see a mess tear down what you don t like or need and then build something beautiful is very rewarding and addictive you can be creative and have fun because this is a game so you can just go crazy and enjoy if you hate cockroaches you can always change them to glass in the settings so this is a great thing because i am not a fan of bugs i don t like that when you design a house for a specific client even if you add things they do not want or like in a home no matter how hard you try for that one client the other clients are just greedy i would like for there to be an option to pick specific clients you want to sell to i don t mind the auction house but when you re trying to get an achievement it is kind of annoying so not being able to choose clients specifially has negative points on the game and how you do things in it it takes away from the freedom to do things how you want in a game that s supposed to be about having the freedom to choose how to do things overall it s a good game and i recommend it for those who like realistic building management sims interior design the sims and viscera cleanup detail i wish this game would also let you choose whether the person you play as was male or female it s not too much of a big deal i guess but i would prefer to play as a female character than some guy i can t relate to the character has no personality at all and it s just these two man arms i would rather play as a female character so that it can feel even more like it s me doing all the work the game already has one free dlc which was a good thing but they need to do more with these free dlc and updates gender option is one but i also would like more stuff to do like with landscaping and maybe plumbing i know for sure that i don t want to see paid dlc for stuff that should have already been in the game i would also like more furniture paint tiles and wood flooring options steam workshop would be a great idea too so people can make and upload their own stuff like how the sims 4 has mod support with custom content even though there is a lot more that can be done with this game i can easily recommend this to you if you like cleaning building designing flipping homes or just want a really relaxing game it would be very worth it for you i also review games in collaboration with abyssal ascent reviews if you liked this review and want to see more by me or other gamers please follow the curator and join its group thanks
