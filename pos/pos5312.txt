early access review this is in my top 3 favorite games ever played i was deep in the desert with limited water desperately trying to find my way back to civilization i had adventured below the ground into a desert temple and couldn t find my way back to the surface things became dire as i began encountering flame spitting bird creatures that were highly aggressive thankfully i had salvaged a decent rifle from the corpse of a deceased nomad and it was providing adequate protection from the birds although my ammunition was dwindling as i spotted a staircase my heart leapt and i headed for it but in my excitement i moved too quickly and attracted another swarm of the birds they swarmed me as i fire shots off killing one two and three of them the fourth almost killed me but i deftly shot it down with one of my last bullets a notification popped up saying that i had become inspired by the recent triumph and i was going to give my new rifle a name i was presented with many options like naming the rifle manually giving it a name from my native culture giving it a name from a random other culture or giving it a name from the culture of the fire bird which i had just slain i thought the fire birds have a culture that s incredibly interesting but of course they do what a fitting way to end this treacherous excursion i ll honor these beasts with my renewed sense of appreciation and give my rifle a name from their culture so i selected that option the rifle was automatically named cawww caw cawww caw caw and i facepalmed and had to set my computer down for a few minutes while i regained my composure
