2021 i remember putting hundreds of hours in this game when it first came out on the switch im happy to have it on pc now too this game is very close to my heart 3 my favourite thing is that it doesnt make me feel like i have to rush to get things done i can just take stuff at my own pace most of the time its great to play after a long day very easy to get sucked in also as a bi person i love that i dont have any limits to which gender i can romance everyone should try out this game
