2016 early access review if you took the brain of minecraft the legs of the walking dead the soul of left for dead and the arms of fallout new vegas and stitched them all together into a zombie frankenstein creation you get this verdict its solid but we re going to need a bit more floss and needles think the face is starting to fall off a little p s got this game when it was in early early alpha when the dogs were straight outta resident evil and the lovely spider monkey men were beginning to roam on the range and my nightmares lol exilirating times
