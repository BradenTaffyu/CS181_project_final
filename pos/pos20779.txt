the hogwarts legacy is nice game that you can spend a lot of your time on the environment is nice hogwards feels just right there s no place like hogsmead and you can t imagine how travel was inconvenient before floo powder was invented but this is not choose your own adventure the story is set in stone and your choices mostly do not matter one quest is different for every house no matter if you decide to be good and never use forbidden curses or even learning them or if you are evil and learn and use all of them constantly the story will not change you cannot do multiplayer without mods so it being like a sandbox game in hogwards setting also do not really works pets and other time related activities will not keep you occupied for long so if you are going to play it with mindset i want to be shown nice story then this game might be what you have been looking for if you are going into it with i want to choose my own story you will be disapointed i would categorize it more as open world adventure game with rpg elements then actual rpg
