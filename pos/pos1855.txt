2017 this game is certainly one of them art types also you can absolutely see it s a product of passion it was made to convey a message and make people feel the feels not to rake in some cash after seeing all of the 5 main endings you have to subsequently unlock all of them to see the true finale to the whole story they are not just 5 independent alternative endings i can say for sure that this is one of the most memorable stories i ve experienced pros rich and unorthodox story with existentialism absurdism and nihilism being the main themes which are explored a lot outstanding design levels characters ui animations weapons etc everything looks polished and smooth like it s a finished and refined product which can t be improved any further a rare occurrence these days great music no babysitting bs you don t waste time on stupid handholding tutorials and introductions prohibitive death penalties and no save load abuse very similar to souls games cool little feature with occasional camera mechanics switches sometimes it switches to top down zoom out or side view multiple cute little details and features that you just wouldn t find in conventional aaa games cons not enough difficulty levels normal is too easy hard is too hard there should be 1 more option that would be average between normal and hard technically it s not impressive just mediocre game would be better off without many of the side quests like half of them are boring and don t expand any of the game s lore at the same time side quests should either be fun or tell you something interesting or do both ideally no multiplayer and longevity it could potentially have something similar to souls multiplayer to give people a good reason to really dive into character building optimization and verse the most challenging enemies another players but there s none so as soon as you get 100 completion the game s over instead of making a thousand joke bad endings just to match every letter of english alphabet they should ve made just a few proper bad endings with a bit of cinematics and story overall it s a solid 10 10 for me
