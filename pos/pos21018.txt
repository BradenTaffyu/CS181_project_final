2022 slime rancher came into my life right when i needed it most my mother died in may 2021 and as this past may approached i thought i was handling the impending one year anniversary of her death well until suddenly my blood pressure was spiking so hard it was giving me literal chest pains and causing my heart rate to soar everything made me angry kept me stressed out and kept my bp dangerously high it turns out that was a result of a combination of my anxiety my grief over my mother and the stress in my life that sometimes felt crushing even my games caused my bp to spike and that was making me more and more depressed and then slime rancher went on sale and my best friend bought it for me and told me to try it the soundtrack was relaxing the graphics were soft and easy on the eyes and best of all there was nothing to trigger my anxiety and send my heart rate and blood pressure skyrocketing i could just play this and relax it felt like a weight had been lifted from my neck and shoulders and i felt like i could breathe for the first time in a month i m not saying this game saved my life but i am saying that it along with working with my therapist and help from my nurse practitioner helped me keep my stress levels low my blood pressure from spiking and my heart from feeling like it was about to explode if you need something fun that will help you relax and forget the stressful world around you for a while slime rancher is that game
