2021 product received for free in my opinion this is the best roguelite deckbuilder ever made and also in contention for the best roguelite ever the design of the game is close to perfect every card relic and enemy is in for a reason and serves a purpose and there s almost no additions to the game that serve to just up the item count without offering interesting playstyle consequences it s very easy to understand and yet that betrays its considerable depth and endless replayability it s very good
