2017 definitely a great game this is great for my down time and i use my steam account for the entire household and allow younger kids to play it while i am babysitting or i can just play it on the big tv screen and all the kids love it they are so happy to learn each new slime or area the bright colors to the strategy and monetary system helps the little ones learn 10 10 would buy the game again
