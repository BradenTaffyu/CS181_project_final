early access review good game if you enjoy dungeon crawling and rpg games in general gameplay loop is actually quite addictive you go in fight mobs loot stuff do quests try to get out alive make money and progress with npcs build up your character if you die in the dungeon or fail to get out for whatever reason you lose all your loot and your gear there are 3 maps that rotate every 3 mins or so with great varieties of different monsters that require different approach and gameplay and you only have enough time to explore maybe 2 or 3 rooms if you are efficient so you never really get bored all in all very awesome game unfortunately at this time i had to stop playing because of the sheer amount of bloodthirsty and toxic people that will eventually drive you away from the game you can t realistically explore the game and enjoy it to its fullest higher tier quests bossing deeper layers of dungeons unless other players let you be and or you enjoy killing others and take their stuff for yourself which i really really don t i understand that it is a pvevp game after all so it is unavoidable that you have these types of players run rampant don t get me wrong nice people are there with the general gesture of crouch spamming and yielding emoji as an universal peace sign i had a few very memorable runs where i ran into nice players and clear the dungeons and escape together but those are very rare maybe 1 player out of 20 or 30 games each game has about 10 players so the way i see it if you have to constantly try to put up with the mentioned above type of people just to enjoy an otherwise very great game then i d rather play something else still though not the dev s fault nor the game s so i ll still recommend it and give it a like but if the types of players mentioned above bothers you then you should probably steer clear because they will destroy your enjoyment and your overall experience perhaps in the future when they add a pve mode where you can enjoy the game as an online dungeon crawler with friends and strangers alike without having to deal with people but as of the time of this review there is no pve mode planned
