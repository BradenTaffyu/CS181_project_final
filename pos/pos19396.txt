2023 this one s tough great core gameplay good balance between the civs but not enough variety in units tech ages of civilizations is lacking and the built in mod support is crappy you can make a new map or release a game tuning pack that tweaks what s already there but its almost like they only want you to mod the game in a way they approve of also the strategy is pretty much the same all game walls are useless if you have one enemy trebuchet that s defended by cavalry so everyone just zerg rushes its not a civ game its tabs with more historical accuracy i ve put in my hours on this game and i m pretty much just bored of it the campaigns hold your hand way way too much and the ai goes from not doing anything in intermediate to being on par with a human on hard difficulty so there s a lack of a sweet spot there also whoever designed that the ai would just produce one big army and then spend the rest of its population cap on villagers clear cutting trees across the world needs to be fired finally why can t foresters regrow trees in history foresters re planted pretty much in every major culture since medieval times but they can t in the game because they re forcing players to play the way they invisioned the game to be played 7 10 won t go back for the dlc unless major new mechanics are introduced new civs are added and more emphasis put on actual planning of bases and not who can hoard all the minerals while zerg rushing bases with 100 spearmen or horsemen this might piss a lot of people off who like the game but it s my experience in the game
