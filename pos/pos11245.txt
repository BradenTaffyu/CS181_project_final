early access review fun game and the newest update is great restockers are finally picking up newly ordered inventory and putting the boxes in storage which takes out a lot of annoying grind you had to deal with manually every single day my biggest annoyance now is time progression the store opens every day from 8am to 9pm this is when you make your money and store points for progression this 13 hour in game time takes 7 minutes real world time after these 7 minutes it s not uncommon to spend 13 minutes waiting for your restockers to finish their job and put product back on the shelves which they have been doing from 8am to 9pm as well so basically you re just waiting for your restockers about 2 3 of your play time this is with 4 restockers hired and not even close to all products and store growth upgrades unlocked so i imagine this only getting worse they really need to add more available restockers for hire or rebalance them cause for now they seem to need 37 hours in a day to do their job
