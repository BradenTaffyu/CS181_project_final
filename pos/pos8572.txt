2017 never left a review on steam before but i was absolutely compelled to do so after playing this game it completely took me by surprise so much better and more involved than i ever expected the visuals are beyond incredible never seen an environment look so convincing and beautiful before this in my 30 years of pc gaming the realistically balanced audio just topped it off for me and i was happy with just these features but then i realised just how deep the game went in it s gameplay animal tracking mechanics are incorporated brilliantly being able to sit and wait for animals in areas likely to for them to pass through but may not necessarily do so is excellent the need for absolute quiteness and patience when sneaking up on your prey is priceless the tracks left by both you and your prey and even your online hunting friends is mind blowing i m running out of adjectives to describe how great this title is it s an experience that so few games offer and it s so refreshing to play that i m totally hooked and can t put it down even the animal population dynamically varies itself depenindg on how much hunting pressure there is in a given area absolutely incredible honestly i never really considered the idea of a hunting game hunting for animals in games like far cry never really took my fancy and i really only picked this up for the co operative component but i am so glad i did end up buying it because it s introduced me to a totally new type of sand box environement with a different focus one that s quite hard to explain and really you need to experience it for yourself to understand it s not going to be for everyone especially the younger twitch shooter generation style that s marred classic pc gaming for most of us those who play for an immersive realistic and involving experience rather than our achievement score and bragging points if you fall into the former category you owe it to yourself to pick this one up this is proper classic pc gaming at it s best don t miss out on this we need more games like it buy it now i d also like to add it s extremely sad and disappointing to see so many people here complaining about the paid dlc all the paid dlc combined cost less than my lunch today i really don t understand the mind set of those aggrieved by this especially considering how monstrously big the new dlc hunting reserve is the developers deserve the money and i have no problem handing it over it s a matter of value and this game offers a staggering amount of it compared to almost any other title i ve bought before this you should all be thanking these developers for not succumbing to the watered down mass appeal attitude that big business gaming subjects us all to on a daily basis i certainly do
