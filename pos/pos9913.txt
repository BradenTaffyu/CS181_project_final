2018 early access review i really didn t like this game when i first played it everything about it seemed like dwarf fortress but just felt smaller less complicated just worse it takes place in one height there were much fewer colonists there was just less to do sure i liked the sci fi setting and having an intuitive ui that i didn t need to google to find every niche order was nice but i simply didn t see what it could offer me that dwarf fortress didn t already do to a greater degree in 2010 so i went on with my life and i really thought that would be it with me and this game yet i don t know if it was the sci fi setting or what but i just wanted to see what i could do with it if i could escape or dominate the rimworld this time i stopped trying to play it like df where i would create a massive wealthy and prosperous colony the idea in df being that the wealth would create more immigrants and also bigger invasions basically i made my peace that this isn t really a colony builder a large camping group is more apt it s more like rust yeah you might meet one or two people that wants to join you but for the most part they want your and you better make sure you have enough firepower to keep them from getting it you have to admit it does make sense it plays dramatically different than other games where you all have the same start condition in a way that really i have only seen in rust there are some tribes that are already more advanced than you equipped with assault rifles and uzis sometimes mortars they can wreck your if you give them even grounds then there are some tribes that are significantly behind you in technology relying primarily on numbers to overwhelm your defenses this means that you have to react to and plan for a decent variety of tactical situation with a primitive cover system terrain destruction wood can be set on fire etc and a variety of weapons armor along with mood altering drugs the combat is actually quite entertaining if limited in size this is also one of the biggest advantages of the game over df the more natural animation and base makes the combat quite a bit more enjoyable to watch and play than in df but combat isn t all there is to this game there is quite a bit to the civilian aspect of rimworld first of all there is quite a large variety of materials and nuances to each activity just take farming as an example each plant has their own growing cycle their sensitivity to fertility their own season their ideal temperature etc on top of that your colonists have their very human needs that has to be managed summarized on an overarching mood meter this is actually pretty in depth and there are a lot of systems that require a long time to learn how to manage and optimize temperature comfort cleanliness beauty hunger sleep etc keep them too deprived and they might just start breaking down it will take a while to figure out all the intricacies of the system and you will need to do this while balancing against the constant threat of invasion add a primitive electrical power circuit and you got quite a lot to think about and this isn t even getting into the medical social wealth bit i think the best aspect you will really feel like you are really changing the land most of the materials you will utilize comes from the map itself so the feeling of terraforming the land to your needs is excellent it really will feel like a very different world by the time you are done with it so best game ever not so fast first of all the issues i had in the beginning are still there it s still a relatively small game in the sheer scale of it i simply don t think these small villages will ever be as impressive as a factorio base or a 200 colony df fortress not to mention the newgrounds character artstyle isn t exactly helping but there are other problems as well that started showing up deep into my playthroughs the raid system feels lacking after a while and makes you play unnaturally it s entirely dependant on random events by the storyteller that scales almost entirely on how well they think you are doing so it really doesn t matter if you got a functioning colony in the first month or an entire year or your diplomacy all that matters is what the relative value of your base is right now instead of happening within the natural logic of the world it creates a random event for you to react to it now i am not saying that every little thing in the world needs a diplomatic event random raids are fine enough but when the game crashes a spaceship on your base in the middle of an insane permadeath run it just feels like a board game woops you were playing a bit too well get nothing you can do about it really just attack units that are way out of your league and hope for the best it s extremely infuriating because there is another huge problem with the game half the characters are useless except for a couple of tasks now i actually liked the stats system originally i thought it had quite a lot of character and told the entire story of the character in a simplified way which is how stats system should work but there are quite a lot of characters that simply will refuse to work on a huge variety of tasks like you couldn t even get these to move a table from one room to the next if you whipped them to the ground it s ridiculous combine this with the random raid system where one bad roll can permanently incapacitate someone critical to your base and you have a cluster of a situation it s insane so most of the time you keep re rolling until you get just a normal person not fun and there are quite a lot of unfixable issues like this there are some good ones too drug addictions are done relatively well i mean is it so hard to believe that a ship exploring the rimworld might be mostly populated with sane functioning people with one two significant quirks at best what it should have done is create a large amount of factions and create a natural scaling system with diplomacy i have seen these worldwide factions attack with a boss with only eight people for sake why not make the boss attack a significant event in both their tactics siege and their consequences this would solve a lot of issues with the world feeling unfair and you could do this as a natural scaling difficulty system if your colony gets a certain threshold it instigates a multi faction raid from the factions around you now that s proper story telling and when you kill a faction s boss maybe the faction doesn t stay whole maybe they can fracture and you might be able to befriend one of the sects or if you have enough military force you can force people to pay you tribute there is a lot more that could be done here but wait for all that to work it needs to be a functioning colony so good game and i did have quite a lot of fun but that s ultimately what this game needs to work towards
