2019 the first time i played this game i loved it something about it was just fantastic and had me playing non stop here i am now trying to replicate that same feeling i had on my first playthrough but i just can t after your first playthrough everything becomes boring mostly the main story and it makes it hard to get through the first few hours that coupled with the fact that this games modding community is nowhere near as big as say new vegas is makes it really hard to enjoy this game a second time maybe not worth buying at full price just due to only have a base 60 or so hours of content compared to new vegas limitless hour possibility
