2013 early access review there s nothing i can say about this game that hasn t already been raved about by thousands of other people it s the most polished early access game you will ever see ksp will spoil the very concept for you because after playing it you ll think that early access is just a great way to get already awesome games at a discount no wrong the vast majority of early access games are severely underdeveloped for even a partial release and too often misrepresent how far along they are on the path to completion some of them run out of funding or enthusiasm and never even reach completion or declare mission accomplished and give you a game that falls far below the devs original expectations and ignores the community s complaints ksp makes early access into something of a joke because it s more fun and more functional than anything that electronic arts or creative assembly have released in the last 10 years yeah not even kidding when i say that ksp has been a great game that just keeps getting better and with the start of beta it just goes to another level entirely most folks would ve been happy with the game as it was a year ago but squad is still picking up more and more momentum they love their project they re good at what they do and they re incredibly responsive to the wishes of the ksp community which is exactly what early access is supposed to be about if you weren t sure from all of the modding community s input that got included in the prior patch well here s some more for you the community interaction is great from every angle really modders get the recognition they deserve average players get way more than they paid for and the devs get a game that makes everyone that much happier people here have mentioned the learning curve before and it s there but it s definitely not insurmountable i know a handful of friends who ve just tinkered with the game and gotten into low orbit around kerbin and called it a day but they re missing out on the real game each new task each new challenge requires you to master another skill in addition to properly executing everything else you ve already learned but when you finally get it right there s a sense of accomplishment that s hard to find in any other game getting into orbit changing orbits landing attempting a rendezvous intercepting a planet that ll take you 6 months just to reach once you start to string all of it together the results of your hard work speak for themselves and like lots of other folks have also said there s a great sense of accomplishment when you nail a difficult task but the real hilarity of the game comes from those moments when you get things just a little bit wrong ksp will satisfy all of your emotional needs 3but if you re more into stories here s the highlight reel from my last playthrough after they updated career mode the infamous jebediah kerman did most of my early test flights and managed to hog all of the glory not to be outdone bill kerman booked a spot to be the first kerbal to land on the mun unfortunately bill botched the landing and his pod tipped over sideways and couldn t seem to right itself now we had a problem not only was bill stranded but we hadn t yet researched a 2 command pod that would allow for a rescue team so the heroic bill kerman sat in his command pod on the surface of mun eating snacks for exactly 34 days while we built a ship big enough to take him home and got it to the landing site we all held our breath as the ship arrived and prayed that bill was still alive and had enough snacks jebediah stole the show again and came to the rescue and got bill into their 2 kerbal lander and got them back into space but then something happened they ran out of gas before they got home the lander collapsed into orbit around kerbin with enough fuel to get them off the mun but not enough to finish the job so now bill and jeb were stuck in space for another 61 days while we engineered an unmanned ship that could grab them and redirect them to kerbin s surface thankfully by now bill s snacks had been replenished from the latest rescue attempt and they hunkered down in anticipation of the final rescue attempt only it wasn t the final rescue attempt being our first effort at a rendezvous in space the unmanned ship with the grabby claw came to within 3km of bill and jeb and then rocketed straight past them into the unknown it would be almost another month before we set out again so we sent a second ship with a better grabby claw and this time we got them our two heroes were yanked from orbit and rocketed home once and for all splashing down just a short distance from where it all began this could happen to you buy it now 42 10 will definitely run out of gas again story based on real events see screenshot library for documentation
