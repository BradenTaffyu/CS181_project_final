2021 in my opinion this is a great evolution of the first game most of the pros were developed further or they didn t touch it at all and cons were redeveloped of course there are new cons like short campaign or inability to sell unused fossils campaign is short yes but it seems that it serves mostly as a tutorial chaos theory is true campaign that can take some hours from ya gameplay is great everything is better however i think it is more difficult than in previous title it is more micro now and actually requires you to read or remember what needs have specific dinosaurs for example i had to constantly manage everything for straight 4 5 minutes like researching adjusting squads sending med cars and helis which i think is a good thing because now it is more engaging ui went a big upgrade and now we have a lot of information that we actually need there are less fluff info and more useful one that directly transfers into the gameplay highly recommended for park management players and dinosaurs enthusiasts
