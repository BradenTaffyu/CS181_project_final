2019 hearts of iron iv hoi4 is for those who wish to play both a wwii game and a paradox game if you want to play a wwii game play one by graviteam if you want to play a paradox game pick up one of the earlier and more fleshed out titles if you have a hankering for both and are willing to tolerate all that paradox brings to the rich subject matter read on the good before the bad hoi4 particularly compared to other paradox titles looks good you re not here for the graphics but the style is evocative of the period and is pleasant to view the major nations have their own unit models which look just fine the minor nations have generic unit models but considering the how militaries were becoming more standardized and how the models represent whole divisions rather than small units this isn t as boring as it may sound mechanically the game offers the classic paradox model a few percentage bumps here and there based on prior decisions and unit positioning this is what you came for and honestly the variety in the base game can carry the experience until the point where you feel like you got your money s worth playing as different major nations offers changing geographic positions bringing new strategic considerations each has a range of decisions that summon up the feeling of the time how can i as fdr pull the ol u s of a out of crippling economic depression what is the best way to defend france without giving concessions to the communist elements in my government should i send my japanese divisions north into the ussr to reignite a russo japanese conflict or cut into china for their rich natural resources for major countries these options are great minor countries in the original release have a generic decision tree this is being remedied by the trickle of updates but the game is so stacked in favor for the major powers that it can be difficult to have a fun playthrough as a minor resource and production management is in my opinion the most important part of the game it is fairly straight forward and easy for new players to wrap their heads around the game in built on what appears to be watered down keynesian economic principles which makes perfect sense for the time period i don t have any real complaints about this process and as you will see below this aspect of the game is for better or for worse what you end up enjoying the most the fighting the main event is just ok there have been details added here and there to create an illusion of the fluidity and dramatic fighting of wwii frankly the game shines in the years leading up to the war and in the earlier period in other words designing and supplying your army is is more fun than actually leading it this means that the fighting is not as important as the planning of campaigns assignments of production lines and political and diplomatic management unless you hope to paint the map as germany the soviets or some nation converted to a more militant ideology the game drops after 43 or so you re either pulling a man in the high castle or you find yourself looking at the inevitable end of a conflict that could have been predicted with the opening shots who knew war was about getting rifles into the hands of the fellas at the front and not about watching courageous platoons mount a forlorn charge viewing hoi4 in the context of other paradox games is also important it is by no means as personal as ckii nor does it present the same range of possibility and ambition like euiv i won t compare it to stellaris or ir ultimately in the face of those other games hoi4 comes off as austere and almost lifeless while this may be the reality of managing supply lines it is not what most want in a wwii game nor does it speak to the experiences of those who lived through the times something has to be said about a wwii game which distances itself like almost all of them do from the horrors of that conflict the most detail one will get arises in short news articles about events such as the rape of nanjing i m not even sure i saw mention of the holocaust the soviet purges are gone into in slightly more detail but only in how you should worry about which officers will be available to lead your forces not in the executions and servitude of a tremendous amount of people the game is meant to be a wwii simulator the nuts and bolts are there but barely a nod to the phenomenon that was experienced by millions obviously this is not what is sought by a videogamer but i think it needs to be said to all of those who play games based in history ultimately hoi4 plays like a wwi simulator in the context of the 30s and 40s if you like the subject matter and you like paradox games it s not a bad choice for an afternoon just see it for what it is most are drawn to wwii because of the high drama built on the actions of those who lived through a remarkable time in human history this has led to the call of duty and medal of honor franchises some like to get into squad positioning and platoon leadership essentially tactics this is where games like company of heroes men of war and a whole mess of rtss have been built to give an illusion of big battles a good middle ground between these two types of games and hoi4 can be found in the graviteam series where you can get drama but still micromanage your resources to an acceptable level tldr hearts of iron iv is a good game but it is neither the best wwii game nor paradox s best title if you want those two elements combined you can play and have a good time otherwise explore your options carefully before buying
