2016 early access review this game will steal time from you and you won t even realize it played with and without mods some tweaking to the gameplay is necessary if you don t want to rebuild your camp every two days imo beefalo s will chase you while in heat i m assuming that s what it means anyway when their rear ends go red frogs will annoy you tentacles will slap you silly pigs are the happy go lucky ones for the most part turkeys will be jerks and steal your berries mosquitos and bees will chase you spiders get butt hurt if you even go near their property basically expect the unexpected and don t expect to live very long at a time in other words it s great can t wait for the full release and i m currently making sure all my friends get it
