2020 this review is for those people wanting to move their sims 4 game across to steam there are plenty of reviews online about the differences between sims 4 and other versions this review is for current sims 4 players who want to play their game on steam rather than origin the first thing you ll notice is you have to purchase the base game a second time in order to play via steam not cool ea i have moved games from different platforms to steam many times and it was always free this added expense is unnecessary and outright stealing from loyal players so i suggest you grab the base game on steam when it s on sale if this is still the rout you want to take the process of transferring will require you to uninstall your origin version of the sims 4 and re install a steam version of the sims 4 still in origin that s right you will still need origin to play the game if you were hoping to ditch the origin platform think again this makes it almost pointless purchasing via steam if you already have the game on origin for first time players of the sims however i recommend purchasing via steam just cos steam is awesome the origin platform is less invasive when playing the steam version of the sims 4 just sign in once to origin when you start up the game for the first time and from that point forward you may launch the game via steam and the origin platform will not be an issue allow your dlc to install before launching any pre saved games or you may corrupt your saves make save game backups b4 changing to the steam version just in case your saves will be in exactly the same place as the origin version of steam documents electronic arts the sims 4 saves on a positive note you will not need to re purchase any of your dlc thank you thank you thank you i m so glad they have allowed this but i m not sure any dlc will be purchasable via steam at this point all dlc may need to be purchased via the origin platform so again why bother getting the steam version of the game if you already have it on origin along with all your dlc one reason you may want the steam version is to take advantage of the steam overlay you can stream and chat with fellow steam owners from the steam overlay in game still not a selling point though since you can do just that by adding the sims 4 as a non steam game on steam i think the overlay works when you do this but i m not sure somebody please check and comment thanks another reason you may want the sims 4 on steam is to take advantage of the steam achievements and badges yes the sims 4 on steam has badges go get your ranks up everybody i guess it all comes down to why you want the sims 4 on steam if you just prefer steam than by all means get the sims 4 on steam transfer everything across bob s your uncle it supports the steam community so if you do thank you if you don t have the cash to purchase the base game a second time than it s probably not worth it if you don t care about steam achievements badges or the steam overlay it s probably not worth it if all you want to do is uninstall the origin platform and play on steam well you can t so get over it imo i got the game on steam because i like steam i like being on steam i ve always wanted to have the sims 4 on steam and i think ea have made a pretty good compromise here they are giving us what we want but still getting what they want they probably just want more money so long as steam is somehow benefiting from this deal than meh i don t care i have the game on steam now i m content
