2019 within the top 3 best tws of all time and easily the most polished historical title since shogun 2 the campaign mechanics graphics and the attention to detail is second to none within the tw franchise the game is very very well optimized i have been running the game on a five year old pc and it was honestly shocking how well i was able to run the game even on extreme unit sizes run the game using the romance color filter it s better the ai can still be goofy during battles especially sieges but overall the ai has been better at attacking as a group in land battles the campaign ai is unforgiving unless you play it carefully vh vh was playing as dong zhuo and i had a half dozen full stacks charging right down my throat it was probably the most hectic and exciting campaign i have played since my time playing as hattori in shogun 2 i haven t encountered any bugs as of yet i haven t had any crashes no matter what you think of china ca or the three kingdoms period ca deserves praise for this release 8 5 10 at the very least
