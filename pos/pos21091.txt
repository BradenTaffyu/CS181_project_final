2021 slime rancher is without a doubt the cutest game i ve ever played it s so frigging cute you ll eventually notice you re talking to your screen in an overly affectionate or childish manner and find yourself crying while watching puddle slimes playing with their rubber duck if you re an oversensitive pansy like me you may also find yourself wasting an entire corral for regular pink slimes because you found them all alone while exploring some far tiny islands picked them up like abandoned kittens and brought them home with you and you don t want to make them largos because they would no longer be the same the ost is so cute and relaxing i ve been listening to it even while i haven t been playing the graphics are so cute and colorful you re gonna puke rainbows and just when you ve managed to get a hold of yourself and force yourself back into the role of this appropriate adult human being you re supposed to be you listen to some slime sounds and whoop there you go again talking to your slimes apologizing them for being so busy they became hungry while you were away telling them to eat so that they grow big and stronk soothing them when they re scared of tarrs telling them the black ones won t come back and installing hydro turrets in the middle of wilderness to protecc all slimes not just your own you get new stuff unlocked all the time and it keeps things fresh although some repetitiveness is to be expected from a farming simulator new quests areas slimes and gadgets keep coming before you become bored of the previous thing if you re feeling more adventurous go for exploring and unlocking things and if you just wanna coma before going to sleep etc you can just feed your children collect plorts and build items it took me 37 hours to finish the main quest and yet i feel there s so much stuff left to do i was after a braindead relaxing and fun game i could play when i m too tired to play any other games i got exactly what i wanted except this is also addictive as hecc i haven t had depression in a good while but if i still did have it this game would ve cured it you seen hacksaw ridge you ll be like that guy while playing this game i just gotta do one more thing then i ll have a break and after you ve done that thing i m just gonna do one more thing etc the dev team are my fav kind of people what kind of genius one has to be to come up with something this adorable judging from the trailer of slime rancher 2 it ll be even more colorful than this one i wouldn t have believed it was possible but apparently it is can t wait for it
