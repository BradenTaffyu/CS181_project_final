2015 9 10 great game now i m a big fan of bethesda and the fallout series so this may not come as a suprise when i say this game is a really great game but i m going to keep this short and sweet pro s great story however it is way too short i have completed the main story on survival in under 9 hours that doesnt seem right to me great customization everything about the new customization is great hundreds of random side quests mean you can go for hours it will probably take more time to do the side quests than the main ones con sthe map feels small and dense you turn a corner and there are super mutants turn another and there are wastelanders it feels way to small but having played using no fast travel i can say that i am mistaken and it is huge other than the story being to short thats about it it s a great game and i think if a dlc were to come out that extended the main quest then this would be 10 10 i really do recommend you try it out
