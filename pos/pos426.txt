2016 i have no idea what harvest moon is too many reviews say this is like harvest moon oh it s so cute like harvest moon and it s a wondeful remake of harvest moon that s not very helpful i never played harvest moon i never heard of harvest moon unti this game came along i was playing computer games when it came out but the snes was never my cup o tea if you re like me this is the review for you without knowing what harvest moon is i m coming into stardew valley with a fresh set of eyes and what these eyes have beheld is pretty magical the one word i d use to describe stardew valley is enchanting the game play revolves around building up your farm fighting mining in the mines fishing and bribing the townspeople to like you it frankly doesn t sound like much but it s much more than the sum of its parts first of all the farming is deep and entertaining there are many crops to sow groves to plant animals sap and a host of artisan type improvements to your basic ingredients there s simply so much to do here it s tough to see it all and if you re creative you can construct some beautiful farms so they are visually pleasing along with productive it s not easy though you need to slowly clear your farm build up your money for seeds and you ll need raw ingredients from elsewhere mainly mining to truly become productive and self sustaining other areas are simple but rewarding mining doesn t sound like fun but each level of the mines brings new challenges and rewards fishing can be challenging and even frustrating but as your character levels that skill you ll find you re able to haul in even the most challenging catches it doesn t seem like the valley is very large but as you complete challenges in the community center new areas will open up each with it s own unique style and bonuses you ll forage through the landscape and acquire more resources that way the townspeople deserve their own mention they seem like they re the standard tropes the jock the vain girl etc but as you get to know them you ll find they re unique characters and somewhat memorable the villagers have their own schedules and you ll have to work around those schedules to get what you want as for downsides probably the most annoying thing is this bribe people to be my friends aspect i m not a fan of the limitations and i m not a fan of the message that sends but that s a minor problem with what is just a great fun relaxing and entertaining game i d recommend this game for people from 8 to 80 i m on the older side of that scale it s simply a wonderful product
