2017 i am incredibly excited to say that this game is all that i could have asked of larian studios as someone who loves dungeons and dragons pathfinder etc divinity original sin 2 simply blows my mind the dialogue can be witty comedic even tongue in cheek but at times it is also grim dark and serious each character has their own way of coping with situations and you as the player must work to keep the group together you can choose the class of all of your adventurers and tweak your main character at the start screen in effect you can multiclass from the get go abilities synergize and can create opportunities that can be exploited by other party members or if you re not careful by the enemy in terms of customization the game is lovely in summation you can advance your character in a non linear fashion if you so choose but you might find it easier to create classes that are symbiotes they benefit from each other s abilities in terms of audio the game is fantastic the voice acting is wonderfully immersive and the sound effects are well timed and well orchestrated speaking of orchestas the soundtrack is incredible if you don t believe me give it a listen on youtube the ability to choose which instrument will play at turning points of the campaign really gives you that feeling of audio customization and lets you feel like you are in control of every aspect of the game in short i may sound like a yes man when i wholeheartedly recommend this game i may sound like there s nothing wrong with the game but there are several bugs which are still unfixed and exploits that can be exposed to the savvy gamer but if you are like me and you simply enjoy a game for what it has to offer a complex storyline diverse characters entertaining combat excellent audio above average graphics then this game is for you
