2013 during the rather buggy launch i was quite unhappy with rome 2 i had fps issues even on low settings which made the great looking campaign map a pain to go through all the models had stupid faces and the naval combat was terrible but the game has been patched alot now and i feel it s a better game than what it was but it still could be better campaign map the map during the turn based sections is incredible the hyperbolic terrain really makes the different areas feel truely different it is also huge from western spain all the way to iran in the east although it isn t as big geographically as the empire total war map it does feel alot bigger it would have been alot better with seasons though which should have been put in there anyway the cities are huge on the map and you can expand them to fit more buildings but this is so rarely used and the animation is so short that it isn t that important foreign nations in the game are way too peaceful in my current campaign as the roxolani on very hard i have been declared war on only once right at the beginning of the campaign in my first campaign as rome i didn t lose 1 city throughout to the whole campaign on normal and i don t think any nation declared war on me at all it does get very boring after a bit so i d advise playing on harder difficulties the a i also very annoyingly requests stupid things for insane amounts of money which makes ending the turn a pain as you can t just leave it for a bit because it gets stuck on them diplomatic requests battle the battles in this compared to the other total wars are fast units brake quite quickly so i find myself using the slow motion sometimes just to command my troops quick enough the a i is quite stupid still especially in sieges e g they run to the front of the gates sometimes and just stare at it whilst being cut down by archers the battles aren t particuarly hard either in my roxolani campaign and my rome campaign i could defeat armies twice the size of mine with just simple flanking and skirmishing as the roxolani or just standing in formation and letting the opponents attack whilst doing obvious flanking manoeuvers as rome the terrain and the models during the battles do look great and the fighting animations seem ok but again they happen too fast so you don t really see them creative assembly or sega acting like ea with all these dlc s creative assembly is basically screwing people over paying to get factions which should be there for free is insane the series does seem to be going downhill an example of these terrible choices is the blood and gore dlc it should have been an option in the main game already this sort of stuff is that dlc quest mocks and it is a shame because total war is one of my favourite franchises i really can t decide whether to reccomend this or not as it isn t that bad of a game but i know it could have been so much more if you are going to buy it wait for a big sale or a proper price drop this game does get alot of hate and i understand why but i still enjoy it as it is still a total war game but i feel this game is good by its franchise heritage but not its individuality if you don t have shogun 2 or any other total war games and want a total war game get shogun 2 first then the others
