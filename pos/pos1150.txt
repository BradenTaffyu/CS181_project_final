2014 early access review this is a very good game latest edit june 29 2015pros zombies don t spawn in all the zombies in the town spawn at the start zombies can t spawn inside the safe area you set up realistic and also an issue a lot of games get wrong this also makes it technically possible to kill all the zombies in the game good luck with that though edit zombies do now spawn in but not in areas you are in aka no magic zombies like i mentioned above sandbox options allow this to be tweaked the isometric style works well for the genre the more old school method of graphics actually enhances gameplay especially if you are playing on a lower spec pc you can have hundreds of zombies comming at you and its not going to crash or lag this simply cannot be accomplished realistically and effectively in a full 3d first person high res format you aren t a super man you can t carry 6000 cubic feet of dirt or wood or potato chips you are forced to make realistic decisions as you would in a real zombie apocalypse simply running through and clicking a loot all button is not how this game functions also don t expect to jump 6 feet into the air or run 35 miles per hour either edit a very fast character is currently possible but with severe drawbacks you also have realistic amounts of ammunition which has weight so even a well off survivor isn t going to be spamming bullets when you die you re dead or undead regardless of if you like this or not you can t deny things just got real general realismfood can spoil planned sickness and and infection non zombie system with medical system to combat such issues implemented now you can scavenge for food bugs and berries fishing trapping hunting planned fatigue needs tweaks mood system patiaally implemented good communityits in the early stages of developement and it already has a modding community thats doing some pretty good work in fact the developers are aware of this and support this even working with a modder to incorporate their mod into the base game this has happened more than once now indie developing at its finest good multiplayeryou can survive the end times with friends or duke it out with them in the zombie apocolypse pvp needs tweaks and those tweaks are planned some tweaks already implented i have not yet tested them planned singleplayer and multiplayer npcshigh quality npc s planned with the same functionality and needs as players they eat the same they kill them same etc very good sandbox customization almost everything you could think of can be tweaked for your own personal optimal experience growth rates of plants abundance of food stregth of zombies and how often they spawn or if they respawn level of experience progression all of these things can be tweaked to a players preferences several character profession options with more being worked on and added cons you cannot rotate the camera you cannot and you won t ever be able to it doesn t break the game in any way but its a drag we just have to deal with it needs more hotkey options item binding buttons for switching to various items while still moving craft x options cook x options upon release i d like to play with a group and it will just be easier for the guys cooking and whatnot quality of life improvements mostly there should be a hotkey to drop bags in a pinch if you need to abandon weight and run there isn twould like to see some minor automation some of this has been implemented much to my delight ex you can build using wood at your feet currently but if its a space over you have to move it or hold it to use it all entered as separate commands i would like a use nearby option to be toggleable for example if i tell a guy to build a wall i would like for him to walk or run if toggled back and forth to the wood pile and wall and build the wall floor etc if its reasonably close it should also be toggleable to prevent this if unwanted i would also like to see this with the cook or craft x options streamlining repetitive menial tasks improves the experience realism and lategame tweaks this has been largely fixed with new zombie migration patterns and respawn behaviors only experienced players will be able to outplay zombies consistently with the difficulty turned up this is a very very good thing for this game the realism is good but with realism comes even more expectations i would like to see food preservation options i would like to see societal rebuilding in the lategame especially with npcs however due to the lategame currently being somewhat easy i suggest that new challenges are thrown into the mix horde migrations planned bandit raider group from another town vehicles and weapons to combat you with that you can get if you win perhaps restore power in minor ways restore running water partially the idea is that eventually you must die but farming made it possible to live indefinitely i think surviving forever should be possible but should be made difficult dudes attacking with machine guns and zombie hordes will always be a real threat waiting lots of planned features good features but features that take time and as the indie market and development process is a somewhat new phenomenon and it goes against the modern world s fast life culture it can be difficult at times movable funiture portable storage wheelie bins wheelbarrows vehicles npc s npc s npc s all things we re waiting for minor concernstweaks neededthere are various things that don t quite work that well yet and need to be solved like sleep no sleep options in multiplayer as well as how some moodles function moodles are buffs debuffs warnings that describe various status effects on your character but the game is early release so it gets a pass on those things for the time being the map is huge but there is no random map and your map options are limited the only map options are what region town on the map in which you spawn the base map is fantastic and features a good mix of environments and they do continually expand the map if map expansion continues especially beyond release then one map only will make a lot more sense and this will go into the pro category especially if the map becomes all of kentucky like some rumors have suggested even if its dlc or if modders have to do this do it lol more maps are being made by modders as well the biggest issue for me currently is multiplayer sleeping currently sleeping is simply removed from multiplayer but i would like to see the option for a minecraft style sleeping arrangement that is not default but can be enabled for private servers removing a very integral requirement need from characters in multiplayer really hurts the multiplayer experience i know this will be resolved before final release but in the interim i would like to see some options so we can at least pick our downside to multiplayer sleep rather than have that experience choice made for us
