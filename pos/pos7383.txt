2017 overall 3 5 points most severe downgrades 1 overpriced 2 not enough area coverage american truck simulator is a nice game no doubt it scores over the european truck simulator series in many ways so if you enjoy ets then ats is definitely worth looking at in detail pros beautifully designed scenery that just feels right villages towns and cities blend seamlessly into the terrain famous landmarks look like the real thing and most of them can be driven through road style variety ranges from your monstrous 8 lane interstate all the way to small rural roads that nobody in their right mind would drive an 18 wheeler on but ofc you re going to try scenery object variety is beyond enjoyable dirty trailer parks camping sites famous oldtimer cars on the roads it s all here the road grid is very consistent and the roadside signs are correct you d think that goes without saying but anyone who plays ets too will know all about improperly signed highway exits numerous easter eggs some of which only a keen explorer will find the trucks are just beautiful both in terms of sounds and visuals indicators and guages are nicely visible from the driver seat ofc that varies a bit depending on which design you pick the user interface is very intuitive the game doesn t come with much of a manual 8 pages but for the basic gameplay it doesn t really need one smooth performance even on a mid grade pc no stuttering and fps drop near dense scenery is hardly noticeable ai traffic works nicely overall much better than in ets nicely customizeable controls the steering sensitivity and nonlinear steering sliders are a huge help for anyone using keyboard only cons only 3 states nv az ca are covered in the base product it took me only 15 hours of playtime to discover 50 of the road grid and unlock 60 of the achievements overpriced just that if you happen to buy it from a 50 off sale that price seems about right but for 20 i d expect more area coverage fewer glitches more unique playtime no multiplayer in the vanilla product seriously not even a lousy ranking score board law enforcement could be more interactive actually being chased down by a police patrol and being pulled over would seem more fun than the simple speed violation message ai traffic could be more responsive to player actions for example a player driving recklessly could get reckless ai drivers in return etc there is no incentive to driving safely or carefully many minor glitches and shortcomings numerous designated parking areas fail to trigger the sleep dialog rather annoying here i parked my vehicle perfectly for a change only to find out the parking spot that will trigger the take a nap dialog is one slot to the right in some locations the enforced speed limit does not match the limit on the roadside signs e g road sign says 75 mph but route advisor says 35 mph law enforcement fines are indifferent to the severity of the act it doesn t make a difference if you go 6 mph too fast or 60 mph the fine is the same really 1 000 fine for going 6 mph too fast economy company aspects of the game are very rudimentary and too easy truck fuel consumption hardly makes a difference for job company success and most repair costs are covered by the insurance there is no incentive to being efficient or economical which also renders the entire eco driving skill set particularly useless cargo mass has no impact on revenue 10 000 lbs or 100 000 lbs of the same cargo type the payment seems to be the same owning upgrading a garage is only useful for players who intend to hire ai drivers cannot even do basic truck maintenance there what a pity only incentive to upgrade a garage is the fuel pump which sells fuel at a slightly cheaper price the latter is definitely not worth the upgrade price though seeing that fuel consumption is irrelevant to company success some key states of the truck are not stored in savegames engine status seriously guys i load a game and here i am on an 8 lane highway with my engine off transmission status and setting always in neutral after loading a savegame cruise control setting weigh station bypass tagso bottom line you are looking at about 20 30 hours of unique gameplay for 20 with some minor design flaws personally i ve seen much better for that price
