2017 early access review caves of qud is a really beautiful deep roguelike the mechanics visuals writing tone and sound all complement each other really well the procedural generation is super tastefully done and adds just enough variety to the game without smothering it in bland sameyness the devs are friendly and responsive and have been adding a lot of things to the game recently the new water ritual for example adds a whole new dimension of mechanics that layer on top of everything else and opens up lots of new options for how to play it s not perfect the ui is kind of clunky and the learning curve is pretty brutal if you want a game with an hour of tutorials and quicksaves every 30 seconds you should look somewhere else but if you re a fan of things like nethack dcss brogue df rimworld etc etc and if you re willing to put in a few hours to get acquainted with the controls and mechanics it ll reward you with tons of fun
