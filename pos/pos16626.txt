2019 early access review watched youtubers play the game decided that it looks fun to play used money from birthday to buy installed it ran it for the first time took forever to load cause of my potato pc my first impressions of the game were this is quite fun but a pain in the you know what at the same time all it takes is one small mistake and something goes massivly wrong i created a new profile starts playing the game after about 4 hours finally got the car turning over then you realise that you forget to put oil in it finally get it running ingame day is saturday fleetari s is closed cant drive the car till monday cause its not tuned and pulls because of wheel alignment deiceded to go and drink at the pub drink some vodka thought it would be a great idea to drive home ends up crashing into a tree along the highway respawns at the graveyard van is on the otherside of the map but atleast its sunday afternoon decides to risk it with green car guy hitches a ride with him until you get to the highway entry another half hour walk to the van its late the hunger and thirst bar are nearly full gotta get home quick finally found the van thank god theres some beer and saussuge in the front finally got home at like 12am goes to sleep wakes up and its monday takes the satsuma to fleetaris finally gets to drive the ferndale its soo dam hard to control on the dirt takes it on the highway and guns it all the way around police get me for speeding i said i would get them back oneday finally the satsuma is ready its now tuesday nearly crashes the ferndale cause its hard to control drives the satsuma to the inspection place gets it inspected it passes thankgod after about 48 hours of raging the satsuma is finally registered buys more beer and saussuge from tiemo starts getting perforance parts drunk guy calls one night you pick him up and thats all i got up to overall my summer car is a very fun game but be warned you will rage a lot it teaches you about how to restore and maintain an old car overall i give it a 8 10 if theres one thing to be improved on thats the optimization
