2019 excellent right out of the box but needs mods to iron out minor annoyances and to really shine and boy it shines scs software stands are one of the last few truly great and underrated game developers of this generation best enjoyed with a wheel shifter and clutch the ats and ets2 experience is largely one of constant relaxing pleasantry punctuated by moments of truly awe inspiring moments scenery lighting and weather effects or a particularly amazing stretch of road is there dlc yes but right now i can t think of a single dev not even cities skylines creator colossal who deserves every dollar they charge for their content i can wholeheartedly recommend buying at full price on release and that s only for what little they charge for ets2 is over 7 years old now ats 3 and yet they have put in so much work on so many free updates content and features that you can almost consider it a different game now it s an outright insult that rockstar with their microtransaction infested gtav won the labor of love award at the last steam awards instead of scs and this sadly says a lot about where gaming in general is headed scs is a rare gem in a gaming landscape inundated with money gouging practices microtransactions always online forced multiplayer pvp and drm and superficial yearly releases that are really just pathetic repackaged and regurgitated crap are there areas where scs falls short sure maybe driving through las vegas isn t that realistic right now because you can t bypass it directly to kingman but if you can find me another dev out there charging the prices that scs does releasing a product and basically rebuilding the entire game world from scratch because feedback said the scale was kinda off as a free update i will eat my logitech gearshift
