2020 fallout new vegas is probably my favorite game of all time and is what i hope every bethesda game is going to be like sadly that almost never seems to be the case between the s p e c i a l system perks and the various story options approaches there really is just so much for you to discover within the game there are genuinely too many things i love about new vegas to think of any negatives on the fly but i can definitely say that you should save your game as often as possible heck key bind the quick save feature to a convenient key on your keyboard and get used to hitting it often you won t regret it in the slightest this advice also holds true for any other bethesda games too 10 10 an actual masterpiece from my perspective it s similar to how some people view fine art such as the mona lisa or the sistine chapel we had those masterpieces back when and now we have fallout new vegas all the same
