2018 i m simply stunned by how great this game is now before i bought it i hesitated after all i had f1 2017 and project cars so why would i buy yet another game that seemingly doesn t add anything when i first looked through the content assetto corsa had to offer in the base game i was very disappointed even there s like 14 actual round courses with a few variations and the choice of cars isn t exactly the biggest either it has some cool road cars and even a few gt and lmp1 cars but that is the key a few very few the base game itself is kind of empty in terms of the content you will get but what you get is a framework you see the dlcs can be bought to actually increase the amount of playable content in the game and i would definitely recommend buying one or two of them simply for the tracks they add to it almost all of the dlcs are priced at a relatively okay price point for what they add to the game itself the biggest plus in regards of content i will get to in a minute now the game itself is very straight forward and while the menuing is pretty horrific once you get used to it and once you get used to the fact that the actual racing is done in a second window that opens up still to this day not sure why this is the case you are greeted with a really in depth sim racing game don t think you can just take to the track in any given car though the base setups for each and every car in this entire game are absolute f cking garbage the setups that the cars have out of the box are borderline undrivable in my opinion and each car class requires a good half an hour of testing before you get a semi drivable setup that is if you know what you re doing if you have no idea what to look for and how racecars function you are gonna get lost here very quickly and this can be a huge turn off for people that just wanna have some arcade style racing because while it is an impressively detailed sim with a metric ton of information and variablities you can play around with it s definitely no arcade game you will have to have some experience in order to be able to control the cars here sufficiently i use a controller and you can get used to about any car after a bit with the right setup however the cars feel like a dream i don t think i ve ever played a racing sim where the car control just feels so realistic and responsive like it does here in project cars you are basically ice skating rather than driving you just can t for the love of god rely on your car if you push in a corner assetto corsa is different in that aspect pushing a corner actually feels like i am completely in control of the car if you push too much you can feel your rear giving in but you won t immediately lose complete control over the car like it was the case in project cars you can actually get the car where you want to go it s a real blast driving now what my biggest critique was on project cars the ai this ai is probably the best i ve seen in any racing game by far they intelligently trail you try to attack after following you for a lap or two when they ve found a weak spot you can calibrate them to extreme lengths diversity aggression and difficulty are all individually able to be set up test the game for a bit and you will get an ai that actually challenges you and makes for extremely fun races the ai feels really human they make mistakes unlike project cars which just had the ai drive like they were on rails they try to overtake overestimate themselves push too much retire and they sometimes actually battle with you i don t think i ve ever played a racing game where i was able to do wheel to wheel racing with a driver next to me over the course of 3 or 4 corners without getting shot off the track by them it actually feels like i am racing the people in front or behind me of course they still occasionally bump into you or each other but it rarely feels like the ai just plain screwed up the races are challenging and dynamic you actually have to push and fight your way past something i very much enjoy in this game and not just the driving itself is great you have so much customizability you can entirely clutter your hud in the car up with telemetry data and information to a point where you won t be able to see the track anymore you can even fully customize the seat position which especially becomes useful when it comes to the bonus content which i will again get to in a minute finding that menu however is extremely janky and i hate that you can t seem to pause and unpause the game with a controller you have to use your keyboard for it you can create your own championships as well even multi class races aren t beyond your reach and while i think that the functionality in it is very limited in terms of the race weekend one practice session max 90min one qualifying session max 90min and one race max 100 laps with no way of creating things like 6 hour races and in terms of points can only give points for p1 to p10 and you can t give two positions the same amount of points i still think it s quite remarkable how detailed you can customize your championships the custom championships would be of little use with so little race maps to chose from if it wasn t for the all deciding factor which is the reason i can recommend this game a full 100 to any racing fan out there mods there is tons of cars and hundreds of good tracks you can download for the game and the installation couldn t be easier dragging a folder into a directory done you can now race no janky installers no studying rocket science like when you want to mod games like gta 5 nothing of that sort drag drop done this is how games should work with that in mind the content people create for this game is amazing there are so many extremely detailed cars and tracks which will make any race fans mouth water while the base game doesn t have much content it definitely has set up a framework to get you to mod your own tracks and cars it even has a sdk for people here on steam to create mods so the developers are 100 endorsing it really awesome to see developers actually care about the community in such a manner instead of trying to declare modding illegal on their game they have definitely understood their target audience and callibrating the mods has never been easier some mods for example had the camera inside of the driver model so i was able to see the driver form the cockpit a few adjustments and done overall and especially because of the mods i can only recommend this game to anybody from people who like to play an occasional race or two even then fiddling with the mods is so easy you will hardly find it bothersome to do so to the most experienced racing sim lovers and enthusiasts
