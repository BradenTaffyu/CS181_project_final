2018 i really like this game and to be fair i think obsidian deserved some creditthe game was made originally by obsidian game studios and published by the infamous bethesda also u pete hines the game again has it s flaws pros and cons yadda yadda here we go againpros and cons pros character design storytelling is absolutely amazing has it s problems with some minor issues due the game dev resources gameplay mechanics are really cool and fun to play character building progress i have to give a little for the lack of customization of the charater on this one but that can be achieved with mods perks s p e c i a l stats are pretty unique it s grat for roleplaying and a enjoyable gameplay hard decisions through the game that affect the ending cards the dlcs are amazing you can play vanilla with this one karma actually requires more gamesense when it comes to playing in higher difficulties hardcore included cons it s buggy as hell when it comes to modding not like the bethesda dev but if you re going to play vanilla it ll be fine compatibility issues with newer versions of windows 10 and maybe 8 enb is a pain in the ass to optimize in this game cfgs messes up pretty quickly rendering problems with some nvidia drivers specially amd so radeon users beware save cleaning with characters on mid endgame some areas on the wasteland have weird cfg and loading parameters especially in older versions of the executable engine was good at the time but that was all ihad in my opinion new vegas in great when it comes to comparison with some other games of the fallout franchise i definitively recommend if you like rpg and shooting stuff but again it s up to ya little jim
