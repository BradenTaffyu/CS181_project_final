2023 after a 170hr playthrough of bg3 i approached dos2 very skeptically because i thought no way any game out there can make me feel the same way that bg3 did for me ever again i was wrong this game despite being more than 6 years old arguably packs even more content than bg3 did and has the same level of love care and attention to detail put into it no animated cutscenes with waifus though it even suffers the exact same problem that bg3 did towards the end where the last act felt painfully under realized in the best possible way that leaves you imagining what could have been if larian was given unlimited time and resources if you liked bg3 then this game is a must play an incredible fantasy adventure from the beginning to the end thank you larian for yet again making a game that would become one of my most favourite games of all time final rating bg3 10
