2022 a very enjoyable game who wouldn t want to eat sawdust finally after 200 hours i have 100 the game and its dlcs the vast majority of which have been outstandingly positive my only complaint worth noting is the lack of a steam workshop that would allow the frostpunk community to create and share creations such as buildings stories scenarios places laws and so on this has been requested heavily by the community but not truly recognised nevertheless i would and do fully recommend this game to anyone i am excited and hopeful that frostpunk 2 will successfully continue the story and achieve above and beyond where frostpunk has lacked
