2023 one word magical a lot has been said about the flaws of this game and quite frankly many of the criticisms are well deserved yes the world is filled with the typical ubisoft bloat of rather pointless collectibles and points of interest yes there is a lack of optimisation and yes it lacks real depth and isn t rdr2 but honestly none of it bothers me at all the mistake here is trying to compare hogwarts legacy to the other open world greats but if you were to compare hogwarts legacy to every other harry potter game ever made you d understand that this game has no business being this good when i heard that this game was coming out i fully expected it to be completely mediocre the first and only other potterverse game i ever played was harry potter and the philosopher s stone and i got that for free as a cd from a cereal box while fun to play as a kid it really wasn t much of a memorable experience but why would it have been when pretty much every harry potter game were made as cash grabs to be released along with the movies over 2 decades of harry potter video games and not one of them has ever been worth mentioning that is not until hogwarts legacy came along for someone who grew up reading the books and daydreaming of flying on brooms and exploring the castle of hogwarts hogwarts legacy is a dream come true the landscape and castle are gorgeous you get to hang out in your house common room you get to run up the grand staircase with its moving stairs the great hall s ceiling changes with the sky and weather the room of requirement is all yours to customise and even fill with magical beasts you get to explore the world while flying on a broom even the magical combat is fun and somehow manages to work the killing curse into it how could i ask for more so no i don t care that this is a ubisoft game because i dreamed of a game like hogwarts legacy for years edit someone wrote that combat is boring because you just spam r2 and the same spells while you can certainly do that it s actually reflective of poor gameplay and makes battles last longer than they have to be different enemy types in the game have unique weaknesses and are susceptible to certain spells you can smack a troll in the face with their own club you can slam and bury spiders into the ground you can interrupt spellcasters and have them blow themselves up you can levitate dugbogs up by their tongue and take them out with a single spell combat rewards quick reflexes timing and patience not mindless button mashing
