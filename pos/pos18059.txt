2017 tldr basegame lacks depth good mods amply compensate for this basegame the game as it is has been fixed from most of its starting bugs and still looks quite good the map is nice the historical period is amazing and the battle system is very nice however the game is shalow it is quite easy to play and as you grow bigger it gets even easier the building system is very easy to learn and you can easily outsmart the ai in battle upping the difficulty to make the ai get a ton of legions be super aggresive and have buffed unit stats is possible but i recommend another option mods there are a ton of mods for this game produced by a still very active modding community i would highly recommend playing this game with one of the two major overhaul mods divide et impera or radious both add depth to the game but my preference goes to dei which i m currently playing with everything is overhauled in this mod new historical units the ai is better there is a supply system and a population system for me dei adds the depth that i missed in the basegame and since its enterily free i highly recommend you to use it there are also graphical mods that make the game look nicer i recommend gem and aztec lighting and a ton of smaller mods with which you can customize the game entirely to your taste i would say that a fully customized rome 2 can be a very good game and since its entirely free i do recommend getting the game dlc s the dlc s are generally not worth the money except when they are on sale i bought mine 75 off and you specifically want to play some faction the dlc s are not needed to have a good experience with this game and i would only buy them if you have played quite a lot of hours and want to try out some new factions or campaign maps
