2022 i was hesitant to buy this game since i am terrible at strategy games i m getting better though because this game has great tutorials trying to go for a gold medal to learn how to play effectively really shows the difference between good and bad plays the mastering challenges might stop one from making perfect plays but getting forced to try out different things help one to learn as well and as always it is great to be able to play against the ai to find out basic things before playing with real people like that 20 villagers is not enough
