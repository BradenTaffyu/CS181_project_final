2020 this game brings few new things to the table and comes with loads of problems since i ve started playing i ve encountered the following ranked lobby is absolutely broken invites consistency everything is broken workshop no longer exists now it s outsourced to a microsoft owned website this wouldn t so much of a problem if it worked correctly modders complaining their mods are deleted subscription system is wonky as hell and a huge etc if your internet connection isn t at its absolute prime the game connects you to the game anyways the problem you can t really do anything i mean for example you can t select your tc to create well anything you can t build with villagers you can t select resign or anything it reduces to alt f4ing and begging they don t take your elo away pathfinding is even worse than before villagers can and will stop working altogether until you reset their action they get stuck more often they don t know what to do sometimes military units don t attack even when they are given the attack move command there s no save quit function anymore so if anyone just drops that s it you re done i understand that the original function wasn t perfect and could be exploitable to a degree but this is worse it s aoe you can t carry a 2v3 most of the times also you can t reconnect to the game maybe you could just idle everything until the guy comes back i don t know sky s the limit for the answer to this problem this goes in hand with the previous point random crashes are a thing your game crashed for no reason you automatically resign no backsies it s bs in this state it s a shell of its predecessor now why do i recommend it if i bash it so harshly well it s simple lag has been almost kind of fixed completely units perform the tasks you hand them almost immediately this isn t the case for hd so yeah i prefer de because of that single huge point and other minor ones as well i wish devs were more active honestly these problems are consistent between all the playerbase and need at least some immediate solution
