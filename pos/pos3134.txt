2023 game is pretty solid would recommend to get it but you should get friends to play it with made it 300 more fun also would recommend some mods if you like to play mage if you don t rush the story and combat and do some sidequests that you pretty much need to get to the level then you can easily get 100 hours in this there are some cheese tactics in combat but don t think you can cheese your way forwards in the game it backfires hard 10 9 graphics you forget what reality is beautiful good decent bad don t look too long at it gameplay very good good it s just gameplay mehh watch paint dry instead just don t audio eargasm very good good not too bad bad i m now deaf audience kids teens adults grandma pc requirements check if you can run paint potato decent fast rich boi ask nasa if they have a spare computer difficulty just press w easy easy to learn hard to master significant brain usage difficult dark souls grind nothing to grind only if u care about leaderboards ranks isn t necessary to progress average grind level too much grind you ll need a second life for grinding story no story some lore average good lovely it ll replace your life game time long enough for a cup of coffee short average long to infinity and beyond price it s free worth the price if it s on sale if u have some spare money left not recommended you could also just burn your money bugs never heard of minor bugs can get annoying ark survival evolved the game itself is a big terrarium for bugs
