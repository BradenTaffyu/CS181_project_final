2017 cute little family friendly game about organ harvesting incest tribal genocide and a teenage boy who overdosed on drugs after his pet elephant died from alcohol poisoning upd jokes aside i feel like i should add some real recommendation rimworld is a phenomenal colony simulation game and it s easy to lose yourself in it for hundreds of hours not something you d usually say about an early access game play it how you want rule a degenerate raider colony with an iron fist or just roleplay a peaceful isolated mountain family of animal herders the modding community is amazing and thanks to mods you can transform your game into pretty much anything you want and have limitless replay value
