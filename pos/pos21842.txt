2018 tl dr yes it s good no it s not nearly half as scary as you ve been told don t be a chicken and give it a try probably wait until it s on sale though the game certainly isn t new anymore technical stuffs i m running a pretty mediocre i5 processor a mediocre 8gb of ram and an equally mediocre 2gb radeon rx 460 gpu i ve set my graphics quality to high which gets me a clean steady 40 fps i don t terribly mind i can t really see the difference between 40 and 60 fps anyway dialing the settings back to medium boosted my frames by an entire 5 fps on average so that wasn t worth it i haven t had any crashes yet and haven t encountered any bugs the game runs perfectly fine for me difficulty okay let s get it out of the way is dark souls 3 difficult i mean kinda and you ll almost certainly die a lot but it s also very kind to its players the thing is ds3 very much expects you to royally mess up pretty much constantly and it s balanced around that you can suck as much as you want to and you ll still be fine afterward dying doesn t make you lose anything you can t regain fairly quickly just take every enemy seriously even the most common of mooks and the freaking tutorial enemies and don t bother being mad about dying and you ll be fine winning is also never a mathematical impossibility no matter how crappily you ve leveled your character you can still beat the game with it heck some people take on the game at lv1 and some even without equipment for fun i m not saying it would be easy because it really would not be but it s possible so seriously don t be intimidated by the souls series scary reputation it s not fully warranted and you re missing out on one hell of an experience gameplay first off yes you can play ds3 with keyboard and mouse if you re used to that you might want to put up a sticky note translating the shown controller keybinds if you have difficulty navigating the menus but apart from that kb m is perfectly fine and occasionally very useful because it helps with camera management oof what else to say melee combat especially with a controller is smooth as all hell magic is fine but something skyrim honestly does better i m happy with the gameplay basically but gameplay is generally not my main focus visuals oh man ds3 is a pretty game hardly anybody ever mentions that about dark souls but the design of both characters human ish and monstrous alike and environments is really really good the environments are dense and the render distance and texture quality of far away backdrops is positively ridiculous i adore the cloth pysics in this game too on sale you could easily buy the game for the visuals alone only three second long exception lothric s face when he resurrects his brother dude what happened to your high definition facial textures you look like you fell out of a very shoddily upscaled ps2 game audio yup so much yup much of the game is surprisingly silent but when there s music mostly for the boss fights it s incredible very epic but also very fitting and finely tailored to the circumstances in which the music plays i d listen to it all the time but it gives me sudden feelings of dread story and writing very sparse but the things you can piece together from dialogue and item descriptions sound intriguing npcs tend to stay pretty flat and personality less with a few exceptions funnily enough few people will agree on those exceptions few people will agree on anything in this series but that s neither here nor there the weirdest thing about dark souls in general is how everyone chuckles creepily every few lines it s very strange really also the unironic use of thee combined with the over the eyes headpiece of the firekeeper reminds me of the mouth of sauron and that s a mental image i really did not need additional comments visual design worldbuilding yes i ll ramble on about that some more everybody keeps raving about how amazingly difficult those games are which never interested me much you know what would ve made me play those games years ago though somebody mentioning that ds3 in particular is a highly unconventional look at what s essentially a post apocalyptic world or that you play various flavors of undead characters in all three games that is so awesome ds3 also loves to contrast and combine purity and corruption light and dark holy and demonic in something that s pretty much my entire aesthetic in video game form so many creepy corrupted cathedrals evil angel knights morally dubious gods and equally morally dubious people worshipping a great many things all the lovingly modeled gothic architecture have i mentioned the amazing architecture yet sure i m a bit of an art and history nerd but i ve spent hours staring at pillars because they re so pretty in ds3 reality and the space time continuum is completely falling apart the world is stagnant and full of unchanging undead aesthetically rotting full of half decayed wall hangings and carpets in gorgeous buildings brittle gothic inspired furniture everywhere i love that so so much additional comments community multiplayer multiplayer is divisive and the community tends to feel very strongly about pretty much everything the tone is much rougher than in most other games i ve played it s stilly pretty fun though you just need a healthy sense of humor and the ability to keep your competitive nature in check seriously don t be that guy ds3 has way too many that guys already pvp matching is level bound so be sure to give it a try from the start the higher your level the more difficult starting out would be you also get rather important items from pvp you can farm them offline there s nothing in the game that requires pvp but having to farm those items is generally not a very fun time additional comments business practices you can get softbanned from online play for a large array of mostly harmless things such as using camera mods in offline mode for screenshotting purposes mostly without an option to rectify that some players have reported getting banned without being aware of doing anything wrong at all fromsoft s solution to cheaters deliberately getting people softbanned amounts to keep backups which a handful of people have reported being banned for of course and don t get screwed over by cheaters real smooth that it s honestly the only real gripe i have with that game
