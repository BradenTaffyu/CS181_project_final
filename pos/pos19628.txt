2020 fallout new vegas is literally the most superior fps fallout game currently the beginning of the game doesn t beat around the bush unlike fallout 3 and 4 imo fallout new vegas has the best atmosphere and most pleasing colour pallet to it it s not gray and green fallout 3 and it s not overly colourful fallout 4 the story the dlcs the soundtrack and characters are all fantastic you actually get more freedom and choices in fallout new vegas like the original games also play dead money and old world blues
