2018 honestly klei games the people that made this are my favorite game company they make good crud hard difficult crud this game will kill you repeatedly sadistically mercilessly it won t wait for you to catch up it won t give you a break when you need it the game s title isn t an instruction it s a challenge but gosh dang it klei you made a good one why one of the marks of a great game is the fact that even if you lose 99 of the time you still have fun a game that doesn t say enjoyment success a game that you can laugh at your own stupid stupid demise as you get mauled by 100 penguins while desperately getting the ice you need to make jam yes you read that right so yeah buy the thing they still support the game with events and if you have even one friend to play with i guarantee you ll love dying to their eventual betrayal when you guys realize there s only one meatball left for the winter
