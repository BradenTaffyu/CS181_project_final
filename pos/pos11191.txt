2019 i used to play theme hospital on the ps1 and two point hospital is not only heavily inspired by this great classic but has also been developed by some of its creators the first levels serve as a tutorial introducing new game mechanics step by step which makes learning the game pretty easy and accessible the later levels offer a nice variety and sometimes it s quite challenging to achieve the highest rating possible in a hospital if you like simulation games and or are a fan of theme hospital you should definitely give this game a try
