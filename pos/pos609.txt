2023 can t believe how long i was sleeping on this absolute gem that will eat up your time like you do with a bag of potato chips i think at this point everything has already been said but in addition to this i have to say it is the most single perfect game for the steam deck that is out there the controls are excellent battery lasts way over 5 almost 6 hours and it is just the perfect game to pause at any point to do something else only to come back and continue your farming or mining job it is just a game that will always brighten up your day and improve your mood the lovely music alone will make sure of that i honestly can t wait for the itch to come back to do some farming again and start a completely new farm but on a different map this time also massive props and respect for the ongoing support of the solo developer concernedape of this game after all those years since it s release
