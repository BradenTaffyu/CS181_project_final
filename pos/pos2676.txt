2020 i thought i would put down some of my thoughts on the game after over 150 hours of playtime dos 2 is a single player and cooperative multiplayer fantasy role playing video game by larian studios starting off you immediately realize that it s taking a lot of cues from very old school rpgs you pick one of several classes for your character battlemage cleric enchanter fighter knight ranger rogue shadowblade wayfarer witch and wizard pick a few skills to go with it and customize the look of them you re then thrown into the world trodding along a beach where you find many interesting things about the game this game require a lot of patience in tactician mode or honor mode i ve restarted the game over 5 times to adjust and try out classes stats skills burnt over 20 hours there until i made my mind and went for my final settings playing the game initially feels similar to a bit of a slower paced diablo you re running around and have to select items on the floor to pick them up and there s lots of them i started thinking to myself early on why am i picking up these shells and couldn t really explain why aside from that s just what i do in games with loot soon after you come across your first fight and this is where it differs greatly from most other rpgs out there the combat system is turn based with each member of the fight on both sides having their turns in a set order the order can be affected by turn skipping status effects such as being frozen or stunned each character whether yours or ai controlled has a set number of action points they can use for their turn you can move to a better position whack a nearby enemy cast a spell etc these all take up your action points but you are able to end your turn early and save those action points for the character s next turn positioning and strategy are vital for winning any fight in the game and it s a tough one it feels incredibly old school in it s level of difficulty and really rewards players who go around gaining xp through exploration and side quests as well as those who are extremely skilled in thinking out how exactly to approach a fight there are many factors that can alter what happens when fighting does begin rain makes your characters wet so you conduct electricity a bit better there could be poison on the ground that could effect where you need to run all of these can be affect by the player as well wanting the enemy to stay at a range throw down an ice spell so they have a chance to slip and fall on their backs if they try to move closer to you enemies are coming into melee range perhaps throw a firebomb in their path to start them burning and cause damage to them before they even get close it s a fascinating system that i ve never seen before in the game and it makes every encounter so deep that you find yourself scanning the environment your inventory your spells and your party set up just to see what is possible for that fight in terms of quests in the game there s little to no hand holding or help your quest log is literally a journal describing your heroes journey so far in their own minds essentially it makes you explore and think rather than blindly follow a marker to find your next objective this resulted in me getting lost repeatedly for a great deal of time in the very first city of the game the number of side quests i picked up was staggering and the lack of direction just made me try to think outside of the box to try and find any way to progress with my murder investigation there are even some incredibly fun encounters you can run across in your time with the game which has a wonderful sense of humour about it personally i have found tactician mode fun and challenging this game remains one of the most interesting rpgs i ve played in a long time it s well crafted has a ton of content and is a blast on your own or with a friend i highly recommend this game cioflix iplay4fun myartwork
