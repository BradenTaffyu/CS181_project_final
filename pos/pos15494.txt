2022 there s something relaxing about tearing apart and putting together cars that is actually enjoyable along with progression and a decent variety of cars in the base game it an easy recommend if you don t mind the dlc aspects for those returning from 2018 there are plenty of improvements that are worth the purchase for those new to the series you basically take orders to repair cars use tools to find out what is wrong and of course fix them you use cash to upgrade the shop and use levels to increase your skill eventually you will buy junk cars from barns junkyards and auctions and can restore them you can also fit the cars with performance parts and upgrade the parts using scrap that is basically it but it s oddly satisfying to restore a car or fix one for those returning the changes are nice they split up the upgrade tree to use money or levels money is used to physically upgrade the shop while levels improve speed and what you can do such as see values of cars and repair body parts they added more ways to repair stuff brake lathe and added fuse boxes and fuses to fix there are more fluids besides oil and they may require changing the case system has been overhauled so instead of getting parts it s focused on maps cash xp scrap or another case the part levels are replaced by a scrap system which you use it to upgrade parts repairing is more skill based than chance wheel balance is a mini game instead of a 1 minute wait for balance there s tire alignment and headlight alignment which adds a tiny bit more to the game i do have minor gripes such as separating parts into electronics which require a few more clicks to get to the part you need i wish there was more things you can do with the money though it would turn it into a different game at that point finally the dlc may irk some people but if you think about licensing on cars for a moment it s easy to understand why they have to charge for it can always look out for a sale plus they have workshop support so your dream car might be in there overall i ve had fun with this game and i keep coming back to play it defiantly check it out if the videos interest you
