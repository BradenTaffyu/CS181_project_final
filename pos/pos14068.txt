2021 great concept for a game that does entertain but it even as someone who loves micromanagement the level of micromanagement required to finish this game is just way too much for me imagine lemmings as a real time strategy game it suffers for me too much from there is really only one way to do it everything is a problem that ends up having a very specific very game y solution and at some point even if you start figuring out what the solutions to heat buildup or how to deal with the carbon dioxide you generate or the fact that water cycles are always a net loss even once you have a recycling sanitation system going implementing the solutions feels more like work than fun after a while recommended only if you get actual joy out of micromanaging things
