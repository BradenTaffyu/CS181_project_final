this is a really tough game to rate because there are a lot of factors to consider on whether or not someone will enjoy this let s get the obvious out of the way yes it s a survival crafting game you build camps you gather materials you grind aside from all the abandoned buildings it looks more like a zombie apocalypse than a nuclear one i really do not care for the atmosphere in that regard you also get perk cards instead of picking perks like in the main games i won t explain that i m sure there are plenty of videos to explain it it s not like a proper fallout game over the years they have done a lot to fix it now there are npcs that give you quests but you will never have meaningful dialogue or make meaningful decisions it s basically an mmo so don t expect much more than fetch quests and kill quests however it was enough to keep me entertained i like the world of fallout so i enjoyed crafting power armor and roaming the wasteland exploring the world of fallout 20 years after the bombs drop that was really what hooked me i like to explore and this game definitely scratches that itch when it comes to the multiplayer aspect it s another iffy element of the game it s a lot of fun to adventure with your friends but this game does not allow quest sharing which can get really annoying for people who care about that stuff there are world events you can join in on either to defend something or kill something that s a lot of fun if you are into social activities like that camp building is a lot of fun addicting even so if you re into that creative stuff i found it to be top tier the latest update even allows you to rate people s camps then there is fallout first the monthly subscription there is no nice way to put it it s a scam it s worthless they offer a battle pass and currency shop for camp props and outfits most of the stuff in there you can t get unless you subscribe like other games as a service however without subscribing the game is nearly unplayable you are only allowed one storage crate and when it fills up you basically have to drop the extra loot the only way to mitigate that is to use a scrapbox which is infinite and an ammo storage box guess what is only accessable while you are subscribed absolutely disgusting the last thing to mention are those dlc expeditions you might have seen the pitt and atlantic city don t be misled those aren t new maps or map expansions the best way i could describe it is a 1 2 hour dungeon set in a location outside appalachia where you complete multiple objectives it s fun but after doing one once i had no interest to return here is the bottom line for me it s an enjoyable experience i m approaching 200 hours and nearly level 100 i ve got a few days left of content then i m moving on and never coming back this just doesn t have the holding power for me to care once i ve seen all the content some people can get hundreds of ours out of this but i imagine you must love survival crafting and fallout has to be your favorite franchise ever
