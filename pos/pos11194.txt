2018 i ll start by saying i adore this game i don t normally play management sims i haven t even played the sims before this is not a serious hospital building game and it has a wonderful sense of humor the room building is a bit glitchy at times and i agree with the other comments when people say they wish there was a copy room feature the ai can also be a bit off at times and there are some people who will never be happy no matter what you do each hospital has it s own unique feature to it and in this sense the gameplay builds on itself
