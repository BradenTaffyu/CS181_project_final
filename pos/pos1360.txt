2015 early access review this game is brutal i returned after a long period of not playing and am very satisfied with the changes that are currently in the beta build the addition of more occupations for your character perks debuffs make for some very interesting character builds with almost no hand holding you re plonked into a random house in the middle of a map that you ll have no idea how to navigate with nothing but the clothes on your back and food in your fridge plus anything else you re lucky to find you set off on your adventure looting shops houses warehouses farms petrol stations all in the hopes you ll find a little more loot to help you survive that extra day all the while you re battling the hordes of the undead the sandbox mod allows you to tweak the nasty biters any way you like want old school zombies sure want to try and survive in a scenario like 28 days later go for it although not recommended you ll fight with whatever you can find kitchen knives bats axes planks of wood there are also firearms but remember the zombies react to sounds and a gunshot will likely make all your problems worse hordes of zombies migrate at random events that happen in game so don t ever think that large group won t think twice about seeing what tasty morsel hides in your home when a chopper goes overhead along with the copious amounts of brains you ll be ejecting from skulls you will also have to contend with the isolation that is the zombie apocalypse you ll be holed up in a house for days on end fortifying all whilst your character becomes bored lonely and depressed at the thought they re the only one left if i could give a few tips to anyone new playing it d be invest in the future read the books and learn how to farm fish and build the power shuts off and any fresh food will go mouldy the water will go and you will have to find other ways to sustain your thirst so spend time learning how you re going to extend your life without the comforts we all take for granted good luck you re going to need it
