into the old rpg style that players were so enamoured by with the original divine divinity only with all the polish of modern capabilities and the extremely successful and informative release of divinity original sin and its enhanced edition granting them insight into the necessary improvements that make dos2 the absolute masterpiece that it is players can be sure to find themselves trapped within this game for such lengths of time that the outside world shall begin to pass by unnoticed as one becomes so transfixed with the beauty of larian s latest release divinity original sin 2 is perhaps the most engaging exciting satisfying and well designed adventure rpg of the decade and that is quite the title to fight for the world of dos2 is massive hours upon hours upon hours of dense creative and unique content stacked together in this vibrant and stunning game world every location itself is chock full of fantastic characters all fully voiced with quality acting and each with a rich and realistic personality and story that drive the player s desire to uncover every ounce of their story and build upon the deep lore and sprawling history of the world of divinity the main campaign spans four acts each filled to the brim with hours of non linear content including side quests treasure hunts battles secrets to be uncovered and more all with multiples ways to be completed and numerous outcomes and with such immense amounts of freedom and player choice the likes of which almost no modern game can compete with there really is no dull moment in divinity and this game is a shining example of the effort and dedication larian puts into their work the combat of dos2 has been revamped since the previous release though maintaining much of what it once was divinity original sin 2 like its predecessor adopts turn based combat and turns it into one of the most finely crafted and perfect editions of this style of combat to date every moment of battle is exciting and even for one such as i whom rarely plays turn based games the combat was astoundingly well designed and thoroughly enjoyable players command all manner of skills thanks to the diverse customisation options available and freedom of choice with crafting bombs traps potions poisons arrows and much much more players will always find themselves with an array of tools with which to combat the enemy no class is tied to any particular tree of skills and one can mix and match as they see fit provided they learn how to best use such abilities dos2 encourages interactivity with the environment and players have much freedom to use objects terrain and combinations of attacks for devastating effects if there is oil set it ablaze if there is water freeze it so that your enemies slip the combinations are many and are far deeper and complex than just those above this game holds some of the most complex and intriguing combat systems i know combat is by no means forgiving and the game boasts a variety of difficulty options that make enemies easier or expand their skills sets and ai intelligence such as that they pose worthy adversaries to even well skilled players something brought to players for the first time in divinity original sin makes its triumphant return in dos2 and that is the wonderfully designed multiplayer aspect drop in drop out co op allows players to seamlessly enter the world of another player and join them on their journey be they ally or foe the multiplayer system is beyond extensive and to the delight of some players and the woe of others players can act as friend or foe on their journey and betrayal is a sweet thing the absolute freedom of the multiplayer system does have its faults however as playing with strangers can sometimes lead to them rushing through things progressing without you or making choices that you didn t want to make it is highly recommended that players save co op until after their first playthrough or only play with friends that one can communicate with easily and rely on dos2s world is too big and too grand to risk someone spoiling it for you however in my experience playing dos2 with a friend or two or 3 is an inimitable experience that all should try working together or against one another towards the finale of this game is thrilling beyond imagination so alongside the beautifully crafted world intricate characters massive freedom of choice expansive customisation and awesome combat divinity original sin 2 much like other installments in the series boasts an amazing soundtrack composed by borislav slavov dos2s soundtrack combines epic scores emotional pieces and the jovial warmth of tavern music in one of the best compositions of the year and even beyond rivalling that of hollow knight nier automata and potentially even the witcher 3 with traditional styles of rpg music reminiscent of golden oldies each with its own unique flair and spark and returning tracks from other divinity titles the music of larian s latest game is something no one will not enjoy hours of beautiful tracks some of which are placed so heart wrenchingly well within the game world that you will no doubt be straight onto youtube and listening to the whole lot for hours with everything else dos2 has to offer the soundtrack really is the cherry on top and it is something to behold to summarise divinity original sin 2 into one word it would have to be brave larian studios started the development of this game precariously via kickstarter backing and after the amazing success of divinity original sin they had certainly garnered enough interest to support their new installment their return to old school rpg styles was a risk that paid off not because the style is popular but because larian took something good and turned it into something beyond great dos2 is and will no doubt remain for some time among my favourite games of all time i have sunk so many hours into this game through several playthroughs and still each new one is unique and engaging here is a timeless game play it with all my heart i tell you to play it
