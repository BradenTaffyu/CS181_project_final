chaotic when there s many elements on the screenminor graphic details and bugs not game breaking gameplay 10graphics 8sound 10innovation 9final score 9 note you do not need to play the first game to understand this one they only share the same universe and lore a god awakenslarian knows that if you didn t get into the first divinity original sin game was probably because the story wasn t too captivating well the story of divinity original sin ii is nothing to go crazy about it uses elements of the typical fantasy rpg genre but always adding that particular sense of humor the game will take us around thousands of years after the events of the first game we will be in the middle of a conflict between the sourcerers users of a special more powerful type of magic but that attracts infernal creatures known as voidwoken the people are waiting for a new divine since the last one has passed away in the meantime every sourcerer is captured to avoid the use of their powers the story is intriguing but the main focus here is our hero that is where the developers have put most of the effort we have many races to pick from human elf dward lizard and undead we also have the option to create a custom character or go with one of the predefined ones we can either decide to play as one of them or have them in your party during the journey and help them in their own stories or not every race also counts with unique perks lizard people can dig without the need of a shovel undead can pick locks without lockpicks and they also heal from poison whether you pick one of these characters or you pick to interact with them you will see the story getting enriched with these conversations that will change depending of our actions characters we meet along the way the way we behave around certain people etc your party also has freedom and they won t doubt to talk to someone if it helps them in their own personal mission the game also counts with an affinity system that can go from romantic interest to never want to be in your party again open up your paththe combat s root system is the same as in the first game turn based but not tactical pauses this is more like the final fantasy type of combat where every character has a turn that will be displayed on top and an amount of action points ap that will determine how many actions you can do in your turn you also have the chance to skip a turn and gain more ap to do even more actions for your next turn in combat another thing to remark is how the environment can be a huge help you can electrify a puddle that your enemies are standing on set fire to oil surfaces or blow up a cloud of poisonous gas with the huge amounts of options we have to complete missions we already know that divinity original sin ii is big and complex but it is in their solo and multiplayer modes where we see the true flexibility of this title you can start playing on your own and even in this case you can pick to have companions with you and control them in the way you want or go lone wolf there s a special talent for this that will give you a huge boost in combat to compensate for the absence of companions to aid you in battle alone or with friends doesn t matterthe multiplayer mode is totally different the first one offered us 2 player coop but in this one it is increased to 4 player coop online lan offline split screen whatever mode you pick the game adapts perfectly allowing you to explore the whole map to the point where one player can be on the northest point of it and another player can be on the complete opposite side each doing their own side missions being a turn based rpg allows it to be great to strategize with your friends and that is one of the biggest pleasures of this game another high point of this title is the full compatibilty with steam workshop mods in this game offer you a lot from increasing the size of your party to creating a complete new class with custom animations and spells the beauty of rivellonjust like the classic crpg games divinity original sin ii uses an isometric point of view to create combat and exploration with a classic style but oh so attractive this game exudes beauty detail and color in their maps with a beautiful and optimized scenery only a few elements like the limited customization of portraits made me go meh there s not that many bad things to say about divinity original sin ii it is a pleasure to get lost in its world in the uncountable amount of hours that you can spend in this game especially if you want to complete every side mission and explore every nook and cranny original sin ii is the pinnacle of what an rpg game should be from all the big crpg projects we ve had for a while now this is the best one because it looks forward into the future but taking the best from the past with it to rpg fans this game will be a balm for the soul
