2019 short version its fantastic go play it 9 10 long version having played every total war except original shogun i can say that this is a really well done game however not without tiny issues here and there first off what does the game get right atmosphere its amazing the production value is just a bit under shogun 2 despite the lack of cutscenes there is plenty to appreciate the beautifully done technologic tree the music the sounds ambient architecture its very well done optimisation game runs silky smooth despite a large ammount of units however this is achieved by cutting from other places as a result you can get a whole lot of blurring even on ultra diplomacy is the best to date in tw its probably better then in stellaris there are a lot of options personally my favourite interactions are buying out provinces and selling crops i will never forget how i traded a bunch of rice and clay figurines for a marriage with legendary lu bu agriculture 10game balancing just like it was in warhammer archers and artillery no longer suck hard they are very fieldable units that can and will do work moreover i have found that absolute majority of units are very much fieldable with respective expertise areas peasants still perform awfully but compared to shogun 2 s ashigaru units they cost more and do more have infinitely more morale but less use factions i havent played many but from what i have seen they are fairly well balanced and each has unique predisposition i dont say playstyle because when i started as bandit queen i still had to rely on capturing territories while she does have predisposition to raiding and pillaging you wont be doing that forever also unique units relationships seem very fun and innovative but imagine this 3 best pals in perfect harmony suddenly game awards me a perk and there is immediate disharmony and they are bickering game can be a bit silly but that rng adds to the unique nature of every run what did the game get wrong duels available only in romance mode they still give you barely any benefit and only for the duration of battle their best part is locking down an enemy hero so they wont bother your units not very exciting despite advertisements of permanent buffs they only last till battle ends which makes sense otherwise that 25 hp would have been a pain in the ass to deal with but that said i wish there was still a small permanent reward for a won duel like say 5 to dmg or 1 to block chance depending on who you defeated it should also be noted that its hard to get a duel started as often enemies will adamantly refuse to have one heroes advancement gimped semi randomised trees which set hard lvl cap to 15 its a far cry from rome2 shogun2 warhammer its just in every way outside of multiple things in one ability any time a hero is lvled up im not excited you pretty much dont get stats best you can get is an ability on the field or some passive buff for administrator commander thats about it not exciting items i absolutely adore the idea of item trading this is fantastic items however are 99 hot garbage when i get n th rat figurine its like toss it with the others most of these issues will be solved when workshop is released by ca but that will take time as it is this is my 4th favourite tw right after1 shogun 22 warhammer 2 very fun 3 medieval i will never forget 4 6 inquisitioner torturing my own sinfull generals to mold them into either a corpse or a walking saint but this is crisp new and i hope you will enjoy it
