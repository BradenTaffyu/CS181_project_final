2017 this game is great by itself the dlc is only worth it if its on sale for 2 as you can find the cars or similar ones online in the modding community that brings me to the best part of the game not only is the communty big for a racing game but the modding community is awesome some of the best cars in the game are from modders and even modders make cars better than the devs can the shear number of car track and most importantly skin mods creates something bigger than any other sim game can create as the number of mods leads to so many different things you can do with this game if you are looking for a drifting game this is the one to get the drifting community is crazy big and pumps out great cars and tracks that make the game so much more than just sim racing i personally have bonded with friends more over this game than any other and met people through drifting to sum up game is good mods make it so much better highly recommend
