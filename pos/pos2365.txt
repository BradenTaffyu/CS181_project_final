2023 if you are more of a single player gamer like me don t let the online nature of fallout 76 put you off it s eminently playable as a single player experience if you are put off by the issues mentioned at the start then maybe steer clear or at least wait to see if patches address your concerns otherwise i d say grab the deathclaw by the horns and jump in but maybe wait till you have powerarmour to do that
