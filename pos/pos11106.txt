2021 oh yes very good so far if you liked the first one you ll love this one so far and i ve only played minutes there are things i wished a thousand times the first one had time manipulation you can speed up transporting building etc or pause completely path spacing there s space reserved on narrow paths that allow you to replace with thicker ones later the helicopter for tranquilizing is amazing while in 3rd person you can click mmb to lock onto a creature then fire without ever going into first person it s so fast and reliable the ground editing is great everything all together and you re able to batch delete all manipulated objects just like you would level terrain the trikes didn t need a feeder you just put the grass ground fiber down which used to be cosmetic but now it s their food and that s all i ve noticed in like 20 minutes lol it also looks and runs absolutely great as long as you re not using a potato i don t see why people are having issues installed right away think it was 7 or 13 gb fired right up i maxed absolutely every setting and am enjoying about 55fps i could turn dss on as it s an option and would get higher frames but it s not cs go and i d rather have the fidelity i9 10900 kf rtx 2080 32 gb 3600mhz ddr4 1 tb nvme samsung 3440 x 1440 144hz gsync panel so yes i would recommend this especially if you played and liked the first one
