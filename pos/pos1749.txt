2017 i am writting this review now that i am near the ending of playthrough no 2 ending b so i can keep an happy mind to write this review without tears this japanese story writer is famous on having happy endings but when it goes to true story route it became some wild emotional rollercoaster i been following this game serie from drakkengard it s very interesting to see a serie from dragon rider that fight flower into a post alien invasion world that inhabited by machine and rebot while humanity escaped to the moon the story is very loosely connected to drakkengard but it s quite tightly connected to first nier i never played first nier but to prepare myself for this game i spent many hours on utube to watch an entire playthough of it i personnaly recommend your guys to do the same before playing this game if you never played nier a lot of important and interesting reference from the old nier are in this game and this game is the after effect many years later from the first nier plot itself is very interesting but the most interesting part of it are at the very begin of the game when fighting boss the size of the building for the first time that s probablly one of the most interesting boss fight i had in this last few years the other boss are also very interesting but it doesn t have the chill quite like that first target graphics and control are smooth with fantastical combat sequences the cg quality of this game is nothing short of epic regular graphics of background and object are not exactly the best i ever seen but it does give this game a feel of digitized realism very interesting chip skill system and there are a lot quests that give you some much needed items resources and exp overall difficulty is quite easy i recommend player start on normal but as soon as you get use to it change the difficulty to hard as the game difficulty would be too easy without it at least on hard you will need to use all your buff items and restore items until you gain those good recovery skill chips what tops all the good things that i said so far music and sound effect is legendary for this game i can listen to some of the metalic songs for this game for hours and hours this cannot continue is my favorite and can put me into a trance 24 endings with 1 dlc endings are mostly silly but a e are the important ones that will only be awarded if you finish a playthough make sure you at least playthough the game 3 times as the third playthough will be vastly different then the a and b i will deduct 0 5 point to my review score from low difficulty and some of those silly fletch quests to give this game a solid 9 5 10time to play on and finish the rest of the game ps like many japanese port this game is not very good on game optimization so it does require high spec pc to run effectivly so if you low end spec pc run this game on low spec i wouldn t recommend it
