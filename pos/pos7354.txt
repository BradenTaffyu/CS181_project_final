2022 early access review only played for 8 hours and i couldnt stop pointing out all the little details that they thought of that sadly many gamedevs wouldnt do seems like a fairly thought through game that feels nice to play intuitive and fluent to play not some clunky mess that is frustrating to operate great game very fun with friends dont know about solo highly recommending esp for the price
