2023 i have been playing it since pre release and was more than excited for the full game i am more than satisfied for people who enjoy single player games this game is a masterpiece i am out of words to write a review because i can t describe how flawless it is music art story weapons crafting system upgrades boss fights and the entire concept is well executed with the full release they implemented puzzles as well which are enjoyable oh and i am japanese so i might be biased i love sushi 3but truly this game is very fun for those of you who are into playing alone it encompasses everything you d look for in a single player game my only sadness is that i know this game might end someday but it will be one of the masterpiece games i will always remember
