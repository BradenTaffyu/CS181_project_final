2018 early access review i gotta be honest this game is awesome but just needs more this game is all about entertaining the player and it nails it when you first get the game you have plenty of options to choose from but it s just not enough and that s the only downside to this game for example i really wished they could add in more cars to choose from more maps and heck no online multiplayer maybe better graphics too all in all its a fantastic game for car lovers like me but needs more but if you re gonna buy it i d say go for it as if the developers might add in more into the game in the future
