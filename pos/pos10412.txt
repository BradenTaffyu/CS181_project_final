2019 overall a fantastic sim racing experience that just needs a little more integration into the blancpain gt series pros ffb tire physics track characteristics car physics sound the sound vivid graphics car models and liveries trackir integration driver rating system that encourages clean and mature racing cons woefully inadequate explanation of car setup aspects prepare to do a lot of homework trial and error testing cannot completely navigate car setup menus with logitech g27 directional pad have to supplement with keyboard performance problems during day night transitions and i m running in 1080p with a gtx 1070 limited track selection but will improve over time small online community this is the wild card with this game the community could grow but that depends on how dedicated kunos is in the long run based on kunos support for the previous assetto corsa i m not too worried needs honest integration into the blancpain gt series there should be race alerts highlights links to content and rules etc this is a huge missed opportunity for the game i purchased acc because i was already familiar with the blancpain gt series but there s no reason why it can t work the other way around the game should be heavily promoting blancpain it s a worldwide series after all
