2021 people playground is a well executed well thought out game about constructing machines that can and will kill the puny humans that you spawn within the hell hall of a room i originally got this game because my brother got it on his computer and i played it a lot on there with updates very frequently a dev that cares about this game and a silly and inclusive community of gamers that add a little something nearly everyday via mods that you can ad to your game with a click of a button and a restart of the game this is honestly a really enjoyable experience its only 15 bucks and its well worth it if you like torturing pathetic humans that just can t do anything against you i usually tend to build machines that will completely destroy the humans like my most recent machine the deletion machine ii its better than the original because instead of just crushing humans cars and almost anything it now burns them too this game is awesome edit yes its a whole paragraph sorry also i don t really care its a whole paragraph
