2018 early access review nice zombie fun played sprinter zombies with friend needed a supply run so he dropped me off by supermarket with a car and drove off to attract zombies grabbed mostly what i needed but some zombies were breaking windows and started running towards me went through back door big mistake theres a big horde out there ran through an entire parking lot being chased by zombies my getaway driver is about to arrive on our pickup point he is also being chased by zombies get barely enough space between the zombies and i in order for me to get in the car zombies swarm the back car as we slowly start driving forward both our characters ingame and real life selves are in state of panic sigh in relief as we drive away unscathed with suppliesdunno what other game will let you experience some genuine movie action unscripted like that other than hereedit forgot to mention that this is more of a simulation much rather than a game as others have said which is why i tweaked the zombies to sprinters to add more tension and fun not for the first hours of dying getting used to runners though lol more fun with to play with a friend than alone
