this game is an absolute gem which would i never have discovered if not for a friend who immediately recommended it to me upon learning of my love for turn based tactics trpg games they were gushing with praises for almost every aspect of the game i bought it without hesitation and then proceeded to struggle to get into the game it took me about 5 6 on and off attempts of starting new campaigns before the game finally clicked for me and then it had me completely hooked this game is a lot the devs evidently operate on a more is more philosophy the sheer amount of gameplay elements can be very intimidating at first and the game takes its time to introduce you to them i ll summarize some of the key elements of the game and what makes it truly special for turn based tactics veterans here are some features that will be familiar isometric grid with cover based combat 2 action points per character turn the main reason everyone compares this game to xcom action time system to determine turn order based on speed stat and combat actions effects much more interesting and engaging than simply player turn vs ai turn unique characters each with their own stories no permadeath chapter based visual novel storytelling with replayable missions similar to disgaea no base building or management but you have a hub where you can engage in shopping and crafting an extremely customizable perks system known as masteries for each characterthe masteries system is where the game truly shines and was the biggest draw for me you can think of masteries as what are often called perks in other games except you have to collect them and equip them they re functionally similar to materia from final fantasy 7 you can collect them from defeating enemies you can also research craft more of them by combining other masteries you ll start with a limited pool of masteries you can craft at the start of the game but as the game progresses you ll encounter new enemies and accomplish certain achievements which unlocks more masteries to craft equipping masteries to a character s mastery board may modify stats grant additional abilities and so on equipping specific combinations of masteries grant additional bonuses known as mastery sets these sets can introduce completely game changing behavior the game encourages you to try different setups which can be saved and freely switched between although you may need to grind a bit to collect masteries as you level up each character they will eventually have access to 2 advanced classes which give access to class specific masteries to give an idea of how drastically they can change how a character plays here s an example of how i built albus the main character at different points in the game a magic focused wind caster with extremely high crit chance and crit damage to nuke enemies at medium distance yet capable of cutting foes down should they get too close a terrifying swordsman who chain kills bleeding enemiesthe masteries system is a theorycrafter s wet dream i probably spent more time tweaking masteries and experimenting with different combinations more than actually engaging in tactical battles speaking of battles it s important to note that battles can take quite a while especially on higher difficulties some battles can last 1 2 hours even with max animation speed battles play out in a pseudo bronzeman approach to saves you can t make manual saves during battle but quitting the game saves your progress mid battle and there are also auto save checkpoints throughout the battle if you have a busy schedule and aren t able to sink multiple hours of playtime at one go this is something important to take note of difficulty wise i recommend genre veterans to start the game on hard difficulty and then move to cruel the highest difficulty as soon as you re comfortable with the game s systems this is how i played the game and it presented enough of a challenge to keep me on my toes i mentioned the devs having a more is more approach to gameplay here s a non exhaustive list of the many gameplay features included a relationship and bonds system that unlocks additional abilities between bonded characters similar to the friendship system in xcom 2 wotc or fire emblem a simple food drinks system outside of combat to provide temporary in combat buffs a loot system that will have you hunting special enemies to try to get powerful gear a serviceable crafting system for equipment and consumables you can also craft special equipment sets that grant additional bonuses as you equip more of the set a whole ass beast taming system that will have a later character capturing beasts like pokemon they too can be customized with masteries a drone building system to complemented by the crafting system another later character can build drones to be deployed in battle they come with a completely separate modules system that is analogous to masteries but you craft them with materials instead of other masteriesall these systems combine to make for an amazing game that deserves a place in any trpg lover s library some reviews take issue with the translation of the game the devs are a korean indie team so their localization budget is limited i got used to it pretty quickly if you speak more than one language or regularly interact with non native english speakers you ll probably have no issues to cap off this review i d like to give a special shoutout to the devs as many others have too this game is clearly made with love and passion and is worth every penny i also think it s just so neat that a small korean indie studio is able to communicate with a global audience thanks to machine translation tools i bought all the additional content at full price to support the devs and i m extremely excited for the sequel they ve announced as being in development
