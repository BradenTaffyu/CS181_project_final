2017 i really wish there was a better ranking system than thumbs up or thumbs down from these the game is a great expansion on the original tww however all the new and bright shiny things don t take away from the core problems with the series as a whole and introduces a few new ones the long list of grievances will be in bullet point format building an empire with an ally is still very limited let them grow with you and they will never confederate despite you being over 200 rating with them and being 10 ranks lower than you the new mechanic added is absolute nightmare if you want to do more than sit in a small territory playing spread sheet simulator aka romance of the 3 kingdoms the first couple rituals are not bad but after the third they spawn massive 20 stack armies in random spots all over your empire and go on a rampage attacking the most obscure outposts that have nothing to do with the channeling event the worst part is you can see how the factions that need to do the hiring are losing out and are definitely not sitting on a stockpile of gold 10k to be able to summon such twinked out armies there still is no way to broker territory exchanges between allies leaving both people with half completed regions the game is too massive in map size hard time calling it a con as it feels great exploring it though it will leave you infighting amongst your own race more than you will even encounter any of the others minus some small incursions here and there except during the channeling ritual garrisons in cities cannot defend lands they are protecting despite them now being 20 stack armies when a chain is fully walled and upgraded allied ai bee lines for objectives you need for campaign when they can not even participate the resources for the channeling ritual are not shared between allies which i can t wait for a mod to fix the worst by far 20 stack to win there really needs to be a pacing mechanic in which everyone player and ai cannot field 20 stack armies until later in the game until perhaps they conquered enough territories to support a massive military complex as it stands its whoever has the most 20 stacks is rank one and can auto resolve to victory even adding a mechanic of supply and replacement lines would greatly counter this assigning these routes could allow for local recruitment bonuses at the front and allow weaker nations to contribute to war efforts by disrupting them with smaller armies in skirmish based scenarios tldr mods are needed to make this a great game as it stands ca did a great job expanding on the tww universe while mods will be needed to make the game truly enjoyable as a game about waging war much like all their titles while drifting further into spreadsheet simulator in some enjoyable ways yet they unfortunately don t add to the war experience instead detracting from it
