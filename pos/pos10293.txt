2016 just started playing rimworld again recently heavily modded though my current goal is to have a successful commitment mode naked brutality run with a completely random character and random start map current attempts 1 dies from food poisoning within 3 days small starter cave was built2 dies of the flu within a single day in savanna biome surprised i didn t die of extreme heatstroke first 3 two colonists die from raider attack in a desperate defense lasted 1 month and was able to get power and somewhat reliable food supply raiders were just grunts but one had 13 melee skill and we were demolished with our only defense being a former pirate with a hatchet and a con artist incapable of violence was just about to start research as well 4 less than 1 month i tried hunting a gigantopithecus with throwing rocks and 2 shooting skill out of desperation for food and you know what happened 5 goes well for over 1 year with couple seasons without raids and at my peak i had 3 colonists standing strong with every need provided for and 2 prisoners to be recruited i start this big relatively speaking construction project to merge my workshop buildings then a raid of 4 folks comes in no big deal i kill and capture them all but everyone s injured and so they all go in the hospital while caring for the injured my main doctor dies of an infection ok so i build a grave and we just move on without him but then because my cook was healing in the hospital we didnt have any cooked meals so everyone got food poisoning this slowed down everything along with cooking which i tried forcing my cook to do but the room was dirty from all the injuries and blood which just created more food poisoning incidents then a megalania a big lizard attacks my guard dogs out of nowhere i try to mount a defense to kill the megalania but we fail and everyone is now dead funny how i could kill a brontosaurus to last myself through winter and a horde of manhunting dogs but not this one lizard you can take it that in rimworld you can have the exact same goal every playthrough but every time the outcome and journey would be different this is a game with amazing replayability
