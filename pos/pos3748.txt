omori is a captivating experience that challenges you to think critically about your mental health and how it affects your entire being as well as the lives of those you love it actively discourages false positivity toxic nostalgia and mental repression you cannot fight away your past or sweep it under the rug you must face it head on no matter how much it may hurt or how devastating the consequences may be we re also talking well beyond the realm of mere uncomfortability as omori deals with some very dark and traumatic subject matter despite this omori also advocates for patience understanding and personal responsibility reminding us that those we love will be there for us when we need them and as painful as it can be reality will always be more comforting than a world built on falsehoods some things i like i like omori s soundtrack a lot it is atmospheric unsettling sentimental emotional and heart pumping in more ways than one some of my favorite battle themes are it means everything world s end valentine goldenvengeance you cannot go back underwater prom queens omori and omori alter and whale whale whale some of my favorite other themes are remember to be patient h20 hcl a home for flowers daisy sinking lost at a sleepover poems in the fog clean slate and spaces in between the skillfully crafted hand drawn art present in battles and interspersed cutscenes is nicely evocative of a children s book also major kudos to omori for not using the common trope of disparaging medication and or therapy i don t agree with stories about mental health that put down real life resources that can make a significant positive impact on people who are suffering some spoilers follow my biggest gripes with the game are with its pacing and certain aspects of the real world some rpg sections drag on for too long and as the combat gameplay is quite simplistic but still satisfying to me i must mention you might find yourself wanting the pace to pick up a bit this was more of an issue for me the first time i played as the psychological horror tinted teases for what really happened are so tantalizing that i wanted to get to the truth as quickly as possible one thing i commend the devs for is how quickly you earn exp especially towards the end grinding never felt like a slog even on subsequent playthroughs as for the real world i found some of it too silly for my liking the game clearly wants to have its off kilter earthbound esque indie rpg small town with all of the wacky trappings like fighting other kids and doing part time jobs which is strange in and of itself for someone who hasn t left their home in 4 years to want to do but i felt this approach didn t mesh well with the extremely bizarre headspace existing already i would ve appreciated it if the real world segments were just a touch more mundane grounded or perhaps more complexly written to be better balanced out against the dream world that being said there were segments of the real world i really enjoyed such as basil s despondency and especially how they handled real world aubrey and her struggle to navigate her dissonant feelings of abandonment grief and justified rage through effective use of symbolism humor and horror omori s impactful story encourages healthy responses to trauma and guilt things can get better but it s up to us and how we want to handle confronting our issues
