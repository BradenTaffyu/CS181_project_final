2015 i ve been a member of iracing for two years now and don t regret a bit of it first of all the racing format is the best available every race is online with real people using real names behind the wheel this means there s accountability for your actions drivers practice for hours on the track just to do one race so nobody falls behind the field and due to the ranking systems of safety rating and irating you ll never see a bad driver again you have to work your way to racing the best cars i mostly enjoy racing the nascar iracing series half length weekly nascar sprint cup races with their 32 car fields this series really shows off the quality of racing on iracing i ve done three hour races in this series without a single yellow flag wow i also enjoy the world sports car series racing the hpd prototype through multiclass packs filled with rufs and ford gts other drivers are respectful and the races are a blast to do the time just flies by great graphics sound physics and most importantly of all racing i ve used triple monitors and currently use a rift dk2 both of which have seamless integration if you re a serious racing fan that loves simulators get it
