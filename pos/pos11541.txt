2014 early access review edit 3 years later and this review still stands the only difference is now i have nearly 800 hours well worth the money for the time spent enjoying this game truly more satisfied with 7 days to die as time goes on a rare thing for early access i have followed this game since early development this game has came leaps and bounds above what it was before a true masterpiece in the sandbox genre highly customizable difficulty keeps the game challenging when you become a veteran of 7dtd the development team really keeps their word on what they are going to implement a rare thing in early access as i have come to learn i ve had fun playing this game for a long time now nearly 200 hrs logged ingame truly the only early access game i feel more satisfied with as time went on thank you the fun pimps you guys really do pimp out the fun
