2022 star wars the old republic swtor is my mmo of choice mmos are pretty hard for me to get into but swtor was able to suck me in nonetheless let me explain why if you are familiar with mmo styles of gameplay then it is easiest to describe this game as playing like world of warcraft wow if however you are unfamiliar with it you have a bunch of abilities that you utilize usually bound to 1 through on your keyboard they can do a variety of things like attack charge up a resource to use better abilities stun heal and so on these abilities are bound to your class and specialization so your role in fights is determined by what you pick to play most fights result in using your abilities in a general pattern adjusting that pattern slightly to meet the requirements of battle using items as needed and moving to avoid enemy abilities knowing exactly what to do can be complex at times especially in fights that require teams of people but it is generally easy to play your main avenues of growth are leveling and gathering new gear through combat and quests though most of your fine tuning comes from the gear as for how fun it is it is fun enough to not harm the game but not great in my opinion i have never really been a fan of this play style the grind for loot and levels can be tedious the combat becomes very formulaic for most of the game and really it kind of comes down to button mashing and moving it is not as engaging for me as it is for other people but some people really love this kind of game as for me i came for a different reason i love swtor for its story it is what really drives me to play all the character storylines and the late game story content are all high quality and there is so much to play through and of course in standard bioware style you get to make decisions all throughout it to keep you engaged and make you feel like you are actually playing a character and influencing the story most of the game is voice acted and when this game came out it was the largest voice work project in all of gaming and i think that might still be the case and in my opinion it pays off see when i played wow and a few other mmos i could never get into the story wow has phenomenal lore and objectively has a pretty good story but it is all text dumps that you read but don t really engage with whereas in swtor you are ingrained into the story with voice acted cutscenes that give you decisions to choose between to make the story truly yours it makes it so much more fun to go do tedious fights when there is a fantastic story to drive everything this game could play like hot garbage and i would probably stick around for the story it is that good in my opinion now not everything is made equal some character storylines are weaker than others generally speaking i have found the jedi storylines to be weaker than the sith ones and if i remember correctly that is not an uncommon opinion most people do agree though that the bounty hunter sith is the weakest storyline and the imperial agent is the strongest i agree that the bounty hunter s is probably the weakest but you know what it is still pretty darn good in fact i quite liked it if that is the worst the game has on offer then you are in for a real treat oh and did i mention that each class has five companion mini stories to experience as well now as a personal opinion my favorite storyline is the sith warrior it holds a special place as the first story i played through and it just always resonated with me the companions are great especially one which will become really obvious if you play through the story the goals are perfectly sith and your characters interactions with the world are just fun i don t usually like playing through story experiences more than once but despite the absolute time sink the story was i played the warrior storyline twice i cannot express it enough i play this game for the story and it is so good it is not perfect though late game content has less voice acting your decisions long term impacts are very limited for early to mid game and not every character in the world feels perfectly fleshed out but honestly in my opinion those are extremely minor gripes if you like story games this is definitely a game you can sink your teeth into graphically this game is beginning to feel a bit dated but compared to other big boy mmos like wow it looks brand new in comparison the style though is what shines out the old republic style of ships architecture armor and so on are all better than later eras in star wars and i will die on that hill this game utilizes it all very well and with good modeling lighting and texture work all the different areas you play through in this game also look and feel great each is unique and well thought out my only complaints are that the animations can be quite limited at times and some of the characters look samey but i think that is largely a limitation of these massive mmo games in general this game looks pretty good for how old it is the sound work to this game is very good i already mentioned the voice acting and to add a bit to that all of the voice actors did top notch jobs i cannot think of one voice line that i felt was read poorly the general sound effects for the game are great if you get a little bit of the childhood pleasure at the sound of a lightsaber like i do then you will be very pleased with most other sound effects as they all strike me as similar in quality and familiarity and i have never found one to be overly annoying despite how much i have played as for the music what can i say some of it is general star wars music which is always great and anything unique to this game or kotor 1 or 2 realistically is also top notch this game sounds great i have zero complaints overall i really like swtor yeah the gameplay is not my favorite but it really is really carried by all the world building through not only the story but also the graphics and the sound design as well now mmos are not for everyone and that is fair but i would argue that even if you generally do not like mmos this game may still be worth trying just for the experience i have yet to find another mmo that does story telling so well and if you have failed to get into other mmos and have generally given up i implore you to roll the dice one more time and give this one a shot now as a final note this game is generally meant to be paid for with a subscription and if you are in the late game it is worth getting one but if you are starting out i would definitely not get one as you will not properly utilize it but i would spend a bit of cash see not only are there free to play players but there are also preferred players players that have spent money on the game at least once being a free to play player sucks being a preferred player is a lot better also another really cool thing is that you can buy subscriber features a la carte i have spent some money on this game and play as a preferred status player with just about every subscriber feature and now i essentially have all but the most exclusive features and new content without having to pay for a subscription it is so cool that i can do this and it is my favorite free to play mmo model that i have experienced with all of this said i give this game a glowing review my complaints are minimal and i have spent hundreds of hours in this game for a reason give it a try if you have not already
