2022 early access review it s a rare thing for me to review a game but this game begs for a review i ve only played 10 hours but have loved every minute it strikes me as a release build because it s so polished and bug free it has a spectacular concept and reminds me of a game from the 90 s called ascendancy but with far more depth and nuance it s part puzzler base design resource management and problem solving the learning curve really isn t all that terrible only real problem i had was figuring out how to transfer resources to other base structures but once that was overcome everything else was pretty simple the translations are a bit rough but is easy enough to understand what they re trying to say it s a very relaxing enjoyable play that really keeps you thinking overall this game will devour your free time because it s so chill and fun the 5 developers deserve every cent they earn for this amazing title and zen game concept
