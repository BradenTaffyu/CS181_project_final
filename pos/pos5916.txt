2020 early access review as a warband player with nearly 3 8k hours i got 3 4k on another account i can say that this is definitely a warband prequel i also call it warband 2 0 it has the same nostalgia immersion grind and of course insane battles there are still minor problems to fix like boring glitched quests more fun storyline and more options to gain money overall i do think the game is worth the buck because good graphics very well optimized major improvements they can use the money to make it even better replayability is there
