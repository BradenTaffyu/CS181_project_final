2018 early access review dead cells is wonderful dead cells is addictive but why for me it s the kind of game that i continue thinking about the moment i put it down it is also the kind of game that you pick up and play f ck up royally and when you are spat out again at the beginning you mumble to yourself oh okay one last try and you are thrust right back into the action as soon as you take control of your character i never feel bored when i am playing dead cells bosses feel tough but balanced level design is solid enough though some areas are mazes in every sense of the word and it can be a real chore finding the way out making for some tense moments the combat is very well designed it just feels right shooting a bow or swinging a sword or parrying an attack with a shield personally no weapon is a true favorite i like trying out everything which is easy to do in this game as well finally the game does not feel early access to me there is tons of content to worth with and the devs are activity adding content all the time this is hand s down the best indie game i have played in some time i have triple a titles waiting to be played on console but this calls to me first before all else
