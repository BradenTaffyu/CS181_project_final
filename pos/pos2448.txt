2020 my experience with fallout 76 both from early to mid launch up to the steam launch with wastelanders in 2020 pro s fun feels like i can do what i want compared to fallout 4 variety in making your character variety in crafting perk cards let you build and your character s playstyle player interactions for the most part are always friendly and if you don t like pvp there s always pacifist mode since the steam launch i ve seen a massive boost in fps the battle royale mode nuclear winter is an unexpected but a very welcome and fun br experience don t have to spend a dime on cosmetics if you do daily atom quests and even then its all optional creatures are cool and weird since most are based on folklore npc s are very welcomed here and the interactions are great too personally adds more to your experience base building trading and more con s bugs they re there its gonna happen its bethesda some fps drops but this release and update has majorly improved on the fps as i m getting constant and more than 60fps at times fallout 1st we don t need it crashing but this more happened on the bethesda launcher version and currently with steam i have had no crashes at the time of writing the price is a bit too much so maybe grab on a sale unless curiosity is getting the better of you this game has been improving a lot and is slowly doing what no man s sky did too there is a team here that wants to see this game do and get better from its incredibly rocky and troubled start don t get me wrong we cant get rid of any regrets if you bought this game during launch or such but the team wants to make this game better i will be supporting them and if they make this game better and better with free content i will always put time into 76 they could of quickly dumped this game and left it in a ditch to die as they work on their next title but work is being done improvements are being made and this game can become better and better in time let s see what happens next and stay safe out there in appalachia
