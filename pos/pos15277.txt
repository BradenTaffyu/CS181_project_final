2016 a great game to play with friends a not so great game on public servers don t starve together or dst is a multiplayer game based on the popular singleplayer game don t starve dst is an incredibly fun game to play with many elements from don t starve incoporated into it it does not have a relatively high learning curve and the hud is easy to learn and familiarize oneself with the crafting system is simple and neat and only the bare minimum detail is used albeit cleverly this game is not forgiving however do not expect an easy game every second must be spent doing something be it gathering basic resources or out exploring new sections of the world scoping out potential allies to befriend or enemies to behead you may be frustrated at the lack of many op items in the game or their cost however remember this this is don t starve together a game that does not want to help you that will send misfortune upon you that wants to kill you the bees the dogs even the birds don t like you very much it s up to you and friends to brave the bads and get the goods so saddle up and invite some friends to play don t starve together p s i also highly recommend the usage of mods to enhance gameplay once vanilla gets bland mods introduce new characters new buildables and other fantastic fun actions that you and your team can do
