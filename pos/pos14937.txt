2021 early access review i really like this game maybe get it while it s on sale but if you have 20 lying around go ahead and pick this sucker up it s also worth to note that you should have a good pc laptop to play or at least a sort of modern one go to options and lower a handful of stuff in graphics if your computer is struggling 2023 edit i m running this game on an intel i5 9th gen laptop with integrated graphics card at 20fps without mods which imo is playable but i d def still recommend a good pc or laptop for this lol
