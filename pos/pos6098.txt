2020 the sims 4 is the most lacking base game we got and took awhile just to get pools ghosts stairs that can bend and now windows that can be put on half tiles the things they did get right this game create a sim is way easier to make unique looking sims and not have them all looking like the same in game building is amazing in this game it s a lot more friendly then sims 3 ever was because it doesn t punish you for changing the floorplan or wanting to add a basement like the sims 3 did that being said the sims lack that personality they had in the past games and they all start to feel the same after a generation if you want to play base game only for a while i would say you need mods because that s the only way you fix the dull gameplay it has to offer mods i would use mc command center slice of life ui cheats meaningful stories basemental drugs 18 wicked whims 18 and t o o l if you like to build the dlc is way too much for what they have to offer but that being said you don t have to buy the dlc on steam if you shop around on cd key sites and activate the code on origin you can still use the dlc well playing the steam version which means another thing people hate it launches origin to play the game which is a turn off for most people i would still say buy it i picked up some dlc and i m having a blast playing you make your own fun in this kind of game so don t expect it to push out a story for you play with life play with sims
