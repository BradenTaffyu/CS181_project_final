2017 war never changes pros it s fallout i played all the other ones of the franchise this one doesn t disappoint map and scenarios the whole commonwealth is filled with a variety of scenarios and environments humor the game has a lot of humoristic speaches i guess that this is the game that made me laugh the most in the entire franchise besides i came across so many physical bugs some of them hillarious i almost feel like saying that the bugs in the game are a positive feauture if you want to laugh don t belive me check youtube long game are you a completionist by my experience this game is even bigger than fallout 3 new vegas plenty of side quests to do companions there are many companion characters in the game for everyone s taste at a certain point i was already waiting for a mirelurk companion no you ll not get a crabby companion decisions decisions decisions i had a hard time trying to make my choices in game in a good way nuka world was the oposite unfortunately rpg elements crafting leveling up xp you name it cons repeatable quests i hate that even thou you can farm xp or caps i really like to have my quests page clean right guys right story i never thought that the story is the strongest feauture of the franchise and this game is no exception is the story bad no it isn t bad but i really think it could be so much better it had the potencial but it never was the feauture that kept me playing to the end sure you ll have some story surprises and a few moments of wow what s next buuuuut in such a large game i really think it could be better i miss karma such a nice feauture not present in this game overall 9 0 10 definitey doesn t disappoint it is a great game highly recomended
