2021 soooo i recommend this game it s a golden mine i love it and i ll play it whenever i have the chance to it s a good game here are the pros and cons of the game pros good graphics runs on low end pcs laptops easy to learn story mode viking conquest only lots of troops to choose from has steam workshop you can get lots of great mods out there like perisno medieval conquest bellum imperii etc fun to play lots of quests from training peasants to capturing lords cons pretty buggy sometimes quests may repeat themselves you ll have to repeat the same thing over and over it ll become boring at some pointoverall it s a good game buy it it s worth the money i will drink from your skull
