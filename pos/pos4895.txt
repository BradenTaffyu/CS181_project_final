2015 edit well this review ruffled a few feathers anyway i think a lot of people are right for saying that this review is not a proper review but more of a discussion piece so in response i d like to issue a brief genuine review for fo4 btw reviews are not summaries as some of you think you have to explain in detail an entire game for it to be a review it s a pretty good game i like it i find myself getting lost in time when i step into the world of fallout i have already done quite a bit and yet there is so much more i want to do collecting the power armor and giving them sweet paint jobs finding the collectables and displaying them in my sweet post nuclear bachelor pad and the excellent combat above all which i think is the most improved aspect from previous fallouts my only negative takeaway is maintaining the settlements i got to the point where i don t really care about the people in my settlements or whether or not they are happy the whole settlement happiness thing is stupid and it doesn t work in a lot of ways but fortunately it is completely irrelevant i m noticing almost all of the negative reviews for this game include the phrase this is a good game i m also noticing the vast majority of positive and negative reviews have 50 hours with most of those going 100 and this game has been out for less than a month at the time of this review it s just my opinion but i think if you get 100 hours of entertainment out of a game you got your moneys worth this is a great game folks the culture and atmosphere of fallout alone is worth the price of admission but you could have almost predicted that there would be a mixed response on one side you have classic fallout fans who want to prove that they liked fallout before it was cool by saying how much better the previous fallout games were on another side you have the people who pay 60 for a brand new game and try to run it on their 250 hp with a 2ghz processor that they bought at wallmart then lie and say they have a 12 core processor and 32 gigs of ram or something stupid you know who you are then you have the folks who know how to enjoy themselves and got everything they wanted out of this game if you like to play video games and you actually have fun doing it you wont be sorry you bought this game
