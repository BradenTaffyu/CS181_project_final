2018 early access review simply put if you enjoy oldschool roguelikes like adom angband nethack or even adventure mode dwarf fortress this game is going to absolutely consume every drop of your time i have been playing roguelikes since the early 90 s with nethack and have been in absolute love with the genre the entire time i haven t had this much fun with a roguelike in years the amount of current interactions possible between objects and mobs is just absolutely stunning with expansion baked in at the beginning for even more growth in the future a lot of otherwise great roguelikes i m looking at you angband were are very limited in the types of interactions you could have or mod on due to not having the foresight to code into the base engine an open ended entity handling system caves of qud has that in spades you can literally turn a door into a creature mentally possess it and gain levels and mutations as said door if you can get creatures to come near enough for it to attack still can t move you re a door to the point that this door is now a powerful esper able to shoot out lasers and set things on fire also you can learn teleport as a door and move somewhere else and that isn t even closest to the strangest thing i ve done yet pros incredibly rich lore discoverable in game through books and interactions with other characters vibrant world with multiple factions each with their own dynamic rating to each other scanline shaders optional highly moddable pre scripted lore driven quests and randomized questing as well dozens if not hundreds of ways to mangle your enemies or brefriend them your social interactions can turn hostile factions friendly every group and species is a faction yes you can make peace with the slimes hundreds of items and artifacts modifiable and craftable with tinkering skills built in security checks for mods user approval system to prevent malicious code and allow low level scripting this game is obviously a labor of love crafted with detail and patience that few if any aaa dev houses can match no f kdanm elves unless you mod them in now before i list the cons understand this is a pre release game fans of dwarf fortress will absolutely understand what i mean here that said even just what is playable now is so magnificently enjoyable that the following is easily forgivencons still occasionally buggy but far more free of bugs than i expected new mouse driven ui optional still needs work but is at this moment very functional and configurable no version checking yet for mods small mod community but it is early on and the current offerings are great signs of things to come updates will invalidate your savegames and make you cry i have and i am not ashamed of it some interactions buggy gamebreakingly so if you get too powerful as a psycher timewarping and reality bending extradimensional snails will hunt you note this is a feature the vast majority of the above cons are being actively worked on by the dev and we re still in early access so certain amounts of savegame breaking is forgiveable additionally several previous stable versions 40 at last count are all available under the beta options in the game properties and if an update breaks your savegame you can just roll back versions till you find one that will run it i cannot say enough good things about this game i will be actively and hungrily watching this game unfold as for the strangest thing i ve done so far well i was starving to death in a fungus forest and refused to eat my snapjaw hunter companion so in order to save my life i lured my evil twin into an ambush dismembered him cooked his arms into a delicious tart and wore his first face on my second head so i could be a better esper live and drink friend
