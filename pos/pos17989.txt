2017 total war rome ii total war rome ii is the sequel to the original total war rome it was met with spectacular criticisms alongside a video game launch akin to watching a car sputter up a hill only to inevitably fail while this sounds like a death sentence for what this game should be now it is actually only a tough time for a tough game this game is no different from the other total war games with most of the big gameplay mechanics staying true to the series there are slight variations to be noted such as the importance of life cycles and influence or gravitas as it is called it tw rome the launch coupled with the dlc policy makes this game seem like a flop after four years however the launch s initial ripples settled and when sales hit the game becomes significantly more affordable even with dlc pros visuals are crisp and realistic even after four years there is a wide variety of troops to learn about and choose for your playstyle sound design is particularly cutting the sounds of soldiers and war machines alike put you into the action technology tree is crucial to unlocking new battle techniques on both the offensive and defensive tradition and skill trees are both influential in gameplay with options ranging from basic like increasing missile damage by 3 to the grand changes like enabling defensive and morale buffs buildings in settlements are very diverse in both a singular faction and overall micromanagement of troops is and isn t a big deal this is confusing but to sum it up you need to ensure your general stays alive in order to keep fighting but you don t want him to not continually bolster your men by being too far away the setting is very appealing to roman history fans small bias lots of community created mods to further the playtime you will get out of this title cons game is still very expensive even after four years list of dlc longer than a month long grocery list optimization concerns the game runs as well as attila and can stutter during large battles ai can and will focus the player as soon as feasible the interface is a strong deterrant at first especially in comparison to other tw titles because it is an art style and not a classic total war unit picture launch was abysmal and holds sway on many other reviews even now negligible minor factions are very strong while having a faction of many cities can feel like playing on stilts it can all come crashing down very quickly ai as per usual is a little stupid conclusion total war rome ii had a terrible launch and it has dlc totalling the cost at nearly usd 150 the gameplay is set in the non fantasy type total war games and holds the same strategies rome ii in comparison to rome is visually and strategically superior that is if you like the more visceral and realistic visuals of attila or rome ii in comparison to say shogun ii or rome i recommend this title at a cheaper price even more so for the people still contemplating this purchase rome ii is a great game to help yourself become immersed in the time period and setting the combat is fleshed out and the community is still active today many of the reviews that make the launch the centerpiece of their review for this game are not completely accurate anymore would you buy a product that has improved if your friend bought it when it wasn t ready and is upset the game isn t perfect but neither are any of the other total war games it has many flaws and many reasons to purchase it this is why the recommendation is more leaning towards the consumer waiting for a sale buying the emperor edition which doesn t even include a significant portion of the dlc at usd 15 is a better deal that dropping usd 60 if you liked total war rome or the time period and history this is the game for you
