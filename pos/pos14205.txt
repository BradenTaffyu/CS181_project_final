2017 early access review i ve played this game for about 24 hours now and it s a really fun and addicting game it s a very good problem solving and managment game that has many features to keep in mind like making sure the stress is at a reasonable low presentage and having enough oxygen and food so that you dont starve and or sufficate it s a good game that s in the development stages and needs a lot of improvements
