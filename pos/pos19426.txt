alright fallout new vegas is done and dusted this is idk maybe the tenth time i ve played through the base game and probably sixth or seventh time completing all the dlc as well first time not on console though this run took a bit over seventy hours with all major content completed and probably half of the side content fallout new vegas a screenshot of fallout new vegas by robilar5500 stability is going to be a factor for most people playing this game so i thought i d talk about my experience having played this exclusively on the steam deck with no mods fps on maxed settings was consistently around 60 there were no instances of stuttering on occasion while in vats the game would freeze for a couple seconds and during the endgame it crashed twice during area transitions the dlc crashed a bit more but i detailed that in the reviews i previously wrote for each so all in all performance was shockingly great it was definitely a bug ridden mess on console and i understand it hasn t responded well to newer pc rigs either but new vegas seems well suited to being played through proton fallout new vegas a screenshot of fallout new vegas by robilar5500 as far as the actual game experience it still held up perfectly well it s a game that despite having aged significantly still looks great plays great and sounds great in many ways this is still superior to plenty of modern era games which isn t to say it is without issues depending on the order in which you complete quests the dialogue might still assume you are in an earlier stage of the game and with so many different things possible the game does get confused by player actions at times that s one of the more notable issues also the open world traversal isn t always seamless sometimes for example you can be on just the other side of a ridge from an area or objective but you can t go over the ridge instead you have to trek all the way around lol all i m saying is dude should not have let me walk in with stealthboys and grenades a screenshot of fallout new vegas by robilar5500 regardless of the above though most of the systems in the game compliment each other and work well even today i d guess this game still has quite a number of years of life left in it you might have to work to get it running but once you do it s a quality game that deserves to be experienced by everyone it s a true and legendary piece of gaming history do yourself a favor and buy the ultimate edition though rather than buying the dlc separate if you don t already own it it s a huge step up from the base game version as far as content available if you found this review helpful and would be interested in supporting my curator group robilar s reviews it would be appreciated cheers
