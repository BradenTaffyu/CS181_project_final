2018 early access review have you ever looked at dwarf fortress and said to yourself i d like to play that but the ascii graphics and developer style ui put me off well look no further rimworld is basically df but with pretty graphics a sci fi story and no z levels to worry about additionally rimworld boasts pawns the units you control who you ll feel much more attached to since even advanced settlements rarely have more than about a dozen and most of those are gotten through the labor intensive process of downing a raider healing them back to health then gradually wearing down their resistance to joining your settlement over weeks or months no worrying what to do with elite soapmakers here bonus out on the rim morals are what you want to make of them sure common decency would tell you to bury the corpses of the dead however they did try to kill you so why not turn them into valuable meat and leather even if your own pawns are a little too squeamish to feast on the flesh of the dead there are usually native settlements that are willing to pay good silver in trade
