2019 if you re new to the series i highly recommend starting with the first game as dark souls iii is full of fanservice and heavily references the original game not to mention that the original dark souls is generally regarded as the best entry in the series with that out of the way here s what i liked and disliked about dark souls iii and also some words about its pc port pros it s the prettiest dark souls game the moody dark fantasy world realized in current generation graphics is a marvel to behold all the armor sets and enemy animations are very well done and full of little details the combat is much more fast paced and very fluid you have a lot of fine control over your every little move there are many quality of life improvements over previous dark souls games e g the covenants are just items that go in a special equipment slot you can respec and change your appearance you can change your weapon s infusion while keeping its upgrade level you no longer look like beef jerky when you die unless spoilers fashion souls there s a lot of armor clothing sets in this game and you can wear them on the looks alone for better or worse there s actually very little difference between various armor sets defense wise and none of them can be upgraded so no need to grind for that either some really cool secret endings cons poise is now basically useless it only activates during the wind up animations of heavy and ultra heavy weapons the so called hyper armor mechanic even if you re wearing full havel set you will still be staggered by rats sure it makes the combat more risky and rewards being aggressive but i don t think that removing an already established mechanic from the game is good design i d be fine with this trade off but heavy and ultra heavy weapons aren t very useful in this game the combat is very fast paced the enemies are very aggressive which means that you will be mostly rolling and attacking with straight swords some bosses and enemy types would be very difficult to engage with a slow heavy weapon while simply spamming light attacks with a straight sword completely trivializes them the game just loves spawning groups of enemies to stunlock you and it also spawns enemies behind you or drops them from the ceiling predictably this results in a lot of cheap deaths until you git gud and memorize their spawn points the bosses are very flashy and usually have multiple phases however unlike the regular enemies they pose very little challenge i beat the vast majority of the bosses on my 1st or 2nd try only some of the optional and dlc bosses are truly difficult some things are really obtuse you re not going to complete most npc quest lines or find secret levels like untended graves or archdragon peak on your own i mean why would anyone attack a random statue in a random room or use a particular gesture in a seemingly unimportant place pc port no cloud save support this is just silly at this point i lost a 10 hour save because i got a new ssd and had to reinstall windows the steam cloud api is very user friendly and it shouldn t take much time at all to enable it on the developer s end dark souls remastered had it why not here as well xbox controller button prompts only no mouse keyboard or dualshock button prompts not a big deal for me personally as i always use a controller with these games but it s a shame regardless and again this feature was available in dark souls remastered it s baffling that it s not here as well very poor anti aliasing support only offers some basic fxaa can t really get rid of the jaggies unless you have a really powerful gpu and just downsample from 4k or higher don t believe the screenshots on the store page those are staged and heavily edited generally runs very well but some areas like archdragon peak have weird 1 2 sec lag spikes where my framerate drops to 50 s or mid 40 s on the whole the graphics settings don t seem to matter much and won t affect your performance in any impactful way i played it on max settings and 1080p on a gtx 1070 ti and it ran at 60 fps which is the cap 99 of the time overall dark souls iii is a flawed game but still leaps and bounds better than most western aaa games as it focuses on the gameplay first and foremost and doesn t just hold your hand through the cutscenes
