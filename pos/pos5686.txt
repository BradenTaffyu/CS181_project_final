wait for sale period coming from a guy who spent over 600 hrs in this game most people can enjoy it for about 100 hrs early and mid game are very fun but there is literally no late game in fact a lot of the mechanics taleworlds put in such as lord re spawns peace offerings raiding actively makes a non existent late game worse taleworlds have all but abandoned the game the new features they are adding are more about spectacle rather than actually solving the lack of late game content
