2019 i think it s a very fun survival game i thoroughly enjoy how everything builds upon itself i think the situations and things to find are great klei has done a terrific job with the various systems there is a lot to discover a lot to mess up and most of the time it s something i didn t anticipate happening other times it s just frustrating ai or requirements that aren t clearly spelled out having said that here are my gripes i think rockets are bolted on at the end and don t really fit the theme once you can use them there s very little else to do but tediously manage your rockets i liked finding stuff but when rockets take a dozen cycles to set up a dozen or more to launch return it gets old fast finish the encyclopedia i really hate having to look up stuff on the internet because the encyclopedia is either actually missing or incomplete it would be a much better experience if everything was in the encyclopedia such as all inputs outputs of a building all relevant information about the critter and its morphs some good encylopedia info on the jobs and the job buildings would be great this game has so much available to you but half of it is never ever mentioned
