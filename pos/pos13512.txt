2015 kerbal space program was the first early access game i ever bothered to try and it turned out to have been a great decision ksp has evovled into a stunningly fun and creative game that packs not only surprisingly well done physics together and perfectly decent graphics with infinite replayability and different game modes but also a small dose of witty comedy i think an important thing to realize with ksp is that yes kerbals that live on planet kerbin essentially the astronauts that you get to have inside the space crafts you build do have a minionesque comical look but in no actual way does this really ever affect the simulation aspect of the game it still packs in a pretty hardcore simulator with the actual ship resources like fuel electricity and mono propellant having to be carefully managed during advanced missions successfully piloting a craft and docking with a space station is seriously no joke flight dynamics are also very realistic with you actually having to have at least a rudimentary understanding of how a rocket or airplane works in order to have one you designed actually ever get off the ground all in all this provides a game that has you spending hours designing a ship straight out of your imagination using a very wide variety of parts in order to accomplish any mission you could think of like launching from kerbin landing on the mun moon and then returning those happy little guys back home all of this happens while constantly having chuckles at the witty ship part descriptions while in build mode or the quirkiness of the kerbins that you re having go on eva s outside your space station mod support is huge and makes the game essentially extendable to anything you could possibly ever want from a space sim if you like space sims you will like this trust me
