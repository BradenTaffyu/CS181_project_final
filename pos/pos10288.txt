2022 holy this is like one of the best games i ve ever played in my entire liferandomly generated worlds characters scenarios based on what words you choose to put in the seeds box you can literally put racial slurs in the box and it ll give you an overwhelmingly beautiful world filled with fascinating biomes and factions all characters with their different backstory roles in both the communities they re in and in combat and these are just without the mods you can be a pacifist colony trying to make every faction befriend you maybe start a beneficial and dystopian trading company where you take advantage of other communities maybe you re on the psychotic side manage a cannibalistic tribe of people get pets to defend your characters and help with hauling items to storage or get turrets to defend your home against raiders that appear every once in a while get your guy laid by the most beautiful woman or pillage the town for not letting your guy lay the girl with the mods everything is possible you can roleplay as different crossover factions have thousands more clothing and weaponry choices maybe you like dressing your characters up as anime girls or maybe you want to see blood by letting highly advanced soldiers from another world invade your colony the base game has limitless possibilities and adding mods just makes it that you ll never be able to see the end of every single playthrough before you succumb to your age summary worth the price absolutely for any rng survival lovers or just roleplayers and thousands of mods are also included worth learning some parts of the game are hard to understand but mess around with the controls until you make it work is a solution same with looking up google for thousands of tutorials and steam guides on how to make rimworld work there are also a lot of mods that make life easier for you while playing the game graphics up to date it s a 2d game where all characters don t have limbs but the animations are so smooth it compensates the 2d graphics which is also pretty clean and cute looking oh yeah mods also solve this problem by making the drawings cleaner and the animations even smoother bugs 50 hours in haven t seen any yet at least not anything noticeable that makes you think damn that s a bug even if there are any bugs remember mods solve everything 9 7 10 game
