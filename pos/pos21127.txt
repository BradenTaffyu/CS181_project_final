2023 i ve been playing a lot of slime rancher lately and it s one of the most fun games i ve played in a long time it s a simple game on the surface you re a slime rancher and you have to collect slimes raise them and sell their plorts to make money but there s something about the game that s just incredibly addictive one of the things i like most about the game is being able to mix different slime types to make new slimes it s like a science experiment and it s never boring to see what kind of new slime you ll create i ve made quantum slimes crystal slimes and even radioactive slimes it s all a blast the game s core gameplay loop is collect to level up to be able to collect more and level up again it s a simple loop but it s incredibly satisfying as you collect more slimes and earn more money you can upgrade your ranch and buy new equipment which allows you to collect even more slimes and earn even more money it s a vicious cycle and i love it my favorite type of slime is the quantum slime these slimes are unpredictable and they can teleport from one place to another at will it makes them a challenge to keep but it s also a lot of fun i once had a quantum slime that teleported into a puddle of acid and dissolved it was hilarious and it s just one of the many reasons why i love this game if you re looking for a fun and addictive game to play i highly recommend slime rancher just take your time and don t rush some slimes are harder to keep than others and for the love of god don t let your quantum slimes near any acid
