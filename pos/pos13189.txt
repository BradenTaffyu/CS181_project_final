2015 kerbal space program aka one thousand ways to definitely not build a rocket coming from a physicist i love this game and all of my physics math cs engineering friends love it too granted that s a pretty narrow selection of people but judging from all the other good reviews i d say our opinions reflect the general consensus you should buy this game then you should go tell everyone you know about it then maybe public opinion on space exploration will get a bit of a nudge back toward where it belongs
