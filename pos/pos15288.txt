2020 this game is one of a kind totally worth a shot if you re looking for something new it s a very challenging game especially for begginers good for keeping you on your toes every character has its own unique mechanics and background story and even though the game is almost 4 yo the developers keep releasing content either by implementing new mechanics and items or by reworking older characters releasing new ones overall great survival game the art reminds me of tim burton s style which harmonizes well with the game itself totally recomend it if you re in for a great experience
