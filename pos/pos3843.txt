2023 having played troubleshooter for over 500 hours now i feel i have a good grasp on what the game has to offer and it s not hard to guess that i intend to recommend it however i m going to start with the biggest problem first since while it appeals very strongly to a specific kind of gamer many would be put off by its structure and more importantly its pacing as many other reviews have pointed out one of the most difficult challenges of getting into troubleshooter is its very slow start to put it bluntly everything about the early game is slow missions are slow leveling up is slow getting new masteries is slow unlocking new characters is slow missions can very in length but on hard or above there are so many enemies that missions will likely take at least 45 minutes possibly well over an hour although to the game s credit it warns you about this the gameplay follows the x com format of having two action points per turn on a square grid with moving taking one and dashing and attacking taking two turn based combat is rarely fast and troubleshooter is no exception to make things worse this is also when the best feature of the game the mastery system is at its weakest the mastery system is at the core of troubleshooter and it is the reason why troubleshooter stands out among its peers essentially masteries are mainly drops from enemies that provide specific benefits when equipped to a player character they can also be unlocking by leveling up character classes or completing specific achievements these are inserted into character specific mastery boards and only those which are equipped provide any benefit these can vary from reducing the cooldown on abilities to increased damage or improved defense or healing furthermore certain sets of usually four masteries can be equipped simultaneously to form a mastery set bonus and these can be very powerful effects typically being much more impactful than individual masteries many masteries are used multiple times in different sets adding an additional layer of strategy to creating mastery boards this brief description is however underselling what is one of the best implemented systems for character customization i ve ever come across it s shame then that its first impression is so mediocre in the beginning of the game you won t have many slots unlocked for masteries as more slots only become available at certain level requirements additionally the masteries from both basic and advanced character classes will only be partially unlocked and these are some of the most powerful and interesting abilities in the game this means that in the early game not only suffers from having few masteries unlocked but also few slots in which to place them the choice of mastery sets is even more restrictive with the total available to the player being around a dozen for much of the early game to put that into perspective with all dlc there are currently over 800 masteries and over 500 mastery sets even 500 hours later i still don t have them all unfortunately none of this depth will be available to new players and i could easily see someone put 15 20 hours into it only to get bored i myself have taken several extended breaks from the game due to feeling like i wasn t progressing quickly enough even so the sheer depth of the mechanics and the constant updates eventually drag me back to it time and time again the mastery system deserves special attention so i will be expanding upon it here masteries are all classified as one of basic attack ability support and defense they each slot into a sub board of that specific type each mastery has its own cost ranging from 0 4 and takes up one slot on the board in order to equip a mastery you must have at least one slot open of that type and the total cost of all equipped masteries must be equal to or below that total for example if my attack board had one slot open and a total cost of 10 12 i would be able to add a two cost mastery for 12 12 but not a three cost one since 13 12 would be forbidden each character has their own set of abilities tied to their basic and advanced class there are 9 characters in the base game and 12 with all dlc each with two advanced classes some classes are shared between characters like martial artist black mage or battle mage while others like great swordsman barbarian or superstar are unique to specific characters these class locked masteries are generally more powerful then general masteries usable by everyone which helps to give each character their own unique identity even characters which share classes feel distinct thanks to their esp type fire wind earth spirit etc and their individual mastery unique to them which is not part of their mastery board the mastery system s complexity is also a double edged sword and players will have to balance physical vs esp damage hit chance critical hit chance speed ability cool down and cast delay there is a lot to consider saying nothing of gearing or ability selection using guides is almost mandatory when starting out especially given the relatively poor tutorial and introduction the the game s mechanics players who truly want to min max their characters and get the most out of the mastery system will have to spend as much time or even more time out of combat then in combat and that s saying something if that sounds about as fun to you as playing with an excel spreadsheet this game probably isn t for you for me the number of viable builds per class is the greatest achievement of troubleshooter there are so many ways the create builds which play and feel very different to each other even for the same class and character certain classes are so flexible they can fulfill any role from glass cannon to support tank though others like black mage are more limited in scope even so with the right masteries gearing and abilities the options that you have for each team member is overwhelming in both the positive and negative meanings of the word normally the dev team would be a strange thing to mention in a review beyond simply thanking them for their effort but i feel the fact that dandylion consists only 6 six core devs is worth noting the amount of content and rate of updates bug fixes and patches already among the most frequent i ve ever seen becomes even more impressive dandylion clearly love troubleshooter and their endless dedication to it is incredible i ve rarely seen a bug and never had the game crash while i was playing it and for a game as complex as troubleshooter that s a great achievement i have a few minor criticisms here and there such as how the story is meandering and unfocused though the cast is likable how the 3d models look dated how the ui isn t the best some balance issues or how the translation is somewhat lacking but serviceable at the end of the day however a game lives and dies on its core mechanics and troubleshooter s are very very good in conclusion should you buy troubleshooter if you are looking for a simple pick up and play experience i can t recommend it but if you are willing to invest the time into it so that the mechanics reveal themselves in all their complexity you ll find a lot to love there s always another mastery to unlock another build to try another challenge to overcome if you can get past the initial grueling start you ll be rewarded with some of the best turn based combat you ll find anywhere and hundreds of hours of entertainment best money i ve ever spent
