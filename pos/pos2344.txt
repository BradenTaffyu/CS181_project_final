2021 i don t doubt that when this game came out it was a complete dumpster fire and if you said tod howard was a lying bottom feeder i would agree that out of the way this game in it s current state is actually not bad by any measure the servers can kind of hickup sometimes but overall the experience for me personally has been that of enjoyment on sale i d say give it a shot
