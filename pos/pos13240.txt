2021 why are you even reading this you should be exploding rockets already it doesn t matter if you like physics space designing rockets or planes as long as you like building stuff and blowing it up you re going to enjoy this game you can make it to orbit with barely any knowledge and after a short guide or video to the mun yes your creations will blow up over and over but eventually you will get the basics and after that reaching low earth orbit will be really easy then the real challenge begins docking making stations going to other planets refueling etc for those who prefer to stay on earth planes and land vehicles are a thing in this game in fact i started building planes before attempting to make a rocket but unless you mod it there are not as many parts as rockets have lots of way to challenge yourself and there are a lot of mods that expand on this amazing game so you can pretty much create any vehicle you want ksp is a game that has something for almost everyone give it a try for certain reasons i can not disclosure i have way more hours in this game than what steam says i do probably more than 1000h
