2019 there is so much to explore in this game i love the lore and the characters i think the dlcs are worth it if you buy the game of the year edition during sale i spent almost all of my winter vacation playing this game i m not even close to exploring every thing in this game there were a lot of bugs when the gane was first released but know i didn t experience any bugs except the mods conflicting i hope bethesda makes the next game in ths franchise better than fallout 76
