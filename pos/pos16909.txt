2020 while very simple in concept the difficulty curve to actually be successful is very high the simple layout structure also makes the replay value a bit subjective you could easily finish a game in an hour or less and after a few attempts you may feel as if you have seen everything even if you aren t winning often on the other hand if you appreciate the depth of the options and don t mind staring at a world map for hours this could easily be a game you play forever repeatedly the actual game play isn t that intense either most of your time is spent watching a pandemic spread and popping bubbles for points to spend on evolving it the depth comes from your mutation choices carefully balancing infection rates against symptoms once you start adding symptoms the pandemic will be noticed by health officials and research for a cure begins and a cure means you lose since you are the pandemic trying to kill the world while it is pretty easy to actually infect most if not all of the population it s not fatal until you add symptoms and you ll find you won t have enough evolution points to do everything fast enough so to win you have to balance the spending of points between effective transmission while still having points left over for lethal symptoms and getting both done before a cure is researched what you are left with is a cerebral experience the depth of the game is in concept designing your pandemic and deploying it in a timely manner but the actual game play experience is a lot of waiting with speed up options and clicker gameplay bubble popping for evolution points it s fun simple to play hard to master but the amount of time you ll get out of it really depends on your game tastes i like the puzzle management undertones so i ll probably keep playing but at the same time i can see a lot of people being easily distracted away from it to a more exciting game i guess i d suggest buying it on sale for the 6 i paid for it i know i ll get my fun out of it at 15 i d have to wonder if staring at a world map clicking bubbles was worth the price of admission while you are here would you consider following my curator page want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones
