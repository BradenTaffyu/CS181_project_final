2018 stellaris is an amazing grand strategy game of all of paradox s works this one is my favorite and one of the easier ones to get a hang of this game will suck you in for hours at a time you will get your moneys worth when it comes to time spent if you re a sci fi nerd like i am you will love this game even more the soundtrack is really nice and does a good job in keeping you as relaxed as possible the dlc s are pretty nice and add nice content although some of them are overpriced like the humanoids species pack they are not necessary to have a good time however i do recomment them especially for my fellow sci fi geeks out there either at the base price or sale price this game is worth it if you like sci fi strategy space empire games buy it and enjoy
