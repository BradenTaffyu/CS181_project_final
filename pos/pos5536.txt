2019 early access review on an island in the river svy i creep step by careful step through rotted foamcrete ruins i clutch my folded carbide blades but they are no protection if the madpoles find me i hew my way through shimscale mangrove trees until at last i stand before a glass enclosure a standing rectangle of neutrofoam with imprints of a human form welcome aristocrat to a becoming nook you are one step closer to the grand unificationmy shaking fingers make my will known to the machine my shaking legs take their last steps into place white light suffuses me and for a moment i am one with the long lost eaters of the earth you are becomingmy legs are columns of cold fire i bid goodbye to my lower half the madpoles may have it now for all i care you are becominga song of grinding metal joy fills the neutrofoam tetraxenoglass vibrates in sympathy i have heard the same music in my night vision eyes my carbide hand bones my dermal plating but never as loud as this you have becomethe song dies away the machine is still i return to the world on mighty metal treads that turn to locomote i have escaped the confines of bipetal motion i will never fear a madpole again
