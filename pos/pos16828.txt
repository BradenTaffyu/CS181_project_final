2019 my review about the hgtv dlc is found here flipper is one of those casual games that will easily suck hours from your day just from doing simple work it s one of those things that is just relaxing letting you clean build a house of your wanting having spent 80 hours to 100 complete it at least until the new hgtv dlc comes out i figured i should finally leave my thoughts on the game now the style is a lot like the popular simulator games sort of like viscera cleanup detail and truck simulator where you go into houses that were destroyed or left in a terrible state and you do your magic to clean it build it and decorate it to please the people that hired you or to people that are looking to buy a house it s that simple concept that will just suck you into the game and then before you know it you spent a whole day working on 1 house maximizing the most profit on the house so you can buy the next one and do it all over again level up your skills to perform tasks better and easier use the money earned to purchase better items and such sounds great right well sort of there is some pretty big issues here the first one being that most houses really start to feel the same and some even have the exact same layout this is extremely disappointing when you can buy 4 different houses and all 4 are the same minus some small details outside being different you won t be able to change much of the outside of the house either did you want to change the windows well you can t even though the game gives you the option to buy windows you can t add remove outside walls which i do understand why they don t let you but i was hoping that there would be at least a few plots that would let you build your own entire house from scratch but that sadly doesn t exist there is 1 plot that is part of the garden dlc that has an empty 2 story house that has no inside walls so you can do what ever you want in this one but like i said it s in the paid dlc speaking of the dlc the price for the dlc is way too high i bought it when it was on sale but even then it still cost me 14 then it went cheaper a few weeks later for black friday it has some decent amount of content but i still feel like this should have been part of the game to begin with it drove me bonkers in the base game that i could not do anything with the outside of places until i bought the dlc even after buying it it doesn t effect the house price unless you enter the garden competitions which depending on what one you choose require certain items setups for things to count it takes work but can easily double the house cost if done right the biggest problem i had with the dlc though was after i bought and installed it i started having more framerate issues due to now having more stuff spawn in the houses and more items to clean up but by far the biggest problem i have with this game is the real lack of items customizations yes i m serious there really isn t a whole lot of items to place and some things have the option to change colours designs but even those are really limited or just plain ugly there was lots of furniture that i avoided all together cause they looked like they came out of the cheap knock off store from the 70s this might be because the game was made more for a uk europe audience due to all the fixtures plumbing also being built for those styles as a north american it can look a little weird for us due to our building codes being different but in the end are still similar i only mentioned it cause i know there will be some people that complain about this kind of thing now there is some things that i feel that should be added that could easily make this game even better the first one being that this game screams to have a coop option in it can you imagine the amount of fun you could have if you and a friend could work together on a place i ve live streamed a buddy of mine showing it off to him and the first thing he asked was is this game coop sadly it s not but could you imagine the second is modding support allow people to make new custom houses and items for the game but we know that s not going to happen the devs don t want that so they can sell the dlc to add limited stuff this is a big miss cause just the workshop alone could add thousands of hours of content for people to build and play with the only real custom content you can add is photos and that s about it so yes if you wanted to hang a bunch of smut around houses you can with that said and 80 hours to complete it i still enjoyed it it s with those issues that i stated that makes the game hard to fully recommend if you don t mind the issues i stated then by all means pick up the game when it s on a good sale you can easily get the hours out of it but if the lack of real customization and repetitive nature doesn t sound fun to you then avoid it my currator page for my other reviews
