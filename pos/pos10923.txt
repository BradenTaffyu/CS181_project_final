2016 my first impression of hearts of iron iv was pretty bad garishly coloured map with little toy solders wandering around they ve turned my beloved hearts of iron into a kids game were the words crossing my lips as i panned around the map i almost had to force myself to play i m glad i did the first hook was the production system after receiving a message that the italians had air supremacy over the central mediterranean i panned the map and soon realised my airbase at malta was still flying gladiators these old fighters were getting pummelled by more modern aircraft i checked what factories i had producing hurricanes and could see the weekly numbers coming out of the factories were far too low i retooled other factories to increase hurricane production and prioritised them to go straight to malta these are the decisions i should be making in my position as cic of my counties war effort the game s production system throws lots at challenges at you throughout the war and they are all fun and interesting to think about and they all read like they re straight out of a wwii history book next hook battleplans they are rather rudimentary at present and can easily go wrong or get confused but in essance you can control the overall thrust of your armies without ordering individual units if you want to order individual units you can and once they have carried out your orders they return to the battleplan for playing a country like the uk where you could be overseeing fighting in the far east middle east and europe they are a godsend no longer do you have to concentrate on one threatre and worry you are getting hammered somewhere else in the world it s certainly a good idea to keep a check on what your troops are doing with their battleplans and to reset them from time to time but at least you can be relieved of some micromanagement duties i think that over time paradox will make battleplans a lot better there are already improvements coming in the 1st patch that sound like they will help next hook see battles there are a lot of things with sea battle that annoy me most notibly the doom stacks of navies forcing the player to use his own doomstacks i also don t like seeing fleets with carriers battleships and subs in the same fleet if that s what they are every nation seems to want to re create jutland whereas in reality most naval engagements in wwii were between far small numbers of ships however in the hope that paradox will address this issue the basics of naval engagements are very sound and they are interesting to watch aircraft big ships screens subs and transports are all displayed on a map and a text display will tell you who is firing at who it s very interesting to watch each navel battle a definite step up from previous hoi titles next hook air warfare although it seems a little basic at first and this will doubtless be filled by a dlc at some point in the future the air war actually works quite well after assigning aircraft to their roles you can see which areas are contested and are able to watch the number of aircraft change as casualties mount and replacements are brought in the areas that aircraft operate in are huge just one for the whole of southern england but this keeps things simpler for the ai and for the player in my uk game i actually witnessed a battle of britain where the luftwaffe seriously attacked the south of england followed by other regions i had to re deploy fighters to various bases hoping to avoid inefficient coverage for my shorter ranged fighters and at times the numbers were quite on the edge with the luftwaffe deploying more than 700 fighters and bombers over the south of england and me managing to field some 8 900 to eventually wear them down despite being relatively simple as it was foughter over just 2 3 regions it was the most interested and closest battle of britain i ve experience in a hoi game i really look forward to this being fleshed out further there are many other great features in the game and paradox has really tried to make wwii mamageable with some of the tedious details streamlined leaving the player to concentrate on interesting decisions and decisions more appropriate to the cic level of command the player is assuming there are things from previous hoi games i miss but overall i am enjoying playing hoi4 more than any previous version i would add that in theory hoi3 was my perfect game if that game were described to me i would be certain it would be my perfect game unfortunately in reality i played it less than any other hoi game the first time i played i really enjoyed changing the oob so i had my armies exactly as i wanted them the next time i played still learning the game i was less impressed to do the same changes all over again and following on from that i would actually not want to start a new game because i knew i would have to spend hours changing the oob to fit my plans despite my love of hoi4 and the way the series has evolved there are major problems at release in most of my games italy attacks france way before germany declares war in real life that would never have happened i ve also seen germany not declare war on ussr until late 1942 and then remove all it s divisions from the border to declare war on and attack yugoslavia i ve fought japanese troops in africa had italy conduct a naval invasion of france from the english channel the list goes on and it s all rather depressing the ai is ok in a limited area and time frame but when unleashed across so many countries over so long a period it s only a matter of time before some immersion shattering event happens i can cope with this as i learn the game and enjoy the new mechanics but it will soon get very frustrating and needs to be sorted out asap and that is no easy challenge so i think hoi4 is great when i ve played as the uk it gives me a perfect amount of decision making without too many of those i can t really be bothered things to do i can pan around the map and watch the war effort tuning into more detail where i see fit i can correct issues play with production design new divisions and then delve into what is happening to the desert rats in aftica while watching my subs in the med attacking convoys supplying italian troops i also applaud the paradox devs for their forward thinking and not just churning out the same game with some revisions but actually trying to do something new there s a lot that new in hoi4 and it s going to work really well i d like to buy whoever designed the production system a beer it does need to be fixed though it was probably released 6 months too soon but i m glad it was because despite the problems i ve having a fantastic time playing it and am happy to be along for the ride as the patches and then dlc refine it into what it should be and then what it could be with this brilliant base game they have designed
