2017 our men flee the field of battle this is a shameful display i ve put 53 hours into this game from sunday night to saturday morning i became so determined to take the exact area that real life rome held that i just couldn t quit playing lol i fought some of the most brutal battles i ve ever faught in a video game at one point being outnumbered 5300 2300 and killing over 3300 of their men before my last unit fell if you like civilization i d say give this game or one of the other tw s i haven t tried them but based on the vids i ve watched they all play largely the same you can basically play the entire game like a more complex civ on a smaller map locked into roman times due to this the map feels quite massive but you have the added bonus of being able to actually fight the battle and control the troops rts style allowing you to pull off wins in battles that the quick battle claimed you were going to get slaughtered in lol though sometimes the result is the same or thereabouts i played much of the second half of my war for the roman empire taking what was the eastern empire and i did the vast majority of that as i would have in civ but the few times i took direct command i pulled either wins or significantly more damage on the enemy than what quick match was going to do i overlooked this series and i wish i hadn t as this is the most fun i ve had with a game in quite some time and i am going to continue to play it and will be buying other tw games later down the road do yourself a favor if you like rts or any of the civ games whether it be civ v or even gal civ watch some vids on this or one of the other tw games and see what you think and give the game a chance i have 97 hours into gal civ and 65 in civ v and as much as i like both of those games i have no doubt that i will pass them both up with the amount of time i put into this game
