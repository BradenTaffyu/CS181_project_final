2017 divinity original sin 2 is not just the best rpg of the last couple of years it s one of the all time greats in the genre harkening back to the golden era of fallout planescape torment baldur s gate and the likes it fully deserves to stand alongside those greats it s hard to explain how enjoyable the game is it refines and improves almost everything from the original divinity original sin the attention to detail environments quests voice acting combat etc are all fantastic the addition of multiplayer is absurdly fun and just the sheer variety the game offers is something else entirely it s such a smooth rpg experience but so polished and still retains the things that made old school crpgs so great everything comes together to make this atmospheric experience from the music to the writing and to the mechanics themselves the best game i ve played in some time and an absolute must buy for any rpg fan
