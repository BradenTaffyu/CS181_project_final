2021 although i prefer the crusader kings franchise because it generates more personal stories the europa universalis series is also good this current installment obviously shows its age after over 9 years since launch especially when it comes to ui and graphics but it s still being updated regularly and getting new expansions and that should be great but actually it isn t my biggest issue with this title is that after each update our saved games become incompatible with the current version and given that a single game takes dozens of hours it s unlikely that you ll be able to finish unless you don t update this is so bizarre i m not going into the dlc policy and their occasional bad launches although it s something that people should notice and consider but i have to point out the extremely steep learning curve paradox s games always suffer from this and their tutorials are always insufficient you ll have to do some research to get the hang of the game and all its menus and buttons when you do you ll realize that eu4 even with all dlcs is not as complex as it initially seemed and this can be another problem if you can get past all that there s a good although not great historical strategy game underneath that deals with military scientific economic diplomatic religious and social facets of running a nation what i like the most is that the nations have missions that relate to their actual history but you can deviate from that and give them a very different destiny
