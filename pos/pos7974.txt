2019 early access review it is a godly representation of automobile physics and it runs significantly smooth considering the level of its complexity i run a asus 320m k motherboardgtx 1050ti gpuryzen 3 cpu16gb ddr4 ramsamsung evo ssdnothing fancy really and it runs buttery smooth for the most part unless i introduce more than 3 or 4 vehicles in the same area of work i love this game to hell and back every experience is unique and i have honestly yet to master any of the editing tools the possibilities are endless and creativity is the focus of this project part science part fun it is truly beautiful the one and only thing i absolutely can not get over is that the tires do not collide with the body of the car i know it must be a huge problem to solve considering how many equations would have to happen for it to be accurate but it bothers me a lot i also wish there was tire wear and pop thread progress etc besides that one thing i absolutely recommend this game to anyone seeking endless fun creativity and is simply a curious mind p s this game is the most realistic simulator in car physics i have ever heard of or come across so good luck building a rear wheel drive drift machine cause here it actually takes skill truly beautiful thanks to all the developers for allowing such an amazing creation to exist
