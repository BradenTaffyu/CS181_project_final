2020 overall the gameplay itself is fun enough and it is pretty much like fallout 4 multiplayer with a different story and map however there is a major problem that plagues this game and that prevents a lot of long term players i think the system is currently designed to not encourage long term playtime so as a result fallout 76 does not have many long term players the issue plaguing fallout 76 is the stash limit 800 is just not enough i have only played for a few weeks yet in those few weeks i have managed to fill up my account s stash and an alt account s stash i am now full and i constantly have to worry about inventory management for a game that encourages exploration collecting and hoarding they punish you for doing just these things when you want to reap the rewards of your labor and limiting how much you can even have at one time this stash limit sounds reasonable at first glance but if you actually play the game 800 is nothing and will be filled up in no time i just hate that a game that encourages exploration and collection is so highly discouraging both by limiting so lowly what you can have even if i m able to clear out some of my stash and empty some things i will always have to battle with my stash and constantly do stash and inventory management how is this fun in any way it detracts from the game it doesn t balance anything out and it just prevents players from playing longer than a few weeks and giving up after being frustrated with inventory management if the stash issue is fixed this game would be very playable and fun but because of the stash issue it is almost unplayable for me anymore they should add a way to increase the stash limit or just remove it entirely it should increase as you level up or pay caps to increase it better yet remove the stash limit i assure you this will make fallout great again and worth playing long term
