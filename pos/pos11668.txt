2014 early access review so where to begin first off i ve really really enjoyed this game so far granted it s only been four hours of gameplay but that s from a general lack of free time more than anything else i will almost certainly have a different point of view than anyone who started playing earlier in the alpha so bear that in mind my opinion will not have been infected no pun intended by having to have played through any broken builds i ll also try to be concise to begin a mix of dayz and minecraft really is a great way to describe the gameplay though the zombies are more of a menace than they have been in dayz for a while next yes there is only one world it is fairly large though so i expect to get another 10 15 hours out of play into it before i might start getting sick of it and that s assuming that there s nothing interesting underground that being said there is a random world generation option coming if i get bored with this world before it is released then i ll just shelve the game and come back to it once it is an option more than anything else i highly recommend that you play with friends while playing solo was fun playing with a friend or two definitely makes the game more enjoyable this game is fairly difficult i ve only been playing on the medium difficulty and i still have to be very careful to be in a safe place by nightfall as for how well it runs well i have a decent rig with a 2gb video card and the game on a solid state drive with this setup i can run everything on maximum with no frame loss or lag whatsoever the only bug i ve encountered so far is with the zombie dogs their pathing is rough they re hard to hit when near because they usually spin in circles between attacks and they occasionally glitch through walls speaking of bugs the big flying ones are super annoying and really the only thing i ve found thus far that i dislike in conclusion if you enjoy zombie themed survival games enjoy games like minecraft and can get a friend or two to play with you will almost certainly enjoy this game i have so far even when playing alone and i feel like it was worth every penny even in it s current state i look forward to getting to continue playing this game as it is developed
