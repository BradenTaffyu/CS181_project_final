2021 this is a solid recommend of a game for anybody of the roguelite or rpg persuasion a must if you like magic the gathering slay the spire has many excellent qualities that make it into my top 100 list at the time of writing this is 29th slay the spire gives you opportunities to really tweak your gameplay on a personal level on why i love playing casual mtg so much it s because i can really express myself in how i want to play with mtg the same could be said for sts anyway time to break this down into component parts gameplayoverall it is excellent it s very intuitive and has excellent tooltips it is a card based game every turn you have a set amount of mana and you draw 5 cards any cards in your last hand are lost to your discard pile to be shuffled again later in play it also lets you click a card and you can see a small preview of what the card will do so you don t need to do all the math there is some math involved nothing escapes math children today think that computers run on electricity and wizardry but at the absolute core of existence is math and they quail at the sight of numbers if you are blessed with the knowledge of the omnipresence of math in all things then this game will be excellent for you if you are a number head this game will be fantastic because you will be halving doubling running probabilities in your head however this is high end gaming when you re beating the final boss for actual solid core gameplay this game is very predictable and gives you a lot of information you will know what the enemy will do and you can prepare the heart of the game is using cards they deal damage create block and draw cards and other things the trick of this game is to find the synergy of these cards the right combo can be beautiful to watch and makes you feel like a genius when you pull it off there are also other effects like potions and relics which can help you on your way up the spire they vary in useability and rarity and generally correspond to a type of gameplay some are more specific to a type of gameplay while others are straight up op you could dedicate entire reaction videos to somebody getting the dead branch relic it s that horrifically overpowered this is a roguelite game so death is inevitable this game is meant to be played repeatedly and getting to the top of the first stage is a commendable performance for a first time gamer this game isn t harsh like darkest dungeon but can backhand you from time to time sts has a few sources of rng card draw deckbuilding and encounters the combat is very solid very predictable outside of combat the route to the spire is randomised and the events and monsters you can encounter are in a set variety for each stage but are randomised for example if you go into a stage 1 elite fight you will want to see the three sentries and not lagvulin the characters of the game are the real shifts in gameplay you can play various different styles of game but the main difference is what character to play again another bit of high praise is that none of the characters are bad they are all good and can give you different experiences there are 4 characters at the time of writing they are the ironclad a tank that can take damage regenerate and deal huge bursts of damage he works through raw numbers the silent a rogue type can deal huge dot damage and can efficiently use her supply of manathe defect a broken robot a weird shamanesque class it creates orbs to do passive and evoked abilities you don t really attack more overly just get more orbs the watcher definitely a monk very burst damage and works with stances mastering those stances is essential to playing her aestheticssts is weird very weird not in a lovecraftian or creepy manner i would say it s more like watching the teletubbies on an acid trip weird it s a blurry line between psychedelic absurd and grim the actual art itself is good for purpose it s very easy to see what is going on in the screen the art as art though is decent you can see small details especially on the player character and the colours are somewhat pastelish which gives the game a casual feeling then there are the relics and monsters they are works of fiction i could not ever come up with fantastic they aren t horrifying but they re eerie as time goes by though and you become more acquainted you ll mellow to them one of the big strengths of sts is that the atmosphere and theme of the game is genuinely unique i cannot think of another game with quite the similar story monsters or characters as you go up the spire the mood is increasingly more hostile and the atmosphere changes as you go into unexplored territory if you encounter an elite at stage three they will scare you especially big head i have a fear of faces already and he is not helping in terms of music it s fantastic strikes that balance between non intrusive and memorable the intro music is mwah chef s kiss it s always there at startup and it s this epic mystical and grandiose theme that sums up sts very well the stages also have their themes and all this works into the atmosphere stage 1 feels a little mischievous and playful stage 2 is somewhat more business like and serious stage 3 has a sense of dread about it and speaking as somebody that has done a ton of runs this is accurate the story is fragmented you never know quite what is going on you have to piece bits together from speech bubbles events and flavour text the is definitely something there it feels tantalisingly close but it s never properly codified if it is i have yet to find it new player old playerone of the chief strengths of this game is its experience over time it s enduring it s all lovely and new to begin with and can make you feel welcome with unlocks and new encounters the game devs are always updating so there is always new stuff here and there as for the older players it becomes an easy and familiar game which provides a challenge i ve only ever beaten the real ending once with the silent and i ve been trying to do so with the other characters there is a weird optimism for this game of maybe next time for a new player simply getting to the stage 3 boss will be a challenge and kudos to you if you defeat it as it s not a done deal even for an experienced player i guess the trick of this game is that the goal shifts as you become more experienced with the game getting past the stage 1 then 2 then 3 boss then figuring out how to get to the final boss is a mystery beyond that then beating the final boss is a massive challenge overallis it one of the great games of our time tricky in a way it really should be it s made with a lot of love it runs fairly well and has great gameplay and artwork i would say that it s not a universally accessible game fps and action gamers will look at this and not bother however i will say that this is an excellent standard to judge computer card games by also it s a safe buy for kids and it will improve their reading and math skills with small instances of both if this is on offer for under 10 this is a definite buy
