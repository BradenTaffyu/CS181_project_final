game is fantastic negative reviews literally all boil down to skill issues or not taking the time to understand the game performance needs some optimization but the core of the game is impressive and a great baseline to build off of for only 20 dollars you get a gorgeous and gigantic city a crazy amount of cars tons of visual customization 2005 nfs most wanted style blacklist progression and an incredibly addictive upgrade path that makes every car viable can t recommend it enough
