2020 so why should i listen to your dim witted opinion on this game i think a good rule of thumb for games like these is that you should at least get an hour of fun per euro you spent so i now feel qualified to write a review beause i m still having an absolute blast the time you see is from a vortex campaign with imrik high elves and a mortal empires campaign with balthasar gelt empire both of which i haven t even finished yet so you get a lot of bang for your buck here now i m personally a little more on the exterminator side but from what i hear in this game there s just as much fun to be had playing as stinky rats slimy lizards or ugly undead people as i have eradicating them so what kind of malarky is this so i ve played all the total wars since rome for hundreds and hundreds of hours except the bad one we all know which one i m referring too if you have ever total wared before this is a really good total war so you can totally total war with it total war yes there is a lot less factions than in historical titles but anyone with a brain can see that these factions are hugely different from each other where in other titles a lot of factions shared similar units mechanis and objectives or even just painted all the same units in different colors looking at you shogun 2 here even within the same faction there are different kinds of campaigns and mechanics making every playthrough unique and challenging while still maintaining the total war sandbox fun for example after 120 turns in my imrik campaign where in other tw games you would already have painted the map in your color and every challenger has bitten the dust now my main rival arrives at my doorstep and is still a higher strength rank than i am and this is on normal diffiulty if you are a beginner you probably have lots of fun trying everything out if you re a veteran there s so much new stuff here that you will feel that great flow a game gives you when there are enough familiar mechanics spears piercing right through horsies horsies smashing archers artillery hitting your own dudes half the time that you will feel right at home and also so much new stuff magic powerful hereos with rpg equipment and fully fletched quest chains dragons that it still feels fresh and exciting from time to time it reminds me more of titles like spellforce or hereos of might and magic than total war so if you like these you will probably enjoy the stronger focus on mixing strategy with role playing elements i haven t bought any dlc yet but i hear they are good and if you own the first game you even get a load of free lc which is always awesome there are people who enjoy smashing their fellow men or elves in this game but for me the imrik campaign is the most fun because finally you start in a place where your dragons can roast more brittle skeletons furry rats and tasty lizards than you could ever eat ok ok you got me i will probably at some point play as the lizardmen too they look pretty fun maybe even as the tomb kings i mean look at that sphinx yummy i hear there are mods too so what s your half baked conclusion buy it it s good but only if you have a halfway decent pc this is an amazing looking and pretty demanding game so if your machine can t handle the biz better stay away from it so go and make ulthuan proud or sigmar or who do the lizardmen worship again the zucc whatever just buy it already
