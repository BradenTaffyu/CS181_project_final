2022 i was a big fan of the first game and the changes made to this version have made it freshly addictive while keeping the charm of the original the good the dinosaurs have more animations personality the increased number of buildings to choose from and the scientist skills system all add depth the amenity module system is an interesting replacement for the staffing level sliders from the first game and it makes balancing the profit loss from each amenity building more interesting than just shifting staffing levels appealing to different kinds of guests overall also adds a bit of complexity and strategy to the business side of the game storms in different regions have various effects and most of these do not shatter your gates and unleash dinosaurs on the hapless tourists every time the wind picks up a welcome change from the first game i also like the mvu system and injury system more than how this was handled in the first game where rangers just handled it all in one step the bad the campaign is way too short and easy i had this done in a matter of hours it was more like a tutorial for challenge and chaos point modes both of which i enjoy the campaign game in the first the first jurassic world game was may better the music goes non existent or very subtle at times not really a big deal there is a tremendous amount of randomness in the events which can be good but when you are on a tense shoestring financially during a hard mode challenge and suddenly the game offers you 5 million dollars out of the blue that makes all that careful financial planning seem a bit pointless overall the bad list are quibbles and i am not regretting paying full price for this game i got the original for free and played it for hundreds of hours so i felt that this great development team deserved the money the second time around
