2014 i score this simulation game 12 10 just hit the buy button it exceeds all expectations the game isn t finished yet but i don t care they can t fail anything anymore just buy it or wait for a sale and then buy it whenever you buy it you won t feel ripped off i guarantee you that kerbal space program is pure magic on the facade it comes across as something with the depth of angry birds and the looks of a crappy looking 3d rollercoaster tycoon and the unsuspecting gamer is easily fooled however there is a reason this game has a fanbase of millions there s a reason i m scoring this game 12 out of 10 i find this game to be the most addictive thing in my library i even try not to play it but when i do it keeps me awake at night and busy while doing daily chores ksp like the name might have hinted is a space program simulator game there is the career mode involving missions and research and there is the sandbox mode that allows you to run free with it the game is in early access and the career needs work i find the missions redundant and confusing but it s already fun and this review is more about the sandbox mode you run the show so you set out your own missions like fly to the moon or another planet then you have to build your lander rover satelite or whatever the means of manouvering in space and a rocket to get it in space then you have to find out not just how to get something off the ground and into space you also need to learn to make an orbit then you learn how to manipulate orbits in order to get around there are no concessions by the time you ve figured out how to get where you want to go you will have learned the basics of actual spaceflight you don t need a science degree to do this and to understand this the game is brilliant this way you can get there by trial and error and in a fun way too i recommend this game to all people that like simulation games tycoon games lego the plastic bricks science fiction in general science in general rockets and blowing stuff up real space exploration or even have slight positive stance on looking at the sky at night willing to learn as you set out your own missions you send your kerbal individuals they all have names on grand adventures their homeworld has a cicumference of about 12000km and it comes with 2 moons the bigger one looks like our own moon and it can even cast a solar eclipse really a fun and beautifull feature in the kerbol name of the star system you will also find the planets moho eve with it s moon gilly kerbin with mun and minmus duna with ike then a gas giant called jool with no less then 5 moons plus finally the dwarfplanet eelo the distances are measured in millions of kilometers when traveling in space it may be a scaled down planetary system but that doesn t mean it s small i have never before adventured through such an immense ingame world each planet and moon comes with it s own biomes and anomalies to discover and explore and you ll busy for hundreds of hours before you ve done it all everyone plays in this same systen so everyone can share their adventures with eachother you know what the other player is talking about when i started playing i had little expectations it looked like a mod but then i reached space it was like the opening of the movie 2001 a space oddisey the space whales ingame music started playing and my contraption was floating in a serene fashion high above kerbin ever going higher and higher kerbin getting smaller and smaller i passed the mun lost kerbin then found the eva button i found out stands for extra vehicular activity or go play outside so i lost my kerbal hours of my life passed by while staring at this phenomenon called ksp while drooling over my keyboard this game is not done yet i m not sure when they aim for a release candidate but they can t fail this anymore nasa has made an addon for it so now asteroids are also part of the game and can be landed on or grabbed nasa also added their own rocket parts based on the new space x rocket how awesome is that and the developer has even announced multiplayer i don t know how this will work and what we could do in an online game and it s already more fun if a friend plays this game too but it s anticipated by me nonetheless the educational value of this game is through the roof i thought i understood the principle of orbits but boy did i learn a lot i understood the concept of flying faster horizontally then you fell vertically but putting it to practice requires more then just going so i watched nasa do it they pivot the rocket as soon as it has picked up enough speed so ok i built a rocket with steering parts and pivotted it correctly after a few try outs and finally worked out an eliptical orbit to play with at this point the concept that isaac newton put down of every action has a pose and equal reaction gets a whole new meaning in orbit you ll see ksmiley every run you make in kerbal you get more advanced your rockets become more stable because you know how to make them you get to other planets faster because you know how to get there my rockets grew in size from around 60 parts for the rocket with my first moonlander of which i built a new version every night to about 1300 in my rocket plus massive oversized truck i landed on duna which took me 2 weeks to build it went from slapping together a simple contraption to a mind boggling engineering puzzle that even my pc or the game s engine found hard to process when launched there comes a point where you get stuck on something like how to dock in space there are several things to do but i warn you this can make or break your experience try as hard as you can if you re stuck play with a friend you know together on one pc thinking and building and if all else fails then try youtube or a guide letting guides take you by the hand can ruin your experience but when you ve reached this point it just means a whole new world of kerbal opens before your eyes i think every ksp player has posted screenshots videos guides both online and private to friends the ammount of material you can dig up is staggering also don t install mods as you just start playing exept for scan sat perhaps but don t the other mods will lure you mods potentially ruins the experience as they can either make it to hard or too easy i ve reached the point where making an orbit has become a boring thing to do and i had seen all the parts ingame i ve reached the point of not getting my ships docked this was the point where i looked on youtube read guides and reviews for mods and then installed mods mods like mechjeb in flight telemetry and autopilot options use at your own risk advanced cockpits cockpit screens buttons to press external cameras awesome more parts graphical addons scan sat scans planets awesome etc but with all games in early access mods can be broken when the game is patched but when you ve reached that point ksp can be enhanced in such ways it brings about limitless posibilities as realistic as you want it to be this game is 100 quality dedicated hard work and deserves all credit it can get when it s done it just means it has reached a point where the developers can call it a complete game with more standard parts more physics more career more tycoon and basicly more game then it is now from that moment this game will only expand as if it were the universe itself thanks to mods and i don t think this game will die out soon just buy the game you ll have fun for years to come i promiss now years after release i stand by my review this game will stand it s ground if it s not on sale check out steamhookups com if there s a good deal in it for you
