2021 excellent simulation game with tons to experience and learn intimidating because of its complexity but satisfying when things work lots of content fun to start new games once you ve learned how to handle different challenges charming funny animations great art style and music always something new to try does take effort to learn all of the systems probably the most complex game i ve played but also one of the most rewarding one of my favorites purchases on steam
