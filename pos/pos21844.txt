2017 dark souls iii was my introduction into the souls universe and it was truly an amazing experience i was always put off from dark souls just thinking that it was a little to weird and out there for me to ever really give it a try however giving dark sourls iii a try was one of the best gaming decisions i ve ever made this game has some of the best combat i ve ever experienced in any game and and the sense of adventure is amazing to experience i have had more fun in this game than i have had in any other game in quite some time i would highly recommend to anyone on the fense about playing this game to do it now i truly do not think you will regret it
