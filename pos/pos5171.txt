2023 product received for free fallout 4 comes with a fresh visual that i really enjoy since nv the way that our player is talking with the others are great cause now the player are talking with voice and improved facial expression here sarcasm dialogue is really funny too the story is okay but its still fun to enjoy especially far harbor expansion i really liked the ambience in there the settlement building system is amazing sometimes when i m bored with the quest i just gather scrap things to build my settlement and expand it so it can be a small city for the people we help for our companion i think fallout 4 is easier than the previous fallout even on survival difficulty because when you know what to do and what play style to build things become easy let alone you re playing stealth its op i m using the midnight ride mod list for anyone s wondering it fixes and improves the game without adding unnecessary content
