2015 playing fallout 4 for me was like going through 4 stages of grief1 denial when the game started there is a lot changes made me think this can t be the fallout that i loved some of the new game mechanics made me uneasy the graphics could be better ui could be better etc 2 depression discovered a game crashing bug cambridge police station and some other small bugs made me depressed because even with all of that i i i can t stop playing3 anger i was so angry with myself why did i complaint so much in the beginning why i did not understand that some of the new changes actually made the gameplay better why can t i stop playing why am i still petrified with deathclaw why am i so attached with dogmeat whyyy whyyyyy4 acceptance accepted this game is awesome fallout will never let you down seriously good job bethesda
