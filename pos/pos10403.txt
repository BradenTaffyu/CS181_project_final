2021 the best racing game i have played until today but i will tell you my history of racing games i started back in 1992 with microprose f1 gp and papyrus racing nascar and indycar racing followed by indycar racing 2 and nascar 2 in svga wow you could see the cars much earlier but we had so much fantasy back then do you remember token ring networking me and my best friend drove 500 laps of the same circuit at home and compared our total times and fastest laps back in school then later i spend a big junk of my childhood to become better in f1 gp2 and bought with all my money a thrustmaster t2 no ff back then finally i was able to disable all assists in gp2 until then i had to use tc as we only played on keyboard i own an original game of f1 gp2 still in 2021 this was a milestone in racing simulations when i look back nowadays when online gaming finally was available i switched to fps games like ut 99 wolfenstein or tactical ops 2 usually my ping was 250 so i had to aim way before the head as the opponent was moving but it worked and i enjoyed it maybe therefore my favourite weapon was the rocket launcher back in 2002 i bought my first ff wheel saitek r4 and enjoyed racing games again for a short time like many other products ff was not the way it was meant to be it made you slower instead of faster after microsoft cart toca 2 and gp legends i stopped racing games for a longer time mmorpgs were more interesting the 4th coming i spend about 5000 hours in this game after this i had to sort my life and began to learn and work finally i began playing racing games again dirt 3 f1 2017 and i was impressed about the graphics and especially the much better ff the first years i only played in single player mode but finally moved to online i remembered how much i liked competition in f1 gp2 hotlap competitions i joined two f1 leagues in f1 2019 and f1 2020 but never was happy with the aggressive style of the opponents maybe the players are too young nowadays for me maybe i hated the racing line too much and then i found acc i started to learn the different cars and mostly learned the important link between temperature psi and tire temperature and after some practice i started to play online and was impressed by the sportsmanship in this game if someone hits me by accident he slowed down and waited for me instead of securing the better racing position sometimes i see dirty drivers when i join a public race but most of the time the players are very fair i think i found my new favourite racing game after f1 gp2 finally when i compare the tracks laguna seca to indycar racing 2 and donington park to toca 2 or moto gp i am impressed by the quality of acc thanks i can only recommend this game to anyone who remembers the good old times
