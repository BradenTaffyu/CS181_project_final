2019 early access review evening descends on the snowswept scandinavian tundra six blue hued archers square off against a samurai six bowstrings twang six arrows speed toward their target the samurai his red armor glinting in the last dying rays of sunlight shifts his stance with a barely perceptible movement of his wrists his blade describes a crescent in the frozen air six arrows flip end over end in every direction one catching a blue archer in the throat the archer tumbles bonelessly to the ground and is still if his compatriots notice they don t show it and then the samurai crouches and in an instant he s among the archers laying about himself with his blade the cacophony of steel crashing against steel mingling with grunts of pain and screams of surprise the archers realize too late that their foe is no mere samurai but a shogun a powerful feudal lord three archers stand then two one pierces the shogun s shoulder with a lucky shot but an answering katana blow strikes him dead before he can celebrate the last remaining archer whose head is the size of a grapefruit and whose bow is held behind his back as though he s hiding a present from a toddler looses an arrow that predictably does nothing a flash of steel leaves him sprawling the shogun s breath fogs in the air he turns limply toward the nearby forest and trudges forward the arrow in his shoulder a painful memorial to the blue archer s death there will be more killing before the night is through also this game is great and you should play it
