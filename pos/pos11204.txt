2022 hello friends today i will review two point hospital this game is a spiritual success to theme hospital if you never played theme hospital this game plays alot like it but also has newer things including costumes for doctors epidemics new diseases even new illnesses this game is more like a newer version of theme hospital but with all the bells and whistles the original game did not have there are also many things about this game that are quite fun if you love micro managing games this one you will really enjoy as a simulation game even if the game does not take itself serious with all the funny diseases and such the game can actually be challenging on the higher levels or getting three star hospitals anyways here are my pro cons pros cartoony diseases and funny ways to treat patients micromanging at it s finest silly costumes for your hospital employees challenging on harder levels and three start hospitals lots of dlc to add to the game new things steam workshop support so you can add even more items to your game cons a few minor bugs i ran into including some lag minor stuttering and even a superbug project that kept staying in my superbug project page it eventually went away though repetition seems to be the worst thing in the game after awhile every level and goals feel the same even if there somwhat different i suggest if you get bored take a break from playing then come back to this game after awhile recommended this game can be fun if you love micromanaging games and simulators this game is not for serious hospital simulation players there is another game on steam for that the game is fun but after awhile can become repetitive
