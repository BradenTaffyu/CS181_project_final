2019 the easiest paradox title in terms of learning the basics but endless amounts of viable playstyles to discover and master paradox didn t have to stick with historical themes with this one and a lot of creative freedom and imagination have been used to make it possible to play your chosen or custom race pretty much however you want to all aspects of your race and civilization can be crafted to fulfill your vision of galactic domination your technological cultural and biological aspects will change during the centuries depending on how you play the game is highly roleplayable by yourself though a love for sandboxy grand strategy is a must because stellaris gives you no victory conditions crafting your own path into the stars has been made fulfilling enough without the need for such i easily got hooked into deep space exploration schemes and warfare and technological ideological progress with this quite a basic but well set up 4k game the ai isn t great by any means but you can custom the galaxy to give you enough of a challenge to make it feel rewarding to figure out ways to deal with surrounding space diplomacy isn t anything special although crafting federations or opposing them becomes a fun part of the politics of many games you don t control individual ships in space combat but give general orders to fleets so the control of combat is mostly focused on the resource and preparation aspects of warfare stellar objects are quite beautifully crafted when you zoom in even though you ll be spending most of your time looking at the simplistic looking galaxy map a lot more grand and obviously varied looking than say hearts of iron 4 the soundtrack includes quite a few nice ambient tracks which fit the theme while effects and voices are generally pretty mediocre i have all the gameplay dlcs installed and i d recommend utopia distant stars and leviathans as first picks these are not mandatory and i generally urge anyone to try out stellaris before buying any since it s still not a very casual game though as mentioned quite easy to get into i feel like the three dlcs listed above are best value for money and add significantly into the base game apocalypse adds doomsday weapons want your own death star and raider factions spread out through space and quite a bit of tension to the gameplay so also a good addition megacorp is ok i guess if you fancy playing ruthless space capitalists or a criminal empire which tries to rule the galaxy through manipulating crime and economy get synthetic dawn if you want to play robot factions such as stellaris version of the borg ancient relics is ok if you re into space archeology but maybe the least necessary of the bunch
