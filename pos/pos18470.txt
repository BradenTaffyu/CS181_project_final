2021 i want to start off this review by noting that i seldom played previous bloons games apart from bloons td battles due to this as you can imagine it was a little difficult to adapt to the games style in comparison to battles especially with the addition of heroes however this game has far surpassed all my expectations when i first purchased the game for only 99 cents despite thew extremely low cost i have gotten an unprecedented amount of enjoyable gameplay even in comparison to games that cost 20x as much the gameplay is energetic vibrant and increasingly challenging in an incredibly fun way the different monkeys all seem to be relatively balanced and the addition of three upgrade paths allows for an absurd amount of different unique play styles and setups every monkey has its own situational use you have to play the game to get more and more used to the different monkeys the heroes mesh nicely with the game and the ranging difficulty of the maps allows for players to progress in skill at their own pace on top of this there are lots of cool community events and the game is even more of a blast when you play with friends i would most certainly recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun and chill strategy game to play with your friends or solo
