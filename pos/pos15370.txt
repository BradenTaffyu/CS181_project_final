2016 don t starve together is simply one of the best sandbox survival game i have ever played the art is very unique let s say it is creepy yet cute the survival system is incredible addicting since you need to plan ahead what to do to survive in the next season there are a lot of stuff to learn and you will die a lot at the beginning but fear not learn from your failure and do it better next time imo this game is incredible fun if you play it with friends or alone joining random servers is fun too but don t get too attached with your character there cause most of them will do a clean wipe when everyone dies doesn t matter if you are online or not the developers are very passionate shipping out regular updates and the result is a strong community and modders that creates lot of entertaining custom content in the workshop so you won t get bored easily pi highly recommend this game even without sales it s worth the money
