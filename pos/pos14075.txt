2021 265 hours 265 hours of my life yet i still can t reach into really late game and make a self sustaining colony there is so much to learn with every attempt you find a new flaw and you find a way to address it before it becomes an issue in the next run it s a game where you constantly have to try fail realize your mistake and try repeat the game offers a huge amount of tools and buildings to design complex machines and structures all to eventually get your dupes to lay back and enjoy life any system you can think of is there anything from food water oxygen gas control temperature control electrical systems thermal conductivity radiation and more it all comes to provides a really big variety of challenges that the player needs to overcome highly recommended if you have the time and patience to learn the game
