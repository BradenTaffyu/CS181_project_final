2015 early access review an amzing roguelike holds up very well against old and modern classics prossuper indepth character creation awesome graphics that balance the clarity of ascii and ease of viewing nice difficulty curve starts hard stays hard does not spike after clearing first area amazing lore deep yet somewhat simple combat that feels weighty and meaningful amazing ui and controls clearly states whats happening and navigating the menus is easy more then one way to skin a snapjaw many different methods to play crafting hunting exploring salvaging trading diplomating and more early variety a serious failing of most roguelikes is that the begining is slow repetitive and boring im looking at you tome caves of qud provides a quick and fairly randomized begining weekly updates cons most of these are only problems to those new to roguelikes no tutorial throws you right into a difficult roguelike those new to the genre should look up how to play not go in blind maybe watch a letsplay and read the steam guides overwhelming amount of options its often hard to decide what would be an effective character build course of action or level progression as so many options are present no music or sounds go make your own playlists verdict 8 5 10i still havent played enough to rank it higher but it is nearly a perfect roguelike and it seems it will reach what it aspires to be the only qualms i have about recomending this game are those associated with roguelikes in general which are the best so buy the game already i can safely and with a lot of confidence tell you that i like and if you try surely you will too
