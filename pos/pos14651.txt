2017 i m posting this because i ve just spotted all the negative reviews i m old enough to have pre ordered civ i in the days when that meant going into a shop i ve played every version and variant since and i think civ vi is deep breath the best civ ever let me explain why civ i is a timeless classic civ ii and its expansions and forks set a new high bar and showed where civ could go civ iii was all about trying new things but whilst i liked it from the start it really needed the conquests expansion to bring the new systems together and even then they were still a bit ropey civ iv was until now my all time favourite and the bts expansion is easily the best civ expansion pack ever the depth of strategy and systems and a slightly fussy interface mean it s not a great one for first timers but the joy of civ is in understanding how everything works as well as using it civ v however was dire the vanilla version was so dumbed down i was completing games in three evenings without really thinking about them and although the expansions helped a lot it still felt like it belonged more on a console no offence to console gamers but the reason you invest in a super fast cpu is for games like civ so knowing that a lot of civ v s systems were to be ported to vi along with the new map and city systems that bear a striking resemblance to endless legend i wasn t sure what to expect and the hefty price tag on the full fat version almost made it the first version i haven t pre ordered however from the first seconds of the beautiful opening sequence i knew this was going to be something a bit special possibly even as good as civ iv the greatest civs i ii iv forget the forks are those where all the systems from the map through city management to science diplomacy religion and war all work together where they jar against each other iii you end up being forced into making nonsensical decisions and it breaks the immersion civ vi with some early teething problems absolutely nails this the map is the star and the new strategic fulcrum of the game firaxis did well to flatter endless legend and there are other parallels that made me worry this would be too much like it but this is still very distinctively a civ game and some people don t like the cartoony style but i do because it evokes civ i we can agree to differ the new city building system also borrowed from endless legend works exactly how it should do it takes a little while to learn how to exploit it to the maximum but then if you want something you can master in a couple of playthroughs then civ isn t the game for you the science system has thankfully been un dumbed from civ v and the structure of the tech tree has some nice nods back to civs i and ii and the eureka system adds a bit more fun religion one of the better systems in v has largely been ported from it and now fits better with the other systems and culture is a similarly good port although the culture victory is far too easy turn if off if you re definitely going for any other victory condition the two weaker systems were war and diplomacy but the patches and dlc have done a lot to fix the balancing issues even though at the moment i d still rather not start near china and for those wondering ghandi is still a warmongering it s still not 100 perfect but no system in any civ game ever was anyone remember diplomats in civ i the point is that they all work together in a way that only the best civs manage so why does it have the edge over civ iv partly because the visuals and sound are beautiful the main music in the game is the traditional song hard times come again no more and i love the way it develops into a crescendo in the late game and partly because the late game is now worth slogging through and yes the cinematic ending and stats have been restored the new map adds to the fun to be had here so rather than just rushing towards your choice of world ending weapon it s actually worth building a balanced force even if you re not going for a domination victory and it s also worth building thermonuclear weapons even just to try one and reload just to see the pretty new fireworks so as a civ veteran i d say ignore the negative reviews if you re a long time fan who wished civ v had never happened then you should find all is forgiven if you re new to the series then just be aware that you re making a long term investment civ is supposed to towards the harder end of 4x strategies but it s nowhere near as impenetrable as it seems at first take a few games to learn it and keep experimenting until you find a playing style that suits you civ vi claims the civ crown and reclaims its place as the best 4x ever
