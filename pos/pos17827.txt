i have been playing this game since the beta and learned how to play magic the gathering with the help and ease of arena you can still play this game and have fun without paying anything in fact if you are new i recommend sticking to the starter deck challenge jump in event and midweek magic events when they are free draft or constructed learn the game and do your dailies until you know which archetype you want to play and have enough wild cards to craft my steam account is a fresh account being a f2p player it allows be to build more decks and use gold to draft more often if you want to try out magic ignore bad reviews at the base of it this is mtg and over time you will build a large collection for free
