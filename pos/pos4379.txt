2017 quite honestly the best battles i ve ever seen in a video game pros large map the world changes without any intervention from the player large selection of weapons huge battles insanely satifying to conquer castles you can join any of the nations or crown yourself king of a new one combat is very well madecons very little of the map can actually be explored you have to grind to really get anywhere hard to master virtually no kingdom management
