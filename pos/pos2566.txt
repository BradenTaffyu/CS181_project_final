2023 project moon has long been expected to confront crucial social issues head on as a sincere supporter of the company i along with many others harbor no desire for unnecessary fanservice in your games to the contrary i am deeply disappointed that you chose to pander to those who espouse misogyny and objectification it s disheartening to witness recent events shedding light on such concerning actions within the company particularly the termination of an employee advocating for women s rights this decision sends a troubling message to players and the wider industry on a positive note the game itself limbus company masterfully crafts narratives that carry meaningful messages the character of yi sang in particular left a profound impact on me the message of his wings always being there signifying his inherent worth struck a chord with someone who also grapples with low self esteem and depression however the regrettable controversy surrounding project moon cannot be overlooked by dismissing an employee who stood for women s rights the company seems to perpetuate the very issues it seeks to address in its games this decision contradicts the core values and themes depicted in your own creations as a passionate player who has supported project moon financially i hold admiration for your work yet i implore you to reflect on these actions and take steps to align yourselves with the meaningful messages you aim to convey through your art let us your devoted fans continue to support and champion a company that upholds its principles and makes a positive impact on society edit the comment
