2023 it s a good game biggest downside is lack of replay value i have completed the game this game constantly introduces new spells and mechanics as you progress through the story i m a gamer who is accustomed to ignoring the story missions until 40 hours later don t do that prioritise the story missions throughout you ll need access to spells and pickups before you really get exploring gameplay it s all about exploring finding collectables opening doors solving puzzles and finding secrets most puzzles give rewards the hogwarts castle is huge the surrounding area is also huge there is a lot to explore this game is not about making decisions and seeing changes from those decisions most dialogue choices early game are just for roleplay are you boastful or humble nice or snarky i don t believe these have any impact near the end of the game there are a couple of quest choices that do have impact those choices are obvious you get asked a question in a quest and you can choose one of two answers no need to worry about saying the wrong thing through most of the game combat there are four spell types damage slice set alight etc control slow cause to float etc force push pull etc and utility light repair etc the first three are used in combat and the spell types are colour coded sometimes an enemy can only be effected with a control spell and after that you ll be able to do damage normally there is dodging and shielding i played on normal and found combat to have a good flow it is fun challenging enough to not be too easy but not frustratingly difficult either you can t hurt your classmates or villagers with combat spells only enemies stealing nobody cares about stealing just pick locks right in front of people it s totally fine stealth there are only a couple of short mission sections that require stealth both are sections you can return to later so no need to explore everywhere while trying to stay hidden you may use stealth in open world for sneak attacks but it s not required or necessary game resources you can craft potions and grow plants that can act like turrets or grenades honestly the only potion i used in the entire game was the health potion and i rarely remembered or needed to use the plants on normal you ll end up with more money than you know what to do with i had close to 50 000 at the end of my game the only resource that i found really important was using the loom to upgrade items unlocks a long way through the story performance i m running a 1080gtx and expected to be playing on low but i could actually turn it up to medium and i m quite happy with the performance only occasional hitching is seen clothes clothes are important you can tell this because you ll complete a dungeon that s worthy of indiana jones and in the big glowy chest at the end you ll find dun dun dun an old school uniform you have a bunch of gear slots found items have defence offence stats and can have special abilities as well this game does have transmog and you should use it put on your outlandish glasses go back to the top gear screen and use the prompt to change the appearance of the gear to match any gear you have found sold destroyed so far in the game character creation do not change the voice pitch of your characters they ll sound weird if you do change it you can actually go to the audio options menu and change it back you don t get to fully customize your character appearances there are 30 head shapes to choose from 15 each feminine masculine 50 hairstyles 20 skin tones there s a mod if they don t go light or dark enough for you hair colours freckles and moles scars eye colour eyebrow shape masculine or feminine voice and whether you sleep in the witch or wizards dorm dorms directly from the books wizards cannot enter the witch s dorms in ravenclaw enchanted suits of armour with polearms will block the stairs in the other three dorms the stairs turn into slides as you try to go up them whether you want to explore the whole dorm or experience the slides may influence your decisions the ravenclaw and slytherine dormitories are basically mirror images of each other and roughly identical you re not missing anything by going as a wizard the gryffindor witch s dorms are very different to the wizards and worth seeing in hufflepuff the balcony area outside the witch s dorms is also worth visiting animals there are lots of cats you can pet them you can also accio them there are other animals roaming the world angus cattle chickens owls squirrels and there are dens where different magical beasts congregate later in the story you can rescue the magical beasts lgbtq inclusion this game has gay npcs a transgender npc with a transgender voice actor and allows full voice face dorm picking options for characters violence there is a surprising amount of murder in this game you ll constantly be fighting dark wizards goblins wolves giant spiders there is now an accessibility mode for arachnophobia and you re getting rewarded for defeating them if you want a game with lower violence this is not the game for you racism so far i have seen zero evidence that the goblins may be a racist stereotype npc characters represent a solid range of racial backgrounds mods this game supports mods i have only used a mod that improves the vivariums so far there s a mod that makes spiders appear as burgers and many other excellent options complaints little replay value there is almost no interaction available with friendly npcs most of the time when they re not store keepers or quest givers they just walk around and ignore you there are a lot of npc set piece scenes that you ll randomly come across but you observe them you can t interact the map does not show you the corridor detail except in the little minimap in the corner it s annoying only 4 character slots my instinct was to create 5 or 6 characters play them all for half an hour and then decide which to continue with nope 4 characters only getting inundated with too much clothing that i ve picked up and the puzzles to expand backpack size are a third of the way through the story missions some of the mechanics are unintuitive like using the map to its full potential scroll out to see collectibles figuring out how to change gear appearance can t skip the tutorial prologue for new characters it s a good game
