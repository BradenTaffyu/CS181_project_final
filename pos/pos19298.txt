2022 excellent foundation for a game that s begging for future expansion the videos for the campaigns are amazing they re so interesting it makes you want to finish the next mission just to see the next set of videos i hope as the years pass the dev team will make this game as content rich as aoe 2 keep adding civs keep adding campaigns keep refining balancing we re still missing some big civs like the romans vikings spanish japan celts and others i dont mind paying for new expansions i realize high quality costs money just keep them coming
