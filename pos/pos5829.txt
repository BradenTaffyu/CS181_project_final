2021 early access review bannerlord is great open world rpg you start off as a poor peasant and continue to build up an army to eventually own towns and be a lord there s a few different ways you could play the game like be a trader and go town to town or be a bandit and raid villages and caravans or just accept quests from people to gain power ultimately though the end goal is always the same which is to own castles and armies there isn t much story but rather you make your own there is a main quest line but i haven t done it because i find it annoying so idk what lies beyond that the combat in the game is fantastic it s like mordhau or chivalry but simplified the large scale battles you have with like 400 troops on the field feel great and fun castle sieges feel realistic and they re also super fun whether you re defending or attacking my biggest complaint in the game is the load times i have a good pc and can run plenty of graphic intense games just fine but with bannerlord even on the lowest graphic settings it takes a few seconds to open my inventory sometimes opening the character menu the party menu then quest menu literally almost anything takes time to load battles take me a solid 10 20 seconds to load it s a great game so i ve been able to overlook it but man it sucks now in comparison to warband bannerlord has more content and the graphics are much more beautiful is it worth the 30 more though in my opinion no it s a great game though and i trust it ll get better so i ve invested the money in it if it s your first mount and blade game though i recommend you play warband first because 50 for this is a bit of a stretch
