2020 after 700 hours i can still say i find this game fantastic massive fan of roman history so it s a big plus for me yes the graphics are getting a little outdated and the ai isn t all that bright but you just cant beat the concept of fighting with armies from that time a spartacus type campaign would be pretty awesome where you would have to defend italy from hordes of slaves or even try to take out italy fighting as the slaves dbut yeah great game would recommend this for sure
