2015 i started iracing about a year ago i was always into racing but never could afford a decent wheel pedal setup i found out about iracing right before my birthday and the idea of fair internet racing fascinated me so i built myself a rig and jumped into the world of online racing ill sum up some of my expiriences with the simulation in this review trying to give you some insight on how your view will change when you get better and better prior racing games simulations i ve been driving the oldschool nfs titles the old hot pursuit and so on and some f1 titles but always with a game pad so i had no prior wheel expirience approaching iracing hell i didnt even have a driving license at that time my first weeks at iracing i started out with the mazda mx5 which is free from the beginning and got right into the frey i started a privat test session and drove a few laps quickly realising this was not comparable to anything i had ever driven before i immediatly learned that you have to invest time in iracing to become save and good enough to drive on a racetrack with others and thats before you even think about doing competetive laptimes while this is a starting obstacle you have to overcome it is also deeply satisfying to finally get into your first race after proper training i started out of the pits and propably was driving on my own at the back of the field but i did my first race and the feeling when crossing the finish line unharmed was absolutley great i went on to practised on and quickly climbed through the license levels getting from rookie to a d license was my first big acomplishment and i was proud as f pan important note about license levels they are not about how fast you are they are about how save you are that is a huge difference i d rather have a slower driver in the field who has his car under control instead of a guy who is quick as hell but will most likely crash after 5 laps if you just keep your nose out of trouble and work on your driving skills advancing from rookie to an a class driver is not that hard my driving expirience now about 10 months after my initial start by now i am using an oculus rift dk2 i am having an absolute blast really i don t even dare to call iracing a game anymore its a racing simulation and it does an incredible job i am mostly driving the gt3 cars and i actually am quite good at them being able to drive highly competetive laptimes i can still get the other cars around the track but i wont win a race in them putting my focus on a single car helped me to become a very save and quick driver in the gt3 series i shifted from the official races to community leagues and am now mostly racing endurance events with 4hours racing time with my teammate there are some races where i crash out there are some races where i get taken out there are some races where i just hotlap for half an hour because everyone else is either quicker or slower than me and then i have those amazing 45 minutes battles other drivers which are at my exact pace and everytime i am in such a race i have a huge idiotic grin all over my face when im done its just such a great feeling when you are driving close to your limits and have a fair battle with someone else you will litteraly start to shake and sweat and when you are leading a race for the first time you might become so nervous that you drop out of your chair and it feels great even now i still get nervous at starts of big important races when im standing somewhere in the mid front of a 60 car field at spa and am waiting for the safety car to drive us through the warm up lap i still shake in my mind i am already racing down the hill towards eau rouge and get crazily excited i remind myself that ive got a 2 hours race ahead of me and that i only have to survive the start the engines start spitting and everything from there on is in my hands tl dr here is a list of what i love about this game and about what is a little bit annoying pro great physics really fun to drive good graphics and they will become even better friendly community on the road side i dont know much about ovals amazing clean races yes you will crash at times but thats racing my friend a huge track pool and a lot of cars that feel completly different from each other an extremly high level of competition at the top racing with people that have your pace no matter if you are super quick or just having a chilled sunset drive the amazing feeling that you actually achieved something when you win your first race after hours of training in deep setup building the faster the car the more options you get the game sound way better than ac imo cons you will have to invest training time to become good but training is also fun especially with others on the track iracing is not cheap but in case that you cant afford real live racing it gets as close as can be its adicting this review sounds really positive does it well thats because i am absolutley in love with iracing i spent 200 hours in the bmw alone and i am not the quickest guy yet time to head back into a practise session cya folks
