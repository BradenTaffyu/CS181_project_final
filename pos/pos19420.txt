2022 this is one of the greatest rpg s ever made it is the greatest fpsrpg ever made and it was rushed out the door all the dlc are worth it everything about it is great the fact that they will never do a remaster where they fully flesh out the game map and add the cut content contributes to my depression i hate bethesda nobody has made a comparable spiritual successor i would sell my soul if it meant john gonzalez could complete his artistic vision for this game mechanically great the writing is fantastic i can t put into words how much i love this game between my time on pc and xbox 360 i probably have around 1k hours since nobody can seem to develop an rpg with a story nearly as nuanced and compelling and mechanically interesting i expect i am going to put in many more hours thank god for mods
