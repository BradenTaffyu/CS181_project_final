2019 early access review never played anything pre alpha 17 so without any nostalgia and past experiences i can say this is one of the best survival games on the market pros crafting is extensive there are many items to craft and create never gets old building features excellent there are more than enough ways to customize and create your base after i built my original base i wanted to start all over it just gets better the point of the game the 7th day is a lot of fun and the hype leading up to it makes it even better difficulty is a plus you can change it to make it harder easier if you wish and really tell the difference enemies while repetitve at times are unique once you understand how they work and are fun to engage quests and skill points make this survival game a little more in depth than others replayablity is high with solo play with friends or with strangerscons there are bugs but i can t really say this is a con because it s early access and thats going to happen after you learn all the crafting schematics and get to a certain point in the game it can get repetitive apparently there is a lot of backlash from fans of this game before a17 so i dont know how the developers will respond to this so keep an eye out at the end of the day you re getting a common survival game but with a unique twist on it that can leave with hours and hours of gameplay this is one of the best survival games out there because it stands out from others easy recommend
