balatro is one of those games which comes around in a generation or so which on its surface shouldn t be as fun or as engaging as it is i can already see it being one of the most influential indie games of the 2020 s in that it has achieved what seems simple in a way which is in fact very hard on its surface balatro is just a poker game more specifically a variation of poker called big two but the way that it manages to allow for dynamic builds intense but not exceptionally frustrating gameplay and a sense of replayability that i struggle to find in other deck builders like sts is hard to fathom balatro is the deck builder at its most refined it removes abstraction in the form of damage mana cost block etc and delivers a cleanly presented game that centers around something that everyone can get something out of i can imagine people of any age enjoying or understanding balatro from children who enjoy the bright colors to adults and grandparents who have decades of card games under their belt balatro has set the bar for indie deck builders very high and it is amazing to see the amount of similar games being developed like bingle bingle and other casino likes already beginning to flood the market for a generation of people who have had gambling as a central part of their gaming experience from the unfortunate mess of loot boxes and counter strike roulette to the expansion of esports gambling and sports betting the addictive nature of balatro offers a healthy outlet for the dopamine mining aspects of betting and gambling that otherwise may be taken advantage of overall i cannot recommend balatro enough i will warn that it is as addictive as real gambling but luckily at least with balatro the only thing you ll be wasting is your time and not your hard earned life savings 9 10
