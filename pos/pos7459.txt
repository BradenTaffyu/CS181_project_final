2018 early access review it always feels a little special when an early access title captures your full attention raft does just that what s there right now is pretty impressive for how early in its development it is a very relaxed aside from some tense shark encounters and peaceful game if you ve played survival crafting games before you know what to expect but the added twist of slowly upgrading your makeshift raft feels really rewarding i didn t give the co op a chance yet but i plan to get some friends together when the next big update rolls out absolutely love this game so far
