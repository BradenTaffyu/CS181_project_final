2022 fredbear s family diner william afton and henry opened in 1967 the family friendly fredbear s family diner featuring a brown furry suit of a bear as a mascot henry would usually wear the suit as they didn t have enough money to hire someone to do the job for a long time and they were studying at the time william studied engineering and henry business adminstration and communication william met an unnamed woman with whom he married and three years later had a boy challed michael they met in the court william was being charged for murdering a child that allegedly was crying outside the diner for being scared of fredbear the bear and she was working selling hot dogs in from of the building btw he was released because they didn t have evidences pointing it it took them four years to actually achieve any success with the diner as they learnt from little michael that fredbear was boring william them designed a new mascot a yellow furry suit of a rabbit called bonnie the chemistry between both characters worked like black magic and the success rained on them like rain in a rainy day the amount of money they got was so much william used it to test his engineering skills designing the first two spring lock suits which were obviously bonnie and fredbear the success increased freddy fazbear s pizza the diner s success was so big a company decided buy it and open a franchise around it hanry and william sold it seeing a whole lot of profit coming from it but there was a catch the company used sneaky legal actions that allowed them to have the diner 100 under their possession erasing henry s and michael s name from it the company then opened fazbear s entertainment to take care of everything william was so pissed because of this he cut any relationship with anyone involved with the franchise henry on the other hand didn t know any other thing to do so he asked for a job he became phone guy ffp opened in 1973 and featured four furry suits of animals freddy fazbear a recolour of bonnie chica and foxy the pirate this made william even more pissed when he learnt they made four animatronics without him he started planning his revenge btw the diner

bonnie suit he built years earlier he lured five children to a back room murdered them and hid inside the body of the animatronics in case you re wondering what he did with the fifth one he obviously hid it inside a spare freddy suit he then painted yellow duh fortunately for billy they actually caught henry instead of him as one of the cameras caught him walking around in one of the suits he got out sometime later as they managed to prove he had some mental disabilities and had a fixation with wearing the suits around and had no violent behaviour but dave well he was fired when ffp closed circus baby with the help of the money he got from selling the children s organs in the black market william opened afton robotics and had everything ready to open his own kid friendly restaurant circus baby s pizza world the problem is that he got a new hobby and this where his hill went down he liked so much the idea of killing children and the profit he could get from selling their organs healthy children organs are way more valuable than adults he made special alterations in his robots turning them into kid kidnapping and killing machines the problem is that in 1982 he accidently let his daughter get close to baby when he wasn t looking and baby killed her he knew he was the one to blame but he actually blamed michael for this saying that he as the older brother should ve protected her this incident lead to the pizzeria s cancellation and william s divorce his wife took michael and the other boy with her leaving him alone his new hobby and this incident in his life lead him to become a human monster the children going a little away from the entire afton story arch let s talk about the children he murdered the first one came to possess a puppet from ffp the other
