2016 the first time i played this game i didn t really get it i ran around i found some food i died then i put away the game for a long time recently i decided to play again and started to realize just how much depth there is to the game i ve now played for hundreds of hours i ve tried streaming on twitch and watching others do the same it has become one of my favorite games and i definitely recommend it
