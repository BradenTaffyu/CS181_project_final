2021 tldr if you re a fan of open quest story and dialogue like in fallout new vegas this is a must buy rpg it has so much content and i spent 35 hours on the tutorial island it has a lot of replayability and content masterful storytelling in its quests and has an open quest design giving you multiple ways to complete quests every npc feels like a unique and meaningful character with their own story the combat has free movement and has a focus on status effects and elemental damage it has both couch coop or steam remote play coop if you and your buddy owns a controller and online coop if you and your friend both own the game long load times regardless of your system specs 9 7 10this game is practically the best turn based rpg on the market to date it has so much content depending on your race character stats and perks similar to fallout new vegas this game has an open quest system with a ton of ways to play through the game and yes killing everyone is an option just like in fnv i ve been addicted to this game since i bought it i clocked 48 hours in the first two weeks because of both its story and addictive gameplay and combat loop if you re worried about buying this game because of you fear that it may lack content don t worry this game is far from lacking content to give you an idea on how large this game is in a singleplayer playthrough when also doing most quests i spent 35 hours on the tutorial island because there s so many quests secrets and stories in the first island alone in addition to its amazing content it also has an amazing combat loop mixing turn based combat with a non gridbased movement and attack system with a primary focus on status effects and elemental damage and to top it all off this game has online and offline multiplayer you can play with a friend or three and set of on an adventurous quest with each other either in a party or going by yourselves to give you an idea on how perfect this game is my only complaint for the entirity of my 48 hour playthrough is that the game has long load times it s not my system that s causing it i have a 1tb ssd with 180gb of spare space which does make quickloading your saves a bit tedious overall this is one of if not the best rpgs on the market and excluding that little negative with the long load times i would give this game a 10 10 but with it i would give this masterpiece a 9 7 10 buy it now if you haven t already
