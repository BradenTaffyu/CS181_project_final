2021 i bought teardown for my 6 year old son but it was myself who actually ended up playing through the missions what a great game very original game nothing else like it really each mission requires thought and planing but u get a real sense of achievement once completed or if you carn t be arsed with the effort just dl all the guns rpg s and other fun stuff from the steam workshop this game is 100 worth buying if you like blowing stuff up or destroying your environment my son also enjoyed playing teardown aswell lol
