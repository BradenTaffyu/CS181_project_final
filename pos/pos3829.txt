2022 this game is absolutely something special and for the price the devs are practically giving it away i ve been a strategy fan for 30 years now ever since i was a wee lass and first played shining force i was instantly hooked ever since then i ve been looking for ways to scratch the itch and besides shining force 2 few games manage to really nail that feeling i got playing shining force for the first time enter symphony of war made by some guy that looks like cypher from the matrix and his coding gimp he keeps in his basement allegedly by my own presumptions to bring about a fresh dynamic that goes beyond find crystal change job while with an art style reminiscent of other 16 bit classes the biggest ticket item that differentiates sow from the rest is the squad system each character has a leadership score which allows them to field so many units under their squad each squad is then able to add or remove units as needed and place them across a grid with a maximum of 9 units including the squad leader each of your units on the battlefield can be completely customized there are no restrictions being able to build squads however you want is absolutely incredible and allows for a depth of play that is rarely found in games like these there s spearmen heavy infantry light bandito infantry mages healers multiple types of cavalry firearms units dragons and more you can hire 4 basic classes a medic militia fighter or archer each with their own upgrade paths some interlinking the classes affect stat growth on level ups for instance you can make a unit a fighter in order to increase their attack and mhp values and then shift them to a more skill based high damage dealing unit but with higher strength and max hit points than someone who went purely through skirmisher training that s only a basic example and i ve yet to fully explore this system the music has been fantastic the story is well written and provides enough intrigue to desire to keep playing but this game absolutely shines in both the organization and the combat phases the organization phase is where you hire and upgrade units buy sell artifacts and battlefield loot and organize your formations you then deploy to the battlefield and select a number of squads for the mission you re able to retreat squads and sally forth new ones as well at your home base which allows you to use a glass cannon in the first parts of the mission and then switch them off to heavy cavalry to catch up with the spear head being able to organize the squads however you see fit is incredible your only limit is that certain units require finding a supply of items from glittering mines or stables to hire them similar to heroes of might and magic the difference is when you change class on the units you have spent items on you get the items back allowing you to experiment with your sexua class selection to see what works best this game is something special in a sea of rock paper scissors fire emblem clones also there s a giantess diana for all you people into the big women you re also able to choose whether to have your avatar present as male or female a nice touch being that most games have you locked in on a particular avatar
