2020 this game is a wonderous give and take for instance i was drop shipped 20 yorkie dogs all of which were tame this was a glorious day but sadly it was winter and food was low so we had to make some sacrifices thankfully the meat harvested from one of my colonists was enough to keep all my yorkie s and other colonists alive long enough for the upcoming harvest plus i got a nice human leather hat out of it all 10 10
