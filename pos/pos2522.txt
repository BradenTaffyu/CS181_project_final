7 5 10 the wiki based collaborative writing project scp foundation started in 2008 has constructed a crazy yet charming world that includes horror fiction super natural and urban fantasy elements even now it is still very influential on the web and also inspired many fan made adaptations just like lovecraft s cthulhu mythos 2018 s lobotomy corporation developed by projectmoon could still be the appearance of the scp foundation but when it comes to 2021 s library of ruina we could see that they already jumped out of the former frame devoted to building a much more grand and interesting world as the two former games free to play raising sim gacha sequel limbus company shares their worldview but while successfully bringing the players an amazing plot and good immersive experience it also inherited many shortcomings of its genre and carried forward them in a bad way for now most of the raising sim gacha games share their common features and on this point there is no doubt that whether in terms of plots or gameplay limbus company could be unconventional with the main plot s full korean voice could bring you a unique listening experience the excellent music distinct art style and outstanding 2d battle performance also greatly enhance the player s immersive experience the plot style of this game is not only absurd and funny but also dark and cruel the plot implies various thoughts on religion ideology politics oligopoly etc quite in depth numerous characters with different personalities and the ensemble cast style s narrative could attract the players to keep reading the battle design of this work is very similar to the former work library of ruina and the game s energy could also be transformed and restored with the relatively moderate character raising barrier as long as you are willing to put in time for it you could get a good game experience being unconventional is often not necessarily a good thing especially in limbus company s genre the unique battle design and variety yet complex role title are very confusing plus the tutorial of this game is very poor for those who have not played the library of ruina this does take some time to adapt the ui of this game is far from exquisite the high repetitive contents of mild rogue lite elements dungeon can neither be skipped nor automated and require players to spend an extremely long time every day and week to obtain a small number of resources this experience is definitely not relaxed and enjoyable for most players the ensemble cast style s plot always has two weaknesses one is that many supporting characters are not attractable enough one is the progress of the plot is too fast and lacks basic foreshadowing and sadly these are particularly prominent in limbus company making it much more hard to arouse the empathy of players the fatal problem of this game is it very skimpy on all kinds of resources with the e g o scattering the probability of gacha s identity the new player s game experience is definitely terrible the plot of limbus company is definitely outstanding but after all it is still a raising sim gacha game even the developer projectmoon once joked that it is designed to raise money for the future s buy to play sequel indeed the game experience of limbus company may not be easy especially for the new player but for now the player amount of this game is still very large and stable the biggest selling point of this game plot could also maintain a high level the game is no doubt far from dead if possible play the former work library of ruina could let you know whether you could suffer this kind of gameplay and because of a relatively high daily play time in its genre required of this game i would only recommend this game to the series fan people like the game s worldview and plot style very much and compare to in game purchase more acceptable to highly repetitive and high intensity daily farming find my reviews valuable click here to join my curator group your support is my greatest motivation
