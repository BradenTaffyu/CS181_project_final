2018 this is currently my favorite and most played game on steam and i don t see myself stopping any time soon the warhammer setting just fits so perffectly with total war you ll be stuck wondering why it hasn t been done before it just seems like these two franchises were made for each other with how much time i ve spent in this game i feel it is only fair i spend a little time on a review performance and graphics it is an rts game and with any rts game there are going to be thousands upon thousands of models to render during battles i have a gtx 1080 and an i7 7700k and cannot run this game at a stable 60 fps maxed out in 1440p it s instead around 40 50 fps average at least during full battles it without a doubt takes a beefy pc so i would definitely consider that before buying but if you re pc isn t up to the task there are plenty of graphics options and great benchmarks to help test them out but if your computer can handle the game maxed out how glorious it looks textures are nice and clear and pleasant to look at gameplay warhammer ii follows the basic gameplay that total war has been doing since the beginning and if you haven t ever played one here s the formula a turn based campaign map with simple diplomacy where the main focus is balancing your economy with upkeep for armies when battles are initiated the game moves to real time battles where you command large armies it s a great formula that makes for a great game and i honestly feel that warhammer ii s battles are some of the best feeling in the series if you ve never played a total war game before i honestly believe this one is a good place to start while the battles are much more hectic and varied than the other titles the campaign has been pretty effectively streamlined so to new players it is not as difficult to get started this comes at a cost though that veterans of total war might find different facets of the campaign lacking though i find it is enough to have kept me interested for 501 hours and i m still not bored of the game another great perk of total war warhammer compared to its predecessors is the huge variety between factions that just isn t possible with the historical games there s the heavily armored and slow dwarfs with powerful frontline infantry and amazing artillery there s the quick and numerous skaven armies with weak infantry that relies on numbers and powerful monsters where sacrificing your own units in order to bombard with warpfire and destructive spells is a legitimate tactic there are the high elves with amazing archers and and great elite frontline units not to mention their formidable dragons and wide selection of spells every race has its unique challenges and each faction especially in the new warhammer ii factions has a unique start position that gives a unique experience for each campaign other things to consider total war warhammer ii is not a perfect game this one and every other in the series as well as most every strategy game suffers in the late game when you are so strong that none can stand against you and the game just begins to feel like painting the map the challenge is gone civilization suffers from this as well the new introduction of the vortex campaign where the factions are racing to control the great vortex and thence the world does a good job of giving you a clear goal to keep you focussed throughout the mortal empires expansion which is available to you if you own the first warhammer game as well is much more open ended but also features the chaos invasion which gives you a goal besides painting the map as well does this fix the problem not completely because once you reach the peak of your strength not even the chaos has a chance to stop you however for how fun and challenging the early game can be i feel that this is a minor issue a problem that veterans of total war might have with this game as i ve mentioned before is it is a bit more streamlined than previous titles while what is here is smooth and works there s plenty that s been cut sieges which you ll spend a lot of time in now are only one or two sides of a city this can makes sieges pretty repetitive which is a shame as you ll spend a lot of time doing them while at first glance there appears to be an amazingly large set of maps they can be a little repetive as well there s plenty maps that are just reskins of each other and this is very noticable in the choke point style ones another shortcoming that cannot be ignored with total war games is the dlc policy while this title seems to be better about it than others there s still the annoying blood dlc which should definitely have been in the game already but ca has some really great practices as well when a new faction dlc is released there s always a free update that accompanies it dlc factions are added to the game regardless of whether you own the dlc ownership just decides whether you ll be able to play as them there was also no day one dlc that was put behind a pay wall this time around so that was a nice improvement over the last one the dlc s released thus far tomb kings queen and the crone are great the tomb kings are an interesting new faction and a blast to play the new units and factions for the high and dark elves add welcome variety to the two rosters for the amount fo time you can get out of them i would say so far the dlc is fairly priced except for the blood dlc come on ca conclusion even with all the shortcomings the game is phenomenal there s great variety in the different factions races and the gameplay is smoother than it s ever been there s so much more i could say about this game but this review is getting a bit long i would say the game is worth full price but if you can get it on sale even better veterans of total war will love the unique experience compared to the historical titles and newcomers such as myself will find it a much easier game to pick up than previous titles get this game update sept 19th 2019 so after more than a year i still play this game there hasn t been a dlc i haven t enjoyed yet and there s still plenty more to come unfortunately the publisher raised prices in other regions so the game is getting review bombed at the moment if that is the case where you are wait for a sale or when they reverse the price increase otherwise i d definitely say this game is worth full price
