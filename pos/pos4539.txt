2017 i have 720ish hours in this game need i say more i will though xdbasically its fuedal world your a character male female you increase stats level up yourself troops and companions then try to become a lord after taking sufficient fiefs castles cities your liege will deny you one then you can rebel and start your own kingdom very hack and slash which can be repetitive at times but keep in mind im at 700 hrs so anyways lots of mods from fantasy and historical perspectives i like gekokujo and persino pendor a must buy for any strategy rpg lover enjoy
