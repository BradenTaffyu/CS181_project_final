2019 probably the game that had the most support post launch because of the awful state it launched in the game has since been improved vastly and that really shows if at launch i would not recommend this but as of now it s a totally different title everything is great and i think it s a worthy successor for the first rome way too expensive for a six year old game so if you can get it on a steam sale definitely snatch this up
