2019 euro truck simulator 2 has exceeded my expectations many times over my expectations were never high to begin with though i thought i d be reviewing one of those shovelware titles but i was wrong euro truck simulator 2 is an extremely high quality title that has been built by people who understand their market it is a deep fun and immensely relaxing game to spend hours of your time in while the experience of driving a truck isn t 100 of where i d want it to be it is damn close of just being an enjoyable experience the empire building the employee management and the leveling up mechanic of your own driver all extend the game s replay value and gives you goals to work for it s one of the best simulation games i ve ever played who d have guessed i d be humbled by a game about trucking note my nominee for labor of love award during the 2020 and 2021 steam awards
