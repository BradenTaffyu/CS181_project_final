a great and really cute game would i recommend it totally does it have issues totally trying to 100 the game which i did just now is pure pain and i recommend to only do it if you hate yourself not because of the difficulty or challenge the game can provide there is only 1 achivement locked behind a difficulty mode which it allows you to change at any moment but if you beat the boss on normal and overwrite your save while having no backup in a different slot then good luck doing newgame up to the postgame for that what is an issue are the sidequests there are way too many for my taste quality over quantity is my preference there are 100 side quests and they are tedious shallow worthless and a pain to complete do not force yourself to do them right away you can just accept them and not bother with them until you feel like it side quests start appearing based on your mainstory progress for the most part sure there are some side quests that have pre requisites but there are only very few just enjoy the game for the story the graphics the characters and the gameplay and if you still wish to 100 it go ahead 8 5 10 is my score if i exclude the side quests 6 0 10 if i deduct the pain it caused me to stretch my 60 hour playtime by 20 30 hours it could have been a cozy 30 40 hours playthrough but instead i feel like i wasted so much time doing these side quests
