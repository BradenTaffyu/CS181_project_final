2016 early access review i used to dream about a zombie survival game that was based on the rules of the world we live and breath in a game where ransacking houses felt real and natural where locating fresh water was as important as bashing zombie heads where finding an axe was cause for celebration and where facing zombies was something that was scary and never stopped being scary a game that trusted you to be smart enough to stockpile food to avoid starving to death and that had the balls to make getting bitten by a zombie something that actually followed well known zombie lore ie you re going to turn into a zombie no there is not some magical cure you re going to die may i suggest avoid getting bitten by zombies in the first place what s that you say that makes the game tense and unpredicatble because dying means you lose all your character xp indeed now you re getting it surviving a zombie apocolypse in the real world would be tense and unpredictable i always knew this imaginary zombie survival game of my dreams would be independently produced why because aaa game developers are so terrified the average modern gamer will get distracted by something shiny their version of the game would grant you a fish from heaven magical spell simply to balance out the requirment of finding food and having to satisfy a hunger stat or they would simply make the hunger stat regenrate if you sat in a corner for a few seconds making one wonder why its there in the first place for those not keeping up i m looking at you mainstream console gamer for whom the regenrating hunger stat was created project zomboid is that zombie survival game of my dreams at least as close as one can possibly get i absolutely love the fact that the game more or less simulates how well i think i would do in a real zombie apocolypse that is to say i one hudnred percent believe i d die backed into a corner flailing about with a hammer in a mad panic and eventually getting too fatigued to fend off the hordes and landing up a zombie snack no you would not chainsaw them into bits and flick flack out the window into the arms of a hottie with enormous breasts mainstream console gamer and no i don t care how much you try and convince me otherwise get a job in conclusion yes i recommend project zomboid and as a final thought you have not known desperation until you ve tried to stab a zombie to death with a spoon simply for complete lack of other options another reason i love this game i commend the developers and deeply hope this game sees much success i m eager to see how it progresses
