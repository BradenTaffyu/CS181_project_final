2k finally updated pc to next gen and introduced a bunch of changes making the game much more accessible for offline and casual players like me it seems like they implemented many more ways to get vc compared to previous years if i ever felt the grind was too much i could just lower the difficulty or play a different mode and still get a decent amount the wnba modes are some of the best in the game the w career mode is like the offline mycareer that i would have wanted similar to way back when before microtransactions became so invasive in the rest of the game mycareer was fun having to only play key games which affect badges and your dynasty is a great idea the offseason options helped keep the career mode interesting too i managed to influence some trades by suggesting expendable players with high potential who could grow with me after my team aged up it took me 5 seasons to get goat status and grind to 99 overall with no money spent on vc i liked the city as it didn t affect performance much and we got the go kart early on the streetball challenges were fun and prepared me for coop and park games even though usually stay away from multiplayer modes mynba and eras with the next gen upgrade are a welcome change and has kept things interesting mygm mode is arguably worse than before with just a minor design change there s a lot to be done to make this mode even decent myteam is still microtransaction heavy but its where i spend most of my playtime now as the auction house is back and helps to avoid the pack market that said the auction house is pretty empty and i don t think the time lag between transactions helps i also tried a couple of multiplayer challenges which went smoothly except that the park was very empty whenever i logged in overall one of the best nba2k games in recent memory every mode is fun except mygm great for offline or casual players 8 10
