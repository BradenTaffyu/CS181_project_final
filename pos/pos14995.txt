2017 i have such a soft spot for this game its visuals its music its characters all of it pops out in such beautiful charm and the gameplay has such a simplistic style that it makes you invest in it and the more you invest the more you discover and thrive as a player you are going to die a lot whether it be to starving to the darkness to your own insanity or even to spiders don t starve doesn t hold your hand but you get better you learn from your mistakes and you overcome your weaknesses i rarely play online with strangers but with a group of friends it is a blast huddling together at night working hard during the day using your character s strengths to work with those of others it s so much fun you build and build until you realise that you re all in a funny way a family a bunch of people stranded and who must work together get this game it s one of the best survival games i ve ever played fun by yourself amazing with friends 9 10
