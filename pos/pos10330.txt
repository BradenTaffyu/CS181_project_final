2022 how it started you mastered arcade racers like forza horizon and dirt you mastered simcades like f1 and forza motorsport you saw some streamers playing acc and it looked pretty cool how it s going you try playing acc with a controller only to spin at every turn on your first lap you get good enough with a controller to know that you need a wheel to do a proper lap you get good enough with an entry level wheel to know that you need a sim rig load cell pedals a direct drive wheelbase an authentic formula wheel butt kickers and a vr headset to truly feel immersed and squeeze every tenth out of each lap you spend all of your free time and most of your time in the office on sim racing forums and browsing gear sites your wife and kids become strangers but you don t mind because you just set a pr at spa don t fight it
