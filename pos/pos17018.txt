2017 well having been played nearly 200 hours in wh1 and 110 hrs in wh2 i would like to share some of my experience with the general gaming community experience in wh1 first of all why would i mentioned the game in first title of the trilogy well it s because the map in wh1 was stitched into wh2 under the massive campaign called mortal empire me my initial experience in wh1 was great as i was pumped to be exposed to the warhammer world which i have never even heard of i was amazed with all the sieges underpass field battles cavalry charges and so on but after like 50 hrs things get boring after you have tried most of the races and there seems to be nothing new anymore the event triggered gets pretty routine and predicted the game wasn t dynamic at all but still it is a decent game don t get me wrong though i still hate creative assembly for charging us the fee on the blood and gore graphic effects experience in wh2 man the vortex campaign that was exciting four major races clashing together to control the whirling vortex on a continent called ulthuan i was so excited that i even get my graphic card upgraded from gtx 950 to gtx 1070 to fully enjoy the ultra graphic settings the event was unpredicted traits on lords and heroes gained are based on actions taken the ocean is not dull anymore when its fill with treasures and attrition as well except that there is still no naval battle meh each continents where the 4 major races rest has its unique weather and terrain effect though that i am more than happier in wh2 than wh1 it is not without any cons the capitals model is not distinct enough for example the two legendary lords starting capital on the similar race looks the same there is not much challenge after you completed the vortex the buffs are just too epic i also dislike the fact that i can t have the legendary lords of the race you confederate with which is a massive meh for me mortal empires now this is the craziest stuff i have ever heard of the idea was brilliant the game studio combine the map from the first and second title of the game i will not discredit ca just because they have some bugs here and there i mean come on guys they gave you the extra campaign to spend another hundreds of gaming experience here for free they could have just walked away after the vortex campaign and move on to the third title of the trilogy or even get you to put in some bucks for the extra features if you don t get what i mean just head back to wh1 i can t complain overall well done ca
