2020 the very best racing sim out there just know what your getting into there are technically in app purchases that determine what type of racing you ll be doing if your on a budget and also that this sim is taken alot more serious than any other but it leads to some amazing races each car and track cost money so you will want to figure out what style of racing you want to do and buy just the cars tracks that pertain to the style it would probably be like 100 250 for most all the cars tracks for 1 specific series and about 4000 for everything in game but you will also probably be buying these cars tracks at a slow spaced out rate because you really want to start learning how to race in this sim at a slower rate as safe driving in this sim is almost more important than fast driving so take it slow and learn the tracks before hopping on a track with bunch of potentially real race car drivers you will also need to earn licences to race in a certain series so take you time and drive clean this is the type of sim where intentional crashing wreaking can get you a suspension or perm ban so its taken in alot more seriously and you can feel that vibe the moment you enter the track id say 90 of drivers are using a sim wheel but please do not thing you cant use a gamepad into this sim because you can you can practice in unofficial races that wont effect you irating safety rating but you still generally treat it as if it will offline practice is your free for all burnout doughnut locationbut cant recommend enough if you want the heart pounding feeling of bumper to bumper racing with other amazing drivers been playing this sim from january 2020 and have only come across that 1 person who sounded and was driving like a 10 year old who crashes for sports haha meet me on the track
