2017 i am not kidding when i say this is the closest game to a true dnd experience not perfect by any means but damn close 99 beautifully voice acted 1 being your character who doesnt talk much which i personally prefer visually stunning most if not every npc has been thought through and is unique with dialouge options choices that matter with true player freedom and amazing main and side quests game master mode is ground breaking to say the least mod support is very welcoming and sure to give the game life for years to come this game is easily worth 60 yet they sell it at 45 with no pre order bs a great game by a great developer 100 reccomend to rpg fans and players even slightly interested you wont regret it
