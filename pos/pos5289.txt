2015 this review is possibly biase because i played fallout3 and fallout new vegasthis review has been reviewed based on 180 hours of gameplay instead of the initial 70hoursif i had to summarize fallout 4 it would be half fallout half skyrim with a pinch of borderlands content wise is very high story driven if you are familiar with fallout combat its similar exploration could take up to 70 hours and still be unexplored new 180hours exploration still fresh but if you dont have the time consider a wiki settlements can be time consuming but can be ignored crafting requires prerequisites might be infuriating to some got a noticable bug when sometimes you get stuck in night vision if using a certain scope but can be fixed on pc using this command rimod 00094636 some quests can be bugged out but can easily be googled how to fix it maybe got 1 bug every 40 unique quests new 180hours the minutemen quests are annoying save this settlement kill some raiders at least you could just pay the kidnapping for 200 500 caps
