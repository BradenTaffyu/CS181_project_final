2020 raft is a relaxing occasionally zen like experience as you bob on the open ocean collecting resources crafting goodies both practical and cosmetic and expanding from a single tiny raft into a massive higgledy piggledy self sustaining ship occasionally stabbing a shark in the face with a spear he deserved it or getting rocks thrown at you by a bird you deserved it the survival elements are fairly simple and i find them well tuned and islands have become more and more exciting to explore as the game development has progressed there s even a storyline now which is pretty cool the first time you experience it there s an excellent balance between the peaceful sea faring and island exploring and occasionally battling with the most recent story based updates the game has really expanded although it s still unfinished and development seems very slow bring a friend as shark baitthe biggest benefit of raft to me is the seamless co op hosted on a local machine your friends can drop in or out of your game effortlessly and help you if you should want to let them progress without you which i have done a few times you can easily send them the file to load it s not quite as good as it being persistently online but it s easy enough i played around 40 hours with my husband and a friend and we pulled together assigning jobs and positions working as a team to explore the ocean and the land baiting the shark away from the others tucking unconscious bodies into bed you know all the sorts of things friends do for each other chest warshowever i will warn you that your friendships will be sorely tested when it comes to storage i cannot tell you how frustrating it was to sort every chest into specific categories painstakingly labelled with signs and then find that my husband had dropped wood into my seed box or scuba gear into my food box in the end i told him not to touch any of the boxes except the one with his name on it it staved off divorce i also got yelled at a few times for re arranging the rooms but really these guys have no interior design skills look i m type a okay i need order on my boat even in the apocalypse what s bad the main drawback is that the development is slower than me running a marathon with ankle weights on it s getting there but no one knows when it ll pass the finish line and you re just hoping it doesn t have a heart attack en route i m patiently waiting but i do wish the full experience was ready it s come a long way from release but i can t help but feel there s still a ways to go despite the snail like development i ve really enjoyed my time spent on the game and eagerly look forward to coming back to it next patch so it gets a thumbs up from me if you find the reviews of an old welsh lady interesting please follow my curator page updating because i just nominated this for the steam awards labor of love award and also i m cheeky and want the badge for editing a review i m so glad this has released and am looking forward to a playthrough again
