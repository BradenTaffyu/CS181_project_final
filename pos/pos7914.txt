2017 early access review alot of these negative comments are just pure lies you do not need a super high end computer you are completely fine with a 750 ti and a decent 4th gen i5 another thing i noticed is people complaining about the vehicles and that you can t customize them well you can just look into the settings and you will very easely find it there
