2020 early access review this is an incredible game with a ton of freedom and depth it is essentially an rpg sandbox there is no limit to the amount of different builds and strategies you can try testing new setups and refining older ones is incredibly addicting especially when you stumble upon a very effective synergy to keep things fresh much of the game is randomized and procedurally generated so your experience will still be very different even if you re use an old build the writing is fantastic and the world is immensely fascinating this is the type of game where you ll constantly want to learn more about its world and will scoop up any bit of additional lore you can get that being said qud is not for everyone it s brutally difficult and has a very high learning curve it demands the player invest themselves into learning its mechanics and nuances some players will also be turned off by the permadeath in a sense it is essential to the experience because it forces the player to truly engage with its systems in order to progress rerolling and trying new things is core to the game that being said this is a long game and it can be very unfair if the player is unlucky with rng for many losing a 15 hour run over something largely out of your control simply doesn t feel good fortunately permadeath can be turned off and i actually recommend some players deactivate it until they are comfortable and understand what the game is going to expect of them having the freedom to experiment and explore without fear of losing significant progress may be essential to the learning process depending on the person furthermore if you just want to play qud like a regular rpg where you can save and reload as much as you want you can do that and there s nothing wrong with doing so it s simply a matter of preference the graphics may also seem off putting and overly simplistic but really they are perfect for the overall atmosphere qud is full of beautiful evocative prose and descriptive text that allow the player to create a mental image far more vivid than any graphics could hope to convey you ll have to use your imagination but that s part of the fun this is aided wonderfully by the music which is equally as atmospheric surreal and evocative as the writing qud is honestly unparalleled in its atmosphere and there is nothing else that looks or sounds quite like it if you re the type of person who likes to experiment with rpg mechanics and enjoys reading you should absolutely give this game a shot at 15 is a steal as it already has hundreds of hours worth of content even in early access
