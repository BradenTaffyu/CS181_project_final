2020 when my friend first told me about this game i ll be honest i thought it looked like a niche game for middle aged men still living in their mother s basement however i was encouraged to buy it and as it was on sale for the incredible price of about 4 i agreed the very next day i bought the map booster bundle including many map expansions for places like italy scandinavia and a large chunk of france that isn t included in the base game on a separate note i highly recommend this bundle as it adds a lot of flavour to the map as you can tell from my irresponsible spending habits i loved the game from the first hour bear in mind that i am not a truck fanatic nor am i a driving game enthusiast there s just something bewitching about obeying the speed limits and stopping at red lights that makes my brain release the happy chemical it s the perfect game to play in a voice call with friends or even alone with some music on in the background it s the perfect balance of challenging and relaxing that it can be played late at night if you so desire if like me you are terrible at all driving games you ve ever played and the thought of paying for repairs whenever you crash is terrifying fear not the game isn t that punishing some things that ease the pain are that you are usually going 60 mph unless you are breaking the speed limits you criminal which makes crashing less likely than if you were driving a ferrari 150mph down a motorway nevertheless crashing and toppling your lorry are a core part of the game it does happen even so you start on quick jobs which involve driving somebody else s truck so you don t have to pay for repairs these quick jobs quickly become obsolete within the game economy because as soon as you own a truck you can make far more by taking those jobs unlocked to return to my original point if you feel like you d crash too often this option is a noob friendly way for people to experience the game talking about the experience of the game it is greatly enhanced by the support for steam workshop the modding community is greatly helpful in smoothing over some of the issues that come with a game made 8 years ago there are mods for everything from improved lighting systems to improved weather systems to improved textures to a mod that adds real life brands to the trucks additionally i believe there s an online modding website that has even more diverse and useful mods but to be honest i really can t be bothered to figure out how it works and the game is already good enough already that i m satisfied with simple graphics enhancements whilst all of this makes for a fantastic game i highly recommend by far the best aspect of this game is that you can pretend it s actually educational for instance you might say it teaches you about road laws i ve learnt a lot from this game such as speeding is fine as long as there are no speed cameras or police carsspeeding through a green light to avoid it turning red is often worth ittaking out loans to pay off your other loans leads to accumulating debt but it s fine because you can take out more loansbut the golden rule is as follows if your engine cuts out don t worry if it doesn t start again worry
