2020 this is the most fun i ve ever had being depressed i played this game when it was new and i still love it and find it interesting everyone else has already pretty much said what needs to be said about the game so here s why i like it the art is incrediblethe premise is interestingthe game mechanics were very funthe game was very punishing to learn but very rewardingthe game created an incredible world i want to see more of i love city building games and this one should be on every city building lovers list the game isn t perfect there s a lot of replayability but your 5th time beating a scenario isn t going to be as jaw dropping as the first time since you know of some pre scripted things that will happen i think thats my only quibble quit reading and buy this game
