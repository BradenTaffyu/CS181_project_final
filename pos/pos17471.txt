2016 i want to start by saying that i have been a fan of warhammer since i was 8 years old and my stepdad brought over some lizardmen miniatures for me to play with while he wooed my mom i have collected several armies over the years played many games and given up hours upon hours to reading the novels looking at the lore and writing my own adventures in the old world and beyond this is and has been my favorite fantasy setting since i was a child no other world brings all of the greatest fantasy elements together ties them into an awesome renaissance era and then adds in death and despair and crack addicted ratmen by the truckload quite like games workshop has with warhammer before you write the rest of this review off as the ramblings of a fanboy i want you to realize that this absolute love of warhammer has lead me to hold everything done with ip to the absolute highest standards i have played every video game that i can find with the warhammer logo and been grossly disappointed with all of them with the exception of vermintide which scratches a completely different itch since i was eight years old i have wanted a video game that let me control the emperors armies a game that let me see the old world in all of it s beautiful deadly detail every new warhammer game i ve seen has raised my hopes that this is the game that will let me do that this is the game that will bring the ridiculously overpriced tabeltop miniatures to life every new game has let me down until now mechanically this is one solid piece of clockwork the game is wonderfully optimized i run it with everything set to ultra and i have yet to see so much as a stutter in my 30 hours and i do not have a top of the line pc the graphics are great for a total war game and the special effects and monsters all look stunning campaign mechanics have been streamlined and simplified to make the empire building aspect of the total war series fun and less of a hassle no longer do you have to worry about food or sanitation fertility public order is now the only number the player must keep track of no longer do you have to look at a building and decide if the 12 public order is worth the 10 increase to your soldier s armor now buildings either let you recruit units or give you positive effects that isn t to say that it makes empire building easier just less of a chore you still need to plan out your building slots rather well as you only have a select few in each province new mechanics are brought into the campaign map as well and these are well done and add a nice new layer to the depth presented by the game one of these is corruption certain factions bring corruption to the lands this is generally done slowly and with little notice until it seems all at once that it hits you corruption brings about public order penalties to factions that don t use them as well as attrition for their armies this can be countered by certain buildings and heroes sieges have been revamped so now instead of attacking the entire city you only attack a single stretch of the walls while it makes the battles simpler it also allows for the ai to stand with the player on even footing and it makes the sieges more fun in rome 2 and attila i found myself auto resolving almost every single siege because of how lackluster and boring they were in tw warhammer i don t auto resolve sieges at all because they are fun and exciting it s fantastic watching my units of orcs fight for supremecy on the dwarven walls speaking of heroes they are the replacer for agents on the campaign map they are exactly like the agents of old however they have a new ability and that is the action that lets them join an army when embedded into an army a hero fights on the battle map along with the army and they are awesome they look great and have awesome special abilities to boot lords replace the generals and are much better they stand alone but are tougher and more resilient than the general s units of past games they also collect followers weapons armor and gear that can all be equippied to them and the heroes of your choosing the ai is much smarter than previous total war games though that s not to say that it doesn t act stupid at times all too often have i requested peace from a faction just to be denied and then offered peace and a fat purse for accepting the offer a turn later it makes no sense on the battlefield the ai is a lot smarter as well able to use the new units just as well if not better than me at times speaking of the new units warhammer fits in perfect with total war most of the new creatures and units are incredibly detailed and bring about new facets to the battlefield flying units giant monsters and magic are all welcome editions to the age old total war formula and they fit in so well battlefields are so much more intense when there are steam tanks fighting dragons than they ever could be with romans fighting carthagenians that s not to say that battles got a lot more complicated either the special abilities of units like spearwalls for hoplites have been removed with spearmen bracing themselves against charges automatically if they re standing still this is good because the special abilities that lords heroes wizards and magic items can be complicated enough when you have a lot of them and sometimes can turn into micro managing hell while battles are still complex chaotic messes it s at least manageable given all that is going on the five factions are all unique both on the campaign map and the battle map which adds a lot of replayability to the game i ve read complaints that the end game is repetitive because all factions have to beat chaos back to the wastes at the end but i don t really know what else they were expecting chaos has always been the big bad of the warhammer world so it makes sense that a finale would consist of beating them down hard all in all well done now for all of the praise this game still has it s negatives but they are few and far between the biggest issue seems to be with balance some damage spells are extremely powerful able to wipe out high tier units with a single cast while most aren t even worth their casting cost at all agent actions are also overpowered doing huge amounts of damage to entire armies while costing very little there are other things that bother me too when it comes to staying with the lore of the world the minor human nations have been extremely generalized receiving mostly reskinned empire units this is sad because these nations are important to the lore while i understand that they re not nor will they be playable that doesn t mean that on the campaign map they shouldn t be fleshed out even a little i mean come on kislev doesn t even get the tsarina katerina as their leader instead they recieve a generic empire lord certain locations also don t receive the attention that they should certain empire cities are supposed to be works of art yet are just generic versions of each other dwarfen holds aren t even close to how they re described in the lore also factions are missing entire chunks of their rosters which i m willing to bet will be added with dlc i m not even upset about that because i m used to gw practices of nickel and diming you so that was to be expected the game even has mod support something i never thought possible with gw involved the game isn t perfect but ca has worked very hard for a very long time to make it what it is and it is great you can immediately tell the amount of love that the game has been given and if more games were given this amount of attention to detail we would all live in a better place with better games 9 5 out of 10 great job creative assembly
