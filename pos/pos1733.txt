2017 oh boy this game is fantastic the story is unique and crazy with lore everywhere even your weapons tell a story you will need multiple runs to fully understand the main plot side quests are really simple but reward you with a bit of cash and needed materials the combat is amazing smooth and fun tho i recommend playing on harder dificulties and the soundtrack boy is it good if im not playing im using it to study its just so good 9 10 for weak port running it on a 1070 i5 4460 slightly below recommended and there are some framedrops plus the awkwardly slow render time
