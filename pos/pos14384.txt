2023 early access review much like factorio and satisfactory dyson sphere program shines bright among the automation base building genre the tutorial when first starting a new game nudges you in just the right directions without being overbearing the game loop of collecting building and automating is like crack and keeps you in the zone until you realize the whole day is gone each planet has a finite space and you can circumnavigate them with ease logistics are intuitive powerful and it just works as you play you progress through local planetary interplanetary and interstellar logistics which has a very satisfying complexity what makes this game stand apart from others in the genre is how it feels to play you feel the scale of the planets and the vastness of space sometimes it s nice just to kick back and watch and listen as the factory you ve assembled hums along the drones fly by and cargo ships arrive from distant worlds with new resources to feed the beast and at the end of it all you can look up into the sky from your starter world and see your hard work materialize before your eyes the dyson sphere will start to take shape piece by piece it becomes more complete and only gets faster as you optimize your factories it s very rewarding to see don t be put off by the early access tag even if this game never got another update it would be worth it at full price i am excited to see what the developers do next
