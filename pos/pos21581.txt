2023 it s okay it s the same gameplay as fh4 so it will feel very familiar but just in a bland and boring location yes the graphics are a bit better but that doesn t make it a better game and even with older graphics the uk setting looks better the seasons doesn t make any real difference to the look of the world or the gameplay in fact i barely notice the difference the music is real downgrade from fh4 but that s subjective of course they left a lot of my favourite cars from fh4 out maybe they ll be added later on the plus side newer cars better graphics better sound and more ways to upgrade your cars not saying avoid it s a good game in isolation but i feel a downgrade from the previous instalment in summary fh4 fh5
