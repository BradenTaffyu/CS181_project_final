overall i have no problem whatsoever recommending this game to anyone who wants to build a city because cities skylines ii is actually quite a bit more than that but before i go on it should be made clear that even now at the end of april of 2024 it remains an extremely rough program with quite a few problems put generously the game is now and will likely remain in a beta like state for this is my own estimate based on colossal order s work pace and educated guesswork at least another 12 to 18 months the game promised to be alot more than what was originally available at its release back in late 2023 but features such as easy in game mod access and a map editor were not officially available for months which upset many now however both are now available if still in a somewhat rough beta like state crashes and poor game performance were also widespread but are far less prevalent now all that being said cities skylines ii is now far more stable better performing flexible and includes the much desired map editor and mod support players now have access to their old favorite mods like anarchy and traffic manager not to mention a fairly broad variety of roads and highways building variety continues to expand as does zoning options this new cities skylines has a much wider economic base of gameplay the player no longer simply fulfills zoning demand but also must consider economic sectors such as food chain economics from crop fields to processing centers to grocery stores and warehouses the same goes for most every aspect of the city s economy oil fields produce crude oil which goes to either warehouses for storage transport hubs for export or long distance transport or refineries to be refined into useful products the player must manage and balance these product chains at every step through taxation tax incentives transportation infrastructure development complementary zoning and developing both production supply and demand and looking at just how detailed the game s economics are now going down to the individual citizen s level such as including rent the future of this game s development is interesting and enticing im not going to omit a significant warning though that this game is likely to be extremely demanding on your computer s hardware do not expect to have an enjoyable time playing this on any sort of laptop similar to its software predecessor cities skylines cities skylines ii is a game where one should expect less than 75 fps even on more powerful modern gaming desktops between the extremely high demands of such an intricately detailed simulation from the economics aspect to the path finding logic and the high detail building models in a frankly huge map area this game was likely developed with future hardware in mind so do not expect to run the in game graphics at 4k and on all high quality settings
