2016 this game is way more fun than rome 2 and atilla and maybe on par with shogun 2 if not a tiny bit better than it this is a definite improvement over the previous gamespros is a solid warhammer game soundtrack is actually something to brag about ai is actually alot smarter than before sieges are way more fun than before because of the units and ai units are highly detailed such as the legendary lordscons map could be bigger not enough races though they said there would be more in the sequal you can t conquer the whole map dlc policy sucks d ck
