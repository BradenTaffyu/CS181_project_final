2023 early access review oh boy where do i even start with beamng drive this game is an absolute riot if you re tired of those stuffy serious racing simulators then buckle up and prepare to laugh your wheels off with this gem let me tell you i ve never experienced physics so wacky and unpredictable in a game before beamng drive takes crash physics to a whole new level it s like they took newton s laws of motion and mixed them with a pinch of looney tunes the result a delightful chaos of twisted metal flying debris and vehicles doing somersaults like olympic gymnasts the best part is that you don t even have to follow the rules of the road want to turn your sleek sports car into a pancake go ahead fancy launching a station wagon into orbit you got it beamng drive gives you the freedom to unleash your inner demolition derby driver with an array of vehicles that are just begging to be obliterated but wait there s more the game s community is an absolute riot the mods and user created scenarios take the hilarity to a whole new level from insane stunts that defy the laws of physics and common sense to races that make the fast and furious look like a snail race the creativity of players knows no bounds i never thought i d see a monster truck pulling off a backflip through a ring of fire but thanks to beamng drive it s now a regular occurrence in my gaming sessions sure the graphics aren t going to win any awards but honestly who cares when you re too busy laughing your head off the focus here is on pure unadulterated fun and beamng drive delivers it in spades my only warning be prepared to lose track of time one minute you re loading up the game for a quick joyride and the next thing you know it s the early hours of the morning and you ve just spent hours perfecting your barrel roll technique it s ridiculously addictive so make sure you ve got plenty of snacks and a comfortable chair before diving in so if you re in dire need of a game that will make you giggle like a maniac and forget all your worries beamng drive is the way to go just remember to buckle up because you re in for one heck of a wild ride note no virtual vehicles were harmed in the making of this review note 2 this review wasn t generated by ai totally i promise
