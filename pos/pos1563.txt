2020 nier automata this is definitely one of a good example on how action rpg games should strive to be minus the poor port optimization ofcourse that being said action rpg is not usually my thing but this one check all the right boxes for me plus this game offer one of the best boo er i meant story this game have one of the most amazing story i ve seen in a while anyways here are the breakdown for the game the pros mind blowing storythis this for me is one of the main selling point of this game the story is made of 3 parts where each segment shows a different pov on the situation surrounding our main characters not only the main story is good hol up good is understatement its brilliant not only the main story is brilliant even the side stories are great so as you progress the main story i highly recommend you to try to complete the side stories as well as despairing as the story seems the whole point of the story is about over coming despair while sort of drowning in the process and they did a wonderful job in telling it powerful soundtracki can t stress enough on how good the ost is i m pretty sure they could make millions just by selling the ost itself exaggeration aside the soundtrack is great hands down my favorite part is how they twist emil s happy go lucky song into a song with eerie and dark feel about it oh and the 8bit version from minigames are a cute addition intriguing gameplaythe hacking minigame aside which is pretty okay for me the game is mix between action and bullet hell game which is very interesting and the great thing about it is that instead of creating an abomination they actually did it right and made it one of the great element this game has to offer sweet sweet character development beautiful level design of a post apocalyptic world ending e the cons now despite all the great things i said about nier automata the game comes with one major flaw and it s the poor optimization now i don t know if there s a fix for this out there do let me know if there is what the said problem does is it does not allow nier to run smoothly even on high end pcs other than that i have no problem with the game whatsoever or maybe it was so small it doesn t really affect my gameplay oh and one more thing i highly recommend playing with a controller instead of keyboard cause it felt awkward on keyboard well atleast it did for me verdict so did i enjoy the game yes i most definitely enjoy the game very much even with the porting problem i still enjoy the game very much totally recommended if you re looking for a game with solid gameplay and superb story writing do give it a try
