2023 hi so this whole controversy is stupid i typically dont like to write essays in my reviews and generally speaking posting something like this isn t really smart but this entire scenario is literally just people getting facts wrong and jumping on the bandwagon and its so dumb so here s how it actually goes boatworks ishmael a new character being released who i ll just dub fishmael from here on out for convenience sake was getting flak from the fanbase now this character is in a skin tight bodysuit instead of getting mad about the over exposure mainly the chinese and south korean playerbase was mad that she wasn t showing enough skin and so in an effort to make an impact they were gonna target the person who illustrated fishmael except because she wasn t showing skin they automatically jumped to it being the work of feminism inside the company just because they had absolutely nothing to fight against project moon with these people deduced that since the artist who drew fishmael was a man he couldn t be a feminist they started rooting through all the different artists and found one named vellmori she had deleted past tweets of being a feminist but she was also a misandrist she had a deleted tweet that roughly read all korean men should be aborted these players took the opportunity to jump on her harassing her sending death threats to her and the company there was even a man who walked directly into the pm office knowing that south korean men are required to enlist in the military and potentially have military experience this is dangerous for the artist so in an act of self preservation and additionally to protect vellmori from any further harassment they fired her pm has a no tolerance policy for social political drama from their employees now in light of this i don t support the actions taken i like to think that had the circumstances been different they would not have fired anybody but not only were the pm ceo and limbus manager not present and away on a vacation it was a choice of either firing one person or risking the entire company over something that should not have been an issue as a side note this same general demographic of players had issues with the last recent update specifically with the bugs that were present when a game is updated weekly bugs can be expected the main issue people had was a problem where a unit would actually get worse when being upgraded a feature that was not only patched within 2 days but had an enormously generous compensation to boot there s a theoretical argument that i feel represents pm well when they made their decision to fire the artist called the trolley problem it s represented by a graphic of a train or a trolley running towards a group of people tied down on a track however there s a lever that would change the route of the track to hit one person instead of the group either way someone dies but there s a decision that has to be made to round off my thoughts i don t think there was a better option to take i wish it didn t have to come to what it came down to but i see so many people just jumping on the bandwagon without knowing all the facts it s here on steam with the game getting review bombed it s trending on twitter with twitter users doing what twitter users do really what it boils down to was an unfortunate situation caused by an artist s desire to not overtly sexualize one of their characters and a problem with the social view of feminism over the seas as a non korean i can t even begin to imagine how difficult it is to actually support feminism over there just because of how the public views it it s just a little ridiculous how little information people need to form their opinions i review this game not only as a fan of it and pm s other games but as someone concerned for the state of the company because of this issue it s gotten out of hand and everyone review bombing it is only making it worse for the victims i m a firm believer in not feeling any sympathy for a company but they have genuinely done nothing wrong aside from the actions they ve taken to stay afloat having no other reasonable choice in summation leave the game a good review this whole thing is frankly so brain dead and it amazes me just how many people across so many platforms are entirely ruining this game that they haven t played because they re too lazy to read any information if anybody reads this i m leaving comments on for corrections on any information i may have missed but also for conversation i m happy to talk civilly to anyone regardless of what stance you take on the situation
