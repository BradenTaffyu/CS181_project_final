2020 overallpros big diversity several paths to follow fun with friends competitive challenger probably the best strategy game right now cons too demanding germany is overpower lack of content without dlc sdifficulty hard extremely hardreview apart from age of empires possibly hearts of iron 4 was the strategy game that i liked the most this atmosphere of the second world war that the game creates is fantastic from the preparation to the war itself undoubtedly the best in this game it is giving you different paths from changing the goals of conquest to the very ideology that the country has communism fascism among others and that undoubtedly gives the player a enormous freedom the strategy is very but very present in this game you simply cannot choose a country that in practice is at a military economic social level more evolved than others and simply destroy everything the game forces you to have a job behind you have to choose your attack points you have to pay attention to the factories because you have to continue to always have resources to manufacture equipment among other that all in the end is interesting in this game but i am sincere i understand that the game is complex but in the end it takes a long time to learn in how to play i think it is a little demanding i have about 60 hours and i continue to learn this is not bad but never having won a game without counting obviously when was my alliance that led me forward but being me destroying everything and everyone it makes me draw two conclusions either i am really really but really very bad player or as i said earlier game is very demanding returning to the conversation about the victories i decided to take a test i chose to play as turkey i became a fascist i joined axis and i was simply excited to see what happened my conclusion germany is overpower if the player does not oppose it the game is simply over it is impossible for the allies to win both in historical and non historical i understand that germany was a gigantic power but at least the historical one could be defeated since that was the end of the war speaking of non historical i think the game lacks content at a certain level it is true that there are dlc s but we have to think that not everyone has a wallet to buy them and since the vast majority of countries do not have one focus tree dedicated in a way as i said to a certain lack of content that makes the game become repetitive after several hours if you like to play more with small countries now i will explain what i liked most about hearts of iron the multiplayer especially playing with friends makes the game extremely competitive and this is spectacular it is really fun and i think it will not let me criticize who has 1000 hours because i m quite capable of having them one day too in short hearts of iron 4 is a masterpiece in terms of strategy it gives the player great freedom of choice and forces him to think about the best way to win the game final evaluation 88 100
