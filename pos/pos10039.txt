2018 game trully faithul to motto losing is fun both motto and idea of a game comes from a legendary dwarf fortress rimword is a fine made child with much easier approach in both graphics and difficulty in few words it s a df lite game even though i have spent a share amount of time to df still 5 my first games were failures mostly to my supid mistakes and all of them were catostrophic fun if this game would have opportunity to make massive projects not possible because of only one layer of terrain game is happening or fluid control this game would be epic but don t get me wrong it is still awesome game with a lot things to do build conquer etc for hundreds hours of fun and laughing from your mistakes i recommend to everyone who like some challenge in games
