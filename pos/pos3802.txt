2022 i read some reviews here and many said this game is like ogre battle march of the black queen so i downloaded it yes yes it is basically if you were living for the last 20 years with the itch to play another game like ogre battle get this game just in case you need more about the game here is my take after about 40 hours first off for some players this game has a little bit of a learning curve to how things work so watch the tutorial videos the developer has made right to the point instructions the game story is linear as far as i can see but how you approach it does not need to be if you like certain characters or units it s fine you can still use them and make it through the game no matter what some of the min max guides say there are opportunities in battles to pick up certain troops way ahead which is awesome so pay attention the game does try to level troops to match the player in captain difficulty but generally does not try to crash your game with over powered opposition aka fire emblem which seemed to embrace the moto of thou shall not carry all characters to the end without perfect game strategy that said you can try perma death option here too if you want that type of experience it is squad based with multiple unit types making up the squad or just on type of unit your choice there can be some frustration just like in ogre battle that the mage is just not levelling not matter what you do there are items to help but they are not in unlimited supply so you have to make choices game attack mechanism sometimes can make you a little confused like when your mage wipes a row and all your melee characters hit that row while it s already ashes just in case the enemy turns to un dead the user interface is the next thing to get used to sometimes there is a lot of back and forth to get something done as simple as comparing which unit to apply a buff too though generally in battle interface is right to the point play with two button mouse is all you need the game is fun if not slightly addictive not too complex or heavily dependent on rng the normal game level feels just right with enough challenging scenarios to keep you thinking but still enjoying yourself performance wise it runs smooth without requiring the giga chad rig to play it on standard machine 7th gen i5 16gb ram and 4gb gpu is enough i have tried it on a microsoft surface pro 3 and works well though some of the larger battles may push the machine if you like 2d tactical turn based game play with unit building with no excessive administrative management this game is worth a try now if maybe dancing dragon games devs would try a new take on the original shining force one can dream
