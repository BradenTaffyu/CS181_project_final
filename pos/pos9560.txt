2021 assetto corsa for those who don t know it is a pure and hard simulator this means that the incidences of high speed driving through particularly advanced car models suitable for racing in closed circuit or iconic from other eras find an approach to physics and a feeling of control very close to reality depending on the configuration while other games tend to smooth out the driving process often through exterior perspectives of pursuit that make it easier to read the track here the perspective from the passenger compartment takes on a central role in a position behind the wheel and inside we better play our role as a virtual driver with so much emphasis placed on the simulation and control processes of the car it is natural that the pad in hand audience can suffer and even feel the game deny a lot of its pretensions this is particularly noticeable when entering a race or challenge as you can select from an extensive catalog of aids those that you want to keep on off or adjusted by means of an incidence percentage in the closest configuration to reality assetto corsa becomes an insane and difficult game to tame something that can only be followed through a steering wheel in the opposite direction and assisted the use of the remote may be enough as long as they agree to configure the opponents artificial intelligence as the easiest option and apply them during the races avoiding accidents and starting by using the ideal trajectory so as not to brake too late on a curve opponents behavior tends to be aggressive especially if we increase the degree of difficulty those virtual pilots don t miss a turn don t give in on the trajectory and get lap times that require the best of us not to lose sight of them avoiding skidding collisions and wide exits preventing the tires from squealing too much is mandatory is essential each lap therefore has to be perfect and that requires concentration and good handwork the challenge tends to get bigger as we jump into more demanding and hard to master cars as a rule the sensations of cars configured for the track are good while road machines with more flexible suspensions tend to adorn a little in curves and to slide through behaviors that are nonetheless predictable but if we choose the ferrari manned by niki lauda in the mid eighties and we take it to a demanding circuit like the nurburgring at every turn it hangs over us with the weight of uncertainty as we press the accelerator and i happily recommend this game to any motorsport lover excellent graphics gameplay is excellent game physics is impressive great sounds totally realistic
