2023 early access review honestly i heard the launch was really bad and lucky enough to miss it i mean this is bit more than a simple graphics update they changed a fair bit of things and added more of the most popular mods into the base game biggest thing that makes me happy is how better the building system is so if you have the cash for it i do recommend the upgrade lets hope the dlcs arent gonna cost as much since i owned all the old arks dlcs
