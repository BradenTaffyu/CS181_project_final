2014 i once said that rome 2 has stupidest ai i have ever seen in the total war franchise and due to that i do not recommand it to anyone that love the former total war titles now after numerous patches and updates i can say with confident that this game is pretty solid right now with reformed battlefield and domestic management system rome 2 is a lot of fun to play though it is still not as good as shogun 2 imo ca released the emperor edition together with its campaign pack for free which is a positive signal that they are trying to improve the game since its buggy launch this is something that i really appreciate and i will continue to support any total war title developed by ca in the future
