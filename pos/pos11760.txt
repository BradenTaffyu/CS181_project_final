2023 early access review i don t often leave reviews but wanted to weigh in on ark survival ascended as far as content it s ark survival evolved remastered it s exactly what you d expect from a remaster and exactly what you d expect if not a bit better from an early access title it s got amazing graphics and some much needed quality of life improvements but also some bugs and crashes there s been some drama around the hardware needed to run the game and the state of personal dedicated servers both were reasons i didn t pick this up day one however these have mostly been resolved so i picked it up day three it s still in the realm of crysis levels of frame rate and settings but it s perfectly playable if it gets better i ll be even happier while server documentation is scarce and from what i can tell only windows is available they have released drm free server files all of this to say my immediate concerns have been addressed and i m overall satisfied with the state of the game as it exists today i m eager to see how the title evolves pun intended and look forward to further optimizations and content
