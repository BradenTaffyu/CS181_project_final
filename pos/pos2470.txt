2020 i was extremely against fallout76 when it first released due to all the controversy the piss poor gameplay and everything revolving around fo76 however with the wastelanders update i decided to buy the game and try it out and i have to say it s a lot of fun it feels like a fallout game now with the npc s and the quests the dialogue sure there are still some bugs but overall it s worth the price tag it s asking for but fallout 1st
