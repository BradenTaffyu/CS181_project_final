2018 total war warhammer iiis this game good yes is it worth the price well let s talk about that this is without a doubt the best total war game i ve ever played note parts of my review covering singleplayer campaign battles was cut due to the limit of words in steam review the good the bad good decent graphics a lot of graphical options intuitive unit control long lifespan a lot of replay ability huge variety between races the addition of large monsters in a total war game is very cool many optional features good base game campaignbad dlc pricing is too damn high need to wait for a sale to buy a dlc need to buy total war warhammer to play the massive campaign the mortal empires campaign feels almost too big you forget time ruin your sleeping schedule you need to buy blood effects longevity the longevity is fairly long as we ve discussed already you can ultimately get 5 25 13 50 755 hours out of the game if you do campaigns alone with each race not including each sub faction within each race that s singleplayer only now for multiplayer you can play both campaign battles as well as quick battles and more however standard multiplayer battle is the most popular there is a ton of content in its full potential we already covered quite a bit of this within campaign and battles was cut due to running out of space what you need to know is that the base campaign you get with the total war warhammer ii is the best campaign the mortal empires campaign is actually a bit too big but if you want that go crazy multiplayer playerbase the playerbase is decent there is always several games to pick from you can always make your own battle and people will fill up the room or lobby within 1 2 minutes the multiplayer playerbase is at a healthy state and there is a lot of new players as well as old veterans even t hose who played for long can still be clueless about certain races because it takes a long time learning each race which leaves you with a lot to discover to truly master the multiplayer you need to practically be good at every race so you know each races unit and their weaknesses multiplayer battles consists of 4 player ffa 1v1 2v2 3v3 4v4 if you limit it to 2v2 or less you are able to allow large armies which allows you to double the army size and funds making one this may however impact performance if you deploy 6 000 skaven units you will feel an impact but it feels so cool watching a literal tide of skaven rats washing over the enemy soldiers while you lobe plague containers over everyone causing chaos and destruction even to your own people will often warn you if they intend to play such a game as it s known to kill potato pcs a thing worth noting if you have severe lag the entire gamespeed slows down to match your current gamespeed caused by your lag so you are not at a disadvantage of losing frames in combat everything just goes slower the dlc is a nightmare the biggest issue with this game and an issue you may rightfully be concerned about before diving into this game is the well discussed amount of dlc to this game first of all i need to clarify you are not limited or restricted to player with others if you don t own a specific dlc race you can still play with others who own every dlc and play against their race but you yourself just cannot play said race now with that settled the dlc for this game is for the most part just races as i ve said the base game total war warhammer ii consists of 4 playable races high elves dark elves lizardmen and skaven if you are like me and your favorite race is dark elves you don t really feel like you want anything else but there is also some free dlc that is available however those are not races but maps and sub factions to some races however i feel like we should move onto the price section as the dlcs biggest issue is the pricing and whether or not you should purchase them price the price for the base game and with all it s content is 59 and i feel it s well worth it there is plenty of hours of gameplay and all 4 races you get are very fun to me i like dragons and i like dinos and watching hordes of rats dying is amazing so i feel it s a far better race composition you get in this game compared to the former total war warhammer now the issue people have is the dlc and some people feel like the dlc should have been included into the main game while i tend to agree with that presumption i also feel like the diversity in gameplay between each race is so massive that i can see why it s split apart however with that said i don t think you should buy any dlc because why should you if you have no interest in the other races there is absolutely no reason to buy any of the other races at all so it s my strong recommendation that you just play the base game if you have a favorite race that goes beyond this game then i highly recommend you buy that specific race and nothing more years ago i collected dark elf figures assembled the black dragon seraphon i collected a lot of stuff and wanted even more than i could afford at the time seeing those units ingame on the battlefield crushing your enemies is so cool and amazing if you have a similar affection for a race i highly recommend that you buy that race however if you just want a race because they seem cool then i see no reason for you to buy them unless you can afford it of course over the course of a year i ve bought almost every dlc for this game and i feel like it was worth it at least for me since i ve played the game enough to justify it if you want some race just for the sake of wanting i suggest you wait for a sale but in my honest opinion the base game is well worth it the price not it also included my favorite race dark elves the final verdict this review has gone on for a very long time and we need to reach a conclusion i strongly believe that the base game has enough content to justify a purchase after all you get 4 playable races and the best campaign by far if you truly enjoy the game beyond this point i d recommend you buy the other game to unlock the massive campaign which gives you a lot of new playable races as well but unless you have some affection to a specific race i suggest you only buy those if they go on a sale however i suggest you take it 1 step at the time if you like the base game enough you can ask yourself if you want to take the next step the base game campaign is well worth it and then comes the additional potential of endless multiplayer
