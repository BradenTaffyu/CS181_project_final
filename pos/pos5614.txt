i had fun with bannerlord i really had a great time with it but sadly it has become abandonware the game looks beautiful the combat animations are fluid and it can get very exciting managing your troops in the battlefield and defeating your opponent will make you feel like the calradian achilles the world of calradia and the towns are a fresh improvement from the 2 3 buildings in warband every unit and faction has it s pros cons though there are a few kingdoms who will steamroll another quite early but it s not like there s much science in how to build your army protip khuzait lancers battanian fian champions imperial legionnaires however it s as deep as a pond once you become king or rich merchant or famed mercenary or conqueror of the continent that s it forget about endgame content there aren t any feasts which really is sad you can build a family i guess and wait for your son to be of age to adventure i guess that s really all i can think about it endgame wise mods try to keep this game alive but every update will break every mod you have but it has not received an update in a long time so yeah maybe there won t be much breaking pick it up on sale i really don t think full price is worth it
