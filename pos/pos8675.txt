2022 in my opinion this is the best hunting game by far its not hard to get weapons dlc s are needed but they are worth it 100 you can spend and will need to a lot of time to get rare animals my first diamond rated animal was at 60 hours of playtime pretty much every animal has very rare versions like albino melanistic 0 01 spawn rate usually and the rarest of all are the great ones whitetail red deer black bear and maybe there will be a moose great one soon great ones take lots of time around 1k kills lowest i would say and you need some specific dlc s to make the grind easier more efficient overall this game is very chill addictive and very fun but its not for impatient people
