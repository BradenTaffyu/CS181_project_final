2016 when i first played don t starve one thing that i kept thinking was i wish i could share this with my friends and finally i can the multiplayer experience is amazing especially with a friend that you can talk to on some kind of voice chat the don t starve world translates very nicely to co operative play but since i haven t tried pvp i can t comment on what that s like at all out of the three friends i ve played with two ended up finding don t starve too stressful something about how there s too much to keep track on at once and the constant scrounging for survival became too much like work in the game s defence this was during early beta and they weren t don t starve players to begin with but i think there s something to it don t starve demands that you re quick on your feet and able to multitask to some degree it can get pretty hectic and there s not any time to stand around to gather your thoughts it s something to keep in mind if you prefer games that can be paused or where you can spend a lot of time weighing your options me i feel like i ve found the game for the very first time all over again the stuff i loved finding on my own is twice as fun to encounter with someone else by my side there s a bit lost in atmosphere because you re no longer so devastatingly alone and things are less creepy but that small loss is made up for with a new unpredictability today for instance i was happily foraging for berries when my friend started shrieking that the trees had grown tentacles and were giving birth to some freaky baby trees a well planned day suddenly became a mad scramble for survival
