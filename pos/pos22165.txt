2019 dark souls iii was my introduction into the souls series i actually owned bloodborne on ps4 and played a small amount but hadn t put together its relation with the souls series and couldn t wrap my head around it at first because of that i went into ds3 a tad nervous that it wouldn t be the game for me could i have ever been more wrong i typically play fps i e r6siege or open world rpgs i e fallout skyrim but this experience has evolved my outlook on gaming as a whole ds3 is a must own for anyone who enjoys methodical combat intertwined with rpg elements the game has beautiful environments that are accented by some truly horrendous enemies dwelling in them the game challenges you something any person should know about the souls series but it never feels unfair it just requires you to learn from your enemies and adapt to them with each one area posing a different style of threat i was stuck on iudex the first boss for hours and just before i gave up i finished him and i was sucked in by that satisfaction invasions are still frustrating after my 170 hours pvp is a huge adjustment after pve as net code and player skill makes your attack timing entirely different hackers also exist so there can be some very frustrating times where you re trying to get better but you simply can do nothing but watch as someone instant curses you or uses their super speed but the pvp system also allows you to try out builds that fit a unique niche that you may not have been able to use viably trying to play the story mode this extra dimension further extends the seemingly endless replayability this game offers i would suggest trying to tackle some invasions early sl85 or lower as there s a huge learning curve and most players above this level are weathered vets that will show no mercy i never thought going into this game that it would be one of my favorite games of all time i cannot wait to go to bloodborne and the other souls games but for right now i am still very much enjoying my third playthrough and plan on making a few more for some different level functionality characters 9 10
