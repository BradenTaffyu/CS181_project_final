2017 i feel like they fixed everything that was wrong with the first one no reason not to buy this if you were a fan of tw wh1 gameplay is smoother and ran even better than the first story mode can actually be completed in a reasonable amount of time and with a proper amount of challange heros are no longer able to disband armies at a whim overall while this game could just be tacked on as dlc i feel like this new map along with the races and objective make this its own beast with more than enough content
