i highly recommend mount blade ii bannerlord to anyone who enjoys medieval rpgs or rts style games to give you a short summary of this game you start out as a warrior noble you go from village to village town to town completing quests fighting in arenas recruiting mercenaries into your army joining a faction and then joining a larger army and going to war with other factions the combat system is highly addictive as the battlefields and sieges tend to have hundreds of units on the screen at once you are in full control over your character and try to kill as many units as you can to avoid casualties to your own troops that you are also able to command and change formations i think what really draws me in here is that you are raising your own group of mercenaries and watching as they grow and level up you also get to recruit commanders heroes that you can fully equip with gear and so fourth this makes every battle engaging because you truly don t want anyone on your side to die and heaven forbid your entire army is wiped out meaning you would have to start over downsides the intro to the game is rather slow as you go around fighting small groups of looters and raiders the quest systems is incredibly repetitive i feel like you get the same handful of quests over which breaks the immersion crashes frequently
