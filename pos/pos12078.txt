2016 realistic competitive multiplayer racing it s what other racing sims try to be instead of worrying about perfecting an ai the developers of iracing have spent their resources creating real tracks down to the smallest change in pavement with 3d laser mapping technology the effort that goes into their services is astonishing but in the end iracing is hard to look at as a game it is a subscription based simulator service originally based on the engine of nascar racing 2003 season if you are looking for a game similar to need for speed burnout or even other racing sims iracing may not be for you the subscription model requires you to purchase cars and tracks as you advance your racing license awarding safe and competitive racing along the way and this has been a major turn off to a lot of non simracers similarly you really need a racing wheel to be competitive in this game wheels are not cheap playing with an xbox one controller i can do fine in rookie class but when i advance to race in sanctioned series within class d i struggle greatly to be competitive in a world where your setup means everything people who play with a wheel gearbox pedals simply are at an advantage and there s no reason to nerf that to compensate for the people who go into this game expecting to dominate with a controller i am perfectly content to participate with a controller fully aware that i will probably never win a race the fun comes from fighting the car to stay off the wall avoid crashing into your opponents and run the best line lap after lap in an attempt to keep it together long enough to see the checkered flag for me as a huge fan of stock car racing these aformented things are all things i liked there are very little things i dislike about iracing the tracks and cars are great the compatibility with controller schemes and layouts are some of the best the community is excellent there are a lot of good sports out there and the game itself feels like real racing the stock livery editor is decent and you can expand it infinitely using programs like paint net to customize your own paint scheme the things i dislike are mainly nitpicks such as that i wish there were more tracks offered in the rookie class races i wish there was a larger variety of series available to low level license holders that use more of the cars and tracks included in the basic membership but honestly that s it in the end iracing wasn t built for steam it was built for racing enthusiasts to go against one another virtually without the risk cost and other factors associated with racing in real life if you aren t a racing enthusiast or a simracer iracing is probably not what you re looking for there s nothing quite like iracing disclaimer as you probably have guessed i primarily play iracing on oval tracks i have ran on some road courses and most of my review remains relevant however i can not speak for a lot of tracks or cars that are in the game as i am not investing in advancing my license rank outside of oval series i d almost certainly need a wheel to do that edit 11 26 2016 a few months ago i picked up a racing wheel the thrustmaster vg ferrari 458 italia red legend edition racing wheel and it completely changed the way this sim handles if you can get a wheel they aren t thousands of dollars anymore i got mine for less than 100 and it completely changes the experience for the better the cars handle so much easier it s easy to be competitive and it just makes it so much more immersive and enjoyable
