after 167 hours i ve finally finished rogue trader what an absolutely incredible game i m not gonna include any spoilers here but i do wanna talk about some of the ups and downs 1 storyline this was the most incredible collection of 40k short stories along the main plotline in the form of sidequests the narrative in the background was not only expansive but it changes with the choices you make some of the sidequests involved extremely specific and far flung lore so this game went seriously deep into the lore you can make decisions that are dogmatic iconoclast and heretical i went iconoclast because reason made the most sense and it opened me up to the most characters including those that join your cause however i d like to play it through the other two ways because the story will change significantly and they make that really clear in the game 10 10 for storyline however i think it would have been very difficult to even complete this game without consulting google every so often it was sometimes hard to find the person you need to talk to because that person is not shown on the map so you would have to do a lot of exploring this wasnt a huge problem but there were a few points where i had to go hey community what am i supposed to do to get past this point 2 music the soundtrack is easily the best soundtrack for a 40k game and i say that knowing there s an outstanding soundtrack for darktide mechanicus bfg gladius etc it s dark epic brutal suspenseful and it uses the right music to suspend you in emotions for hours as you play through different parts the first two chapters relies on a few tracks but as you get later into the game and waaay more gets added you realize what an expansive undertaking it was to have an orchestra perform all this 10 10 bugs there were a few the ones that were serious were few and they were easily avoided by reloading and just not stepping over that really out of reach spot overall i didn t really find bugs to be a serious issue or one that was gamebreaking battle and level up system it s very confusing at first to figure out what s best for leveling up your characters frankly the first few chapters i picked what seemed best but as you progress through the game you start to see the connections between choices and can really upgrade your characters to top meta there is also someone on your ship that can start a character over entirely and you can do it all over again if you mess up overall amazing game there are so many choices that would have made big differences even within the bounds of the big 3 i really enjoyed this game and recommend it to anyone else who has way too much time on their hands
