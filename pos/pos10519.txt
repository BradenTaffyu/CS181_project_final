2017 if you want a free to play game that allows you to unlock every part of it for free is visually appealing while still running smooth on lower end pcs and still gameplay packed with action at every part of a round then i d recommend this game if you re worried about any grind don t you can unlock a new ship every 2 4 days if you play for over an hour or so per day though as i m still in the beginning stages of the game i can t say this is true later in the game most of the negative reviews are regarding the fact you can t transfer data from your old wargaming account to steam which is why the reviews are now mixed now as a new player this didn t affect me at all so take it from me when i say that this game is absolutely awesome as a free to play game
