2017 my recorded hours for this game should tell you just how much i love it before i checked into tw wh the only other tw game i d tried was napoleon i hadn t had a great experience with it so i was very skeptical of buying warhammer when a friend recommended it to me i checked out some videos and watched a campaign playthrough of the vampire counts i watched 6 separate parts for it and afterwards i said i need this game now i shelled out 60 dollars for it and that was indeed painful but it has been well worth it i ve played a campaign for each different race and each one especially the newer factions offer something unique and make them worth playing i definitely had the best time with norsca plundering and razing the old world in the name of the dark gods overall i give this game a solid 9 5 10 the only thing holding it back for me is the aggressive dlc policy still theres plenty of base game content and flc to make this game a definite buy fantasy and strategy is a match made in heaven for me so i can t help but recommend this game if you re concerned about the amount of dlc or not sure which ones to get if you can t afford them all i recommend these 3 must haves chaos warriors dlc wood elves dlc norsca dlci ve never written a review for a steam game before let that tell you again how much i love this game
