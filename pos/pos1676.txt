2017 nier automata experiencessome of trailer on the internet led me to believe that nier automata would be a mission based game with some sort of central hub playing as yorha no 2 model b or simply 2b and accompanied by reconnaissance model 9s you must meet up with the android resistance and complete missions on earth to help drive back the machines and via the wonderful replayability of multiple endings discover what has really happened it s difficult to explain how this fairly basic premise evolves into the wonderful rpg story that it does without spoiling anything but it eventually grips you with its twists and turns and is a real highlight for the game the combat systemi enjoyed the combat as well as the frequent changes in gameplay soundtracki cannot stress enough how great the soundtrack is it s not plagued by synthetic boops and beeps or other superficial trappings to make it sound futuristic or sci fi instead it has soaring strings intimidating drums powerful chants ethereal chimes and mournful piano accentuating and punctuating the action onscreen my opinion recommended there were a lot of great games this year so far but nier automata is easily my favorite so it s pleasantly made me want to play this game again and again i recommend this game
