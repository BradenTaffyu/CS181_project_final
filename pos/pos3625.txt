omori is not a game people should play casually for alot of people even me i played this game to have fun i did not get that i got an down to earth explanation for why the stress your feeling is not from the game but from your own trauma you may have seen videos like omori ruined my life but well it really doesn t omori helped me process and understand my own trauma im not gonna lie not well but at least it was something that actually cared enough to explain why all the traumatic stuff was still hapenning this is kinda personal but on feburary 20th of 2023 after a good amount of therapy even to this day a psychiatrist has diagnosed me with primary ptsd and secondary depression i can blame this game for all i want like others but without it i may actually have killed myself
