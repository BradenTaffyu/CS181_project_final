2020 the truth is the game was rigged from the start fallout new vegas is another fallout that should already say a lot about it it s good this game takes place in new ve i mean the mojave wasteland although a big part of the story is settled in new vegas and it s clearly the main shining dot here a big lovely desert with all the perks from a post great war location such as super mutants giant mutated animals and a constant struggle of power lovely seriously now the mojave wasteland was and it still is a desert they nailed that perfectly there s a lot of locations to go to caves cities mountains underground bases vaults so many locations with each of them being mostly different from each other a lot of effort was put into them and it shows so many items and loot scattered and hidden around it was always nice finding a valuable item hidden between a seemingly empty room although it definitely felt boring and repetitive sometimes to just open every container in a room and hope there was something useful inside of them otherwise welp you wasted time my favorite location has to be novac a motel becoming a town and having its no vacancy sign now in ruins and only displaying no vac being used as the place s name was such an interesting and funny background to the place the dinosaur and the giant thermometer were also nice details i loved that town so much that i still kept using it as my main house even though i already had other houses in far prettier and comfier places the diversity in equipment in this game is simply amazing so many outfits so many drinks so many drugs drank an drugs so many guns from the throwing spear to the plasma grenade from the 9mm pistol to the gatling laser this game s weapon diversity truly amazed me and the game s skill system made it really fun to make a character focused on certain weapons adding even more fun to the whole deal even if it didn t felt like it actually changed much with the exploration and looting being so nice it s a shame to know that the combat is hot garbage the hud feels weird plus mainly gunplay feels clunky and actually aiming with guns feels like a chore most of time i just found myself either sniping an unmoving target with a shot to the head and if enemies were moving i d just walk to them or wait until they were close enough to me so i could aim at their general upper torso area and hope they got enough headshots to die v a t s truly is a mechanic made so you could actually shoot at stuff i tried using true iron sights during my first hours of the game and it felt so unnatural that i had to switch to the old normal game aim it wasn t just the guns that felt bad to use the melee combat was just ouch it can be summed in just running up to the enemy and spamming attack on them until they die or doing heavy running attacks run hold attack heavy attacks on them until they are forcefully thrown dead to the ground or if you have companions why wouldn t you just sitting back relax and watch your companions slowly poke away at the enemies health bar while you do cheap potshots at the baddies animations mostly for the melee combat are just not good everyone seems way too fast looking at your character doing a heavy running attack in third person or better yet looking at anyone doing a heavy running attack they move waaaaay too fast it s like they do an action that should take 5 seconds in 1 second bodies spin and arms move unnaturally fast it s off putting combat is basically you just shooting at enemies weak spots heavily bashing enemies repeatedly until they drop dead while in between drinking 10 bottles of sunset sarsaparilla and nuka cola while poking yourself with stimpacks still even with all that being said i d be lying if i said i didn t have fun with it fun made even better with the equipment and perks i had do you know how fun it is to pull out a holorifle goddangit i love that weapon so much and oneshot headshot a legionnaire running at you and watching their body explode into a gory red paste as fun as it sounds the story is basically you get shot by this dude you don t die you now want revenge but just summarizing it like that makes me feel bad and is in general a bad way to talk about it you have simply so many choices you can choose to do things your own way ally with others or just plainly kill everyone it s amazing factions and characters all have well fleshed out backstories and there s no true way to do things you are supposed to do whatever you want to do or roleplay if that s your thing one thing or many things that hampered my progress were bugs this game is really buggy and sadly it shows a lot it crashed about 30 times for me during all the time i spent with it and i played it for about 130 hours that s one crash every 4 3 hours quick mafs that s really not good now it would be ok if it were just crashes i save like a maniac anyways but textures flashing enemies bodies bending and stretching infinitely across the horizon items re setting themselves when you pick something where other items are now this seems more like an engine thing but i ll still add it to the list and having the sound slowly disappearing until i couldn t hear anything and it crashing after that random crashes crashes after entering or exiting an area items noclipping through the ground and other smaller things killing an enemy and seeing their body fly to the horizon companions getting stuck somewhere and going around a massive area to get to you etc this game is riddled with bugs and even though some were small and funny saving every 3 minutes because at any moment you could just crash and lose progress is not a fun thing i had some mods to help ease the bugs too and they still happened ouch oh wait this game has vegas in its name that s right folks gambling games of chance and casinos yay everything that i hate now this is more of a personal opinion but i just dislike anything gambling related so naturally with this game having new vegas stamped in bright and shining letters i couldn t help but go eugh every time i saw anything gambling related which is about half of the game and one of the game s main focus ok still i have to say everything was so well made roulette slots blackjack i can t help but feel happy whenever i win big and end up leaving the place with 5x the amount i put in the machine this whole odds thing also ends up being a main point of the game considering the courier survived getting double headshot by benny and how he is the wild card in the new vegas power struggle music game music eh it sets the mood and can be ominous and scary sometimes the one with the laugh in the background is a tad spooky but i wonder who thought that nails on metal horns being blared and more cacophonies like that would sound like something good hoover dam music is a massive bop though radio music though fantastic some absolute bangers there big iron ain t that a kick in the head something s gotta give and many many more jazzy classic old tunes to wish for a nuclear winter to fallout new vegas has a lot of problems and it simply felt boring sometimes to do the same stuff over and over again but goddangit was the grind fun getting better guns and armor finding secrets doing actually interesting missions and shaping the future of new vegas it was fun the game does feel dated and ugly but it still has charm and i had a nice experience with it good game
