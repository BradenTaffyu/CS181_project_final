2019 genre action hack slash open worldlet me first explain basics of souls games every time you die you lose all your souls ds currency if you go back to same location where you died you can collect your souls but if you die again before collecting souls you will lose them forever you can use those souls to level up and then upgrade stats to buy stuff etc you can obtain souls by killing enemies or collecting souls through items to understand story you must read carefully descriptions of items listen to dialogues etc in this game you can play melee you can cast magic or miracles all depends on how you wish to play you need to worry about your equip load so you don t roll slowly or move slowly there are bunch of weapon classes and bunch of weapons swords greatswords ultra greatswords axes whips shields daggers etc many miracles and sorceries too multiplayer works like this you can invade the world of other player with some special items and there you can kill them while they are playing through game you can play co op with another players or phantoms you can also post red sign on the floor and if someone calls you you can duel with them comparison with previous souls games pros really good boss fights especially ringed city dlc but main games has good ones too a lot of weapons have special skill that can be activated with left hand strong attack while 2 handing i think didn t use it much lore is okay it s not super interesting but it s pretty big there are references to the first game but also a lot of new stuff it is good overall ringed city dlc is amazing with awesome boss fights and tells pretty good story that is also very tragic it is good conclusion to the end of souls series cons poise in first game poise was working properly you had to have certain poise number to be able to take 1 2 3 hits from certain class of weapons without getting staggered there is poise here too but it only works in special situations as i understood poise works only during your attack and because poise doesn t work when you are getting hit this means that stunlocking opponent is quite easy if you hit him that s one of the reasons why straightswords are strongest class in the game you can succefully land few hits in the row by easily stunning opponent while just smashing your light attack key button ability to summon 3 phantoms making this game absolutelly easy for players who rely on others i always disliked players who co op first time playing dark souls this game is supposed to test your skill if you can t beat it alone just don t play it that s my opinion at least i don t mind co op after first time sure people can play however they want but i ve never seen more bad players in souls games than in this one every 5 mins someone asks in forum for help for bossfight this is also horrible for invasions i always loved invasions but in this part they are terrible i am not sure what the hell is wrong with dark souls community in this part but in 9 of 10 cases when you invade you will get ganked and it s usually at least 2 phantoms however in this part when you invade you can heal too but guess what you get half of estus flasks that you should have while host has same amount everyone can heal and because of that everyone does heal you are maybe thinking well they were always healers in dark souls but i was able to punish healing wrong here it s hard to do that and why is that well cause you can heal too fast and cause you can heal while walking aside from gangking invasions where you get small amount of souls if you kill host duels are not much better either you can play in arena where is not allowed to heal but still even there it all comes to who lands first hit and after you land it you will mostly drain at least 50 of opponent health it s more about output damage than about skill involved there is also failed backstab animation sometimes where opponent rolls or runs just before you backstab him but still animations occurs making you vunerable at that moment multiplayer lag first i thought that maybe i am having issues with my internet but nope i checked youtube videos everyone has these issues those are in game issues and what exactly i mean by that basically in a lot of cases when you attack opponent and attack animation doesn t even land on opponent you will hit him or opposite if you let s say hit 20 cm next to opponent you will probably hit him it s like some additional phantom rage this is of course most noticeable with straghtswords they have range like greatswords great for catching opponent after roll and for attacking opponent while keeping distance too world is really boring imo besides ringed city dlc but to get to ringed city you gotta beat painted world of ariandel and that dlc is really boringverdict dark souls 3 is an okay dark souls game it has great bossfights good lore and amazing dlc ringed city however world is really boring imo also i only recommend playing this game if you have played first game because it is necessary to understand lore pretty good game overall note this explains how i rate games in my reviews rating 7 5 10
