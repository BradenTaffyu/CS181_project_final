since its release 1 year ago the game has got so much updates which have improved its general quality both in single player and in multiplayer the single player was improved reducing the redundancy of ai skirmish while the multiplayer is now neatly balanced there is now also a lot of variety in battlegroups which make the multiplayer very enjoyable if you were on the fence before to buy the game because coh2 offered still a better experience in my opinion the game has really matured and improved so much that it is easy to reccomend to buy it my only gripe with the game is that there is still an hotchpotch of coh2 and coh3 icons which detract from its art quality
