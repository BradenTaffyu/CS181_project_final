2020 i have played this game on and off since around alpha 17 it is so packed with content and replayability especially when you include the vast amount of beautifully created mods that it makes a aaa title look shallow in comparison what is rimworld rimworld is a colony simulator where you control a number of people that crashed on a planet you build everything from scratch and altho the main goal is to build a ship to get off the island the game is all about setting goals for yourself if you know dwarf fortress this game is the same genre but with an actual good ui well that sounds pretty simple and boring ah yes you only need to feed your colonists but there was a blight on your crops and your farmer wasn t able to cut down the blighted plants in time because his leg got shot off by an enemy faction raid now you need to research prosthetics in order to make him a peg leg but you want your doctor to be good enough to install it and you will want a hospital room with a hospital bed so you need to research this with a research bench which you haven t build yet so you want a builder that can do this fast but you are running out of food do you see where i am going with this when you have a small problem there are consequences for your entire colony and the way you handle these problems is entirely up to you and will create a story i still remember that one time i had a bug infestation because i had to mine for steel in order to create gun turrets to stop the increasing raids from injuring my colonists this game is filled with such moments and this is what makes it amazing rather than getting a scripted narrative the story is told by you you re the one making the decisions and finding an end to a need that s what gaming is all about choices overall rating it might take some time getting used to the graphics as they re cartoony but the gameplay is so good you can clearly see that s where the effort went into if you install mods after a few vanilla playthroughs you will have endless hours of fun and replayability when it comes to base building colony simulators this game is at the top of it s genre if you like strategy games or base building games definitely give this game a shot it will surprise you how fun and complex it can be it s not hard to pick up either you will certainly die a few times at first but you learn from those mistakes this game is truely a masterpiece for 30 euros it s a steal surpassing aaa company level of content 9 5 10 with free mods
