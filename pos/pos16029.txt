2020 my mom was watching me create maps for my d d players the other day i told her i felt like i was a kid again playing roblox the game is a phenomenal tool i only have 2 complaints and they re extremely simple 1 the workshop s search functionality is an absolute mess but i m not sure if that s even the devs fault or if its steam s 2 theres room for more customization and accessibility when it comes to base game assets
