2018 this is my first souls borne game and it has been a weird ride i did not buy it in the humble monthly but i convinced a bunch of friends to buy it then and join me 3 of them havent beaten the first boss one is about midway through and the other has beaten the final boss it was interesting to see my friends rage and that alone made purchasing dork souls 3 worth it however you are getting so much more than that the gameplay is fast paced and rewarding most of the time i never died more than 2 3 times in a place maybe its because i r1 spammed my way through my first play through builds in ds3 can be simple or complex some strategies will work and some wont in my first ng run when i went for the usurper ending i respecced into making a miracle class then a sorcerer class then a pyromancer each playstyle is different and unique enough to where you can have hours goofing off and blowing up with magic there is a definite learning curve here but once you get a grip on it 95 of the deaths you recieve are fair game the online aspect leaves something to be desired invasions can happen at the worse times but invading always seems to end up in a world against the host of embers and 2 sunbros which can be a nuisance another gripe with invading is that sometimes it takes forever and joining a game after 10 minutes of waiting can easily get you booted back to your world if the host bum rushes the boss fight in the area there are also serious latency problems with people using a bowl of potatoes as a wifi hotspot and they start warping around and hitting you from miles away another gripe is that blades of the darkmoon and blue sentinels can only get their covenant items by being summoned randomly into a way of the blue s world when he gets invaded it never seems to happen making two very nice items almost not unlockable summoning friends sometimes doesn t work out even if you are the host of embers and someone from idaho in the middle of a war camp joins you the host will get hit reg problems on the ai enemies cheating doesn t seem to be too big a problem but 2 or three times i have run into people who just swing you around with the power of cheat engine the covenants are garbage its basically a grindfest for the little covenant items to get moderately good gear some of which is required for the achievements it is 10 of the covenant reward item for the basic rewards then another 20 for the final reward making it a total of 30 invasions defend sessions per covenant thats where a good 40 of my hours went sitting around the pontiff sulyvahn bonfire waiting for a way of the blue to get invaded or to invade someone without 3 sunbros and 2 darkmoons ganking me the bosses are memorable and a fantastic challenge they act as checkpoints to make sure you have what it takes to procceed some of them would randomly grab you when you were nowhere near and just slam your ass into hell and sometimes they hit you but it doesn t register the only boss i consider to need a nerf is darkeater midir from the ringed city dlc even with fully maxed out weapons and soul amounts i grinded for hours for this dude tanked hits like an asteroid i ve tried base run ng and ng only finishing him off by cheesing him with sorceries in my third playthrough for a spell i think thats the only time i truly got pissed in dark souls so a fair warning the level design is very atmospheric and well crafted i know the levels like the back of my hand and where items are located for ng runs you do occasionally run into weird level loading problems where you see textures blockier than minecraft but maybe thats just my computer the enemies in each level are themed nicely and there is plenty to explore and find the soundtrack and boss themes are hype inducing pummeling bosses to memorable soundtracks like the dancer s and souls s really makes beating each boss memorable everything about the sound design is top notch except whenever the playable character makes a noise whether its an emote one of those weird stones or taking damage these noises are slightly jarring and really take me out of the immersion its probably a me thing though the dlc purchased together is a fantastic deal and a good amount of content however if you purchased ashes of ariandel alone you really arent getting much for the 15 usd ringed city however is easily worth the 15 dollars both dlc feature new bosses new levels new items and overall just more fun to be had the lore is confusing you either need to really get into it and watch videos explaining every detail or just briefly skim through cool looking item s descriptions what i did understand was good and if i ever decide to play other souls borne games i will invest a lot more into learning the story if this is your thing theres a lot here to dig your talons into performance is not the best at times but if you can run the game maxed out at a stable framerate you really have an eye candy i cannot do this however and at medium settings i drop frames heavily in the begining of archdragons peak and the dreg heap there is a bit of crashing whenever you whip the camera around to hard especially during boss battles summons fricken archdragons peak the community is a mixed bag you get the r1 spammes with dark gear and then you get the helpful people on reddit comparing weapon stats and bowing its interesting the price i would say is fair but getting the game on sale with the season pass at 30 dollars usd is a steal better yet if you didn t buy ds3 for 12 dollars with ashes along with a slew of other games something is wrong with you i personally paid the 40 dollars for ds3 w dlc and it is most certainly worth it in conclusion dark souls 3 is a game i put too much time into just to get all the achievements so i can feel justified writing a review pick this game up on sale definitely a good 8 10 dark eater midir is bs
