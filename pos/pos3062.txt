2020 i am not much of a reviewer and only really get around writing reviews for games i have something very strong to say about more often than not it s something actually negative and most of my reviews are thumbs down now divinity original sin 2 is going to be an exception it s simply a phenomenal game in every way imaginable and while i dont have anything new or revolutionary to say about it and i basically never write a review if i dont feel like i will say something at least mildly interesting or different it s just so good i want to add another positive review to that pile let s be honest this is not even a review i just want to leave a thumbs up for this game lol if you want to know why it is so good you are going to find plenty of great and in depth reviews for it divinity original sin 2 is probably the only game which could charge a 70 a 80 even 100 extra premium price and still be absolutely worth it there are like at least two amazing games worth of content inside and all you had to pay was measly 60 for it at launch even less now just buy it it s the ultimate no brainer purchase
