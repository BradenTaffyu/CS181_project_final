2019 dead cells is easily the best rogue like game i ve ever the had pleasure of playing it s a hack and slash platformer that takes inspiration from a number of classic video games and adds it s own flavor to the genre from the artstyle to the game mechanics dead cells brings a very distinct presentation to what is essentially a beautiful and intuitive 2d environment with very fluid combat and challenging enemy ai the progression system is the main drive of the game since the more you play and advance the more rewarding your next run will be basically encouraging your inevitable death but with the promise of a satisfactory improvement to your character very nice from a multitude of general upgrades weapons consumable and outfits that you can unlock through your journey to reach the finale there is no shortage of loot that you discover which leads to some incredible replayability because one moment you think you ve perfected a good built until a new blueprint catches your eye and you immediately are craving to unlock it and test it out very fun experience all the way through damn hard at times a story that isn t all that interesting but is made more awesome as each run is unique and you get to teach yourself new tactical ways to approach certain rooms or enemies lots of secrets hidden throughout each stage so exploration is the key to success you also need to balance your currency since it all comes down to what you decide to invest your gold used for items weapons and cells used for unlocks upgrades fear not though because it s all self explanatory and after a couple of runs you will know what suits you best great visuals and tight action be warned the game is insanely addictive one of the few early access games that deserves its full release fantastic optimization and did i mention it just received a big dlc update for free enough said i love dead cells
