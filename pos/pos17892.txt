2023 tldr if you are a fan of the coh franchise or a new comer i would wholeheartedly recommend coh3 despite some bugs along with somewhat rough launch state it still offers something for everyone whether you are campaign enjoyer or comp stomp enthusiast or pvp is your life you ll most likely have an enjoyable time worth the full price and the time you ll most likely invest in it long boring blah blah reviewcoh3 is the third entry to a franchise i have been playing and loving for 15 some years now despite a somewhat rough launch state i can forsee this game easily replacing coh1 as my favourite of the 3 but as of now it places just right behind it sp campaigns 7 5 10i have a beaten the italian campaign but it has been quite enjoyable with it s more open ended story a big improvement over aa from coh2 the letters of soldiers to and from home during loading screens is a very nice touch scripted battles are as fantastic as ever enemy turns are boring to watch rather quickly interested in seeing how they expand this portion of the game updates fixes expansions etc the north african campaign on the other hand was a let down for me really short finished completely in just a few hours it s saving grace is the battles themselves which are quite enjoyable story was bland and i was actively skipping the cut scenes after the first 2 missions just couldn t get invested coop ai custom battles 10 10after beating the campaigns this will be a huge chunk of your playtime maps are absolutely fantastic the map pool at launch may not be overly large but every map feels really well made and i ve enjoyed playing on all of them ai has received and upgrade and feel more challenging to play against fantastic way to learn to battle groups tactics without the stress of pvp great way to chill with friends if you want to play more casually and just mess around mods mods mods pvp 10 10 if messing around and fighting ai isn t your cup of tea this is where your massive hour count will come from great maps as listed above balanced and unbalanced as it should be graphics 7 10while not breaking any boundaries or winning best looking game of the year i believe the graphics are a good overall improvement over the prior games assets overall looking a lot sharper and cleaner less blocky chunky buildings break apart with satisfying energy unit and vehicle animations look more natural smoother colour palette befitting the mediterranean and north africa theatres rather nicely vehicles getting battle scared over the course of the battle is fantastic performance 9 10runs extremely well and smooth no shader stutters hooorah no fps dropping off to when a large 4v4 battle is taking place really pleased with the games optimization took 1 point off because the graphics menu is a touch lacking while most modern pc s prob won t need to do much tweaking having more control over your settings would be nice and for people with lower end machines more options to tweak to hit their desired frame rate audio 6 5 10i am rather quite torn on the audio for coh3 some of it is fantastic some of it s awful as time goes on thou i can assume this will all get improved unit dialogue is as mint as ever even changing pitch and volume pending on if they get into a building or vehicle buildings when on lower health have great sounding creaks and moans as they strain to stay up vehicle engine gearing is well detailed although varying in volume vehicles crushing gravel dirt etc under itself feels very crunchy no complaints some explosions have an excellent impact and fullness while other explosions sound muted and thin gun fire is all over the place sometimes they have an excellent crack rattle bang etc other times it sounds like they are afraid to make noise modding 10 10do i really have to make any points aside from mentioning it s available for the game lol some odds and ends that don t quite fit anywhere else and possibly answering a few questions perhaps tactical pause wasd camera movements are nice additions may not use em myself but glad to see more options for everyone no player account progression yet not talking ranks but overall levels private sergeant major etc not a big deal as i assume it s coming with the full start of seasons and such achievements wasn t expecting the insanity of 2 and while not achievement hunter personally i felt the current 24 is way to low it was nice to see milestone achievements pop up in coh2 hopefully more will be added as the game ages on i actually really enjoy the plain and simple menu liking the postcard effect it has i really hated the bloated and laggy feeling of coh2s menu overall coh3 is a 8 10 for me and i am excited for the future of the game going forward and will probably log hundreds if not thousands of hours into this entry as well
