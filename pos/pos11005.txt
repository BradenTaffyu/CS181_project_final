with over 100 hours on city skylines 2 passion for city building and a good understanding of city skylines 1 i think it s time to write a review on city skylines 2 is city skylines 2 worth purchasing at the moment city skylines 2 currently falls short of justifying its price tag it definitely needs more time to fix its issues and add more content while i ve encountered several bugs and errors the most notable being random crashes after surpassing a population of 100k the overall frequency remains relatively low however game optimisation for a broader range of computers and laptops is needed as zooming in to street level often triggers lag and overheating even on my modern gaming pc is the game enjoyable in its current state yes it is there are many things to do and build from perfecting your city to expanding and adding more services especially with the addition of mods the game is now more enjoyable does the gameplay become repetitive after extensive playtime for enthusiasts of city building the gameplay remains engaging beyond the 50 hour mark even casual players with somewhat of an interest in city building will find themselves drawn in the potential for multiple city creations ensures longevity provided players refrain from rushing their city and poorly organising it overall is it advisable to play the game now unless you re eagerly seeking a modernised version of city skylines 1 or are deeply invested in exploring the latest in city building games i recommend not buying for another few months until the developers address the current issues particularly considering the game s current price point it feels rushed lacking the optimisation and polish it deserves from a casual player s perspective i d rate the game 6 10 but as someone with a keen interest in city building i d bump that up to a 7 10 acknowledging its potential for improvement
