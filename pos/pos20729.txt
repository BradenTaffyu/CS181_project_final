hogwarts we do not use the unforgivable curses they are dark and utterly disgusting you will be reported and expelled from the school also hogwarts here you go children you will now learn to polymorph an enemy into an explosive barrel and then proceed to chuck him into the face of his friends you do not have to be a harry potter fan to enjoy this game although throughout the story you will see a lot of similar scenarios from the books films practically mimicking your character as harry then there is still a lot of other things you ll experience the story takes a different approach in your character being a 5th year student and you re thrown into the action even before arriving to hogwarts it s difficult to write a lot about the story since it s better to just see how it goes yourself you will have plenty to do in terms of side quests and if you re eager you will find plenty extra as exploration puzzles and capturing beasts the open world is big but not too overwhelming and you will have easy time moving around with your broom the game excels quite a bit with it s combat magic there aren t a lot of wizard games in the same sense where you can go nuts and blast away utilizing elemental attacks and crowd control spells there are combos to certain enemies that will greatly amplify your damage you also have access to potions to make you stronger defensive and plants that will attack enemies the latter is especially funny with chinese chomping cabbages which are 50 cabbage and 50 teeth hogwarts is a great atmosphere and the scenery in the open world is something to behold they made both hogwarts hogsmead and minor villages appear quite lively with chatter or npc s moving around the music was made to appear very similar to the soundtracks you know from the movies it should be noted the game is quite easy it s made in more of a sense it s a journey rather than a rough mountain climb oddly enough your character is quite fragile in terms of the damage you take but the game is pretty generous in terms of i frame protection and the crazy spells you have it won t take you long to become a 1 wizard army despite the mentioned utility like potions and plants you rarely use them due to how easily you can wreck enemies with spells so they feel left out the same can be said for flying mounts you re introduced to it but will rarely ever use it as the broom is faster in both speed and mount dismount animation caution there was an update to the game in june which introduced some issues for players where the game will crash check out the discussions and have a look however plenty are still playing the game and i had zero issues with the game myself
