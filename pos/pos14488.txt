2018 ok bear in mind that each civilization game is a slight reworking of the previous one sometimes the reworking benefits the game sometimes it doesn t civilization vi is not the best civilization game of the whole series in my opinion but is it a bad game worthy of all these negative reviews certainly not like every other civilization game it s a well produced well executed 4x game by a studio that very much knows what they re doing with this genre there are some improvements over previous civilization games there are some changes in how particular systems or game mechanics work in some but not many regards it feels like the game has regressed a little bit the ai is poor let s face it the dlc model is bullsh t having to pay for individual civs is just rude is this the greatest 4x game ever no is this the best civ game probably not is it as good as civ v i d say no personally but at least it s different unlike civilization beyond earth which was just a reskinned civ v but is it a bad game no it isn t you really can ignore many of these entitled reviews hating on this game just because they made changes that they don t like it s a decent polished 4x game that isn t perfect but for anyone who enjoys games like this there are plenty of hours of gameplay to be had if you own civ v and loved it but you re now bored of it civ vi is definitely worth a go if you haven t played civ v but want to try a civilization game go play that instead
