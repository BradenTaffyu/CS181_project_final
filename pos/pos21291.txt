2019 early access review tabs has been in looong development since 2016 landfall had so many deadlines but what was most surprising was that the playerbase was a tad bit patient over those years now that the game has came out it seems that the game has turned out to be pretty good i d say as much as it is disappointing to say that a couple of factions were not introduced at the start of this game it s at least plausible to me that landfall games is still doing their part by updating and polishing the game as much to their ability i mean hey the renaissance update came out so thats a plus in my book tabs is a fun wacky sandbox game right now we just kinda have to bare with the eras or factions that we are given while landfall works to add the pirate and modern faction
