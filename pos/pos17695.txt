2017 this game is great the dlc being expensive complaint is valid but for every dlc pack they charge money for they have boatloads of free content as well not to mention the game is one of the most mod friendly of its class and the mod community is awesome i get it if you think the dlc is expensive but look at the bigger picture over the course of a year they ve exponentially expanded what was already a complete product races are interesting varied asymmetrical and relatively balanced runs well mod friendly and i do have to reiterate just how cool the mod developers are for this game it s not perfect but it s also the best and most engaging adaption of warhammer fantasy
