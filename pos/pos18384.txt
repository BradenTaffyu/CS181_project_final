2020 bloons tower defense 6 was very conflicting to me when it came out it had a new style and was mobile only for a while what was ninja kiwi thinking years later i picked it up out of sheer boredom seeing that it was on pc though apparently it went on pc the same year it came out i ll be honest i think i took it for granted the style is actually really nice to look at i can only assume i didn t appreciate it at first because it was simply different bloons monkey city was horrifying like a cross with adult swim happened or something btd6 however got the redesign right the characters are cute and don t feel like eyesores the new three pathway upgrade path design is really interesting including the newest level 5 towers not only does it allow you to experiment with your favorite paths such as the super monkey s sun god route where you can choose between larger range or the ability to knockback bloons and shoot camo but it also brings a lot of new stuff in general to the lineup a good example is the sniper monkey who now has a path that turns them into a machine gun wielding monster another great thing about btd6 is how the powers changed in comparison to btd5 if you wanted something like a buyable raft to put in the water in 5 it could take a while to accumulate the funds in 6 however gathering monkey money feels less like a chore and more like a part of the main game you only need to do 1 2 maps on easy or medium for that shiny raft and the game rewards you for getting to round 100 with a free insta monkey to place down at your leisure i can t believe btd5 was so stingy it really opens my eyes finally the hero system btd5 had these agents that were buyable with monkey money they didn t really do much honestly and the price wasn t worth it btd6 threw that out the window and slammed down the hero system a buildable tower that levels up alongside you mid game and can be a real powerhouse at later levels my personal favorite is captain churchill who when leveled properly can shut down entire blimp lines with his abilites and weapons he s really good in particular for the first moab round number 40 tl dr btd6 is great for players who came from 5 don t let the new features scare you
