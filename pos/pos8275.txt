2022 actually this game came as a surprise when i personally thought the yu gi oh card game was about to completely collapse aftel legacy of the duelist that was advertised for so long and yet was a terrible failure and duel links that sucked because it tried changing the game s format making it into a speed based game when it s originally a strategy card game comes master duel the game that kept the original format of the yu gi oh card game we ve always loved although with the greed you d expect from konami now if you re one to say that this is not a pay2win game i d like to point out just a few points that will instantly ruin your line of thinking basically you play duels online versus other human players and the game is very populated at the moment of writing this review you get gems by winning these duels and progressing through the current battlepass gems being the game s currency that you use to buy packs that may or may not include the cards that you re looking for to build your deck the thing is the gems you win without buying anything are quite scarce considering challenges offer like 250 gems daily a pack costs 100 gems and winning would award like 20 gems every five wins or so basically you d need 1000 gems for like one card that you really want in your deck in short you d want to spend like thousands of dollars in gems to build a deck that can hold its ground on the top tier ranked gameplay furthermore and because konami is so smart the top tier cards will obviously cost ultra rare materials which translates into needing more than a couple thousand gems to craft and there is absolutly no way you re getting that many gems for free another issue i could think of is that once you get to gold you d start really hating this game those top tier decks that everyone and their siblings are using their mommas debit card to pay for would literally end the duel in the first turn ever i m not even kidding i ve seen opponents pick go first then deal 8000 of direct damage through card effects while i sip my coffee in complete awe thinking to myself this must be a glitch i haven t even had a turn yet is the game pay2win no is it pay2playattoptierranks yes yes it most definitely is however online gameplay is not all there is to the game you can duel with friends and really feel the heart of the cards in a solo campaign mode that teaches you about tons of dueling archetypes which you will never ever use once you figure out a way to one turn kill the opponent using the decks you paid real money for and i recommend you go through that first before you spend those precious early free gems on anything hopefully they patch the game later on where they limit cards that can end duels before they start but i m not holding my breath it s konami we re talking about here after all if it helps them get money from kids with low self esteem they will keep it the early yu gi oh duel monsters days will always be the best it s a 6 10 strategy card game from some of the greediest devs on earth it s time to w w w w watch you one turn duel
