2019 so i am part of the i am not buying this side of the community i m very glad i did first things first day one dlc not cool ca please stop now that s out of the way this is a great game that feels one of the strongest on launch i have seen i love the leader s system i wish marriage was a bigger deal and more fleshed out but overall an amazing step the combat to me feels great i feel the leader to troop ratio of kills is good and being able to equip them with weapons is mint i adore the rpg additions with this title the leaders are unique and have hard starts i start on vh h most total was not today jimmy not today the yellow turban are fun i like the old style tec map but i do find with have 6 unique lords of the top of my head they do start to feel a little limited towards owning half the map on the other hand they offer something of a this is total war legend style campaign from my understanding though ca said they would leader packs in earlier or later time frames didnt 6 years before a cloaked badass mf with his brothers walk around as an englishman i hope we can find understanding that i like islands i can t build an empire with those three tiny little islands ca i would love to see future korea dlc s im not 100 sure of their history at this time but map wise it would be a game changer i think the banners in particular make the game look so much better than other titles in fairness the game looks great i find it hard to escape the dynasty warriors look but ca did a amazing job i think the artwork deserves a round of applause however if you have not taken a word in please read this bit twice we need avatar mode and custom generals and no more day one dlc i m a guy thats been playing this series most of my life so a lot of my points will not affect new players and i m sure older ones will have more than likely have heard them mentioned before i think this title has the potential to be one of the best we have seen in a long time i hope ca may bring things like avatar mode and naval battles and id be more than ready to pay for them but if you are sitting on the edge i d give it a chance
