early access review the game only released one month ago and is in early access there are a lot of updates that will drop in the future the planned content includes unofficial road map cleaning customization more furniture decoration detailed setting menu moving items without boxes door interactions self checkouts shoplifters cctv security guards economy app to see price change expiration dates for some items putting items on sale to attract more customers veggies and fruits and weighting them to sell buying a house and much much morefor now we have a basic skeleton of the game yet it still can provide plenty of gameplay time you can buy upgrades to expand ur store storage buy licenses to be able to sell more products you can hire workers restockers they will restock by moving items from the storage to the store cashiers or u can just be the cashier urself there are bills to pay and rent you can take bank loans something about the gameplay loop is relaxing and addicting for me ordering products restocking shelves operating a cash register i m having a lot of fun even now and patiently awaiting the updates
