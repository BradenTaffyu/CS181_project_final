2022 early access review for me this game came out of nowhere and instantly became one of my favorite games it s janky quirky yet charming it may not look great at first glance but believe me it gets a lot right if you know nothing about cars you ll certainly learn a lot from this game not only is each component of the satsuma modeled but each part of the engine itself is modeled and detachable put something together incorrectly and the car may not run properly or run at all maintenance is a core mechanic of the game neglect the satsuma and you ll find yourself stranded real quick oil changes must be done head gaskets may blow out belts snap clutches wear out etc you ll have to learn how to diagnose an issue when it comes up as each part failure has unique symptoms now combine this with managing your thirst hunger income and you ll find out that this game really isn t easy either car handling is surprisingly good too each vehicle handles uniquely and just about as expected depending on its drivetrain layout front wheel drive cars understeer and rear wheel drive cars oversteer there are no tutorials this game will not hold your hand if you don t know how to build the car you ll be looking at a guide if a certain game mechanic doesn t seem obvious to you you ll be looking at a guide this game requires patience but if you love tinkering with cars you ll love this game remember the satsuma may not be the car you want but much like everyone s first car it s what you ended up with make the most of it and wear a seatbelt
