2019 i can easily say fallout 4 is my all time favourite game to play the huge world and endless quests keep the game exciting even after the main story line is completed i love the soundtrack the character designs personalities and the beautiful scenery throughout the world s map i do not have a single complaint about fallout 4 other than it is a bit addicting i ve played a solid 200 hours on this game and don t plan on stopping any time soon
