2017 hard to write a review for this game if civ 6 were released today as the first off a series it would be wildly acclaimed and receive excellent scores but it has its own legend to live up to and frankly this isn t as good as civ 5 was at it s end of life civ 5 once you include all of the expansions is probably the best 4x of all time balanced challenging inifinite replaybility so civ6 has to live up to that it is definitely better than civ5 was at release but it isn t yet as good as it can be nonetheless i d still recommend
