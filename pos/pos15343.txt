2023 i would recommend this game but only if you have friends to play it with playing alone is frustrating and gets boring after a while and in my experience at least most of the dedicated servers are full of snobby elitists who will ignore you or run by temperamental brats who will grief the entire server over an easily crafted item don t go into this game expecting a warm welcome from the community to them you re nothing but a hindrance they d rather do without
