2023 some of the criticism is deserved but don t listen to those saying the game is lesser than the previous games that s not true at all graphics and animations are way better but still a bit buggy at launch sound is actually a lot more realistic but people prefer the fake bang i guess performances are very good as usual relic will improve it over time and add features the only problem is people don t know how worse coh2 was at release and most of them never played coh1 so they think the game is bad relic tried to keep the best of both previous games and i think they made it a must buy for any fan of the series or any rts fan
