2021 tl dr if you are a star wars fan play it otherwise depends on how deep your wallet isstar wars the old republic is an mmorpg experience that is unique in many aspects with a narrative focus rare in mmo s and of course the star wars franchise to support it which its universe and concepts enough to convince many to play the game the game also sports a tab targeting combat system that is dynamic and impactful through and through and makes playing any character force user or not feel powerful and satisfying the class system the game employs allows for players to play in varied ways with 8 classes for the republic and the empire although it is important to note that force using classes are essentially interchangeable except for a few changes in animations and powers however all 8 non force using classes are all unique story wise the game is rich with 8 unique class stories each of the player can interact with that will lead to different outcomes and i some cases different missions to accompany your decision of which some will make you stronger in either the dark or light side with each extreme allowing for unique gear to be equipped requiring a certain alignment level whilst all of this and many more features sound excellent the game is not without its errors well for free to play players ea s notorious consumeristic approach to their games follows in this one which restricts a majority of its elements behind a subscription or a paywall that can only be paid off via a premium currency which f2p players can earn a minute amount on a monthly basis and whilst as a f2p player you can get all the way to level 60 you will still be far behind the level cap of 75 which was introduced in the most recent expansion of onslaught which cannot be played by f2p players this essentially makes the game an extended free trial with a subscription program that is mandatory if you want to fully invest yourself in the game whilst i m not opposed of subscription programs in f2p games there s a line to be drawn of how restrictive can the f2p players be and this crosses that line and then some overall i d recommend the game for star wars fans looking for a star wars experience but otherwise it s a hard sell unless you are willing to invest in a subscription
