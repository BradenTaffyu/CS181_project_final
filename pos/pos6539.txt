2019 i got ptsd from driving a double trailer loaded with 23tons of caviar for a distance of 1100km i played the first 30 hours on keyboard and sure it was fun later in 2016 i got a driving wheel and oh boy has the game changed so much it became so much more fun and it feels like you really are in the truck and now pair it with a vr headset you got one hell of a nice combo
