2015 while writing this i have almost reached my 700th hour and that does not even include the ones i played offline so i m probably more near the 800th hour nevertheless this is one of the greatest games i ve ever played it s difficult yes but not as difficult as it sounds or appears first watch scott manley s tutorials on youtube and with a little practice and patience you will be able to do all the cool stuff you can imagine i don t want to misslead you it can be a rly hard and even a little frustrating during the first couple of hours but it s also so damn rewarding once you got past that initial learning courve so what does this game offer a huge sandbox experience with lots and lots of content that has been build up and polished for about 4 years you want to build a rocket a space plane a shuttle a station a moon mun lander or a probe that travels across the whole system to reach the gas giant far out than do that no one is stopping you your imagination is the limit as much of a cliche that might sound like but it s true and if you don t believe me watch showcases of people on youtube there is everything from star war s podracers to real life replica missions and if you fail a couple of times there is nothing bad about it the game manages to make failures fun how cause you see stuff spinning crashing and exploding in ways you couldn t even imagine this is the unique experience of ksp that i ve been enjoying with the greatest community i ve ever seen if you have a question than simply post it on the forum there are so many experienced vets out there that help each other and especially the new people with theire knowledge and skill it s a rly unique group of people that has kept the forum alive ever since the buggy first steps you might ask yourself where the hell you might take the inspiration from to build new stuff after 100th of hours the answer is simple ksp is easy enough to be fun once you get used to the basics while still being acurate enough to build real life replicas from the apollo and space shuttle aeras to modern missions and designs like spacex s reusable boosters or virgin galactic s space ship one it s all within the possibilities of this sandbox and if you want something more scifi orientated then get a mod like interstellar or near future and you will get everything and more right at hand even for the type of player that enjoys a harder and more realistic simulation type of game there are easy ways to adapt the game to be just that the moding community of this game is just huge there is everything from physics driven algorithms that simulate hypersonic reentrie effects to adding whole new planets and solar systems there is just so much content out there that you will literally never be able to see or play it all long story short after playing this game for years i sudenly felt a need driven by nostalgia to write this down and promote the best investment i ever did when it comes to a game i hope you will enjoy it as much as i did and still do cheers
