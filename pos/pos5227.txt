2018 fallout 76 makes fallout 4 look like the last good fallout game that bethesda could ve made while the fallout 4 storyline and the rpg elements aren t exactly up to the fallout 3 and fallout new vegas standards fallout 4 still is a much better game than the cluster that is fallout 76 imo the best part about fallout 4 was the gunplay gun mods from the modding community and the gun modifications you can do in game while i lost touch with the story in the game i ll give fallout 4 a thumbs up for the great gunplay that can be found through various gun mods on the mod workshop base building is also a fun feature in the game but the most fun i had in fallout 4 was using various gun mods and having gun fights with the game s hostile enemies overall if you re looking for a fallout game i would recommend fallout 4 and not fallout 76 you may actually like the storyline and i hope you do it didn t really do anything for me but i did find other things that i liked a lot about fallout 4
