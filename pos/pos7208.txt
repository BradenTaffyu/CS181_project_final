2016 ats very much looks feels and plays like ets2 whether that s a good or a bad thing is very subjective it s perfectly understandable that some people call it a glorified dlc and that there isn t much content at the moment but let s be honest the game is also priced as a glorified dlc the base game consists of the standard assets and the state of california all other content is added in the form of dlc s this can be both free or payed dlc like in ets2 new trucks will be added to the game for free currently due to licensing issues there are only the peterbilt 579 and the kenworth t680 scs already has a few more trucks ready to roll out as soon as they have the approval the first two new states are also added as free dlc nevada was released together with the base game and arizona will be added soon altough soon can easily take a few months in scs terms graphics and performance have improved over ets2 but not by a huge margin i think ats looks a bit better with improved textures especially the roads it s also more detailed and has way more variety in the scenery while in the stock ets2 map it was just more of the same the engine also seems to be better optimized wich results in a bit smoother fps only 64 bit is officially supported this time scs is offering an unsupported 32 bit version for a limited time wich can be obtained via de betas tab within the game s properties the game can perfectly be played and enjoyed with a controller settings like sensitivity and deadzone can be adjusted for the analog controls off course a keyboard also works but don t just don t for the full experience a steering wheel is highly recommended just as much as with a semi realistic racing game it s a complete gamechanger if you also own a trackir great another gamechanger all scs trucksims have native support for this device a neat new feature are multiple ways to park your trailer not in the mood for difficult parking but just pressing enter is to fake just do it the easy but legal way and just drive your rig forward in the designated spot however this will off course result in less xp than you would have gotten when parking like a boss i do have some minor complaints ats still has the same simplistic road network that ets2 has travelling from city to city is over just to quickly than there s the ai it has improved over ets2 but it s far from perfect there are still many ai drivers who never passed their driving test and somehow managed to get a car remember those creatures in ets2 who stopped on the highway to let you merge they re not only living in europe the game also doesn t have much variety in ai vehicles well noting that the modding community can t fix ats has the same extensive modding support that made ets2 a huge success that also puts the lack off standard content a bit in perspective unless you don t want to use any mods at the time of writing there are already lots of mods available including drivable trucks cargo s ai vehicles skins etc map expansion are just a matter of time scs took their sweet time to release this game and many expected a bit more content at release i m sure they will take care of this like they did with ets2 that game is well over three years old now and is still being worked on in the end scs delivered the quality that we come to expect from them if you played and like ets2 you will feel right at home in ats even with it s flaws and weaknesses it s still that ultra relaxing driving experience that so many people love
