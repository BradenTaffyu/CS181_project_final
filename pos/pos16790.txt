2019 i wanted this game because i saw a few youtubers play it and it seemed really relaxing and theraputic plus i love decorating things so if i could i d totally flip houses in real life lol i think a lot of people are a little too judgemental about the game as i think its meant to be pretty simple i like it a lot however it would be nice to have a steady flow of jobs rather than however many there are and nothing else multiple saves could be nice too but i don t mind that part too much i really like how there s an option to turn the cockroaches into broken glass cockroaches really freak me out and i appreciate the awareness of people who feel the same way i also love how friendly and nice the devs seem i just finished reading the new post valentine s day patch notes and i really like the humor and enthusiasm shown overall i think its a great game if you want to relax and make things look nice i don t mind the bugs too much as they seem to get fixed pretty quickly its could be a bit better but from what i can see the game is being improved quite often so i m not worried about ever being disappointed with it i look forward to future updates
