2020 early access review bit of a gem in the rough i m very glad i gave it a try it s a sort of survival base building on a raft with a mean ol grumpy shark chasing you down nonstop so far developers are active too quite a steep learning curve and you will most likely become shark bait on your first try or starve to death on the first island you hop onto while that scary ass shark tears your raft into pieces but soon the soothing sea and it s calming waves becomes your ally and you begin to learn it s secrets and grow your puny piece of wood and torn plastic into a mighty seaworthy settlement capable of sustaining life fighting especially with bow arrows is a part i least enjoy it is very clumsy i ve seen vids of people mastering it but personally i didn t have the patience nor will to keep on throwing away resources to learn to time it and aim it right so i just stick to stabbing things the game world reminds me strongly of the movie waterworld with a cross to riverworld since the sea behaves more like a river going huge circles instead of a square map all and all very unique and pleasant atmosphere btw while it is a great co op game it is totally doable as a single player too
