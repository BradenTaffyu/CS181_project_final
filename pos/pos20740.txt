2023 my vote for game of the year hogwarts legacy is a must play experience the world design music story and characters are an overall fantastic experience you do not have to be a harry potter fan to be able to enjoy the game but it does add much to the game if you are the graphics are fantastic the user interface is informative while remaining simple and user friendly the menus are fun to navigate and check the map collections and progress for the most part game play is mostly perfect i am not a fan of the broom stick flight the controls on the broom feel clunky and not user friendly on controller nor on keyboard mouse however the combat is highly enjoyable spell casting item utilization and potions are well balanced in player use difficulty on hard was not difficult in the slightest but there has been an update and i am finding the challenge has been upped quite a bit fast reflexes and smart choices definitely are needed for a favorable outcome i would not consider the game remotely as difficult as a souls like experience while the story is fantastic it is the world immersion that makes hogwarts legacy shine brightest the side quests choices progress in the main story and discoveries all add and change the conversations and interactions that the protagonist has with the other classmates professors and even enemies if you use certain methods in combat more heavily your enemies will make comments on that for instance we are still not at a truly dynamic open world but this is one of the best open world builds i have enjoyed in gaming my biggest complaint is that the puzzles are all rudimentary there is nothing mentally taxing in the entire game with so many puzzles the most difficult is solvable without any pause for thought i could expound on all of this and more but it is easier said that hogwarts legacy is a great foundation for a new gaming franchise while i could nitpick hogwarts legacy in how the game can be better in many ways it achieves what many games fail to even deliver and that is an immersive and enjoyable gaming experience from start to finish
