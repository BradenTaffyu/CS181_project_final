2022 early access review good fresh take on the factory genre so good i consider this one of the big 4 factorio oxygen not included satisfactory dyson sphere program unique goal and progress towards building the dyson sphere is fantastic and has gameplay returns multiple planets and planetary travel no magic resources ok except gas giants factory lines need planning and appropriate spending infinite resource mode is built into the core game now which just eliminates tedium contrary to what the game says this doesn t make the game easier my 1 tip turn on infinite resources when you start a game for a better experiencebad the english voice and tutorials are bizarrely non native please just get a native english speaker to write the script the space travel can be long and boring especially at first it would be much better if there was autonavigation between targets or just faster travel in general nobody wants to spend 2 5 minutes just flying between planets blueprints are unlocked strangely late in the tech tree which leads to alot of early game tedium they should be unlocked towards the end of blue tech and before red tech imo early game tedium in general tossing items in and out of boxes or playing lazy bastard style is really dumb some recipes like the new sprayers are unnecessarily dependent on a single resource and a single way to make them as a result sometimes if you re out of certain resources there are zero alternatives even at lesser efficiency optimizations the new hard mode with low resources is just annoying to play it s not actually challenging sphere based construction means that grids don t align correctly and make complex blueprints useless at large enough scale this is very much a base game like factorio it needs angel s bob s industrial revolution style mod support to get more interesting like factorio limited resources is the default which leads to rebuilding your factory over and over this is just annoying not challenging
