2020 i personally love space empire building games to death stellaris is 100 my favourite it s unique take on how you can personalise your empire makes for a lot of fun especially allowing you to live out your space empire fantasies however you like the game tends to have an interesting release cycle of minor story dlc and then major dlc and then story again story dlc is nothing major and usually adds a small layer of depth to the game major dlc on the other hand often compliments a large patch that as of the past 3 expansions dramatically reworks the core mechanic that dlc impacts for instance armageddon introduced colossus portable death stars and extremely powerful vessels to compliment the war system overhaul megacorp introduced the ability to play as well a mega corporation empire a galactic slave market and the ability to make city worlds or ecumenopolis which complimented the worlds economy overhauls federations introduced the galactic senate and deeper federations potential with the diplomacy overhaul alongside it s 80 s inspired fantastic soundtrack and wonderful little story telling system of anomalies the game captures the feeling of truly going stronger whether that be through might or peace and as most paradox games it has no real static end goal allowing for even deeper freedom into what you actually want to achieve in your game and letting that evolve as you come to understand the galaxy you exist in more howeverthe game absolutely requires the major dlc in order to experience it at it s fullest as the game grows a lot of the content that now makes it very unique and fun is locked behind an ever increasing paywall and while at the time of writing the game remains 35 it s understandably extremely difficult to buy the base game and also the currently 4 15 major dlcs that bring the game to an eye watering 94 roughly to experience it as it s effectively intended though it s worth noting that as with all pd games if you play multiplayer with someone who does own the dlc they can host the game and you ll have access to the dlc but if you want to play singleplayer that s tough luck additionally with such a hefty investment it can be a very daunting game to get into without dedicated guidance or help there is virtually no tutorial and the overhauls i mentioned above have always made the impacted mechanics and systems deeper and thus less easy to learn if you have no idea what you re doing so unless you re extremely sure you re going to play this game it s certainly not at all worth it at full price outside of this the game overall has aged very well and is extremely enjoyable and has a lot of replayability but getting into it now with that ever increasing paywall while it isn t on sale will certainly require a hefty amount of time to make it feel worth it
