early access review this game had a ropey start to say the least however many patches later and i can confirm the client does not crash after many hours of play in solo mode it seems a lot of the crashes plaguing people are to do with the intel cpu bios bug and also more than likely having their ram set too high for their mobo to handle no one will prob read this but if you do and have lots of crashes i would update your mobo bios to the latest and even if using xmp and your ram can go above 6400 mine does 7600 please just try lowering your ram down to 6400 or maybe lower i run mine at 7200 use a program like prime95 on a stress test for an hour or so and test for errors this program is a godsend for detecting bad ram or overclocked ram being unstable
