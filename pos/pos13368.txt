2015 what a truely amazing game i highly recommend this game to anyone even remotely interested in space like gaming the core game is really great but the modding community and available mods for this game adds value to this game unlike anything i ve ever exerienced this game has 3 modes sandbox science and career each having it s own unique experience after spending a little bit watching some of scott manley s videos on youtube you ll be well on your way to creating your very own space program you can literally design every detailed aspect of your spacecraft accomplish things in space and have endless hours of fun iliterally can t stop playing this game seriously if you re wondering whether or not this is for you go check out some twitch streams or yt videos and get a taste of this masterpiece that is ksp it s not rocket science well okay actually it is but after spending a little time on those vids you ll be well on your way
