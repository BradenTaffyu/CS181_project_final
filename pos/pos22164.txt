2016 finished dark souls 3 after an intense 11 days with a soul level of 116 spoilers from here on in short it s a great souls game it feels very focused in most aspects changing covenants is easier armor upgrades are gone stats are trimmed down the world feels tighter grinding for upgrade materials wasn t necessary i also liked the slightly improved weapon infusing system there is now a more clear way to infuse weapons with each elemental and still have stat scaling while there are simpler infusions available of each kind for better base damage output but no scaling at all sounds complicated when reading but it s the easiest upgrade system so far another mechanical change is that the camera and player movement feel more similar to dark souls 1 which i prefer over the feel of dark souls 2 i enjoyed the pacing and focused design reminds me of demon s souls this more focused design also shows itself in the world and bosses there are fewer bosses and the game generally felt lighter and shorter seeing ds2 it by no means lacks content though especially compared to dark souls 2 the world feels more believable and cohesive the areas themselves are also better designed and most importantly to me offer much better boss encounters than its predecessor this makes me most happy as the bosses in ds2 were for the most part lackluster i thoroughly enjoyed almost each and every boss for their unique designs unique behaviors and unique flow of battle interestingly enough i had the by far easiest time so far in any souls game with ds3 not sure if it stems from the experience in the series but on the other hand i ve heard of friends with tales of horror about certain bosses which i managed to down on my first or second try in terms of music demon s souls and dark souls offer more haunting and memorable tracks but there were several nice ones here that caught my attention abyss watcher and prince lothric boss fight music namely the cast of npc and the questlines were well done with some personalities being nice additions to the souls series to my understanding this will be the final entry in the dark souls franchise so it was nice to have references and nods to the whole franchise starting way from demon s souls i enjoyed reading weapon armor spell and item descriptions vaguely hinting at the players past achievements but the throwbacks don t end here by far they don t the blacksmith is the very same andre of astora from the first dark souls which surprised me since this is taking place apparently a long time after the events of the first game while him being the single only major identical npc i still would have liked it more if he at least was a descendant ah well it was breaking the immersion a bit there is a fine line between recognizing heritage and recycling and for the most part it s thankfully the former but having seen all the content there are areas where i would not blame someone for using the word recycled anor londo is actually not one of those though as it was a very small area basically a run up to a boss so i was absolutely fine with its appearance most of all it did not feel like a cheap copy paste but made sense in the lore and world time passed so it was decaying and crumbling very well done sadly though the existence of silver knights was not only done beyond a little nod but felt copied they added few new attacks but they were the same old silver knights with the same old gear not even brittled or broken to show signs of time that was a big immersion breaker and i did not enjoy facing them which only became sadder at the amount the area could have become much more memorable and impactful by making the silver knights wear broken torn apart armor maybe even broken weapons and slower less lively behavior the way they are depicted though is not well done later on when you end up in the untended graves there is an interesting aha moment upon realizing it s the starting area but that gets replaced by a why moment when you realize it s not that the original area changed its tone and time but this is a parallel world different area dynamically changing the area from a certain point in the game would have been better you fight a variant of the same boss and later on fight black knights similarly to the silver knights with almost no differences to dark souls 1 but worse as the location does not make much sense shame thankfully these recycled occurrences were not too much so i could forget about them once hitting subsequent areas which did not have these issues at all all in all i am glad that the dark souls franchise is ending as i want to see fromsoftware build a new world with different mechanics different ideas without expectations shackles that come with a franchise from a technical point dark souls 3 has network issues which i have not encountered in previous games frequently summoned players become glitched lacking any animations and just glide which makes for a subpar multiplayer experience same happens to the player as a summon in that no enemy or boss has any animations which made for several severely anti climatic boss fights where this issue obviously occurred for multiple summons who could hammer on a glitched boss without any repercussions it s not the majority of the multiplayer experience but happens more often than is acceptable other than that the game shows stutter it was only mildly annoying and never became a major issue for me thankfully what did bug me were the load times when browsing through the inventory the larger images take a second to show which annoyed me despite the lengthy criticism the positives outweigh them by a landslide and the ups are much much higher than the lows dark souls 3 is a very good souls game and stands tall on its own with many of the most memorable and enjoyable areas and boss fights in the whole franchise i am eagerly awaiting new content so i have a reason to play more of this gem of a game
