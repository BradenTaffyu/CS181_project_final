2017 early access review first time reviewing a game but felt i should on this one i never did play the first game though heard good things about it so figured give the second a run so far even in early access i can t say i was disappointed the game it s self reminds me of classic computer rpgs and pen n paper rpgs i played when i was much younger just a bit more fair and easier to understand yet still maintaining a lot of what made them challenging character customization starts a bit limited but as you get higher in levels its more about what you want to play and what your party members be you are not locked into your starting class at all and i love that hoping they have a lot more choices in the full release gameplay wise is point and click though i found there is a lot to interact with in the world in different ways one of the more different ways i found was that playing an elf or having an elf in your group the elf can eat a corpse and gain the memories of that person and it actually does play a part in the game combat is much of the same point and click with a lot of tactical choices to make the enemy ai is well refined and act in actually very smart ways even on the easier difficulties i also found it pretty neat how your spells items and attacks can change the battle ground and make hazards for yourself and your enemies with the enemies able to do the same such as freezing a wet spot on the ground to give a chance of someone slipping on the spot or shocking the water with lighting to stun everyone standing in the wet spot though at times at least for me i found it hard to move to avoide these hazards at times like the area they were affecting were slightly larger than they really were i even tried a bit of co op with friends and a bit hidden in a sense once we figured it out connecting with one another was clean and easy to do storywise i found interesting enough a dark world with many dark themes with demons torture and corruption the premade characters have backgrounds and behave well according to their backgrounds another different system in this game is the tag system basicly pick tags for your character and you will have in game choices that you can make based just on those tags you pick the pre mades having different choices as well they can make based on their stand alone backgrounds though it does feel you can get same results no matter your background still it does help with immersion and at in making your created character feel seprate from the rest graphics are not that important to me but they are decent enough in this game though playing completely zoomed out pretty much the only way to play an rpg like this i found it a bit difficult to notice things i could pick up or interact with since they are so small a few rare times i misclicked on something because of how small it is i have an older system so i wasn t able to play on the highest settings i was able to however able to play on high even though the game suggested i play on low so i can see pretty much everyone able to play this game with no issues even when i tried the highest settings i just had a slight drop in frame rate overall divinity 2 i recommend highly especially if you are a fan of old school rpgs and pen n paper rpgs you will feel right at home playing this with a high level of immersion and ability to costumize your character however you desire story had been done before but it s presented well in the world and should be interesting enough to keep you playing combat is deep and will challenge the thinking sides of your brain to approach each encounter in most effective way possible plus have you thinking best way to build your characters to deal with threats in your prefered way you might find a little frustration in interacting with the world due to how small things are and will even miss a few things if you aren t careful but it shouldn t be a big enough issue to remove any enjoyment in the game hope you found this helpful if you took the time to read it
