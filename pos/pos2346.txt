2022 i don t usually review too many games but due to what is essentially a massive u turn i feel a short summary is overduei was so excited when fallout 76 was announced as a huge fan of the franchise and like every other fan i was horrified at the empty vessel that bethesda had the audacity to out i think i managed about 20 hours before i gave up playing due to the amount of my own vomit i d swallowed now here we are in 2022 the uk is in turmoil due to 12 years of tory rule facing a cost of living crisis and to top it of the queen has just bloody died nothing but misery but waiti decided to go back to fallout 76 i guess at the time i just wanted to hate something because of the depression and all that but you know what it was great and in 3 weeks i have managed to hit over 200 hours in game there is so much to do so much to see new content every so often the main thing for me is that it feels like a fallout game now unlike when it was launched i hope that big fans of the franchise who hated it on release or those that avoided it like the plague due to the reviews i implore you to give it another shot in short it s bloody brilliant
