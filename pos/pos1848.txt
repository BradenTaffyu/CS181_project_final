2017 i ve been hyped for this game for a long time but i didn t want to get my hopes up too high when it released i got it on ps4 first and was happily impressed i didn t rush through it because i knew this pc port was coming soon and i can say with my personal opinion that i prefer the pc version since you ve got more options to fumble around with granted i am using my ps4 controller steam big picture so the controls are exactly the same as most people on here will claim to which i agree with there are some optimization issues floating around anything gamebreaking though not in the slightest the vast majority of the issues of which there aren t too many relate to display issues and complaints about the fps cap in my experience the open world gameplay and combat is always smooth with the fps cutscenes tend to drop some fps but not terribly so there are workarounds to many of the issues i play in windowed and then hit alt enter to expand it and i expect patches in the coming days anyhow i ve never seen a perfectly ported game and nier hasn t broken that record but it s a damn good port among a field of failed ones and it s a damn good game in itself you ll come to love many of the characters and especially the combat i m willing to bet oh and i almost forgot the soundtrack simply one of the most amazing game soundtracks ever created they never distract and always add to the atmosphere nier automata deserves your consideration because it is powerful the creators were passionate about this game and wanted it to be amazing not your standard cookie cutter aaa title or anything of the sort you ll experience haunting sweet action packed and thought provoking moments all in one game replay is encouraged for more story endings achievements you may have missed take your time and enjoy the game it has plenty of assets to match its price tag
