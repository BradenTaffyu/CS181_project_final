2022 early access review so basically you need to survive build a car earn money for better car parts and win a rally race but you are completly free to do what you like there are different ways to earn money and you need to constantly fix your car cause it will break it s very indepth because every car component needs to be installed separately the game will punish you hard but then you will learn and don t do the same mistake again what facinates me is the game engine the graphics don t look fancy but in motion if you drive it appears very nice also this game has a high immersion factor you can pick up and carry around a lot of things and the objects stay exactly where you left them so you can organize your stack of groceries and things like oilcontainers by yourself for a productive everyday life or be completly chaotic it s up to you and that s nice when i bought this game i thought it is going to be a funny 15h indiegame it very much surprised me now it is one of my favourite games i played for almost 200 hours and haven t even tryied the rally everytime i want to register something happens like my car has no licence something breaks i need to go to prison it s ridiculous it s a love hate realationship with this game and it s very much an adventure with lots of executive thinking
