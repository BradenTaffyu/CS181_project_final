well 89 7 hours in just reached level 100 and i have to say i am enjoying my time with fallout 76 it s a monumentally better game than it was day 1 and i was a person who played the beta pre ordered and played it on day 1 only to find out it was a boring buggy mess it is still quite buggy at times because well it is a bethesda game it runs off of todd howard s quote it just work although i will be honest about this i would ve not had an interest in returning to fallout 76 if it wasn t for my friends the game is much better if you have people to play with i don t have too much to say other than if you have friends to play and pick up this game during a sale go for it you ll have a fun time i would rather play fallout 76 than fallout 4
