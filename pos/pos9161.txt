2018 probably the closest to a sci fi simulator you ll ever get to experience just about every concept from the ascension of man to ancient aliens insect swarms across space millenia old constructs to unravel interstellar war and more besides are represented in some fashion or another within this game they re still improving and iterating and stellaris is nothing like it was when i originally purchased it however each update for the most part only helps a good game achieve greatness it still has problems ai issues are abundant diplomacy is extremely bare bones and the late game can drag out somewhat but even with that in mind this game is still an enthralling play extensive mod support and a huge amount of startup conditions mean you can create just about as much variety as you d like and even with over 300 hours played as of time of posting there are still core game concepts i m yet to fully explore it also has one of the best overhaul mods i ve ever experienced in star trek new horizons and frankly it s worth the price of entry for that alone
