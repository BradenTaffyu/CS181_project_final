why didn t i leave a review for this before now 164 5 hours in many packs owned at this time all available states owned but 3 states are on the way i once was horrible in here because my nerves were shot so many settings can t hit curb can t speed can t this can t that then i found the option to turn off traffic offenses d finally i can simulate my way lest they let them start chasing me then i may turn it back on for the fun of it an adventure in the form of a game where you can break rules safely and it s a okay d no one gets hurt though your truck can take a beating if you have damage on i do have many settings on there are several ways to play you can convoy with friends perhaps strangers but i never tried that i played with a few buddies who already had the game and they had a nice bond going on it was really fun it s a memory i ll always keep with me as long as fate lets me so many laughs i enjoyed testing the limits of the game s roads and trucks with and without a load behind me i enjoy seeking out those hidden locations you pass as you travel from one place to another sadly some roads don t exactly let you know that you can not take them and you ll slam into an invisible wall cha ching for the mechanic then you have to back up tapping foot just wanna get back on the road again then i can turn the page like bob seger did i yelled at my vehicle roll on 18 wheeler roll on and so it did until a car cut me off they re not always slow about it always be ready for most i d recommend a controller or better yet a steering wheel set i drive using my keyboard lots of quick tapping tendon overload at times but i enjoy the game and have gotten mostly used to it d love the visuals screen capture options are amazing driving down the highway at 75 mph and i suddenly tap esc to get a shot of the scene before i don t have another chance i don t recommend what you do in the game to be done in real life i think simulation should be accepted loosely lol in a more relaxed way i ll try to get some screenshots of this up here soon
