2020 perfect for coronavirus quarantine my sister and my dad have both previously played this game and told me to download it but i will be honest the graphics put me off and i assumed this game was very basic i would often read many reviews of this game online and become more and more sold on it but would never actually purchase it one of the reviews mentioned how they had clocked up 263 hours of gameplay due to the lockdown that is now taking place i fear i may become slightly stir crazy so what better way to prevent that then to spent hours playing a game and farming i took the plunge and downloaded on saturday night i normally go to bed around 10pm i ended up staying up way past my bed time and managed to clock up 6 hours do not be put off by this game and believe the reviews im straight back on it today and i am enjoying it very much i cant say that i wish i had purchased sooner as i believe this is the perfect time for this game and at 10 49 its a steal
