2022 early access review this game very chill and you can put 100 of your focus into planning gathering building troubleshooting repeat and generally crafting a very complex purring machine which in turn creates your own custom designed dyson sphere here s a few ways this game is a little different than other factory builders your factories are built upon spheres forcing you to make all sorts of interesting choices in planning the automated trade network you are eventually able to create includes many other solar systems later you will design a customized dyson sphere and begin launching bits and pieces to it the sphere will slowly come together and watching it do this is absolute bliss at a certain level of infrastructure resources are no longer any concern so you can craft the sphere like you were working clay leading to all sorts of gigantic satisfying pieces of art almost like a spirograph in space there are no enemies or combat yet though optional enemies are planned it did not detract from my experience in any way instead this game s building complexity was very entrancing and hypnotic and fun the graphics are sleek the game runs well and i didn t experience overt problems or glaring bugs wonderful game totally worth my 20 bucks still playing it after 200 hours i really would consider it required for lovers of chill factory building games even in early access after 400 hours my review and opinion remain the same but i will add these comments once i covered a planet in infrastructure the game would understandably lag whenever visiting that planet my graphics card is a 2080ti fps would drop 30 but it was never game breaking for me and was only after the planet was 90 saturated in belts and machinery in my experience all these factory construction games use an annoying save file technique during the early access phase and this game is no exception at the time of this edit my save file is 400 mb this makes the autosave feature pretty jarring when it happens which is every 10 min somewhat annoying but i m betting it improves when 1 0 comes out once the tech tree and first dyson sphere is complete there s nothing else to do except expand and or make more dyson spheres i m expecting more will be added in the future and i can t wait i d love to see the tech tree get even more complicated these are minor issues though the game is still unbelievably solid i can t wait until the next major update and additions still a hearty thumbs up
