2020 i have like 1200 on the cracked version its a great game once you know how to play it its a bit difficult at first but with each try you will get better it just wants time invested pros you can do a lot of stuff you can do whatever you want sabaton tons of great mods that add tons of hours alternative history for example a lot of choices for every country especially these with special focus trees you can play with friendscons runs kinda bad after a few in game years freezes for a second each month because of autosave requires a really beefy machine in order to run properly for more than 30 fps low end machine get slower time rendering dlc s are way too overpriced there is a workaround check google youtube the method still works 2023 dec
