2018 originally i wasn t going to review this game on this account because i have few hours on this account however reading through some of the reviews out there i wanted to speak my piece this game changes things from the previous game in the series and some argue that it makes the game harder forcing you to play as a certain type of character however i feel the need to point out that you are only forced into playing a certain way if you desire to be the absolute best possible character in the game people say that mixed damage parties are not viable because of the armor system in the game if you are unaware every character in the game has an amount of physical armor and magical armor these armors prevent damage and certain effects until they are depleted however me and a friend did a playthrough of this game and we played as a mixed damage party for those who are interested we had a summoner who also had abilities in aerothurge pyrokinetic and geomancer that was my main a ranger who focused on long range physical damage but also dabbled in pyrokinetic that was my secondary character a rogue who focused almost entirely on physical damage that was my friend s main a cleric who used hydrosophist and warfare and acted as our team s tank that was my friends secondary character the point of that is to show that we had a diverse build to our team sure it may not have been the most effective but do you know what it was fun we had a lot of fun playing that party so before you get this game ask yourself this do i want to be able to create a character who is unique to my playstyle even if they are not necessarily the best if you say yes then you will enjoy this game there are so many options for what you can do however if you want to build the best possible character then unfortunately you will likely be disappointed with how you will need to build a certain way however is that not what something being the best mean if one object is better than all other objects of the same type does that not mean that in that catagory there is no other choice besides that one object it is the same for looking at the builds in divinity original sin 2 yes one is better than all the other however if you only play to have the best build then i think you are missing the entire point of the game this game is meant to be a medium for telling a story for sharing memories while you can play the game alone it is my belief that for the true experience of the game you should play it with friends and when you do feel free to play however you desire i will lead to some good laughs when you look back at it
