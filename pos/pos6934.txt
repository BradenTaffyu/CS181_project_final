2022 i like the game its one i always come back to a sea twist on survival building games its just leaving early access now and whilst i feel there s a lot more that can be added to the game its amazing to see how much its grown over the years i love that its actively updated and maintained the graphics though not terrible aren t the best i cant wait to see how pretty this game could be in a few more years the price is worth the game it s really worth getting if you like survival building games with optional difficulty settings from creative peaceful to hard impossible
