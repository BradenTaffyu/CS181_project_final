hogwarts legacy is a harry potter fans dream full of magic mystery and fantastic beasts the action kicks off right away followed by choosing your very own wand and being sorted into your hogwarts house i chose ravenclaw the first time around and then slytherin because those are my favorite during the beginning of the game you will attend classes to learn spells and eventually become a very powerful wizard i think the best part of the game is being able to fully explore hogwarts castle and being able to collect magical creatures which you will keep in the secret room of requirement there are alot of fun things to do in the game and lots of places to explore and lots of villains to duel don t miss out on this fantastic game
