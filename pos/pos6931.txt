2022 early access review graphics you forget what reality is beautiful good decent bad don t look too long at it ms dos gameplay very good good it s just gameplay mehh watch paint dry instead just don t audio eargasm very good good not too bad bad i m now deafaudio is actually good but the noise of the bees can get annoying after a while once you unlock them so i marked it down 1 notch for that audience kids teens adults grandma pc requirements check if you can run paint potato decent fast rich boi ask nasa if they have a spare computer difficulty just press w easy easy to learn hard to master significant brain usage difficult dark soulsit was hard to choose between easy to learn hard to master and actual brain usage just because the learning curve in the beginning is a bit steep there s no tutorial or guidance so figuring out what you need to do in the beginning can be a bit intensive and you will die a lot unless you get into the community and ask questions look for tips once i got into the community and figured out how the game worked it was like oh i m dumb how did i not notice this cause its actually really simple but not necessarily intuitive oh and build a spear and extra hook as soon as you can like earlier than you think you ll need one thank me later grind nothing to grind only if u care about leaderboards ranks isn t necessary to progress average grind level too much grind you ll need a second life for grindingok so there s literally no grind to complete the story if you just go story island to story island and make the minimum pit stops in between you can complete the whole story without a drop of real grind however if you want to take your time and build a really cool raft and really get into the crafting and building aspects of the game which is my favorite part then you will need to grind for resources the minimum is there to survive and complete the story but any extras you re gonna need to grind for that said the grind is actually pretty enjoyable gathering resources can actually be pretty relaxing so even though its grind its enjoyable grind story no story some lore average good lovely it ll replace your lifegreat story and the story islands are super interesting and fun to explore being able to go back to story islands and they respawn resources so you get to explore again is also a nice little feature granted the stuff is in the same place but what the stuff is changes game time long enough for a cup of coffee short average long to infinity and beyondif you just wanna rush through the story speed runners do it in about 2 3 hours but if you like to just build and build and explore the time is limitless i m close to 500 hours and the bulk is on a single save even when the story is over you can keep on playing as long as you want which is great then there s creative mode which lets you just build no supplies or grind needed if you like building its really limitless price it s free worth the price if it s on sale if u have some spare money left not recommended you could also just burn your moneyhonestly the dev s could charge more and i d still say worth the price its early access but definitely doesn t feel like early access 100 worth the price no steam sale needed bugs never heard of minor bugs can get annoying ark survival evolved the game itself is a big terrarium for bugssome bugs can be annoying like on occasion you might get stuck on a charging hog that s probably the most annoying but there aren t any major major bugs and the dev team does a great job when a bug comes up at trying to fix it and address it then there are some bugs like the floating floor trick that started as bugs but now its become so widely used that people don t even want it fixed for the most recent update people literally said please don t fix this bug so yes some annoying ones but they don t really take away from the game so don t let those couple of glitches scare you off 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10overall i give this game an 8 10 just because of the few glitches that can be annoying and because of the learning curve with no tutorial or instructions the community has been great at stepping in and trying to guide new players though so if you buy be sure and check out the community page and or the raft discord if you have any trouble once you get the hang of it the fun is pretty limitless between just working on a main save and creative mode and then even speed running if you re into that there s also a very active mod community so you ll find a lot of stuff to do absolutely a worthwhile buy grab this review template here
