certain people etc non game breaking visual audio speedrunner friendly notes i m really not sure how i feel about this game the moment i saw it i was hooked the first few hours great i was having a really good time but the more i played well i got bored there isn t enough here to sustain my interest i made through i think 5 houses this feels like an early access game that was quickly and hastily polished it s kind of ironic actually just like how you tile over dirty cracked floors instead of fixing them once you peel back that new tile you see the reality underneath the game has problems a lot of them this game is a big asset flip ironically while i don t really care there s not nearly enough variety and for a 20 game about interior decoration that s a bit concerning not damning yet but if nothing changes it will be hf seems to be getting popular so hopefully they use the funds to hire a good 3d modeller or two it lacks polish inconsistently polished at best little things your character drops out of the sky when you load a new map tiny little bugs not worth mentioning but that are noticeable some minigames let you do the screws in any order you want some don t some interactions don t have sound opening a window fixing a lightbulb etc customers don t react to most things you do the day night cycle doesn t work trying to get clients to recognize certain rooms is frustrating no matter what kind of room it is if it has a sofa it s a second bedroom on that note they need to react to more things why should i panel over the entire exterior house if they don t care why should i carefully select paint if none of them even those who say they like certain colours react to it why should i furnish all the rooms in the house if they only want a select few why should i spend my time installing radiators or window blinds why should i put little touches on the rooms like paintings and vases and whatnot do they even detect the obviously dirty furniture and walls as dirty they don t seem to there aren t enough client orders i did 4 5 houses and was out also i wish they would react to what you do to leave you good or bad reactions once you re done if you leave all the lights on or doors open they should be mad if you go against their orders moving the husband s tools lavishly furnishing the mil s bunker etc they should penalize you i mean you can toss all their furniture onto the lawn and they won t care the game is too easy you start with 30 000 and get paid a fortune for each order you do i want to struggle to have to earn that 30k working for rude and unscrupulous clients and still barely scrape by to carefully watch a varied constantly changing housing market until i can snap up my first house on a deal and still struggle to repair and fully furnish it i shouldn t be able to buy whatever i want in the early stage of the game if i screw up buying something my wallet should suffer for it add extra expenses living expenses business costs taxes fines more ways to renovate the house less money per order and more money per house building code violations when you do a sloppy job on the electricity or panel over a sagging wall instead of fixing it i ll take all this in a hard mode even but that s one reason i got bored it becomes mindless there s no challenge a better house buying system is necessary you should be allowed to choose who to sell to or at least who not to sell to houses should take time to sell once they re listed maybe you should have to pay to have them listed at all and where what about renting or rent to own and all the legal hassles that come with that your business needs a better system too running a one man real estate business isn t easy popularity and reputation should factor in to how quickly houses sell graphics optimization it s a universal opinion that this game runs like ass no matter how good your computer is please add mod support please i m sorry for the essay but you can see that this game has many issues i m willing to be lax because it just released and they said they ll spend the next few months improving it but there you are the biggest problem of this game is that it doesn t last it s shallow there needs to be more deeper more interesting systems more clients more furniture types variations paint colours categories outdoors decks and porches and pools lawn care more types of house problems more infestations rats mice termites more ways a house might need to be fixed up more realistic cleaning not just with a mop but with a sponge pressure washer fabric cleaner etc realistic paint that gets everywhere viscera cleanup detail style dirty mop bucket even not just point and click at the mess more minigames and less radiators more interactivity in those minigames than click and hold i thought you had to pull a bit to tighten screws grab things and slide them in etc i was having more fun before i realized that wasn t the case in its current state there just isn t enough to hold interest for the first few hours it feels worth the 20 overall i enjoyed it that s why i recommended it but after a while it gets monotonous there s no reason to do all 20 houses it s enjoyable enough sure but it could be more i hope when i come back to this game it will have changed a lot it s going to need a big overhaul to reach its full potential but the devs seem fairly active so i hope we can get there
