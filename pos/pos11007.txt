2023 i ve been really enjoying this game is it perfect not yet i say not yet because the first game got nearly a decade of updates as well as user content i have complete confidence this will surpass the original within the next year and even in its current state it is still fun to play take the relentless criticism with a grain of salt yeah this game had a bit of a rocky launch but people saying that it s unplayable is very unfair and completely untrue being unwilling to turn down your graphics settings doesn t mean a game is unplayable expecting the new systems to work the same way they did in the last game does not mean it s unplayable
