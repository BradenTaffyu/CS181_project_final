2015 so i have been playing fallout 4 for a while now and have been reading the reviews from what i see the game is getting negtive reviews because of pretty pathetic reasons this game in my opinion is really good and sure it did not live up to my expectations all the way but i don t think any hyped game came out perfect i think the main problem with the negitive views was the hype this game was really hyped and for good reason years of development and potential was put into this game but people expected this game to be groundbreaking revoloutionary a game that everyone can have hours of fun in but hype is not aways a good thing hype rurrined this game our expectations were waaaaaaaaaay too high for this game and this is what is making people upset reading some of the cons people have written about the game is so pathetic most of them are tiny details that honestly don t even matter i honestly found myself laughing about the complete the reviewers pulled out of their arse some of my favorates negitive said things are big skill tree people quickly getting out of bed when you talk to them you can quicky demolish building in editor mode and enimes falling out of the sky when i started playing i hated the new dialouge mechanic only 4 options of converstaions what a downgrade but now i have been playing for a while now and honestly its not that bad sure more options would be nice but its really not much of a big deal i am still upset about removal of skill points but i guess i can handle that i would get a mod if someone will make one i do agree the game feels less like a rpg because of removal of skill points removal of the kama system ect on that note i can t believe they removed the karma system this was a really bad move in my opinion and removes great role playing aspects fallout is known for being different from other games for its rp aspects the rp elements is what seperated fallout 4 from games like far cry just cause and lots of other open world games fallout 4 still has lots of rp elements just not as many as fallout 1 and new vegas not 1 and 2 entirely different games with all these aspects in mind i think its good bethesda done this yes removal of karma no skill points removal origonal speech options ect is all a good thing and for some of them i dont think bethesda can be blamed for it think about it if bethesda kept the dialouge from fallout 3 the same in fallout 4 players would call the game out on being too much like fallout 3 and not much improvements with bethesda experementing with new dialouge options they can see what fans like and dislike and with this infomation improve their next games witht he infomation of what works or not i think this applies to all of the game elements people are upset about yes people say fallout 4 is just a re hash of fallout 3 which i think is complete and utter say if bethesda used the old dialouge system players would call that out of being copied from fallout 3 and nothing new is being added so to avoid this bethesda tried to add a new dialouge system different from fallout 3 and new vegas so people wont moan that the dialouge system is the same as last time and their is no new content i think game reviewers are responsible for this when a game developer tries to make a sequel to a game they try to make it seem differnet to avoid hate also why is it a bad thing that fallout 4 may use lots of origonal material from fallout 3 and new vegas fallout 3 and new vegas are great games and have lots of elements that would work well in fallout 4 i dont see why people complain about this don t we gamers want a sequel to new vegas not a entire different game that removes lots of elements that makes fallout fallout jesus christ just because fallout 4 uses content from its old games does not make it bad its a good thing its like if the elder scrolls went from a first person rpg medieval game to a fps futureistic game we dont want this but apparently we want this in fallout 4 god i still laugh at people complaining about graphics those people dont deserve to play video games trust me we dont want a super realistic post apocalyptic game we want fallout and thats what we got most of the negitive reviews are kinda stupid just people moaning about the dialouge system kinda annoying hey if you read this far thanks sorry for bad spelling and gramma you see i don t care thanks
