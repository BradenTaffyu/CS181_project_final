2023 i ve been having fun so far nice new and refined old mechanics and no bugs except some minor inconveniences with snapping seeing all the hate bombing over fps issues i preemptively reduced some reflections and illumination settings a bit and it gives 30 40 fps on average not good and not something you would expect from a rtx 4070ti but not nearly as catastrophic as some clickbaits make you think and perfectly playable and enjoyable for a city builder
