2019 i figure i should weigh in on this thing now that it s basically my most played game there s a cycle to this game and it can be a tough thing to acclimate to at first you ll probably love how the game feels it feels pretty fluid with a seriously large amount of weapons and skills secondary items like grenade turrets etc you ll probably beat the normal difficulty pretty quickly in fact since it s been balanced pretty well by now then you ll start on new difficulty levels and you may just rage against the whole thing new enemies await at higher difficulty as well as some tricky enemy mechanics the frustration will probably get to you in some way whether it s anger at the sometimes stiff mechanics or disappointment in your own skill level little details of the movement will grate on you trying to climb a half height block will cause your character to bounce and stop climbing lots of animations have a slightly longer than expected animation locking you from attacking or parrying jumping over spikes can be insanely close to your max jump distance etc but if you stick to it you could get to that last 6th difficulty hell and beat the game a few times maybe you ll grab the harder achievements like no hitting bosses or finishing the game while cursed where one hit kills you and you ll probably feel the stress of the earlier difficulties ease and you might again enjoy the game for what it is a solid 2d action platformer with a pretty great depth there are a lot of little improvements that could be made on this game especially with the janky movement issues but it s still a really enjoyable game it definitely requires a lot of work to get to that final difficulty about 250 or so hours for me but that s a lot of replayability since a run can take about 40 minutes i d think a lot of people could get their money s worth out of this game while a really stubborn person could absolutely finish the whole thing i d recommend it in the end especially since the developers are still working on it they really seem to care about what they ve made
