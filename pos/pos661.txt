2017 being a deep fan of terraria well i guess 800 hrs of gameplay is enough to call it so i was very sceptic at first and decided not to try this one on summer sales 2017 but after watching some playthroughs on youtube i decided to give it a try the result my beloved terraria is forgotten for a while and this little beauty is nominated for the the even better than i expected award need i say more just play it terraria fans that s more relaxing more lovely more cute if one may say so though it has a strict timeline it does not bring tense feelings surely it s not ideal but as it is well it s impressive and surely something that was created with passion and dedication of one man worth the money spent to the penny and on top of that every minute spent for playing it can t wait to replay again when update 1 6 is live guess this will be my 6th playthrough
