2018 like putting your hand in a blender and watching yourself press the button however in all seriousness this is an amazing game fun beautiful interesting story it has it all co op is extremely amusing and all the bosses are fun to fight albeit sometimes a bit aggrivating as aren t prepared i give the game a 9 10 that 1 is just for that one time i died from a cliff
