2021 this is the first time i ve ever left a review on steam but i had to let me preface this by stating i am a cdl instructor while the game can t mimic certain real life situations the amount this game has gotten accurate is nothing short of impressive i have since hung up my keys and live my days retired from the life but firing this up with some noise cancelling headphones and hearing the engine noises the turn indicator the traffic the air brakes all of it takes me back i m not going to sit here and nitpick out everything it didn t quite get right like how if you try to gta it you have increasing fines but irl you flat out lose your license and face jail time lol i d rather focus on what it did get right speaking of fines the way they increase really makes it so if you do try to gta it you ll eventually start spending more money in fines than what you get from the load making it so that your profit margin increases dramatically for safe driving i purposely tried three profiles up to about level 20 each i drove like a bat out of hell on the first as a gag quasi crazy the second one and perfectly safe the third time i noticed that i made more profit with fewer deliveries by driving safe so while the game can t take away your cdl for constantly running red lights and scraping the side of a car the fact you just simply can t make a profit unless you drive safe was a nifty implementation i could go on and on about this game and the nostalgia for the open road it gives me but i d rather be playing it right now i tried the demo immediately pulled in bought it on sale and once i really experienced it i didn t even question buying all the available dlc and now anxiously awaiting the new states quick mention about wyoming and texas i m going to enjoy driving wyoming in this game as driving it in real life was an absolute headache with how often i 80 has chain ups for ice and shut downs just for strong winds that could blow your trailer clean over so that s a reason i m glad it s not 100 realistic for texas make sure you put the entirety of dallas under construction forever make sure no one ever uses a blinker and make sure any shippers in laredo have trailer yards so small that even the most skilled driver gamer can t park a damn thing in it because they just simply can t move i hated laredo loads can t you tell i will be constantly throwing my money at this game i hope this goes far i hope the devs never lose their passion for it i hope it stays alive long enough to see the entire continental 48 hell i hope i stay alive long enough to see that lol i would love to hop i 40 from barstow clear to wilmington nc or i 10 from cali to florida i can t say enough good things and most have tuned me out by now so i ll wrap up i can t thank you enough for this game my only regret is i didn t get in it sooner
