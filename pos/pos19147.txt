through the many notes and details scattered in the wasteland the environmental and dialogue interactions are a canvas encompassed by the beauty of the mojave and embroidered by the desires of the

a group of npcs or even a whole faction the player can even avoid combat completely in certain cases by manoeuvring through the sophisticated dialogue trees which result in different outcomes conversations community created artwork for steam artwork by majordomo speech checks are crucial because they test the player throughout the entire process while also providing assistance when necessary combatthe combat system of fnv feels enjoyable yet clunky at the same time on one hand the addition of specific armour and ammo types as well as the many crafting component choices provides variety on the other hand the stats given from the above mentioned activities have a small impact on downgrading their primary use in addition the old reliable vats system has also returned which in turn fulfils the fallout experience vats system community created artwork for steam artwork by majordomo the return of the dated dependable vats system completes the fallout experience character progressionthe specialised perks provided from the innovative skill tree are the bread and butter of the game as every two levels they improve upon the player s many playstyles special perks can also be granted from other sources usually through actions in the game world it is essential to mention that certain perks have requirements like specific factions allegiances minimum special level requirements etc otherwise they can t be obtained last but not least the level cap can reach the staggering amount of 50 only by purchasing the dlcs which add new perks on top of the already amazing building potential pip boy community created artwork for steam artwork by majordomo the game s main draw is its inventive skill tree which offers specialised perks that enhance each player s unique playstyle every two levels difficultythe game s difficulty can be adjusted during gameplay at any time from very easy to very hard each difficulty level makes the experience makes the game harder by increasing and decreasing the player s and enemy damage respectively hardcore mode on the other hand is the exception to this feature by adding realism to the whole experience in more detail ammo has weight the player can get hydrated wounds heal over time and the companions will die instantly if they fall unconscious visuals the vintage scenery perfectly fits the nuclear apocalypse setting but unfortunately it feels very outdated nowadays the same thing can be said for the character models who look as bad as they did in fallout 3 of course such scenery has its moments with the new vegas district shining brightly from afar however despite all the mods out there the vanilla version of the engine will remain underwhelming audio there is an unmistakably lot of effort being put into the development of the sound elements each gun sounds unique whereas the effect of the environment such as the movement of the wind can be distinguished even in the most turbulent background but nothing can top the perfect combination of blues and jazz that mr new vegas provides from his music radio station the 50s and 60s tunes create a reminiscent atmosphere of the old days with a bittersweet feeling that follows the player during their everyday struggles in addition to that mr new vegas comments on the outcomes of certain quests the courier has already completed making each change special side notes the performance is undeniably the worst part of the experience with many bugs that make the game unplayable without the addition of essential mods it is expected nowadays from a game that crosses the 10 year gap but this would be a lie especially if we take into consideration the whole jolly bethesda experience thanks to the dedicated fallout community players can avoid catastrophic glitches by searching for guides on steam and other equally reliable sources i highly advise anyone getting into the tedious life of modding to follow the guides properly without any changes as this former option will eventually destroy the game s files making it completely unplayable verdict fallout new vegas is an open world rpg that not only offers a one of a kind adventure but also provides dilemmas concerning the fate of humanity and its many different shades i was stunned by the amount of love the developers have put into the story its complex characters and its sophisticated backgrounds as far as technicality is concerned it is not a perfect game but for sure a special one
