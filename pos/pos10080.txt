2017 early access review i still remember the days when this game was at the beginning i still remember how i ve fallen in love since the first minute of gameplay i just bought it and i can t describe how happy i am as i didn t play it so much i think i didn t play more than 100 hours a long time ago i ll tell you what i m expecting after the purchase cons and pros and how this game changed my gaming experience first of all the pros most of them simply the idea i don t know if there are similar games to this one but i m sick of trying to survive on an island running away from mobs that i can t kill on my first day and so on just to survive until i guess forever ex don t starve don t starve together in rimworld you have many more reasons to continue surviving you can always find reasons to keep playing because you play as many characters for each you can do a lot of stuff and of course to build a spacecraft to go home the diversity are you sick of basic wooden beds and tables worry no more in rimworld you can choose to build stuff from literally 20 types of materials for each one of them from uranium gold marble for furniture to cat and chinchila skin for clothes you can literally create a lot of different things and that s because of course they re so many types of animals and ores in this game i can have a yorkshire terrier in the game sleeping in a pet box made from uranium damn i love it the colony itself when you choose your people you don t only have to choose between their race and gender each one of them having tons of customizable atribbutes and traits you can chose their age their childhood and even their sexual orientation they can have positive or negative traits each one of them affecting all your gameplay the posibilities you can play this game in many ways the world is huge and it has plenty of different biomes and locations to choose from you can befriend your visitators or just make them your prisoners you can have a peaceful colony just by building and reseaching stuff or you can everything that s in your way also very important you can create presets and stories of your own you can edit the reason why are you trying to survive or how the story will finish you can name every one of your colonists how you want and also customize their weight age hair face shape etc thing that i find very fun to do don t like someone name a colonist after him make him as ugly as possible and just perfom experimental surgeries on him make a family make two families have 40 children strip naked and watch the clouds i don t know everything is possible newbie friendly i must tell you that the first time i played this game i had no idea how to farm or how to assign different zones or object and all the stuff but because of the simple and easy build in tutorial i ve learned how to play while playing the game itself just having fun right from the start so far these are my pros and why i love this game i m pretty sure i ll find more things as i continue playing now the cons that may be just me being noob and stupid the map let s say that a group of pirates are preparing to attack your colony you get a message which states the name of the group and from where are they going to attack the problem is that once you press jump to location in the letter this option disappears and you must find the enemies again by looking all over the map if you want to check the location one more time and you mostly won t find them easily if you re playing on a large map i may be stupid and i still don t know how that works case in which i d like to get some advice that s all i can find not being very good until now same as the pros i ll have to discover more now as i bought rimworld and i no longer have to play it from strange sources i m expecting much more i m expecting updates that as i already can see are very good scheduled and structured that way to make you excited about them i also expect a lot of fun with the workshop mods that we have here and there s a lot this game changed my opinion about building survival games and opened me to this genre now it became my favorite and i am always on the search for this awesome kind of games i recommend this with all my heart also support this developer this game is hard work i m glad i bought it have fun
