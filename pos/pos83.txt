2020 there are plenty of games out there that might give you a higher high getting the highest score in a lobby of some fps for example there are plenty of games that will give you a lower low seeing your companion die in some rpg for example but in over 15 years of playing video games of every shape and size no game has ever made me as happy as stardew valley just happy i love stardew valley and i highly reccomend anybody play it
