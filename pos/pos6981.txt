2023 i really enjoyed playing this game with friends the building mechanics are nothing special but they feel rounded and intuitive the whole adventure to the story islands was really fun especially the moments when big islands appear in the fog at the edge of the map und you get excited the only downside of this game is its late game and long term motiviation when you achieve the best items in the game there is almost nothing left to do so it lacks content past the story line to keep me engaged in the game
