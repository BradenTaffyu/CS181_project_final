2018 well after spending enough time with this game i think i m finally able to review it if you re one of those people quickly scrolling through to get a general idea of wether or not you should buy i reccomend it if you want a more informed opinion feel free to keep reading overview hearts of iron iv is a grand stratagy game set during the turmoil of the 1930 s 40 s and the second world war you can command any nation around the world and lead it on to the world stage and on to glory you must choose wether or not to begin playing in either 1936 or 1939 the former allows for a more custom setup and is better for playing small nations if you re trigger happy and eager to send millions of young men to their deaths you can choose 1939 grab your gun and leap into the fray no matter which country you command you can customize it to your liking you can change their ideology strengthen their economy and lead them to dominate the earth you can create a fascist finland a communist australia or a democratic venezuela good luck with that one you also have complete control over all armed forces of your nation and you can practically do anything with them if you wish to send hordes of unarmed men at the enemy s machine guns and trenches you go right ahead now this game has many in s and out s that i could go on for hours about but most of those things are easy to understand and the internet exists for a reason however i will offer some advice to new players advice to the plebs good first playthrough countries are italy germany the soviet union or the united states only make trade deals if you have no other choice don t give away all your factories remember to change the conscription laws when you are at war you can do this by clickling on your country s flag and clicking on the conscription icon quantity has a quality of it s own joseph stalinkeep your fleets in port until you want to launch a naval invasion then unleash them on the part of the sea you need to control in order to send transports through by then your fleets should be large enough to hold off the enemy this is especially true for germany the moment you send your fleet out the entire royal navy will drop by for target practice and sink all of your ships i know because it s happened to me convoy raiding is admittedly a joke in this game and it s not worth losing all of your submarines for always make frontlines with your armies don t just deploy your men willy nilly otherwise the enemy will break through quickly if you re the impatient sort and playing with a country that has a lot of resources i reccomend the mobile warfare doctrine with some lovely medium tank divisions those guys can always win a war quickly don t try to research everything if you plan on conquering a lot research military police early on and assign them with cavalry and put them on conquered states you ll thank me later now then let s go over the overall pros and cons pros and cons endless replayability few restrictions on gameplay land warfare is for the most part simple enough to understand division customization allows for custom armies the music is excellent lots of opportunity for customization and creativity fantastic modding community mods add hundreds more hours of playtime mods and add pretty much anything you want into the game unit models music ect you don t need any dlc for most mods unlike other paradox games multiplayer is a good time not enough natural resources really annoying naval combat is very hard to understand unless you re playing as great britain naval combat is missing historical elements it ll probably be fixed with a dlc knowing paradox the ai isn t perfect and can make some horrific strategic moves no coordination with ally ai on military stratagey aerial combat in it s current state is simply throwing planes into the sky and seeing which side has more of them the treaty system has a lot of issues but these can be fixed by the player led treaty mod and the state transfer modbest pro the glorious feeling you get when you crush your enemies leading a country through wwii to victory is very satisfying and i believe the game has accomplished it s goal of bringing the grand strategy of the war into the player s control worst con during the late game most countries will have created hundreds of divisions while this doesn t affect me that badly it can cause a tremendous amount of lag and i ve heard from several people that it has made their late game saves unplayable paradox or some modder needs to implement a system in which the ai lessens the amount of divisions it has when it is at peace overall rating 8 10 though the game has it s faults and some aspects of it are difficult to understand hearts of iron iv allows the player a thoroughly enjoyable experience for those who enjoy both history and grand stratagy now if you don t mind i must return to my command tank and finish the conquest of europe soon the entire world will tremble before the might of the fatherland achtung panzer
