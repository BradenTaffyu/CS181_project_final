2021 i am so conflicted about this one lately reality shows in the country i live have been invaded by a parasitic subclass of middlemen called real estate investors purchasing apartments or detached houses and improving those existing buildings with cheap but minimalist furniture while fixing the bare minimum these little parasites who are a level below of real estate developers but still higher than realtors equipped with their petty dreams of climbing the social ladder contributed massively to the gentrification of long standing neighbourhoods buying people out of their homes and ultimately designing new homogenous residential zones where no sign of diversity or poverty can be observed thus a question arises barri baby why did you put 14 5 hours into this game in just two days well the answer is simple i loved designing and decorating houses in the sims games improving the only place where one can escape from most of the daily humdrum is an exciting feeling that i do not quite get from anything else i think for this particular reason the sims franchise has been one of the most unique examples in the gaming landscape where there are thousands of fans who wouldn t engage with the core mechanics of the game but would put in countless hours to a very small subsection of mechanics and i have been one of them since the release of the first sims game as these two points caused an internal conflict between my core values and what i enjoy doing while gaming i should have expected that the rest of the game would have been conflicting in a similar manner the reason why house flipper is an obvious choice over the sims the obviously more polished and varied alternative for me is the fact that all development and design is in first person and this is much more enjoyable as you hit some walls with a sledgehammer and see them crumble or mount a sink and assemble it yourself or the fact that fixing the ruined paint on the walls is going to take some time paint and plaster this relation between manual labour and its rewards has an effect of keeping things grounded for a while and much more preferable to moving around the plot like an omnipotent god creating havoc over land only limited by a menial thing called budget nevertheless this first person pov engagement with rewards of manual labour comes with its own detriments it is not possible to dig the ground and lay foundations to expand the house or to add remove floors which is a tremendously important part of developing a plot inclusion of this one mechanic would have laid the foundations to more mechanics especially bureaucratic part of the business obtaining permits adhering to building codes handing out bribes and so on also due to the inherent repetitiveness of manual labour for example while you are painting a large room by hand like an automaton it becomes really easy to think about the lack of inherent valuation of houses based on their location sociocultural environment and gentrification level while the game feels more realistic compared to the sims it still resides closer to fantasy on the spectrum of realism and fantasy for these reasons surfacing another point of conflict within the game nate kiernan s brilliant article last year anarcute tonight we riot and the optics of revolution kritiqal com on kritiqal last year has led me to think more on my own perspective about what constitutes a good game i believe that in everyday life there exists a tangled web of economic cultural social relations that casts a vaguely perceivable shadow over all of us like the citadel in city 17 but invisible i do not expect that a game could completely untangle this web and present us a clear understanding of these relations and visible reactions of the web itself when a player interacts with it forcefully even when the scope of the game is limited to just one of the many fa ades of society in house flipper developing and selling houses to be clear i especially do not expect this from a game developed by just a 10 people team improbability of achieving a complete untangling does not mean that we should not even attempt to do it after reading kiernan s article sid meier s pirates had seen an exponential rise of its ranking in my list of favourite games of all time it already had a place there due to its charm uniqueness of period and fun and varied gameplay mechanics but when looking at it retrospectively it is apparent that firaxis had made an attempt to untangle this web and it is the primary reason why it still is a timeless masterpiece in pirates players are able to observe the gameworld s reactions to their actions to provide an example a couple of sunk grain ships headed from a small settlement to a major city could cause economic downfall of the said city which in turn could lead to a successful invasion by a major power increasing their influence and presence in a part of the world that was not previously open to them this happening will create further actions and their consequences the player does not have to intervene at all for all this to happen or could just be one of the cogs that sets this chain of events into motion this does not fully entangle the web but at the very least shows an understanding of real life relations between economics and politics and their enjoyable translation into a simulation game even an endeavour at this creates complex interactions between various mechanics which is one of the strongest arguments for building a digital sandbox house flipper due to its choice of subject has a tremendous potential that could have created a similar experience housing being one of the basic necessities for human survival already provides a solid basis adding the abstract but actual needs and desires of the people that live in those houses and their interactions with their immediate environment neighbourhoods would only enrich the game to the point that it would not be possible to compare it with another anymore to observe why people want to move to a certain house how gentrification affects the surrounding houses limitations and change of preferences caused by economic trends even before directly interacting with the gameworld itself would make a true sandbox experience that truly befits the name to consider that not only housing crisis is rampant in most western societies it was also a major contributor to the economic crisis in 2008 pointing out that the game s choice of subject is not only relevant but also a current one adding to its potential i think that it is now quite apparent that my frustrations are not limited to house flipper itself but i have a culmination of annoyances over the years with the so called sandbox genre as a whole i do not imply that house flipper is lying about its premise it exactly achieves what it sets out to achieve with a couple of user experience development and more features needed here and there if you want a first person sims that focuses on houses themselves this is the game my lamentations are solely about its potential and especially about how the indie scene where we expect creativity and bravery to be mostly refrains from taking on larger challenges that are not directly related to programming of a game but with untangling the web this results in an eerie feeling that is caused by a mismatch of realistic presentation thanks to the progress in game engines in the last couple of years while the game is located in a fantasy world that is so far away if i recall correctly developers have made a couple of promises that the most of the requested features will be resolved in the upcoming luxury dlc but i think three years after release this is the best time for them to move on to house flipper 2 with an actual digital sandbox
