2020 early access review first ever review this game will be around as the medieval battle sim for years i waited quite a while during the quarantine watching its release timer as i was a huge enthusiast of warband so far the game is being updated at lightning speeds improving the icomplete perk system and adding more ease of access and rp options pros i would absolutely recommend this game if you enjoy 4x rts style games with manual battles littered imbetween i love the game and put up with starting fresh to see the improvements but if that s not your fancy give it some time and check back building a character from an idea and improving him to that ideal via the battles and quests you have really just maximizes the replayability of the game and intense large scale battles in 3rd or 1st person really can get me in an anxious setting which isn t bad i often find stress hard to simulate in a game if it isn t difficult or challenging in some of it s aspects cons bugs and big ones some times causing crashes and loosing minutes to half hours of game time if not careful many textures dont mesh well from update to update and every patch many things are fixed and some are broken updating basically kills your last campaign so choose your beta wisely and play it untill a new patch is released your willing to start over for other wise this is an amazing game one that i play most often on my steam library
