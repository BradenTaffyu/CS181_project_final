2021 hearts of iron is a full blooded war game set in world war ii the approach is unique the hoi iv which dates from 1936 to 1948 recalls that the axis powers were not overthrown by the prowess of lone soldiers or even the ingenuity of generals it was won by harnessing the resources of the entire nation for the use of total warfare arming and training countless men and staying one step ahead of the enemy in the field of technology depending on the start up scenario there will be a maximum of a few years to complete before a generation of men and women return to the flames of world war ii in the beginning a state is chosen which can be one of the main players of world war ii or any country of its era or from luxembourg to kuomintang china the game itself is played on a world map that can be zoomed from hemisphere size to provincial level it does not go lower but for example hostilities are coordinated at the provincial and frontal levels the war effort requires both the armed forces and the industrial machinery to be armed for combat this requires the construction of factories the development of civilian and military technology and doctrines the training of troops and the construction of war machines the necessary resources such as steel and oil can either be produced by the country itself or purchased from abroad depending on the availability of natural resources and the strategy chosen in order to increase the efficiency of operations it is appropriate to appoint the most competent persons as ministers party ideologues chiefs of staff and the like hoi iv tries to find a balance between sandbox games and historical accuracy indeed the game contains a considerable number of historical figures events affecting the course of the game and other details and the desire of states to rule the war is curbed in a number of ways hearts of iron iv is not an approachable game smoothly for the first game session the ongoing tutorial section shows the basics but the first twenty game hours are whistling with mistakes when learning on the other hand micromanagement has also been added for example production lines push tanks out faster the longer they specialize in making them this provides an opportunity to fine tune the war industry to maximum power the good thing is that if you want you can also do things a little half heartedly and still manage moderately initial poetic speeches about the world fire sometimes hoi iv feels like a boring exercise and a genuine sense of guiding a nation struggling with its fate is not properly born it requires the player to set their own goals and the ability to get excited about arbitrary goals as there is no real way to win the game it is at its best when you choose to play a medium sized powerhouse with limited resources but with potential such as italy japan or spain cons operations and planning can interrupt and slow wars down can take some time to get used to pros comprehensive simulation grand strategy with complexity and nuance despite its shortcomings hearts of iron iv is definitely a good game it s a hugely challenging but largely smooth and extensive strategy game that offers tremendously tedious opportunities to rewrite history if serious fascist italian leadership under fennoscandia or new rome s creation sounds like a noble goal and the basic concept strikes then hoi iv is a sure choice and yes it s probably a few hours away 8 8 10
