2022 this game is great it will melt hours like cheese speaking of cheese that exists in this game don t fool yourself the multiplayer is punishing so much so i understand the source of the negative reviews that being said as much as this game will make you never want to play again i advise you to suck it up and keep playing compared to launch the game is night and day the devs have released updates and are continuing to work with the community to improve sure there s some slight balance issues but that will be fixed the game in its current state is 110 percent playable i ve learnt to stop blaming everyone else on me failing and instead came to terms with my shortfalls focus on where you can improve and understand that is why you lost there is always something to be done better and with enough grit and determination you can feel just how rewarding this game is to play it makes all of the lost matches worth it educate yourself watch tutorials and read guides about the civ that resonates with you do these things and be patient and you will learn to love the process win or lose this game is a work of art thats awesome to play with friends looking forward to ranked and the future civs and updates it s just moneey spend it on this
