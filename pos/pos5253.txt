2017 abstractfallout 4 one of bethesda s best in my frank opinion the potential released in this installment of the fallout series has created hours of fun for me the world of boston ma is a large open world that is perfect for the player to roam about in without feeling that they are constrained various aspects of the game allow players to play all kinds of types of characters from settlers to snipers power armor warriors to a jack of all trades gameplayfallout 4 s gameplay is incredibly diverse this in turn allows for players to interact with the world in multiple different ways apart from that the game itself has 3 different possible endings depending on the actions the sole survivor takes in the wasteland of the commonwealth i ll try to break this down the wastelandthe wasteland a post nuclear landscape and in boston ma its known as the commonwealth the commonwealth is a vast open world that lets the player go whereever they darn well please at any point in time not that where you go determines how much of a higher level enemies you encounter there are no level caps but walking way down south and getting one hit ko d by a mole rat fine may change your mind about where you can go when you re that nice ripe level 5 player full of abandoned and ruined townships and various facilities the commonwealth offers huge opportunities for players to go out and locate all kinds of loot remember in fallout looting abandoned towns and stuff is called prospecting not scavaging fallout new vegas loot can vary from what your character is looking for power armor warriors will look for the largest guns and the most ammo while the settler will be collecting every piece of junk you find yes you heard me right every piece of junk pretty much has a purpose in fo4 questsfallout 4 offers a very basic questline i won t spoil it but it s not as complicated as skyrim s was it s somewhere along the lines of being as simple as holy crap something broke lets figure out how to fix it and there are 3 different ways that it ll turn out don t get me wrong the quests that are not part of the main line are really captivating i was dragged into the minutemen questline and forgot about the main quest until i figured out that the leader of the minutmen knew nothing about what was going on in the main quest idiot d radiant quests are still a thing and they are pretty good still depending on what you character build is in a playthrough your character will benefit from some quests and others will not details and level designah my favorite subject the commonwealth is not only a well built place but the engine upgrades that have been made in fo4 are incredible volumetric lighting ambient occlusion wonderful textures all perfect the amount of care and insight into the world that has been designed is incredible not only will you find all kinds of easter eggs but you ll find interesting purposly setup scenes strange sets of toy setups namely teddy bears you find everywhere not to mention what you can find buildings you can t go inside of every building good thing too whew my looting disorder would have me dragging my loot to a workshop but you can climb around on top of most and depending on where you are raiders can be camped up in allys there s even a settlment you can setup inside an ally mechanicsthere are some pros and cons to the changes fo4 has comapring fallout nv here fo4 no longer has conditions weapons and armor do not degrade some people appreciate this change like myself but others think it may be immersion breaking i think that as well but not as much and the former we still have caps don t worry i don t have any blue star caps but there are still caps this is nuka cola country you ll have to manage your rad level a lot more in this one it s very easy to get cranked up on rads this includes just stepping in a pool of water apart from water there entire lakes of toxic waste and the occasional nuclear thunderstorm where every lightning flash emits a blast of rads that ll crank up to 5 6 from what i ve seen per second workshopsthis is the most talked about feature of fallout 4 since this is my review and i m sharing my opinion on it i get to say that i personally enjoy the workshop system i can t believe that some people don t like it yes it does have it s pros and cons and since i like to stick to being as non bias as i can i m obligated to share cons building the settlment up and having people move in is awesome they look up to me and the minutemen it s rebuilding the commonwealth and it s awesome and you get to throw in your architectural design side of your personality along with your interior decorator side or your logic gate programmer side workshops allow you to get really creative building pieces of various materials custom neon signs rugs floors beds paintings teddy bears heck if you invest in some of the dlcs the vault tec workshop dlc will allow you to build your very own vault now for the cons rotation dude the snapping feature is really useful but you got to have snap for 0 90 180 and 270 degrees as well some pieces don t snap to others either it can get really tricky sometimes but it ll usually work out conclusiongeneral 8 10gameplay 9 10quests 7 10mechanics 7 10graphics 9 5 10overall opinion 8 10tl dr fallout 4 is packed with content and mechanics mixed with a bunch of nice looking graphics if you re eager to continue your adventure in the great wasteland this is perfect i d recommend looking into the season pass if you can afford it i d also advise buying on sale now that it s over 2y o note from the top the reason i say hours of fun and steam says i don t have that many is becuase i play most of my games offline like i literally have no internet connection steam doesnt record those hours appearently
