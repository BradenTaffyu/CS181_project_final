2016 i lost the urge to play and finish this game dunno it just felt boring repetive and no innovative at all fallout 4 is average game but quite addictive repetitive with no replayabillity and lots of useless unfinished features like settlement system which was barely working and entirely pointless to the game fallout 4 has only succeed because of pre builded skyrim hype and brilliant marketing done by bethesda but muhh mods will fix it if a game needs a mods in order to be enjoyable then the game design is flawed game was fun for first 100 hours but it felt like empty i don t feel like i will ever go back to this game again but yeah 85 of the time was just mindless walking finding a dungeon killing raiders looting going back to the city to sell items this game is so shallow that it does not deserve more than 7 10 bethesda went way too far with the freedom go anywhere do what you want also i won t mention random skeletons in the funny position because at least level design and landscapes in the games were pleasing to look at those guys behind it did a fantastic job i wanted this game to be more refreshing and new instead we get simplified fallout 3 on the skyrim engine 1 01 fallout 4 feels like a huge framework for mods where bethesda will use it to milk it to the end because they have the endless supply of the people whos fallout 3 was the first fallout and they think fallout 4 is the amazing piece of art its good game it has some good moments but there aren t many of them sadly no idea how people can defend the dialogue wheel in this game where every option leads to the same outcome why even bother recording 4 different lines if they result in the same outcome also again empty wastelands with no human progress done all through 210 years no estabilished cities wasteland is full of raiders who the hell breeds them its like there is somone who breeds them only to flood the wasteland to give the vault dwellers some loot and experience why no overgrown cities with the nature trees grass vines in fallout 2 after merely 70 years after the bombs dropped you had already big estabilished cities and various cultures spread across the wasteland i know that bethesda wants to keep to the 50 feels but it gets only weirder maybe its because every few years a vault dweller wakes up from his vault and wrecks poop upon the wasteland reducing all human progress again to 0 that makes a perfect sense isn t it i gave it recommendation because it has modding support and fantastic written nick valentine which i hope he wil get his own story in the upcoming dlcs otherwise this game would be dead after few months and forever forgotten but mods can t fix the core game problems fallout 4 is a huge step backwards and i really hope that the future expansions or next fallouts will be improved not streamlined
