2019 allright this game is great the world might not be as good and interconnected as ds1 but that s one of the only gripes i have about this game the combat is way better with more options more tension and way better balanced than the older games it just works more as intended which feels amazing the levels are really well designed with shortcuts and good enemy placementsthe areas look cool and have good enemy varietythe bosses are amazing to fight with a few exceptions like the wyvernsthe music is the best in the series imoi will talk about the dlc on its own ashes of ariandel i love this dlc it might just be a single area it is a damn good one the enemies are cool it tells a real story it looks great i love the end boss too very cool fight even with how hard it is truely amazing dlc some people say it s too short but i d say it s worth it ringed city i feel a bit more mixed about this dlc while i really like the new enemies the lore the areas and the bosses all amazingi had some problems with some of the enemy placements where it felt like they just threw a whole bunch of strong annoying enemies in one place you deal with it this is the only problem i have with it however so if you can deal with a tiny bit of that this dlc is still amazing
