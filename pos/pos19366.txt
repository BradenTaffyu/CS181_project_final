2022 it s hard to find a good multiplayer rts experience these days with a large enough community to keep matchmaking times reasonable it s also hard to find a developer of such an rts that actively supports the game with balance updates and new content that is why if you are at all interested in multiplayer rts you should absolutely give aoe4 a solid shot and when i say a shot several dozen hours to learn a build order and the basics of a few civs at least you really won t start to have fun until you learn the mechanics of the game of which there are a lot disclaimer i have played nothing single player for this game besides the art of war challenges very helpful and skirmish vs ai to practice build orders mp is what will constitute 99 of my playtime as that is where i get my value so what does this game have to get you interested in mp it is still relatively new to the rts scene meaning the population is healthy between steam and game pass therefore you can t rely on just steamchart numbers to get an assessment of how big the player base is i had never played an aoe game before aoe4 and still manage to hover in the middle of plat ranking for solo and team ladders this spot on the ladder results in many of my games being quite evenly matched and therefore exciting since it is still newish there are people playing of all skill levels notice i have 200 hours that is quite frankly nothing in terms of rts playtime even so it is pretty easy to get into evenly matched solo team games there isn t really anything more engaging i ve found in my years of games than an evenly matched rts game both all players using interesting or outside the box tactics working together to see huge armies systematically dismantle a massive defensive position armies on both sides winning and losing battles all in the time of a single match it really can be for lack of a better word epic you almost get kind of a brain high after a long slugfest that you end up winning or maybe just mental exhaustion either way i find it keeps me sharper for other games and in real life for some tasks i d say rts does more for multitasking and problem solving than something like crosswords or sudoku lol as mentioned relic developer seem to be quite committed to making this game a success so far in my opinion it is working out the new civs are very cool and shake up the meta in solo and team games quite a bit the custom game and modding scene seems to be well alive and you can find many things of that sort on the steam workshop personally i stick to official maps and ranked ladders so the only addition i would like to see is the addition of well made community maps to the official pool for quick play and ranked aoe4 does have some problems not dissimilar to other rts sometimes the matchmaker fails and pits you against a 400 iq god brain child prodigy but it s almost worth playing it out to witness how someone else can absolutely destroy you with their thinking a toxic attitude straight from league of legends where always blaming your teammates is the go to will bite you in the ass so hard in this genre so if you are someone who tilts easily and rages at your teammates you will not enjoy this game unless you exclusively play 1v1 though it is absolutely possible to carry even in team games yet you will still see so many salty weirdos who cry from common things like cheese this is a hilarious argument to me because if some simple cheese strat is enough to topple you then you are bad cheese is very easily dealt with after you advance to a certain point crying about it only delays your effort to counter it for the first while you start playing this game you are gathering knowledge hopefully you then learn to apply it in tactical situations part of that process is succumbing to something that may seem like cheese so just get over it in advance or look it up on yt there are plenty of content creators for this game with many tips for you this is a game worth playing if you are someone you is looking for a semi hardcore hardcore mp strategy experience it s somewhere in between the micro requirements for a game like company of heroes and starcraft ii it is faster than coh but slower than sc2 you probably won t need adderall to get to conqueror iii rank highest rank
