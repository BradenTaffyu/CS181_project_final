2020 this is my first time playing an rts game for more than 5 hours since the release of warcraft 3 the game is so damn responsive and smooth the campaigns are a total blast too there s some serious historical accuracy and a lot of the factions have a lot of feel to them even if most of the units are the same i m still too bad to play ranked without frustration but even singleplayer keeps me on my feet would absolutely recommend i reckon if you re into rts and haven t played this somehow you ll be very pleasantly surprised by what a modern experience this remaster remake is
