2018 now at first when i started playing this game i actually bought it over 4 months ago possibly even months before that and i never bothered to try to progress in the game because of the lack of action during when you try and find a way to escape the vault but ever since about 3 months ago i tried to become fully committed to this game and i am so glad i did this was by far one of the most entertainingly fresh games i have ever had the pleasure of playing let s go over the pros and cons pros the amount of things there are to explore in this game is phenomenal you ve got your classifications of bugs types of human enemies super mutants deathclaws mirelurks etc and these are just some of the ones in the commonwealth many more things to find in the dlc everything simply looks beautiful everything and there are tons of places to explore in this game with lots of different prizes awaiting you once you finish exploring said place radio now listening to music and playing a game like this seems nice right well it is nice even better than nice unfortunately you cannot actually play whatever type of music you specifically want but there are lots of classics from the 1900s that are nice along with classical music choice of weaponry now this one was actually a bit debatable considering more could ve been done to make things like guns and melee weapons more unique and different from one another but the weaponry is still really impressive in the game you can find all types of assault rifles pistols gamma guns energy weapons mini nuke launchers and regular rpg 7s and a whole lot of other armor this one i don t even have to go into detail about gameplay footage should reveal all your questions about this power armor is included workshop here you are able to build a variety of things things that could potentinally help settlements protect themselves or things that ll assist you in building a home for fun the more things you expect out of the workshop in the game the more likely it does need to be paid for as dlc nonetheless with or without the extra purchase it is still very resourceful to use i could go on and on and on about how extraordinary this game is but let s move onto the cons i d like to keep this as short as possible cons mission shortage now do not get me wrong at all there are plenty of missions to do in the game may have taken me extra long but i d say you ve got over at bare minimum 40 50 hours worth of missions and gameplay to do in fallout 4 dlc not included however though once the game is completed missions are gone at this point the game can get a little boring in my personal opinion i think particular individuals should be able to just give you random assassination type or extermination type quests even retrieving ones are fine anything like that would ve been great sure you have haylen and rhys to help with that but rhys just gives out orders to kill small herds of ghouls or orders to kill a small group of synths fortunately his desire to kill super mutants makes it that you have to kill a lot of them in order to succeed and pass his quest when it comes to haylen i do truly have no complaints when it comes to retrieving based quests she does just fine only wish there was a more important item to look for at a more important area or even maybe in a dlc area if you happen to have any of the dlc and aside from a few glitches and bugs and like how a body with nothing but bones gets stuck in an object and keeps making noise that one thing is virtually the only complaint i have about this game in my full and honest opinion i do truly recommend it and hope that you will purchase it it did even make me a bit emotional at times i absolutely loved playing this game and will not forget it for a long time nuka cola quantum should also entice youbut what ll really entice you is nuka cola quantum power armor i ll write reviews on the three main dlcs of fallout 4 soon
