2022 i use this game to escape the crippling reality that i m forced to drag myself through instead of working a 9 to 5 getting paid minimum wage i watch a classic car transition from an old rust bucket to a bright shining reminder a beacon that harkens back to a different time then i sell it and earn hundreds of thousands of dollars and do the same thing over again this is the best game i ve ever played ive installed this game on a flash drive and i plan to be buried with it when i grow old i plan to print it s code onto thousands of sheets of paper and eat all of them so that i and the game can become one it s pretty fun 9 10
