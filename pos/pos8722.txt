2017 incredible graphics and sound design along side some great gameplay features make this the best hunting game out there and a must have for any real life or not hunter i ve played thehunter since 2009 so i was very hyped when they first announced this i ve only experienced one bug thus far and my game hasn t crashed yet definitely recommended
