2015 early access review this game s crafting options turned me into a diy nut early game was spent by a riverside shack i created right next to a river in the forest biome i surrounded it with corn cotton maple tree blueberry and potato farms absolutely zero protection but i was relatively safe during the night in sneak mode at the top of my 4 block high 7x7 abode wielding my handmade crossbow had a hell of a time trying to find all the books i d need for crafting particularly the one that would allow me to build a forge luckily i found a cooking pot pretty easily i know from previous playthroughs how screwed you are when you can t boil your own water lived off boiled meat very early but before long i was making a living baking potatos mid game i set up mining operations near my shack mining for stone lead iron coal and potassium nitrate at night while the hordes passed overhead mostly unawares during the day i hunted hit supply drops and did some supply runs on hardware stores and the homes nearby stocked up a lot of rebar frames and wood frames plus came across a lot of tools from the hardware store runs i saved the rebar frames for later and used the wood frames as fuel for my cooking and forge fires so i could stockpile wood from my maple tree farm ended up with a metric ton of animal fat between hunting and those slow bloater zeds the little i needed to make candles barely made a dent in my stock used the corn to make cornmeal then that to make clay with the clay and my supply runs i was able to make molds of all parts of every firearm in the game late game prepared to make the defensible self sustainable lair of my dreams 40 x 40 four block high walls topped with barbed wire that are three blocks thick using stone from mining to make concrete outer layer is reinforced concrete using the rebar frames from runs inner two were simple concrete surrounded by a 3 block deep moat with sharpened tree trunk traps at the bottom entrances on the north south east and west sides secured with two metal doors each inside i had enough room to rebuild all my farms all my forges and cooking fires a mine and built a two story house in the center have a small lake for water now pretty much the only reason i would have to venture out is to hunt to maintain my stores of animal fat and venison fat for biofuel and candles venison for venison stew which is awesome and ironically sand i use the sand to make glass jars because the game inexplicably does not allow you to keep jars after you use water for anything other than drinking like making venison stew or grain alcohol which i use with biofuel to make my own gas cans for power tools between the iron i ve mined and continute to and the molds i have i m able to build any number of guns between lead coal potassium nitrate and a stockpile of brass you should really be able to mine this too i can make any bullet have plenty of books for shotgun shell wadding that was just one way to go about it you can be a nomad packing it up during the day and raiding any town or muni building you see or you can fortify an existing structure and save on building resource cost what s most surprising to me is how a game that is in early access which has made no attempt at a storyline so far can really make you ask yourself how you would survive an apocalyptic scenario highly recommended especially if they come through with the dirtbike they said they d include in the game would make late game looting really fun for the stay at home types
