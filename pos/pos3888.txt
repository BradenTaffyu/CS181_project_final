2018 early access review to the people complaining about the difficulty or grinding stop letting the vhpd take your characters kills really if you re good those vhpd units can pretty much handle the entirety of the game in my experience so far it s not that they re overpowered they re strong but so are the enemies you need to let your characters get the kills and there s masteries that hand out exp when other characters get kills as an example my albus was falling behind a little and sion who can chain lightning a group of enemies and get three kills in a single strike outlevelled albus fairly quickly i put yearning on albus and the problem was solved note that no grinding was required to keep up with the level of the enemies in the story mode i did each repeatable mission once as they popped up let albus and sion get the majority of the kills and their levels stayed on par with the enemies use the police as the backup they are don t let them beat the level for you because it s very easy to do exactly that to the people complaining about a lack of checkpoints fire emblem does not have checkpoints unless you re playing on mode also known as easy mode in the newer games each fight takes thirty minutes to an hour and is much less forgiving than troubleshooter and yet it has a devoted fanbase dandylion is doing nothing wrong you just need to get better the game saves if you need to leave and come back assuming you don t have the time to finish and automated checkpoints can bone you hard later on if you do poorly at the beginning of an encounter as an addendum to the above sion is squishy and can die in one hit he can also oneshot multiple enemies he has a lot of movement placing sion strategically is important you know what else is important examining every character s passive and active buffs the melee vhpd units just so you all know have a passive that lets them dodge overwatch attacks there is nothing wrong with a difficult srpg final fantasy tactics was mentioned as being an inspiration for this game if you could go in and rush through everything with little fear of repercussions then you ve made a game that s little more than a power fantasy fft was crazy difficult if you didn t take the time to figure things out and sometimes that means failing a little there s chests with loot you will need to be getting and grenades absolutely need to be utilized at times dandylion aside from a few grammatical errors i have absolutely no complaints i ve been punished for not keeping to cover i ve made progress by learning the systems you re on the right track i love the game and absolutely recommend it to anyone who is a diehard fan of strategy and tactics games
