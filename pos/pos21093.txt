2018 tldr at bottomhonestly one of the best games ive ever played i normally dont bother reviewing games but this one is just so worth it bought on a whim in a sale because i was bored best random buy ive done its such a happy uplifting game amazingly colourful and gives off such a calm feeling its great for when you just want to sit back relax and have some fun it does have some problems ofc but so does every game the grind for gold after awhile can get really boring ive gotten 100 of achivements and almost 56 hours play time so i think i have enough experience to say the plorts market could use a bit of a workup it works on the basis of the stock market supply and demand if you spam one plort for days then the price will go through the floor however the idea is that if you dont sell any for awhile the price will go up this doesnt always happen very well i stockpilled some of the more expensive ones in silos for days just waiting for the price to go up only for it to randomly go down and they never go back to their starting prices or even close in my case it just seems a little too rng however none of that is really a problem unless you want to grind the final few levels of the club rewards as everything else is fairly cheap the main section of the farm could be bigger as i like to have my main things in one area and stuff like farms silos pens in the other areas to reduce running back and forth too much but you could just be lazy like me and custom build portals for each area the start can seem a little slow at first when trying to feed your slimes enough while wanting to explore but it makes it feel all the more rewarding when you can build up to items to ease the grind the science building has some really fun stuff some of which let you customise your slimes with items like bowties googly eyes my fav etc just makes the game all the more rediculous and hilerious especially if you put googly eyes on an angry largo because they look so stupid they have already announced drones soon to help you around the farm which will make it much nicer late game when you dont have the spend half the time feeding your horde of slimes hopefully more items like that late game will be added to help out or an upgrade to silos because late game i was filling up about 7 fully upgraded ones with the highest plorts just waiting for thr prices to rise so far it looks like they are continously updating the game and each big update normally brings whole new areas slimes items and are really worth the wait also so far all updates have been free yet i would happily pay for a dlc at this point if it is anywhere near as gd as the base game the game has 3 modes so far normal adventure which is just the main part of the game an easier version that gets rid of the tar slimes and a 5 day rush which is just like a mini challenge level which is fairly easy completed it in one try with max achivements but still very fun more challenges like that would be really good in the future but maybe with different difficulties the entire game is a steal for the price ive spent less hours in 40 games before and im so addicted im just waiting for the next update which just happens to be in 9 days tldr prosfast updates with new contentcolourful and relaxinggreat exploration with lots of hidden areasvariety of slimes decorations and craftablesnice musicgoogly eyes cons farm a tad spread out for my liking would be nice if you could layout the farm as you want as in pick where the building spaces can go but i understand why you cant plort market too rng on pricesoccasionally had largo slimes disappear randomly from my farm even when they are happy and fed no sign of them anywhere on farm conclusion buy it thats all
