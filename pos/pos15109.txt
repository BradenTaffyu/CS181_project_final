2015 early access review i m not a fan of the genre those multiplayer craft based survival sandbox games just don t appeal to me and neither the notion of playing early access games but i love me some don t starve together klei is slowly becoming my favorite indie studio because they just seem to understand what makes games fun to play and dst is fun as heck i liked the earlier game but i always found it too stressful by playing with friends the tension just seem to evaporate and stumbling upon new and exciting ways to die horribly becomes something we all get a big laugh of gather a bunch of friends and play this it s worth it
