2016 early access review i bought this game because i saw videos all over youtube on how awesome this game is and my god its awesome even though its 25 it is worth every cent i just love how there is so much to do in the game and this is due to the fact that modding the game is supported the community is greate and there is no fighting in the community like there is in some other games cough wow however this game could greatly benifit from multiplayer i would love to crash smash and race my friends in this open world sandbox car simulator 9 10
