early access review hands down the best zombie apocalypse simulation ever made you re not a superhuman hero you re a panicked stressed out survivor who has found themselves in a horrible situation the developers have been working hard on this game for over 10 years the game is full of content that will last you hundreds of hours and still the indie stone continues to give huge updates once every few years i can t wait to see how this game will look 10 years from now
