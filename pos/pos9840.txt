2016 this game simply terrific i love this game because i ve tried to get into dwarf fortress but it s not my thing personally and the only 2 reasons for this being are the graphics and the hud otherwise the game would be amazing and amongst the best of all games but we re talking about rimworld here not dwarf fortress so let me tell you some pros and cons for this game and the reason why you should really get it because it is definitely worth getting it pros now i d bet most of you found this game through other similar games like as i had already mentioned before dwarf fortress or banished there is a genre for these type of games which i d like to call colony management now not only is this game fun for all the people who played similar games but also for new people which in my opinion is a pretty big pro edit for nominee xddd i might be wrong about this but i ve experienced absolutely 0 bugs about this game and i think that for a especially an early acces game this deserves a pro it s incredibly unique i actually like that tynan the main game developer didn t copy too much from games like dwarf fortress which he based this game on challenging the game keeps you at a constant pace of difficulty to keep you satisfied and not bored although there is an option to change that for example the randy random mode last words to top it off the developer of this game is amongst the best i ve ever seen because not only does he listen to the communities ideas and suggestions but he also involves into it though that might change because the game is getting very popular very fastcons this may sound ridiclious but can t think of any at the time i m writing this suggestions some big suggestions i had that everybody would love to see probably vehicles and rideable horses this could really make the game interesting and with the new chemfeul added to the game alpha 16 it may even get added soon y levels could not only be strategicly cool but also more realistic and in buildings multiplayer this is probably the biggest thing i mean the game could be so fun if this was added here s why and how i think it could be implented so with the recent update alpha 16 tynan has released your colonist being able to form caravans and form colonies on other maps he also made it possible to have a spherical world map and litteraly look around on this map the way i think multiplayer could be possible is if players would just find a colony on the planet and play it would be kind of like the game rust where you make bases and the objective is to raid other people to become the king of the hill not originally called some incredible unique features to the game to top this post off entirely i just wanted to list a few features that were definitely worth mentioning a spherical map this feature has been recently added and is one of the big things the game has you can see it in the pictures on this very store page multiple colonies being able to play on multiple maps is something i d never thought would happen and it s amazing drugs lol this is kind of a funny one you can litteraly drug your people and make them stoned some of the descriptions in their needs menu where you can see your colonists thoughts and need are sometimes hilarious also you can create drugs yourself which is also very cool the health system is very well made not only those it conclude illnesses and infections but it also lets you perform surgeries for example the health system is also very realistic as doctor colonists can fail them or that a room has to be clean to have a higher rate of succes official final words would i recommend you this game definitely is it worth the money yeah it s a decent priceis it for arcade players see here s the problem this game might not be for all people same goes with the game dwarf fortress if you are not willing to learn the game mechanics or you can t quite cope with loss i wouldn t recommend you this game rimworld is trying its best to make it appealing for everyone which in my opinion dwarf fortress fails alot in thank you for reading everyone have a great day
