2016 honestly having played fallout 3 fallout nv with all the dlcs and recently fallout 4 nv really stands out as the game that captures the spirit of the fallout universe the best it can be a tough game to get into if you re not used to what fallout is about in short you can do anything you want in no real particular order the nv universe is big and diverse and allows for plenty of hours of amazing gaming you ll have some emotional moments especially in the dlc some wtfmoments and you ll have loads of laughs for me this is a must have for every gamer just buy it
