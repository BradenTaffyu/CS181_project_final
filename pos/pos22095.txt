2016 hi i 100 finished the game here are my thoughts game seems more challenging than ds2 normal mobs seem tougher than the covetous demon dragon rider the last giant and many of ds2 bosses combined soul memory is gone back to ds1 style matchmaking not locked to 30 fps cough ds1 cough connecting to others playing with friends is even easier than before password system works wonders there are many feature quality of life improvements there are too many to list them here keyboard mouse control works great i never liked using controllers are you reading this ds1 new game and beyond rewards nothing new in terms of enemy placements enemies are slightly stronger hardly noticeable but otherwise the new playthrough is exactly same as ng rings are only slightly better except gold serpent ring 2 it s amazing terrible frame drop when loading new areas if your computer isn t lord skynet the game will force you back into the main menu for low fps you ll need to restart the game to continue online if you have just enough stats to wield a weapon in two hands your status page will not display the true ar chart mildly annoying it takes ages for you to be summoned as a blade of the darkmoon or as a watchdog of farron you ll end up doing a lot like literal days of farming without lengthy online sessions of farming grind just to max these covenants out if you re interested in getting all achievements you can tank partial parry a hit and immediately continue to parry again a single reposte will usually kill you because everyone online is a hornet ring wearing twinking asshats online player character models sometimes just don t load becoming completely invisible but can be locked on sometimes enemy character model won t even have an animation leading to hilarious frustrating duel there s no guard break mechanic from ds2 it takes multiple kicks to break a greatshield a smart greatshield user won t let you kick multiple times 40 of invaders are estoc r1 spammers the other 40 is impregnable greatshield users the 10 is iron flesh sacred flame glitch users who insta gib defenseless people the last 10 are the noobs that need to git gud in summary iron pineapple is the bane of all things nice in ds3 poise still doesn t work like you want it to instead hyper armor is granted to heavier weapons when swinging heavy armors will take heavy stat investment with questionable returns that s all i can think of at the moment tl dr version it s better than ds1 and ds2 it s easy to play with friends frame drops if your pc sucks then you re gonna have a bad time online pvp will kill you little on the inside unless you re a pvp veteran from previous soul games
