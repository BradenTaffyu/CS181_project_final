2021 early access review updated for full release this is one of the best games i have delved into in early access and beyond its release it is so fun and relaxing it is a game to put your fave music on in the background and just play along with i don t play the timed content so it is much more relaxing i have since completed the full game after release and had 46 hours of fun i enjoyed cleaning every location item and going for all the achievements i hope they add dlc in the future of more locations and items there is a light story that continues on through out the game play and a very fun unexpected ending tip look into the crystal ball when cleaning the fortune tellers wagon very cute surprise updated review portion for co op i will say this is the down fall of the games experience for me while i love playing the game with a friend and it is not about lag or connection issues neither of those were an issue it is that only the host has access to their full range of power washing tools tips and cleaning solutions having to be stuck with the default power washer truthfully is horrible i stopped playing in co op after experiencing this you need your upgrades for some of the more challenging maps anyone that is not the host will experience a less than stellar experience so my one big gripe with the game is this otherwise as a solo player it is really fun and relaxing this game its devs deserve all the praise and positive feedback this game has attained throughout its early access into full release they care about their game and it shows so a big shout out to futurlab for their continued success future games
