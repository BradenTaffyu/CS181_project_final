2020 introduction hello everyone i was considering to write this review for divinity original sin 2 for a while now but i wasn t completely sure how to put all different ideas in to words just in order to recommend that wonderful rpg to anyone that is thinking about getting it as there is already about nearly 80 thousand reviews just on steam i wouldn t be suprised that there might be stuff that were already mention by different reviews altough i will try my best to mention things that i have gathered throughout my own experience with the game and consider my opinion on different parts and elements from the game as sort of review guide as for me i have never experienced any larian studios games before and dos2 was my first game that i have played and spent hours of discovering it game features for the game features i will try to list out stuff that you might or will experience through the start of the game that i personally think are great exploration the very first thing that you will discover is that you will never be able to follow certain quest because there will be always something new something interesting enough that you will have need to check it considering objects like barrel or crate there will always be new and different pathway to undiscovered place area that you haven t seen making you want to explore it and this makes the game so much more greater by spending time on that exploration and sometimes letting you forget what was your main objective now for the exploration of the buildings which might contain locked doors this will require you to lockpick them but if you can t do that you could find alternative way or get the key or simply break them using your weapon but also lousing it s durability any elemental problems like a huge puddle of poison use a rain skill to remove it or throw water barrel at it problem solved you see a ladder but can t reach it use teleportation or jump skill to access it all of this little features made my exploration experience much more interesting and ambitious because it was my first time where i was able to interact with elements and objects in order to find and create alternative ways to solve many different problems also in genral i feel like the game gives a passionate music in the background as you enter and explore different areas team managment the probably very first thing that you might struggle with is your team managment i personally managed to create a well structured party on my first adventure with the game in team managment you might consider different stuff as you look through characters they race and talents they have for example lizard is allowing you to dig out treasures without using shovel elfs have a corpse eater where they will eat someones flesh and this will allow you to see the persons visions and help you work out what happend before they died undead heals only from poison and they need to hide they appearence away from civilians and finally human and dwarfs have stat based positives after choosing characters then you might consider picking they classes if it s physical or magical these are very important as the game gives you enemys with different amount of absorption either way to physical or magical armour and resistence to elements so having different party member with different class will be the best option rather than having whole party with the same class another thing that you might want to consider is the civil abiliteis so each character has different one for example your main character might want to have persuasion on the highest level so you can go through dialogues bartering for someone that will pick up all the items that you want to sell so you can get best prices and many different ones overall the whole process might be difficult at the start but as you progress through the game you will be allowed to respec your team to your prefrences combat dos2 has turn based combat which i found myself challenging at the start and it s not let s go all in to one enemy the go to another one no this game presents a combat that you might not be able to finish on your first try mainly because you will need to consider the enviorment where the battle takes place and elements for example there might be barrels nearby that someone might use against you or a puddle of water that you might electrified besides than that you might want to preper for each battle by creating formation where you place your archer somewhere high in order to get increased damage mages in the back and tanks at the front maybe pickup oil barrel and throw it before the battle starts so you can use fire skill in order to deal damage to enemies there is many different methods to preper for your fight and all you have to do is use your imagination depending on your character loremaster level you will be allowed to inspect your enemies this will show you what is enemis resistence to different elements and what are they immune to another great feature that the game offer is bedroll which allowes you to heal and recover your armour for the whole team as a big fan of turn based combat i found myself divinity 2 as a masterpiece that gives you many tactical and strategic options to preper your way through battles skills for skills the very first thing which caught my attention is beautiful animations that show what they ment to show for example a lizard s dragon s blaze shows a sort of powerful dragons spirit that breathes flames a genral use of them in and out of combat like teleportation which might be use to teleport someone to unreachable areas or items to you inventory crafting the inventory is very simple but i love to have sorted things and it s simply done by having different backpacks with different items for example one might be for materials other for food and pouch for gold crafting can be useful by testing things out like mixing weapon with poison barrel or empty potion bottle with different plants besides than testing you can find recepies by reading books which is interesting dialogue the game has far best dialogue that i have ever experienced because of few methods that they used first is narrator and it s because for example if you approache a scared npc the narrator would use complex sentences in order to describe the character maybe the enviorment around character it s feeling and how they react towards you this makes me want to listen read dialogue as each npc has it s unique and really similar voice to created character another amazing feature which is talent called pet pal allowes you to talk with animals and this is great option to find alternative stuff for example a rat might tell you what s behind the door that your about to enter he might tell you about some treasure or he might also lie to you depending on your dialogue option and finally dialogues might help you out learning english if it s picking up some unknow words or sentences which was very useful for me as i was able to find out new words that i didn t understand other features that i haven t experiencedco op a possible great way to go through adventure with your friendsgame master allows you to create your own campaingmods workshop gives you new fun experience to play the game and i think that s everything that i wanted to mention hopefully everything that i written would help you out with considering the purches or just understanding what does the game have in offer i still feel like there might be something missing but i don t have enough space to mention that so if you enjoy classic rpg s challenging turn based battles different mission outcomes the game is definitely for you so thanks for reading and sorry for any spelling mistakes or poor grammar as english is my second language
