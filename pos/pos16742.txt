2019 warning game may cause irrational satisfaction have you played fallout 4 did you enjoy the settlement building part or were you more like me in that while you enjoyed the settlement building you really just wanted to clean it all up and then move on then maybe provide the basics for survival and maybe work a little harder longer for your favorite locations well this game is that with less functionality in the actual objects that you place but with a subjectively more aesthetically pleasing aftermath the only problem is you might not want to actually sell the house after repairing it thankfully should you desire you can move your philanthropic entrepreneurial office into the new house it s much easier than actually repairing a house in real life as you do stuff be it paint demolish walls tile panel or run auctions you ll earn perks that allow you to perform the more tedious tasks faster painting for instance you ll use less paint effectively equaling less time having to dip the roller back into the paint as well as being able to pass over multiple tiles to paint them all at once tiles in this case meaning the vertical slabs that you interact with this also means that you won t actually need to move the fridge to paint behind it provided you can see one part of the tile on the wall you may have to jump on a desk though it s not all flipping houses mind you some people will hire you to clean their garage or paint their kid s room knock down a wall and build a recreation center with multiple playrooms or you ll get hired to replace a lot of destroyed equipment from some miscreant college kid s frat house these act as a sort of tutorial as well as give you some initial income to buy your first home but house flipping is why you re here the potential clients that might buy the home you re flipping will provide feedback on your actions as if they were watching you live stream it however their feedback is enigmatic at best i found it easier to just set the home up as you might like it and then go from there they tend to react to the most obvious things but leave you with no feedback about things i d see as more important they seemingly overact to you cleaning which seems silly they say nothing when placing a washing machine do you want it in the garage the bathroom not at all they react more to the specific picture you hang randomly in the house more than if the kitchen has a stove or not their feedback is almost completely useless the gist if your desire to clean things up and then make them into something appealing conflate with your entrepreneurial aspirations of financial freedom this game is for you i will say though there was at one point when playing this i had become so absorbed in the home i was flipping that i forgot where i actually was in real life my mind had shifted briefly into an old apartment i used to live in that might not happen to you but i thought it was interesting enough to share from a trash heap to this game is obscenely satisfying a screenshot of house flipper by spacecouncil more here station argus
