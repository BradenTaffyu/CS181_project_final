2015 early access review one of the greatest traditional roguelikes out there updated and improved immensely from the previous version caves of qud one ups most of the genre by having fully rebindable keys a well crafted ui system factions interesting abilities and very unique areas around its open world i would recommend this to anyone who enjoys turn based combat emergent gameplay and a post apocalyptic setting
