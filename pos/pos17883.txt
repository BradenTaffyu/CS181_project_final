2023 not quite understanding the negative reviews about this game it s an rts that is made to be multiplayer the campaign in rts games have always been missing good ai we could take this further and say video game ai has been lacking for decades now when looked at from a multiplayer perspective the game launched in a better state than coh 2 is currently i have not experienced a single crash minimal bugs and overall my experience so far tells me the game is pretty fairly balanced as someone who put nearly 1500 hours into coh 2 i can say this game is a great step above the previous game
