2019 early access review my friend got infected and was soon to die i brought him into a dirty kitchen i told him i d watch over his things hoping he d make it back to me i pulled out my gun aimed it at his head said i m sorry and pulled the trigger i sat in the dark dirty old kitchen looking over his dead body it was night raining they heard the gun shot they were coming they broke in the doors i had no chance but to run i ran to the car as the were swarming the area i left drove into a dark empty parking lot stared out at the rain with my lights off my friend came back and was heading for his stuff i drove up as fast as i could and he was fighting off zombies i screamed for him to jump in and we fled the city yeah so pretty cool and all
