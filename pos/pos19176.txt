2017 fallout new vegas is a game that comes around only once in a decade maybe two decades it s just one of those games where you either love it and think that it s the best game that has ever been made to represent the fallout universe or you hate it because you are a sad person who hates fun or just doesn t enjoy these kinds of games which i can understand to each their own i ve put in over 300 hours on steam officially and probably another 200 hours offline the modding community for this game is well its like nothing i have ever seen before there is a mod for almost everything i took great pleasure in modding this game to the point where it nearly crashed many times and yet i still played on if you like a game where the choices you make actually matter where the people you meet are interesting and have a story to tell and if you just love getting to take pot shots at drugged up junkies with explosive anti tank rounds this game is for you 10 would come back as the courier to kill benny again
