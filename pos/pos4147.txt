2018 early access review jarrizard s prons and cons reviewslay the spire is like a bag of chips you keep saying one last round until you see the sun rising in your window slay the spire gives you everything from your opponent s next move to success rates of various actions you can see everything the only rng part of the game are the relics you can pick after killing bosses and elites and the contents of the chests or cards you find this good in a sense you re able device a perfect strategy to determine the outcome of a battle constant update from the devs you get new contents and bugs fixed almost on a weekly basis decent artstyle for a simplistic roguelike card based game and matching music to give an adventurous vibe large variation of cards and relics that promotes different kind of play style for each classes only 2 for now playable for both casual and hardcore roguelike players it can get frustrating at times as the levels are not designed so that you can breeze through it this is good for people looking for a decent challenge but not as rewarding for people who plays mindlessly fair decent amount of content but can get tiring for people who already invested a good amount of hours in the game the weekly updates from the devs makes this not a problem animations are so stale your characters don t actually move and are just given special effects whenever attacking or using an ability end of review
