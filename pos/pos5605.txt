2020 early access review this is everything i had hoped for in this game even in ea is it 100 finished of course not but certainly 85 90 some things need to be fully added some things just aren t functional the reputation system is not perfect yet as it s very hard to gain rep with others but very easy to lose it but the economy is super fleshed out i started as a merchant to get myself going and could easily see how my efforts were effecting cities i traded in their prosperity and thus mine as eventually i owned workshops and saw them flourish as i made sure they had the necessary items to produce goods as far as performance goes i don t really have much to complain about it runs fine on my machine and only super massive battles do i see frame drops in the start sometimes it does crash but i m used to frequently hitting that f5 button quicksave so even if i do it s only a few minutes lost i have sort of seen the snowball people talk about but in my experience each time it happens the faction eventually crumbles there are a lot of npcs and they certainly flock to strong factions i think it will be more manageable in my subsequent playthrough now that i know a lot more all in all this is shaping up to be just as legendary as the original i didn t expect a perfect game from the start but am still impressed about what is in the game and functioning now there are many things that are clearly placeholders and things you can see have a presence but not fully functional that is fine with me it is now friday the game came out monday so in 4 days i have 75 hours played and i am not a fanboy by any means and wouldn t blindly praise something just because in fact the original game i played more of the got mod than the regular game but for 40 i have already surpassed my criteria 1 per hour of getting a good game with value i am sure i will have a decent amount more as i finish up my campaign and maybe another soon but i also know that when the game is fully released i will double my time again to experience the full force
