2020 let me start by saying that this game is not f2p i think putting huge f2p title on banners is a false and misleading marketing strategy the game lets you to play until level 50 with lots of limitations while the max gap is 75 this is more like a trial version like in the wow or ffxiv to unlock full experience you need to subscribe this game is p2p by monthly subscription so before going any further keep this thing in your mind i have over 400 hours in the other version i m so happy to see it come here and hopefully increase the player base and allow a lot of new players to experience one of my favorite mmo s if you liked wow but want something a little different with heavy emphasis on story this game is it companion system is great group dialog is cool solo story is great lots of variations on character creation and cosmetics fully fleshed out space combat quests and no queues on flashpoints decent pvp warzones and good raids and i would like to add something swtor s community is one of the best communities you can get from an mmorpg game let me give you an example there was a bug in an event called nightlife where you are playing virtual slots and earn in game prizes in a casino and the most valuable machines in the server were broken due to an error bug except one slot machine so as you may guess all of the people who are doing the event rushed to that slot machine but here comes to difference of swtor community instead of standing right next to the machine and spamming people just decided to get in line and while waiting on the line people were chatting lauging and dancing it was an amazing view for me to see literally a queue in a video game final verdict 8 10 also check out my top 10 mmorpg list below for 2020 if you are interested wow ffxiv eso swtor bdo gw2 tera dcu archeage aion swl
