2019 alright this won t be your average steam review i m pissed off so this version of the game steam version is all well and good minus the crappy resolution that is as far as i can tell unchangeable however as far as i ve found this is the only form of the pc version of pvz obtainable any more since microsoft purchased the game they ve put it in a vault of sorts and i can t figure out how to pick it up as the buy button just takes you to a copy of the page you clicked the buy button from and some screenshots this is stupid and i don t know why they did it this basically makes the steam purchasable version the best one around which is good for steam but bad for the people who buy it purely because of that resolution issue i promise if anyone can find a way of changing the resolution of this game the will be loved by the internet for millennia to come otherwise if that is impossible i still massively recommend this game as in my opinion it has been game of the year for the last decade i feel sorry for those who saw it and thought eh this is just a boring td game not worth my time because their lives must be so dull
