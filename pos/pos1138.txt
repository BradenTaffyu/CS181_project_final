early access review i first bought this game on late 2022 played it blind and always dying even at 25 hours in and ended up putting it aside because losing progress after progress isn t fun for me i picked up this game again in 2024 read some early guides and reduced the difficulty to builder to learn the game mechanic and end up sinking 300 hours on this gamethis game got a steep learning curve but once you found it it starts being fun sandbox where you can do anything so don t be ashamed to reduce the difficulty first when you start out i ve seen several times other newbie dying too much and end up quitting the game too early also go to options display aim outline and change it to anyweaponsome negative perks are free points some are death sentence starts in rosewood because its the most beginner friendly town
