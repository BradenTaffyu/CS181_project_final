2016 updated to the bottom of review got home today and waited for the upload of the hotfix once done i embraced my darker side and started a vampire counts campaign 19 turns in and all but shcwartzhafen is under my sway with a solid foundation of cities in eastern sylvania mannfred has immersed himself in the lore of death and has acquired the sword of unholy power from it s resting place now let the feeble minded cattle of stirland quake for the dark counts of sylvania ride again 10 10update 14 6 16during the 3 weeks or so that i have had the game i have now had the opportunity to play all the races in campaign vampires quite hard to build outwards due to vampiric corruption but a good challenge stirland is under my sway and now i consolidate waiting for the next moment to strike dwarfs rather easy campaign on normal with the help of the humans numbers was able to crush chaos after obliterating the orcish tribes south of blackfire pass and all through the world s edge mountains karak ankor lives again empire still playing through as karl franz both the empire and dwarfs find it easier to expand due to confedeartion mechanics archaon has been sent packing once and has returned once karl wields ghal maraz i shall march north and destroy the chaos threat once and for all orcs waagh azhag is progressing nicely however it can be difficult to maintain momentum north however karaz a karak lays within my hands and the dwarf empire is in even more tatters than before throgrim has been sent packing and only now rears his face the crown whispers to me and i shall obey out of charcter 11 10 review love the game enjoy the tactical side and building settlements i will try it on hard next time and see if i can truly challenge myself only gripe quest battles hard to get through all the item battles before the end of the game as they re always further and further away but that one gripe is not enough to spoil the game in any way love it love it love it if you liked warhammer in the last 30 years buy this game update 26 07 16keeping this review updated as i feel it helps others as of now i have completed the empire dwarf and vc campaigns of all of them the vc campaign i feel i played the slowest but finally managed to wipe the empire from the map whilst contending with the chaos threat the corruption mechanic does make the game more difficult for the vc especially in the early phases i also made a mistake going round the south part of the map eliminating the border princes before wiping out estalia tilea and bretonnia with mannfred leading the charge just chaos to complete a far different proposition but a challenging one on the dlc i feel that it is worth it i will be pre purchasing soon but before i will be revisiting the dwarfs to try and improve my last performance it was my first campaign in terms of speed before diving into the beastmen next week all i can continue to say is how great this game is and how much fun it is to play and the dlc seems to be a continuous stream of new content still 11 10 and a brilliant investment if you wait for a sale in december i d go as far as 15 10 because you will get it at a steal but i know i wouldn t be able to wait that long update01 03 17felt compelled to update the review of this game to help the numbers of positive reviews i just took a look at 10 15 of the most recent negative reviews with laughable reactions one chap was dissapointed there were no dark elves because he didn t check before hand many complain about dlc where the only dlc i ve had issues with is beastmen rest have been brilliant and bundled with flc as well only about 1 mentioned the gameplay in any way those on the fence ignore many of these people the game is brilliant lots of fun if you enjoy warhammer and still with all dlc cheaper than investing in a real modelled army they also just dropped a complete overhaul of bretronnia and a free ll for vamps all free enjoying my time at the moment pretending to be a virtuous knightly king of old enjoying the new races and how the balance of the map changes everytime a new faction starts enjoy this game it s now going to be on sale more regularly and also make sure to pick up a few bits of dlc i recommend chaos and wood elves
