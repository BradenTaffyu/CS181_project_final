2014 early access review dug myself a nice cave got all cozy and laughed as zombies walked over my base oblivious a dozen dogs spawn two weeks in dogs dig down into my base dies every time i respawn because dogs in base and zombie horde outside 10 10 would get gangbanged by zombie dogs again in all seriousness though i have to highly recommend this game even though i play this on a mac for the most part where it s no secret that bugs crashes and a plethora of frustrating issues arise from time to time overall i think this game has huge potential for just an alpha something that very few games manage to do even 40 hours into gameplay is keeping me on my toes and worried all throughout the difficulty progression of the waves seems to match pace with the progress made very nicely imo while i tend to play settler style for the most part at any point of the game i would never be completely relaxed about the nights yes generally the nights pass by in silence as the zombies simply walk over my base but occasionally when they sense or even outright detect me underground and start mindlessly digging towards me it s always a nerve racking experience my bases are generally shallow eg only 10 or so blocks down something i should probably fix overall the game is wonderful because it allows so many different styles of play but still forces players to do one common and core function exploring now i talk about this from a vanilla server or sp perspective where you have no recipes unlocked as you progress in the game it becomes apparently harder and harder to survive with just a crossbow and some cloth armor you start requiring later and later game items which require more unique resources eventually you ll be forced to go out into the wild to gather and find these resources that will be paramount to your success in the game want a shotgun better know how to make one what s that no ammo gotta figure out how to make that too don t know how to make it well sucks to suck go out and find the recipe book keep getting rekt by the zombies pumelling you well get that janky cloth armor off you and get some iron armor on don t know how to make one find the recipe book what s that need leather better figure out how to make that too the point is you can t progress in the equipment line without these recipe books that you won t be finding unless you actually go out and explore personally i enjoy the idea of packing up a lunch grabbing a stack of water putting on some armor taking my shotgun and seeing what i can find out there i ve been playing on navesgane for a little bit now and i have a pretty good idea of where all the major things are without needing to reference an online map or anything even then i keep stumbling upon encampments houses and other poi that i forget exist it s an exciting experience when you legitimately don t know what you might run across on one day of exploring i would go into more commentaries on the mechanics and nitty gritty of the game but there are already tons of reviews that do that much better than i ever could this review is just an honest opinion of my experiences with the game thus far hopefully others will find that the game might be worth their time and money to do a bit of exploring with
