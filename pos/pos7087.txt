2021 early access review i really enjoyed playing raft and it is without a doubt a game i would recommend i would largely say that this game is a blend of minecraft valheim terraria and a few others that come to mind but ultimately it is still its own unique experience and that is why i logged so many hours in it there is just something enjoyable and ominous about being out on a raft with no guidance on what to do but survive and yet i found there was a lot of depth to this game with crafting building surprises and more that kept me coming back at a 20 price point this game is a no brainer and given how often it is on sale you should be able to find ample opportunities to play this game
