2020 early access review i actually love 7 days to die it s a strong zombie survival game and after a while you can focus on just rebuilding your base and growing pros strong crafting diverse enemies decent graphics seems like it s being updated herecons no story or lore anywhere unless you count a newspaper that says virus outbreak or the random challenges you find multiplayer needs work i d freaking love it if they had dedicated servers that you could build on i understand the challenges world of warcraft does a good job because you can t keep a base but fallout76 actually surprisingly is one they should look at for how to incorporate base building on consistent servers building off of that the lack of a steady server is why most of the multiplayer is lacking there s no community and it s downright lonely you can play with friends and start on servers together but unless you keep your game running you can t play unless the host is available makes it something you start on and stop on fairly quickly crafting can get overwhelming while it s strong it s a bit too strong and too indepth it makes organizing things and creating what s necessary obnoxiously tedious at times suggestions that will probably be ignored run dedicated servers you can solve the problem of time by making the enemies you face in an area dictated by the highest level player within 500 meters i e don t spawn super strong day 60 zombies against a day 1 player unless they re playing with someone nearby who is that far along you can solve the problem of base population with a first come first served rule i e if player 1 is on the server and has a base at the bear den and player 2 joins the same server but also had a base at the bear den alert them that their base will not populate on this map and prompt them to join a different server realm world of warcraft does a good job with realms where you keep your progress on each map and can ensure you play with friends fo76 lets you play with friends but keeps your base itself static rather than the server and alerts you if the server you want to join would make spawning your base impossible you could also make it so that bases built remain after the player signs off however that opens the player up to griefing while they sleep or don t play which would make the game less enjoyable
