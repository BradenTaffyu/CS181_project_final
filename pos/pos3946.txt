this is the best game on steam especially if you re an adult you can stop playing at literally any moment you don t even need to pause you don t need internet connection so you can play on a plane it s incredibly deep brilliant fun and as immersive as you can afford to be immersed without punishing you for not being able to commit it s fun to learn and once you have knowledge of the game it s not about maintaining a skill like fpss or constantly keeping up with the dev s changes like mobas it s like riding a bike so an adult can come back at any moment without feeling the frustration of being out of practice or getting steamrolled by the most recently buffed thing i hope that this kind of game is the future of gaming for adults thank you for creating this
