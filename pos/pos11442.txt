2019 early access review yes this game has bad optimization pretty old graphics and is in alpha for years slow updates very very slow but i ve spent over many hours in this game playing solo and with friends what i want to say is what even with the issues provided above and with many other bugs in the game 7d2d is still very enjoying to play with friends or without also if you got bored there are a few nice mods which adds a lot of new content to the game to developers please stop trying to make this game realistic we don t need it we need an old zombie tower defence game with some graphic optimization and regular content updates that s it
