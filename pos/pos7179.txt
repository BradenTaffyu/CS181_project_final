2017 positives relaxing beautiful graphics good replayability because you level up and that allows you to buy new trucks many mod options good difficulty optionsnegatives if scenery is not enough stimulating enough for you the trips are gonna be pretty boring not a whole lot of exploration to do at least not late game all in all recommended for people who likes scenery and travelling not recommended for people who is only attracted to vast amounts of action
