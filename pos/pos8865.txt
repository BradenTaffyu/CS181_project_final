2020 this game is awesome one of the best computer games i ve ever played it s kind of like a much emphasis on the much better version of crusader kings ii but in space if you ve played ckii before then you will settle comfortably into stellaris they re made by the same company so they have a similar feel a note about purchasing this game is constantly going on sale for 10 00 so if you are willing to wait a little bit then you can snag this for a quarter of the stated price some general features this game is not a light play game campaigns can last upwards of 50 hours in total and you ll find yourself sitting for hours upon hours in one sitting trying to conquer a single nation half your size and that s on easy mode this isn t something you hop on and play for 20 minutes on your lunch break this game is quite complex this isn t a strength or a weakness as different people like different levels of complexnes there s a lot of stuff to manage and it s not always immediately clear how to do things you ll have figured everything out within probably the first half of your first campaign though some strengths of this game this game does a very good job of being complex but not convoluted there are a lot of different elements and features thus it being complex but they all make sense they fit together and you can handle them all thus it not being convoluted good strategy and management elements throughout the game this is a 4x game and a very good one in wars you ll be flanking around behind enemies managing several different fleets at once for maximum effect judging whether a jump is worth it for the strategic position etc you ll also be managing diplomacy with several nations voting on laws in a galactic council keeping the strong empires happy with you and angering the weak ones hehehe forming federations etc you ll be managing planets to get the most efficiency out of them whether that s a research planet or an industrial factory complex you can always get your efficiency to the max if you try some weaknesses of this game this game can be kind of buggy and even if they re supposed to be features they still feel like bugs and you can t tell if they are supposed to be features or not there are quite a few times when ships will act like they don t exist options may appear that don t really exist ships from nations you ve closed borders with will come in anyway and just quite a few buggy things pop up none of them are gamebreaking they re just a bit annoying this is a paradox game and thus be prepared for the dlc pain this game is still fantastic with just the base version so don t feel the need to buy any of the dlc s i haven t bought any dlc s and i still think it s amazing however there is a lot of content that paradox put s into dlc s that are each individually effectively more expensive than the base game none of them are necessary you can still have an amazing experience without them but there are a lot of features that you ll hear about stellaris having that are behind a 2nd paywall in the form of dlc s i definitely recommend this game to anyone interested you can get it for pretty cheap with a little patience and the base game offers tons upon tons of fun and if you are into dlc s then there s even more for you there it s just a well executed great game
