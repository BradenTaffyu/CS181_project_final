2018 i don t usually write reviews because most people couldn t even bother to read them despite this i would say that this is an amazing game that is surprisingly dead for how good it is the soundtrack is beautiful each enemy has its own moveset strengths and weaknesses bosses are even harder versions of the enemies but don t let the bosses fool you the normal enemies are just as tough i ve died more to enemies before the boss than the bosses themselves i ve beaten this game about 20 times now with a new build each time that should give you some insight on the replayability when it comes to mulitplayer it boils down to two things you either get ganked the moment you spawn in by three players or you git gud and kill them usually you don t get a straight up 1v1 fight when you do it is glorious but most of the time you are getting ganked the reason behind this is the game has a dedicated community but isn t really growing dark souls multiplayer is great in my opinion being able to fight alongside or against randoms is awesome but yet there is only around 7 10k people playing this game on the weekends this is a game that came out 2 years ago so often during invasions you will have to wait 5 10 mins for a fight only to get ganked its a vicious cycle graphically its beautiful simple not top of the line graphics but good enough to make you appreciate it the weapons and armor designs are beautiful and mostly practical with a few whacky armor and weapons for those who like ridiculous proportions lookin at you str builds all and all buy play git gud dark souls is intimidating for some but trust me by your 2nd 3rd playthrough you will be beating the bosses in your sleep 10 10 game
