2020 total war warhammer ii is a real time strategy game with light city building and turn based mechanics set within the warhammer fantasy universe the main draw of the game is its gameplay where you put your army and strategic prowess against the ai or other players online although this game requires quite a bit of monetary investment to play it at its best fullest the vanilla experience is excellent when the world is in peril and armies rise up there can be nothing short of total war storythere are two types of campaign in wh2 the eye of the vortex and mortal empires the eye of the vortex is about trying to gain control of the now destabilized great vortex for your faction the vortex is what protects the world from the forces of chaos by draining the chaos magic from the world into itself some want to stabilize it to safeguard the world from evil some seek to harness its power for personal power heck some even just ignore it this campaign is much more story focused and a good introduction to warhammer fantasy for beginners it is also a shorter campaign making it much more appealing mortal empires is a flc mode that allows players to utilize the entire map from both wh1 and wh2 but requires wh1 in their library to gain access to this mode since it is stitching together the maps assets from both games as for story there really isn t any the goal here is to simply conquer the map to strengthen and grow your empire this can be argued to be the real battleground for the game as you will have to contend with every ai player being a threat as you conquer the world there is certainly room for emergent storytelling as you can befriend or crush different characters in each run gameplaythis is the heart and soul of total war titles in wh2 you first pick from a rather robust pool of lords each lord has their own starting position gameplay mechanics stats and abilities starting army preexisting relationships with others and more depending on the game mode you will get a brief introduction or cutscene outlining your objective then the game begins with a robust roster of lords each campaign feels different and fun a screenshot of total war warhammer ii by maverickzealot you build and upgrade cities to improve a variety of things like the economy armies and more city growth is turn based so all choices matter in wh titles cities are only a means of bolstering the armies for inevitable conflict cities can be conquered or even razed to the ground in an instant if one lacks a good army or tactical prowess to defend it each faction has a unique tech tree to allow for various upgrades to many areas such as army buffs and improved city obedience there is also a diplomacy system in the game you may be able to strike a peace accord with someone but they may turn out to be your biggest threat if you do not keep them appeased managing alliances and enemies is a tricky balance but with great rewards despite all of this the actual battles will likely take up most of your time battles are a dynamic dance of tactics and cunning as you plan your unit placements and give them orders to attack in real time you can control up to 20 units in any given army 1 slot being reserved for the lord in charge each army is inherently unique given each faction s fun and wacky roster of units to choose from although basic unit types are universal each faction typically specializes in one field or another some units are as diverse as they are terrifying on the battlefield a screenshot of total war warhammer ii by maverickzealot combat is fairly simple to navigate and mostly done through mouse clicks to indicate which unit is to be selected and where they should move or attack there are also keyboard shortcuts to enable smoother army navigation and orders that can be rebound as well however the thrill and challenge of combat comes from being able to strategize your army efficiently and effectively success or defeat for your army is entirely in your hands and how well you micromanage although there is an auto resolve function to skip battles entirely are you certain you would like to gamble the lives of your army there are so many more different faction and universal features to discuss but if i have piqued your interest by now consider buying the base game to check it out visualsoverall the game looks beautiful on ultra settings with the overworld map having a surprising amount of detail and care in it animals can be seen grazing water shimmers and undulates swamps and corrupted lands are disgusting and so much more in battle the amount of detail in each model is astounding as are most of the animations especially the unique ones for kills spell fx are beautiful and distinct having an aerial view of your army going all out is a treat to watch if you have the time to watch although warhammer is a fantasy game there are certainly really intriguing designs that will make your head turn soundoverall the music is very well done its orchestral tracks convey the perfect mood for the situation sound effects were overall good as well in battle things felt appropriately visceral and weighty voice acting was also a treat with a variety of pitches accents and more to discover performancei personally play on very low to get the most frames possible for battle as expected for a strategy game with a large world map and hundreds of units in battles running everything on ultra will likely tank your fps however there is a nice variety of graphical options to tweak things to your liking and save frames being a strategy game your cpu and game drive will dictate how long load times are and how long the cpu takes to make its turns there are also a few bugs here and there although creative assembly is pretty good with ironing them out in time otherwise i have no real complaints multiplayeri prefer the single player experience but the game does offer online campaigns and battles for those interested campaign is the same just with more players nonetheless i have heard that there are some desync issues and mp specific bugs present online battles are 1v1 or 2v2 affairs with both sides picking a faction and building an army from a customizable gold pool before doing battle against one another dlcthere is a lot of dlc for wh2 including dlc for wh1 which can be played in 2 via mortal empires mode they are all also rather pricey so this is a hard sell for those of you who have limited funds thus i highly suggest only getting the base games first to try out then look at dlcs if you can only afford a few please research what each one does and what changes there is a smattering of free lc s but most of the game changes and updates are included in the faction packs and lord packs nonetheless my first 100 hours were spent in vanilla then i got all the dlc because i loved the core gameplay so much overallif you like real time strategy games and the thrill of leading your army to victory i highly recommend wh2 with its colorful cast of characters although there is a lot of dlc the game is perfectly playable in vanilla there is something new to see in practically every playthrough and a whole world to explore or conquer so this game definitely has a lot of replay value this is also a good entry point for anyone interested in wh fantasy with a colorful cast of character to meet and kill marshal the men we go to war a screenshot of total war warhammer ii by maverickzealot 9 10solid recommendation wait for sale if possible for dlcs worth it but they add up
