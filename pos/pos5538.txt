2015 early access review been playing this game in earlier non steam incarnations for a long while now and i m happy to recommend this to anyone with a sense of wonder call to adventure and the steel to face the unknown and pick themselves up off the floor and push back against the challenge of the frenzied wilds qud is a flavorful evocative and downright interesting land that reveals itself to you over time and stands shoulder to shoulder with the best on offer in the genre of mysterious ruined and technology touched worlds the systems in play are crunchy powerful and deep enough to reward the critical thinking and careful planning that this sort of adventure warrants also you can have like a whole mess of arms with claws and axes and the qud version of mind bullets so that s cool too you can play this game in short controlled bursts if you like but it is uniquely rewarding to simply dive in block out a long evening your favorite drink a comfy chair all of this preferably near a window where you can look out and see the night sky
