2016 early access review the best way to review a story driven survival colony game is to tell you a story 3 survivors of an unknown accident crash land on a random planet unknowing how to play the game progress was slow but eventually we had a cosy little settlement 3 beds table heat light and stove everyone was happy this is when s hit the fan i misjudged how big my farm needed to be so hunting was the only way to keep the colony going raider attacks eclipses and shared living was starting to take its toll the final straw was when the food ran out and earl my hunter couldn t catch anything tim my handyman had a mental breakdown and earl s son ivo was injured in a gunfight a few weeks later my colony was up to 5 people and 1 prisoner which i took pity on i accidently sent ivo out hunting on his own to fight a grizzly earl came to the rescue but it was too late ivo was alive but very badly wounded earl was worse off as his arm was completely ripped off and to top it all off i ran out of medical supplies and earl is the only trained doctor i have the next day ivo s wounds got infected earl decided not to amputate his arms as there was no medicine but then a trader came by and sold some medicine earl gave it to ivo and he started to recover but it was too late ivo died 1 hour later the depression the lack of food the occasional cannibalism and winter was setting in my colony was doomed but with every great story there came a twist a cargo pod just came out of nowhere filled medical supplies the farm finally yelded a decent amount of crops also a trader came by and sold me a bionic arm which was then attached to earl during a extensive operation 2 escape pods landed on the planet only a few days later it was roslyn and masaru earl s wife and other son that is were my story must end as there is yet so much more to see and do 10 10 would decimate the turkey population again update a lot of things have changed since this review my colony now has 15 colonists a nearby mine shaft got infested with alien insect thingys 2 colonists got married but it rained during the ceremony raiders continue to get tougher each day luckily my turrets and perimeter wall are still holding up 90 of the buildings in the colony are made out of plasteel a huge statue was erected in memory of ivo and earl celebrated his 60th birthday with all the research complete he can enjoy a happy retirement
