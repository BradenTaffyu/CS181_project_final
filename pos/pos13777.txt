2019 this is a well made realistic military simulator to an extent it is such a fun experience with friends in scenarios and multiplayer servers the bots in this game are horrible they see you 500 meters away with deadly accuracy on the main map while on the dlc map tanoa they see you through the jungle which is thick as you can imagine i ve had bots shoot and kill me only to find out they re able to do so through 3 bushes and a tree another thing that bugs me is with my i7 along with my 1080ti i only get about 25 30 fps on high settings i pity anyone who buys this game without a good op rig and expects to play it on anything except low medium there s way too many dlc s for things that should just be part of the game a dlc for a handful of snipers and scopes really
