2017 early access review the developer sums up the experience of this game perfectly on his site and it s worth quoting again originally posted by toplessgun i am making this game because this game needs to be made this is not made because this is fun game but because it is not so right from the off you should be aware that this game will require the patience of the god of thunder himself there is virtually nothing in the way of instant gratification sent your way every single finnish markka is hard earned by doing jobs in the septic truck or chopping firewood as is every tiny bit of bolt tightening progress you make with building the car where this differs from other games is how entertaining the developer has made the traditionally grindy process of making cash every time you venture out in a vehicle and leave the relative safety of your home in kesselinper you are putting your life in your hands if you don t manage to slide off the narrow dirt track and bury yourself into a pine tree then you have to run the gauntlet of playing chicken with a drunken lunatic in a little green fiat if you survive this and somehow make it to the paved highway you still run the risk of getting killed by an errant moose crashed into head on by the infamous techno viking or getting chased by the police for not stopping at a checkpoint and then when you finally arrive at your destination the odds are the store will be closed the mechanic doesn t work weekends you forgot your parts order back home you fall into a septic tank and die brutally unforgiving in every respect same goes for building the car miss tightening a bolt all the way on one part and all the others will gradually work loose as you drive my first build made it 200 metres down the road before the front left wheel fell off and took most of my suspension with it so i dragged it back to the garage with the tractor and tried again despite being so unforgiving and usually just giving up on games which treat the player with such disdain like i did with dark souls i found myself becoming obsessed with getting the car working properly passing the inspection in town and upgrading it to go rallying you find yourself forming a love hate relationship with the thing surely a feeling everyone who runs and maintains an old car irl can identify with so the developer s stated goal of realism at whatever cost has actually produced a game which creates an incredible feeling of achievement when something finally goes right for you it s the same buzz people talk about when they finally beat that boss in dark souls after hours of trying but in this game there s no memorizing of moves or anything like that just keeping yourself alive is an accomplishment the rest of the time you re free to enjoy the endless finnish summer using the sauna at the lake house visiting the pub or simply getting drunk on home made kilju and running amok around town once you add all your favourite music to the radio folder tinkering with the car in the garage becomes relaxing almost therapeutic you shouldn t start building with the intention of getting it finished as fast as possible so you can race this will probably end with you dying horribly later on it s more of a james may kind of simulator than a jeremy clarkson if you re someone who s willing to put time in to learn the controls 2 minutes watching a gameplay video is enough to give you the gist of what to do and who has an attention span longer than 10 minutes you will find this a very rewarding and hilarious game about life for a kid in 90 s finland there is a breathtaking amount of content and fun to be had for what is essentially a rough around the edges unity game still in early access oh and press n to swear you ll need that
