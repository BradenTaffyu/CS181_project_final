2018 this game is a breath of fresh air for colony survival sims and emotionally story driven games i play games like rimworld prison architect project zomboid they are billions the long dark dayz twom and darkest dungeon this game fits perfectly into the collection of very hard strategy colony rts games and adds a game that while a bit more scripted tells a very engaging story based on how you try to adapt i literally got exiled from my own city spoiler 6 hours before the final storm ended i was very frustrated but this is exactly the type of feeling i enjoy in these types of games struggle and survival in video games should feel like a very high risk vs reward just to keep existing in the world a balance must be maintained and if not any part or deficiency can cause a massive collapse frostpunk pulls this off pretty well imo i do wish there was an endless mode or that it continued after the final event since rebuilding in that situation is exactly the type of challange i m looking for as a survival games player it feels like a city builder on the surface like simcity yet all your people have needs and relationships like tropico and rimworld then there s the underlying story of your city where you send out scouts to see the ruined world and discover what has happened at a certain point in the game your people even start to break up into sub factions and bicker with each other visually the game is beautiful i feel cold watching my people trudge through snow that s as deep as they are tall there s frost that forms on the screen as the world gets colder you can actually watch each individual person go about their game it really helps you build emotional connection to the people you re trying to keep alive my only hope is that they do more with the game introduce a sandbox mode and keep adding to it as they go forward the potential here is amazing my only real complaint so far is how short the game is but for the price it was worth it
