2020 it s a shame that so many people will look past this game because of it s original bad reviews i was one of the many skeptical that this game would even be fun i wanna mention that i am a big fallout fan and that i will have bias when i am writing this review this game is good maybe even great i haven t played pre wastelanders but from what i ve heard and seen this game has improved a lot there is a lot of content in this game events main quests daily missions side quests random quests there is so much to do in this game this game is similar to fallout 4 with some quality of life improvements and lots of variety the core gameplay itself works flawlessly as a fallout fan and is even more fun with friends the map is huge and bustling with so many unique and interesting places to discover the graphics do not differ from fallout 4 but i don t mind it too much wastelanders has added an interesting story riddled with good character and unique quest segments the characters can seem a bit stupid sometimes but it s easy to look past that the bugs this game is absolutely littered with them it is easy to look past most of them but some of them can be a real pain in the ass and they can even be game breaking requiring restarting quests occasionally the endgame is too long of a grind to be interesting bethesda is greedy and will have micro transactions and small pay to win features cough fallout 1st cough and we can only hope that they will stop doing this the game seems to be improving and judging from 2020 s roadmap it will get even better one can only hope this game will get even better this game is a worth it for fallout fans and an interesting try for newcomers
