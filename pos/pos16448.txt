2017 early access review once upon a time no this is not the beginning of a fairy tale but for an old fart as yours truly it is going back in history like in a time machine it is absolutely amazing how realistic this game is for someone who actually has lived the 90s repairing a summer car with a friend back then in the finnish countryside although being a different make and model the car still exists and will be taken on the road again next summer the details are amazing from the makes and models of the car s yes even the makes and models of the ai cars are recognizable and historically accurate to the main groceries that were used back then beer saussages pizza beer saussages macaron box beer and saussages and yes we only had a few public radio stations which most of the time sent some blabla which really made no sense those stations still exist although having changed names and before someone asks yes back in the 90s when milk was still milk with real fat in it not this low fat lactose free sewage water you can buy today it really took rather out the hunger than the thirst there are basically only 4 cosmetic things i am missing teimo not offering korvapuusti with the coffee or porilainen like a hamburger but with grilled tasteless saussage instead of the burger the taste comes from the additional ingredients like ketchup mustard sliced pickles and onions and the kitchen missing the valurautapannu solid pan made of melted iron could be used as a weapon against mice rats and the neighbour and kuparinen kahvikannu traditional coffeepot made of copper which were always visible after having watched a series of live streams of this game made by a finnish person who really knows how to play it i had to buy this game although not being sure if this computer with only amd a8 and amd apu without dedicated memory would really run it but it does not high quality and with all settings of the game are the lowest but it runs even quite smoothly without many interruptions or hickups most of which are because of the missing vram i am very much looking forward what the developers come up with next this game s idea is absolutely brilliant i completely agree with the developer of this game he stated in some interview that it had to be made especially by someone who uses this degree of accuracy and love to detail as the developer behind amistech it gives a nostalgic feeling and brings up many good memories from back then thank you amistech you made an old guy extremely happy with this nostalgic trip back when the times were better ennen kaikki oli paremmin except that we did not have this game back then i have to admit this can lead to a so called eip s juupas type of discussion i e 2 persons using only the arguments yes and no also a finnish speciality so please fellow gamers feel free to jump on the time machine and travel back to a time when everything was better
