2016 early access review project zomboid is interesting and i recommend it but i m not sure i can recommend it to everyone the basic idea of the game is that it s a simulator that tries to accurately simulate surviving the zombie apocalypse in this regard it is uncompromising going as far as prioritising realistic as realistic as you can be with a zombie apocalypse scenario anyway and immersive mechanics over stuff that is actually y know strictly about making the game fun to play this results in a lot of features that are pretty cool in concept but can end up being frustrating in the context of the game itself with its sort of clunky strategic top down gameplay here are some examples of this enemy variety currently there s just human zombies no special zombies no animal zombies just human zombies with varying degrees of speed and strength this can get dull and coupled with the next feature mentioned in this list makes guns kind of not worth using since melee weapons deal with everything pretty well anything that makes loud noise attracts zombies as does any kind of noise in general no using the gun you spent ages looking for it s more dangerous than useful the game has a large featureset for building but building also means hauling around heavy objects that put you at max encumbrance meaning a lot of trips to and from the trees you re harvesting for wood skills level slowly progression can take what could be called a realistic amount of simulated time with it being possible to survive for months and years worth of ingame time zombie infection this is the big one being infected slowly but surely kills you and can result from one bite now all this isn t to say that the game isn t fun to play it is but it s the sort of game that appeals more to people who like slow strategic survival gameplay and anyone who wants a zombie apocalypse sim that prioritises attention to detail over all else and features possibly the most comprehensive persistent open world used in a zombie or survival game to date it s immersive detailed enough and has enough different mechanics to strategise around that it works extremely well as a vessel to play out your zombie apocalypse survival plans if you re the sort of nerd that daydreams about stuff like that however due to the controls and abstracted gameplay anyone expecting an actiony arcadey zombie survival game will end up disappointed
