2019 early access review i ve already played this game for over 40 hours and i ve loved every minute of it except for the crashing early on so here s my review for t a b s the good so far the good outweighs the bad massively some of the good things include maps units physics ai costumes funny bugs maps the maps are so detailed my favourite map so far is the ancient sandbox map the map is huge and every little thing is detailed from water to windows to ancient monuments every map has a unique personality to it such as hiding little secrets looking at you tribal maps the maps in this game are far better than the maps showcased in earlier versions 9 5 10 units there are so many units in this version of t a b s each unit has a different weapon and costume the amount of detail put into each unit is absurd the units in this game are far better than previous versions as they now have more than just a helmet and the sound of the units is amazing 9 10 physics ai the physics and ai in this game are so much more advanced than any other game the alpha versions had units just lunge at each other and friendly fire now units actually wind up fall over try to miss hitting their teammates and work together the ai is a bit buggy at times but it is understandable for such a physics based game 8 5 10 costumes holy crap the costumes have improved so much since the older versions great work to everyone working on them i m surprised how well the costumes stick to the unit and do not clip the uniforms are so detailed even the weapons look great some weapons have a few scratches that makes them look as if they have been used before i love these tiny details they give the game and the units a lot more personality and help them fit in with the style of this game 9 9 10 secrets unit creator new factions this is an update to the review the unit creator and new factions are absolutely amazing the amount of detail put into each new unit is incredible every unit has its own quirks and its weapons and clothing can be found in the unit creator to be used on other units i love the new secret units as well as you have to go on a fun scavenger hunt around the map to find these new units 10 10 funny bugs most people would consider bugs a negative but the bugs in this game work perfectly they fit in with the games wackiness and they are just plain amazing sometimes units freak out and die right before they attack another unit and sometimes units are stuck off the edges of cliffs and other units come and push them off the bugs in this game are absolutely hillairious and i wouldn t patch them even if i knew how 10 10 the bad honestly there isn t much to talk about in this category the only things that pop up are minor details so lets get into it lag hit detection in slow motion lag occasionally the game will lag if you decide to create a large scale battle this is a very minor issue though and doesn t really interfere with gameplay as it only really affects sandbox mode slow motion hit detection when in slow motion hits sometimes wont register properly leaving enemy units alive once again it s only a small issue and doesn t really affect gameplay unless you are in sandbox mode using slow motion to stop the lag from huge battles edit the hit detection has been fixed meaning that this is no longer a con of the game conclusion overall t a b s is my personal favourite game of all time and i m excited to see where it goes in the future there are a few bugs but most of them give the game personality and add to its wackiness i highly recommend this game to anyone looking for great games on steam if i had to rate it out of 10 i d give it 11 10 thanks for reading this review hope it helps you
