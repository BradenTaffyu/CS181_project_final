2020 this game is all about systems engineering it seems innocent with its cartoon style graphics and hilarious animations i ve never laughed so hard watching a duplicant begrudgingly clean an outhouse but is deceptively complex and frankly pretty damn hard bordering on total frustration sometimes if you are looking for a challenge and enjoy problem solving games definitely for you if you are looking for a chill experience probably not the first game on your list to purchase you will kill your duplicants and wipe many many many times learning how all the parts of the game work with each other just mentally accept this in fact i m not big on tutorials because they ruin the fun of learning about the game but i d encourage you to watch a few before even attempting to start a playthrough of oni whether that is not paying attention to germs getting into your water supply and your dupes all being unable to work because they now all have food poisoning slowly cooking them all in their underground prison because you can t find a way to deal with heat buildup or running out of resources to generate o2 and watching everybody suffocate i ve played about 100 hrs and i m still unable to hit a mid game phase the learning curve is quite steep still keli makes stellar games and for what this game has in difficultly it also has in polish the game is virtually bug free something you don t see much of in modern games that are rushed through dev cycles the art style animation music and overall vibe is brilliantly put together it does feel very rewarding finally seeing a big technology project or upgrade finally come together as you push your way to the surface as mentioned previously the complexity is great this game has fantastic depth you will continue to discover new ways to tweak and optimize even as a seasoned player whether that comes from synergy with various traits of individual dupes room planning bonuses etc my only request is an idiot difficulty mode for people like me that need some extra help completing their first run to the surface also due the fact that you will die many times you will also restart the early game many times and after a bit this can lead to some burnout as you set up your inital power and sanitation system for the nth time while you try to dig your way to a cold biome before everybody is slow cooked by surrounding hot biomes you will ask yourself if its ever possible to win my only complaints rating 8 5 10 great game
