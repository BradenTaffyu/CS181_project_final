2014 early access review seriously this game is the type of multiplayer support i ve been looking for on a lot of popular games you got minecraft gmod civ 5 etc where all their multiplayers are only usable if you have the patience to deal with the annoying crap they give you this all this takes is a click of a button and you have a server where all you re friends can join and screw around and as far as i can tell it s lag free i think it s worth the 5 since you get 2 copies and the fact of how amazing this thing works also giving money to them isn t that bad since i do wish to see this worked on and expanded 11 10 m8 would starve again
