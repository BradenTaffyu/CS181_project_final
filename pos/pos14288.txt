2022 early access review this game was an absolute gem and privilege to experience a must play for anyone with a passion for engineering or optimization i was a big fan of satisfactory but this improves on that formula in several ways 1 when hand crarfting things it will automatically hand craft any sub components for you rather than forcing you to create them one at a time yourself 2 later in the game you unlock planetary and interplanetary hubs which significantly clean up your supply line designs you no longer have to chain together more and more complex things you can isolate all of your productions and keep everything nice and encapsulated but keep in mind this doesn t unlock until about the midgame so if you find your builds difficult to maintain keep pushing until you unlock this and everything will get easier i m a bit more mixed about the dyson sphere aspect of the game it takes a very long time to build a full dyson sphere and the energy output isn t all that amazing by the time you can build it you don t really need it that being said it s a beautiful and even mesmerizing sight to watch your ships and solar sails fly towards the star and construct this massive structure around it for me this is one of those games i ll always remember fondly as one of the best of all time thank you to the developers for creating this masterpiece 10 10
