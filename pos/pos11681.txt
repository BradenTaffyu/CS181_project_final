2018 early access review the bulk of my hours reside on console but i have enjoyed every minute of the pc version i don t have a gaming computer at all but i can still play for the majority of the time the pc version beats out the console version in a long stride mostly due to the console version require restarts every hour or so for a lot of these comments about the devs have abandoned the game are completely baseless information a lot of the information is released via twitter youtube and their website if you don t like their content after the first few hours of gameplay and you still can get a refund then do so the best part is the devs encourage modding of their game to enhance your gameplay there are several fantastic mods out there if you don t like my opinion then keep on moving edit i have basically stopped playing this game it has turned more into a dungeon crawler type of game when i last played yes you still need to survive loot trade and scavenge but it has become less like what i originally played this game for and more eh
