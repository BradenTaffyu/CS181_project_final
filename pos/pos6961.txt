2023 i have fun with raft and even though i completed the story i find myself going back to that awe so satisfying desire to get as many achievements that i can when i first started raft i found myself getting annoyed with the inability to find rocks that by the end i had a whole chest full of them raft defiantly has some work and grind you have to put into it but its worth it to me the best games are just that that something that appears difficult at first becomes easier in the end beside that 50 kill on the angler fish achievement that i am more than determined to get i more than recommend raft for people who like survival building games to wonderful art this is for you
