2022 early access review a card game where you can t buy booster packs what sorcery is this ben brode is behind this which was the game director in early days of hearthstone super fast fun and easy to learn with some strategy involved cool snap mechanic where you basically gamble to double your progress in rank if you win or lose that much if you lose something like poker you can bluff you have a good hand you unlock more cards just by playing and upgrading visually your current ones this motivates you to play with different cards just to upgrade them which leads to some cool variety decks you can buy card variants with money from the shop which is just different art for you current cards and credits which let s you upgrade cards more often personally i believe the daily and weekly rewards along with free rewards from season pass are enough to keep you going some people might want to get every single card in the game asap then you gotta pay you only face opponents in your current unlock state though called card pool so you don t feel overwhelmed as a free to play player i highly recommend this if you like card games or even if you are just a marvel fan some missing features and some problems with ui here and there but it s stll early access nothing that can t be fixed give it a try and see for yourself just don t forget to link your steam account with an email even if you don t play on mobile cause you lose your progress if something happens with your game files happy snapping
