2016 early access review this game is addictive after close to 20 hours in game i had learned to drive pretty well i earned money delivering firewood and emptying sewage i learned that some settings reset during save and reload i learned to always mind my fatique and keep food beer tools and extra gas diesel with me wherever i went i learned not to answer the phone during a thunder storm i got confident and started a new game with permadeath on it started well i had the car put together engine was running well this time i had adjusted everything correctly but there was one thing i had not tried to drive my drunk friend home from the bar it was dark i drove my van in the highway switching off highbeams as oncoming cars drove past me as i was approaching town there were one more set of headlights coming at me about 50 meters the truck veered sharply into my lane straight into my lights i tried to evade to the right but could not prevent head on collision instant death why why did he want to kill me was it the beer truck with a drunk driver i m starting from the beginning again will not use the highway at night
