2019 total war rome ii the worst launch i ve ever seen and still it has managed to become the best historical total war game on the market throughout the years if you are new to the franchise then this is the game to start with it s simply the most stable entry in the series and has something for every kind of player if you are a total war veteran but has stayed away from this game due to how it launched then i can tell you with a hand on my heart that the game has improved by leagues it s no longer a buggy unfinished and uninspired mess like it used to be some of the newer campaigns are some of the best total war experiences you can have people don t like the idea that the game has the same price today as when it was launched but to me it makes sense because the game has been in deep development for all these years they are still releasing entire overhauls of the game because the developers are dead set on making rome 2 the definitive total war experience some say that we shouldn t forget and forgive ca for how they launched the game and i agree don t preorder games from ca but you have to award good results ca didn t drop the game after the dumpster fire that was the launch but instead turned it around and made the game the best it could be long story short rome 2 has become the game we deserve if you have stayed away from it for various reasons now is the time to get it
