2018 i am a real life hunter but guess what time to go hunting is limited and there are such things as bag limits closed seasons work wife dog that limit your actual opportunities since around 2000 i ve been playing hunting games the old deer hunter series especially the 1 3 come to mind after deer hunter 4 the hunting games became more and more arcade like there was nothing around to play enter call of the wild it blew my mind it is all deer hunter or big game hunter wanted to be and then some the scenery is amazing the details awesome the animals behave mostly as they should though sometimes a seriously wounded animal flees uphill or teleports who knows where but those are minor glitches sure i would love a pause button or to be able to save a session but there are workarounds for that i bought the tents and later on the medved expansion which is great i believe the realism in the game is well balanced so though quite realistic it is also fun to play come on who wants to wait eight hours in a blind for a deer to come out outside of real hunting who has the time i would love to have more weapons to choose from but that is minor for anyone who wants a serious simulation that is also entertaining this is a no brainer buy this game
