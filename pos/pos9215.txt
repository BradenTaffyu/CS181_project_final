2018 stellaris in 2018 is a unique and innovative rts experience the game has been lovingly re balanced over the last two years to create a challenging but fair flow the game s story engine has also received attention adding a natural and immersive story to every play through of the game unfortunately paradox have gone a little dlc mad in the last few years with this game and others while most of the content packs are irrelevant to new players and not having them will not remove from the game play i would consider stellaris utopia and stellaris leviathans story pack vital to getting the full game experience this brings the total cost to 70 european region at time of review at this price it is still a rewarding game and highly recommended
