2016 commonwealth is no different than others all is lost and destroyed war war never changes first i would like to talk about cons not much to do in main quests and it doesn t have a good storyline characters doesn t feel alive and nothing interesting about their backstory because they don t have one our protagonist can t be bad by your decisions in dialogues because there is no option to do so you always have to be the savior of the commonwealth rpg elements well we are missing them you got 4 options in dialogue but it doesn t effect any relations between you and the person pros exploring is perfect as any other fallout game areas are well designed and lot less waiting at the loading screen if you don t have mods ofcourse side quests are well made but some of them are hard to find weapons ah the weapons are quite good and the option to modify it is perfect lots of options to choose idea of making your own settlement is very good but there is not much to craft for your settlers to live but sssssh in the nexus mods you can download tons of new stuff to craft for your settlers combat feels real and with the survival difficulty it s a blast game has the base contents that could have been much better if bethesda hadn t relied on the modders it s not perfect but we always have the mods to make this game better 7 10 base game 10 10 with mods
