2018 recommended at any price you will want to have a controller one of the best most compelling games i have ever played ignore the hype this game is not as difficult as you ve heard what it is is extremely unforgiving with almost no margin for error it has a steep learning curve and treating this like a standard hackey slashey will get you killed very quickly and those deaths may cause ragequits but the game is never actually unfair it is merely extremely unforgiving you ll get better and as you get better the game will get easier because you ve become so much better at it and other games will feel lesser
