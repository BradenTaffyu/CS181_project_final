2021 i am the stereotypical woman who knows absolutely nothing about cars if you ask me to check my oil i ll have a panic attack because i don t remember where the little stick is i take my car in for a yearly checkup and they can take care of all that stuff i have just spent an excruciating amount of time trying to find out why a car makes constant banging sounds only to discover that the rusty parts that were eluding me were little round things called rubber bushings i m only a few story missions in so i don t know what a rubber bushing is yet but i will not cheat and google it hopefully my journey will eventually lead me to the answer i bought this game because i like simulators and wanted to learn more about cars sine they re such an important part of our lives it s a big challenge from the start if you don t know anything about cars but i wholeheartedly recommended it it feels damn good when you figure something out and hey i m 99 sure i can check my oil in rl now
