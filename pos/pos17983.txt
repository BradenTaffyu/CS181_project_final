2018 rome ii while not my personal favorite is now one of the best games in the long history of the total war series rome ii s extremely wide scope and breadth further enhanced by the availability of free and dlc campaigns that cater to specific moments in antiquity provide something of interest for everyone it s also the only total war where your queen regnant can lead her amazon warriors from the steppes of scythia on the field of battle which is a significant plus in my opinion i bought rome ii within a few days of launch at the time this title was slagged not unreasonably for being obviously incomplete and without the rich character of rome i medieval ii and shogun ii for example at release the painfully unfinished political system was lacking something as basic as a family tree members of your political dynasty more or less popped out of the aether with no relationship to each other rome ii has surprisingly benefited from years of continual post launch attention and over the course of many content updates it has been fleshed out so well it is at times hard to recognize the same game consider the earlier problem of the missing family tree now you not only have a family tree but the other nobles form parties with specific agendas with their own shifting regional bases of power in your territories even in its worst state rome ii introduced innovations in total war s strategic layer that i can only applaud and i hope remain the template of the series going forward for what it s worth it certainly seems that this is the path ca is taking in the future perhaps one of the most obvious changes compared to previous tw entries was the consolidation of army recruitment and management into individual standing armies or fleets or stacks in 4x terminology which recruited units directly rather than units being recruited in towns and cities individually and then consolidated into armies the number of armies is limited by the size of one s empire the change couldn t have been better for the series it minimized the mopping up of enemy micro stacks and encourage epic battles even in the mid late game phases of a campaign in the process of consolidating the recruitment of armies into a number of stacks that scaled with the size of your empire overall the series could no longer simply spawn family members on the field the moment they reached adulthood additionally the old system was wholly unsuited for the republican politics that were important for several major factions not the least the very namesake of the game enter one of the biggest changes to the series family members and rivals from competing families now hung out at an abstract central court from which they could intrigue against each other be appointed for special missions and be assigned to lead armies as generals the result is that there is now one has the real sense of politics and warfare joining together in a seamless whole in a historically authentic way you are now conscious of the growing fame of generals from rival families manipulating important appointments to keep a grasp on power without driving your rivals to rebel hurriedly sending your best generals regardless of factional loyalty to take charge of garrison armies when a previously quiet front is invaded together the result is one of the greatest leaps forward in authenticity and engaging mechanics the series has made to date many of the core problems that still remain are ones which the warscape engine has had since it was developed for empire and which will probably never be solved until ca has the time and resources to catapult forward to a new engine entirely for example the rear ranks of charging infantry formations squish forward when the first rank makes contact which never looks quite right if you do choose to buy the game you may be wondering which dlcs are worth buying that answer is very simple and also entirely personal buy whatever interests you core mechanics native to dlc campaigns were patched into the grand campaign with free content patches that accompanied their releases and dlc factions still have their unique units as enemies or allies so there is no obligation to buy any campaign or faction dlc that does not interest you i strongly recommend you use a four turns per year mod if nothing else it can be difficult to get attached to any of your characters due to how quickly old age catches up with them in the vanilla experience this is an honor that belongs to atilla and shogun 2 s fall of the samurai campaign
