2020 edit updates detailed in comments there s a lot to say about fallout 76 i should start with the fact that i completely misunderstood it until i played it fallout 76 is not a normal mmo it is really an expansion to fallout 4 with a new map and an always active online co op mode it is much closer to 12 other goofballs playing fallout 4 at the same time as you than any classic mmo in fact you could do most of this game and never notice you re online except for the standard bethesda glitches being multiplied by an online framework you re still wasteland garbage collecting but the engines all feel a little tighter the loot is leveled but unlike most western rpgs the power scale isn t too bad enemy health bars never feel too long unless you are totally undergeared if you play smart you can sometimes get away with blasting stuff outside of your level the gunplay from fo4 for better and for worse is here the ragdolls and gore are satisfying and the weapons feel as good as they can for shooting into enemy health bars but it s still bethesda fallout so there is almost no meaningful player skill component and most fights still come down to you being able to tank hitscan damage and munch stimpaks and should you die there is literally no penalty you simply respawn and go grab your loot a few bosses make some serious effort at trying to feel like a real game with attacks you can dodge but they are few and far between unfortunately the game has the irritating habit of staggering you when you take any meaningful amount of damage when you are at low health you can get staggered two or three times in a row interrupting healing movement and reloading it is a terrible mechanic that even further removes skill from the game but if you have been playing bethesda games this long you have to take the good with the badfallout veterans have long complained bethesda took the lore of fallout and gutted it to serve as an aesthetic for wasteland garbage collection and those folks are still vindicated here the whole game feels a lot like bethesda just realized nobody was finishing their tes fo games and just made this one without an ending the base game s story revolves around everyone being dead and having automated their lifes work with robots and audio logs so you can iterate through their issues without talking to anyone this works for half the game juxtaposing do gooders plans to help the wasteland next to their charred corpses and ruined dreams note well for all my talk there is a lot of writing here to back some of this up bethesda did not just phone this story in there are a ridiculous amount of computer text and audio logs in this game the plot goes off the rails when you meet a robot harley quinn and from there until the end of the game it just feels like you re fast travelling around to stuff you ve already cleared when you were enjoying the exploration to grab pointless macguffin trash nobody asks you to kill 30 chickens thankfully but this crap is just as bad mercifully it rebounds with two real good dungeons at the end but that s still quite a time to wait for a good level by the end you ve pinballed your way to the enclave and bos for no reason but not actually done anything but just opened endgame boss fights forever note they achieve a mostly corpse filled wasteland by writing in a zombie virus but you need not worry too much they re not trying to be modern zombie garbage mercifully this game still has the spirit and earnestness of fallout at least bethesda s flavor that said the current update actually adds npcs to the game and as a sign of bethesda s love for the game some pointless npcs into the previously voice logs only story just for flavor they care about this story as awkward as it is and i can t take that away from them and the npcs have a slightly better questline that again doesn t really have an ending but introduces more endgame grind once you re done for all i said bethesda cares about this game they managed to make faction npc grind into teams of settlers and raiders which so boring and mismatched as to be borderline malpractice i sincerely hope the five or six dudes at bethesda who cared about this story ground their teeth down to the nub at this awful management forcing of this crap factions also this story kills off in a really unceremonious manner the most interesting side character in the whole game i felt cheated when i saw it happen so cheaply i could have blinked and missed it that having been said some of the quests here have some neat dungeons and gimmicks there are a few pointless special stat checks and you aren t granted much freedom of options hell most dialogue options are just you being a whiny jerk for no reason but they still manage to be engaging of course if you don t care about the story fo76 makes good on just having lots of stuff to explore or see just like fo4 the world map is excellent with some slightly more video gamey biomes and some excellent use of color in the environments you ll use the photo mode quite a lot to be sure as the game is packed with beautiful stuff to see it also makes good on the multiplayer component by periodically having co op events the game will announce an event and everyone may fast travel to it for free to join in most of these are just short 10 minute shootouts and they remain quite fun as something you can always do if you get bored of the exploration and want a little fast action and fast loot one thing that didn t make it in from fallout 4 was the settlement building here building is just restricted to your camp a portable home and fast travel point you can deploy anywhere on the map within reason while mostly this functions as a base to store extra junk and throw up vending machines to sell stuff you don t need the amount of cosmetics both in the game and in the in game atom shop is considerable building and customizing your camp is fun whether you just want to throw down a few crafting stations and get on with it or if you want to build an elaborate houseboat on the lake once you clear the story though the endgame grind is atrocious you can launch nukes to summon the same boss over and over which is interesting enough the first couple of times but the faction and endgame currency grind involves you repeating the exact same fast travel here shoot x return with y mission twice a day every day forever this is utterly criminal sure you probably got 80 hours of loot and shoot content before getting here but you also didn t get an ending twice so i ll cry foul fallout 76 is better than everyone says it is but at the same time almost everyone who says something bad about it is still correct the shooting and looting is there there is good content worth experiencing but there is plenty of terrible fetch quests and even more bugs too if you want a fallout 4 experience with fewer people to talk to and less stuff between you and exploring ruins to collect garbage and more quick instanced shootouts played in coop fallout 76 will fit the bill but it s still a bethesda product so every interesting thing is accompanied by a boring thing an awful thing and a buggy thing and if you re still mad about the jump from fo1 2 to 3 let me twist the knife i joined the enclave in this game entirely by accident that having been said for all the flaws fo76 s story is still far more respectful to fallout than disney was to star wars in fact this game is so earnest it feels like a breath of fresh air compared to so many game stories that just want to tear everything down bethesda likes fallout and wants to do right by it i think also there is a battle royale mode i have not talked about it there is are several good reasons for that and you should pretend it doesn t exist yourself
