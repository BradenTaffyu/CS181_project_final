2019 its a fun game i really like it but there are something that almost ruins it my number 1 complaint is the people in the game its a city building sim and you need to help your people survive in temperatures below 130 c the world has gone to everyone is dead and you and a generator is the only hope for humanity you would think that people would be happy or grateful for being alive but noooooo soup id rather starve working more than 12 hour shifts to keep the colony alive you tyrant id rather freeze to death on my free time make the children pick up wood you are worse than hitler our children should stay inside playing gameboy my house doesnt hold 30 degrees inside while its below 100 c outside id rather leave and walk back to london these are just some of the problems youll have to face as the overseer of this colony of ungrateful that think they could do everything so much better than you theyll even string you up if you dont give them steaks daily or if they have to not steal wood oh and people wont work if they have a slight cold theyd rather watch humanity die other than this its a fantastic game thats both entertaining and challenging at the same time
