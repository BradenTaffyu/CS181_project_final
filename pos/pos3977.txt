2019 slay the spire is somehow the apotheosis of the genre where it inspired many copies before i bought it i figured it probably wasn t much different better than monster slayers guild of dungeoneers or various other card battle games right wrong somehow sts manages a perfect blend of roguelike randomness and predictability to the point where when i die i rarely feel like it was completely unfair i should have had more block in my deck needed to kill that enemy faster should have saved some potions for the boss shouldn t have been so stingy with potions earlier so i d have more hp now etc the variety of cards enemies that all tell you what they plan to do vast plethora of interesting relics random adventures and of course the slowly unfolding underlying frametale all combine into something that s every bit as compelling as everyone was saying very strong recommendation for anyone with any sort of interest in the genre edit years on i still go back to this game occasionally to do a few runs it s just that good
