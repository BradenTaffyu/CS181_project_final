2015 this feels like skyrim meets fallout 3 with better graphics and story everything is closer together so the world isn t huge like previous fallout s i ve already almost hit 60 hours to hit the 1 per hour guideline i like this game yes to me it s worth the money and when the countless mods come out for it some tips you re going to want to know to get out of your power armor hold default e to throw a nade hold your bash key default left alt when you hear a click release settlers will use and bandits will steal your power armor so remove the power core so they can t do that you can use your pip boy as a flash light by holding default tab which will illuminate the area this reduces stealth do the same to turn it off when building your settlements you don t have to go to the workbench everytime you want to scrap or build assign people you can hold i think it s default mouse 3 whatever key workbench is assigned to you can move things you ve built are built you mouse over them and hit default e and move them last important thing mods even if you don t have any points in gun nut if you find a gun with good mods but crappy other stuff you can put a standard mod in that slot it will put that good mod you just replaced in your inventory and you can put the good mod into another gun enjoy
