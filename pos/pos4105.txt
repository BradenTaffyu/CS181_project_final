2017 early access review probably the best way to describe slay the spire is by calling it a procedurally generated roguelite card game with a heavy emphasis on drafting and deck building the game starts with you having access to only one class the ironclad a mixture between a warrior berserker and demon knight you later get access to another class the silent essentially your rogue assassin type character there are plans to release a third class eventually i haven t researched this but i would presume it would likely end up being some sort of mage or wizard there are three stages which have you navigate through a series of event nodes ala ftl or other similar games mega crit manages this in an interesting way though in that they allow you to see the full map at the start of each stage but only the basics here s a basic monster fight here s an elite monster here s a shop here s something more secret this allows you to strategize and plan ahead to mitigate rng and balance the risk vs reward of each of the paths this is something i personally greatly appreciate combat is surprisingly deep for an early access title and even if it didn t evolve an increble amount into release and only added class es and random events it would be more than adequate for a budget title both you and the enemy can manipulate battles in various ways and strategy is definitely rewarded over just playing what you can afford and ignoring card effects and enemy abilities enemies have various interesting abilities especially bosses who can have various effects that can punish you for playing too many cards dilute your deck with cards that have various negative effects or just take up your draws or that become ever more powerful as the battle goes on thus punishing slower decks deck building is handled in an interesting way in that for every basic monster encounter rewards you with various goods but also a choice of 1 of 3 class cards at the end of battle there is nuance in how you should approach this though as a bigger deck isn t always better each turn you draw a new hand of cards and when your turn is over you discard any cards you didn t play what this means is you draw through your entire deck very quickly sometimes and when you have finished drawing through your deck your discard pile gets reshuffled into your deck this leads to interesting deckbuilding as you choose a card not only based on if it fits into a current or future strategy but also based on the fact that it ll cause you to be less likely to draw every other card in your deck multiple times the make up of your deck can be small and focused large and diversified and everything in between one of my silent runs made hearthstones miracle rogue decks look incredibly tame in comparison as a small side note while you can t carry over any aspects of one of your completed runs over into the next there is some run to run progression via card unlocks which can then appear in future runs this adds variety but may make getting specific combos trickier in the future pros deck building strategy and intelligent play are rewarded and boy does it feel good aesthetic suits the game very well and beside a few missteps here and there which feel out of place corpse explosion rest screen as well as a few other examples it looks damn good the game already has rather good replayability and could easily be improved exponentially with just a few additions some of which are already planned such as the additional character with a few more stages as well as more relic and card additions this is the kind of game i could see myself playing a few times a week for the next few years if not more right now it is slightly more barebones but as an early access title that is expected meh music isn t awful but it could definitely be better i haven t gotten to the point of muting it yet but some of the loops especially the one for the main menu are beginning to grate this is coming from someone who doesn t really mute music in games too hopefully this gets some love as time goes on current ui both for the main menu as well as in game isn t bad but could definitely use some improvement cons the game is too easy i m sure some will argue this point but i won my first playthrough and am sitting at a 6w 4l record some of the losses were potentially winnable but i bailed on due to frustrating rng likely if i played through the two runs i bailed on i could have at least one more win this coming from someone who s only knowledge and frame of reference for the game is the first two episodes of northernlion s lp and this being a roguelite deckbuilder convinces me the game is too easy maybe as i unlock more cards it ll add to the difficulty as i won t be able to achieve the combos i want as easily but if so then it s annoying that the difficulty increase is going to be tied to watering down the card pool as opposed to a traditional difficulty increase despite the game being too easy there are also some questionable decisions surrounding the difficulty two examples off the top of my head if you don t make it to the first boss during a run you miss out on the bonus choices at the start of your next run added via three random choices this seems to be a decision made to combat people rerolling into op starts but this is short sighted as this a single player non competitive game who cares if someone is cheesing it this also creates a situation where good players gain additional power every run when they likely don t need it and those doing really poorly are punished when they likely need the help the most a second example would be encountering a first stage first fight thief where given poor enough draws you can reach a situation where if you don t play overly aggressive and lose 40 hp or more you can risk losing half your starting gold when he runs away as a final warning if you dislike any form or facet of rng impacting your chance of winning or losing this isn t the game for you it is a roguelite card game and at its heart that means there will be variance however i found games like binding of isaac rebirth to be much more frustrating when it came to rng and if you were good at it you could win most runs i expect this to be similar i fully recommend this game and am eagerly anticipating further content updates and even dlc in the far future as long as it s worthwhile and content updates get pushed until then
