2020 humble farming simulator stardew valley is taking steam by storm right now and when you consider the charm depth and number of cuties you can smooch within the game it s no surprise why seriously i ve spent 28 hours in the game already and i ve only had it for like 4 days i have to force myself to stop playing lest i become too caught up in the just one more day trap there s always something more to do be it tending to your crops fishing chatting villagers up or diving deeper into the mines to find loot and kill monsters despite all the comparisons to harvest moon you can actually do way more than just farm it reminds me a lot of starbound in terms of its crafting combat and exploration actually better yet the town itself seems to be full of mystery too this far in i still haven t unlocked all the areas on the map yet nor have i come anywhere close to seeing all there is to see i m obsessed the rest of steam is too right now stardew valley is sitting on an overwhelmingly positive user review score users aren t just citing the gameplay here though they re also pretty impressed that a game as massive as stardew valley could have been made by a single person developer concernedape honestly people seem to have nothing but good things to say about the game
