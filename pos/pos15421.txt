2015 early access review you kick your feet up peacefully the roaring fire glistens in your eyeballs and a warmth encompasses you not only physically but mentally you ve made it through the hard part after all right those silly spiders and frogs couldn t keep you down then you hear it feintly echoing over the empty plains barking what s that you think worrying you ve faced wolves before killed them even but these seem different as you reach for the spear to your side you hear the beating footsteps of the pack drumming their way up towards the light you tighten your grip around the spear you are prepared except you really weren t dogs jump from all angles towards you salivating hungering desperate for a bite you slash and spin killing a few as you go but there s a different one a red one it runs over and in a second one single moment everything is set ablaze you watch as your chests farms machines and walls are burnt to a cinder in a flash of time in your shock and awe the red dog takes you in his jaws ferrying you into the darkness your body being devoured simply observes your creation as it is reduced to ash a new day a new chance you push through the first 29 days in this hell you ve made quite the home for yourself and look at that not even the fire dogs could stop you now another victory you yell as your friends lift their meatballs in the air for you all you revel in the moonlight basking in the greatness that you re all responsible for a bird cage farms bushes fridges you re advanced now you re self sufficient proud survivors everything is brilliant not even the biting cold of winter can stomp the burning passion you re all feeling but then as you sit to enjoy a moments peace the serenity is disturbed a tremor a single shake in the ground followed by a monstrous roar the team pause confused suddenly before you know it another is unleashed you all look to eachother for answers but no answers can help now in the corner of your eye you see it reflecting from the dancing embers of your campfire there is an iris floating high above the ground another tremor rattles the team and the body of the creature is exposed a single eye antlers a fur coat and the will to destroy time slows down you observe your heroic friends leap towards the creature as it swipes the ground eviscerating them your friends fall to the floor lascerated with gaping wounds blood shoots from their oozing injuries and the creature laughs turning its attention to your happiness your creation it stomps on the bird cages uproots the farms and defecates on your berry bushes before crushing them inbetween its hand as the manure seeps between its ghastly fingers it s eyeball finds its way to you it stares at you dropping the pooey bushes you close your eyes drop your clothing and assume the necessary position for what is to follow you don t quite survive that winter
