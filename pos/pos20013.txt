2020 can t say much more than has already been said there is a reason people are still playing this game years after its release story rich and with a little mod tlc it can be very pretty check out gopher s videos for the modding on youtube if you ve never done it before truly this is my favorite of the fallouts i ve spent countless hours wandering the mojave and i love how the game makes me pause to think about my decisions and what kind of courier i want to be it s not often that i go back to a game and retry endings it s just not my style but i couldn t help but want to stick it to mr house in the end and before that i found multiple and creative ways to do away with benny that bastard i also got attached to goodsprings and felt like it was home anywho i digress get out there and get wanderin
