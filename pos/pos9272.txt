2016 i haven t played many grand strategy games or even turn based games civ5 so i was a little bit hesitated about getting stellaris but after reading some good postive reviews i finaly decide to jump on the train and see what s it all about it s suprisely very approachable even if you never really played games like stellaris the game is pretty in depth and the combat is fun i always been much of a multiplayer guy so i really love how the game packs out during multiplayer some people turn their backs against humanity while others seek alliances sure there are a few issues with the game which i am sure paradox is working on it issues like joining multiplayer games some ingame mechanics tweaks sectors front posts don t drawn influence etc overall i do recommend this game for anyone out there looking for a new addiction milad
