the game is good funny it has a bit for everyone from casual players up to so called try harder races are meh mostly frustrating my whole problem is with ai and abit unfair policy of the company it self you see i bought the game here kinda played it well over 4k hours on diffrent platforms and after 2 years they decided you we wont let you play the game you paid just becouse you live in a country we dont like this is not the right way to treat your coustumers xbox games
