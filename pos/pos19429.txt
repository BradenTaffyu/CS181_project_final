2021 people say this is the best fallout game ever made to be honest before this game i only finished fallout 4 and i really enjoyed it i m not a stranger to bethesda games skyrim is my favorite game of all games i really loved oblivion and dishonored and now the time has come this is the time to play fallout new vegas first of all i have to admit that i was really bored at the beginning it was really slow but then when you start to discover you can t stop for me main quests were really well written side quests were amazing and the roleplaying was just wow you can feel the effect your choices make and sometimes they are really critical the end of the game is completely created by your decisions if you are going to buy this game you have to buy with dlc s i played the dlc s with this order first i became 25 lvl then i played dead money dlc then i became like 30 35 lvl and played honest hearts dlc then old world blues and then before the last quest of the game i ve played lonesome road you can play this with this order they are really brilliant mysterious well written sometimes scary and dark and enjoyable 9 5 10
