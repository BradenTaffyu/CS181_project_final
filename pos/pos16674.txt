2019 early access review this game is amazing pros not like any other game lots of fun content including loads quests easy to mod lots of guides and tutorials online hours of fun includes wheel supportcons not for a beginner watch some youtube videos to see if this game is for you difficult in the beginning the survival aspect can be annoying or difficult at times when you die you respawn at a graveyard this annoying if you don t have mods because if you don t have a vehicle there you have to walk home can be broken at times but that is because it is in early access updates are not frequent sometimes taking over 3 to 4 months to be released or to be confirmed if you want a game that is going to different from every game get this
