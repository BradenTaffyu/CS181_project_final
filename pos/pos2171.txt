pros great custom building combat is fun and infinitely varied depending on your build not so grindy that you beating you head against the wall to get one part performance is great caters heavily towards gundam fans and mech fans can t stress how good the custom building is cons story is meh ended up skipping most of it graphics are a tad dated parts clipping is to be expected but on multiple suits using parts that were designed for that suit there was major clipping or parts were so far off they couldn t even be adjusted into position price point might be a tad high for casual fans buildersall in all i love the game if you like to customize mechs its worth the price of admission alone if you re a casual fan just looking for a beat em up i might wait for a sale
