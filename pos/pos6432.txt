2014 top notch truck driving simulator with support for trackir wheels and pedals this game has become a gem of the simulation genre before having tried it it s hard to see why this game will be so addicting i suspect much of that feeling comes from the progression from a lowly truck driver not even owning a truck to a multi country logistics company owning a hundred trucks and employing as many drivers you level up various skills which improve the rewards you get from certain types of deliveries or open up more jobs such as longer distances or different categories of dangerous cargo driving the trucks is a pleasure it s surprisingly therapeutic driving from city to city obeying the road rules rather than smashing things up like a madman that said if you disable the speed limiter in options 90kph you can get a bit crazy getting as high as 150kph on some routes a bit of a thrill considering the cargo you have in tow speed cameras will become your enemy though unfortunately the ai of the other traffic can at times frustrate in some instances such as in underpasses under freeways you can find intersections where the cars always fail to give way probably because the intersection was not programmed correctly don t get me started on the kamikaze ai at roundabouts either in any case this is the most fun you can have driving a truck in a game having a controller or steering wheel would be highly recommended and if you have head tracking equipment it s icing on the cake
