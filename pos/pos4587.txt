2019 one of the most iconic medieval games ever released on pc the amount of longevity this game has almost 10 years after release just shows how good it is with 6 000 10 000 players still playing daily the amount of modding content is truly incredible while this game still has its flaws its so easy to burn many hours into it the native campaign is very drawn out and time consuming especially if you are going for conquering all of caldaria with your own faction with the same type of repetitive battles fortunately the battles are fun and satisfying to play the siege battles are not as enjoyable your units are forced to go into a tight chokepoint to take over the enemy castle making overtaking the castle long and boring with the same gameplay over and over there are certainly some balance issues as well with certain unit types or factions feeling too good or very bottom tier while i m ok with some factions being underpowered when you can just spam swadian knights and win everything it starts to take away from the game i d recommend using the floris mod instead of playing the native mode
