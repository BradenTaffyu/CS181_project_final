2022 come boy yes sir this is how you address the fatheranother playstation exclusive on pc how cool is that finally sony started using their brain and realized they re gonna get more money by making their game available elsewhere duh i ve played previous three games and in my opinion this is one of the worst ones but by saying that i don t mean it s a bad game it s actually a good aaa game sony is one of the very few publishers who is still releasing quality aaa games so this time kratos is not alone he has a son atreus and they venture forth to release mother s ashes on their way they meet a lot of monsters and some characters some of them being funny af i usually don t talk about the story much because i don t like spoilers at all but the story isn t anything to remember just a simple generic story why is it one of the worst god of war games you ask well i m used to fight big threatening monsters titans or wide variety of mythical creatures here you won t find them besides enemy design is as generic as it could be you get to fight only few enemies through the whole game to give it more variety and pretend that the game has many types of monster to beat developers just changed colors of the enemies there s zero variety you ll be fighting same enemies for the whole game except bosses it s just lazy design besides the game is based on norse mythology this time so of course expect trolls which all are the same of course there are valkyries they act like super bosses completely optional and those are so much fun to fight they re extremely difficult even on normal difficulty but also extremely fun to fight but again all the valkyries look the same basically at least they have different movesets gameplay is pretty straightforward you fight enemies climb something and solve some simple puzzles this time the game tries to make an impression it s open world but it isn t again just bad design why because of the map and how those areas are structured map is the worst i have ever seen in gaming it s useless piece of garbage and doesn t help you to navigate at all thankfully there s a very accurate gps system which will help you to get where you want traveling somewhere quickly is a pain yes there are fast travel points they are called gates but you still often need to run through corridors climb walls etc to get where you want to be and the whole fast traveling process is just stupid you go into a gate then loading screen loads and you run in another world until loading ends this was clearly done for consoles so that people would have something to do while the area is loading up but i don t know why would they need to reinvent the wheel the old good click to travel here system is good no need to reinvent or fix something which isn t broken the world design from a visual standpoint is awesome it really is but you never feel like you can go anywhere you like it s nowhere near open world you get tiny areas usually corridors paths etc and that s it i wish i had either more freedom or less freedom like older games more criticism camera i hate it it s a third person camera which acts like first person it s annoying again why invent some stupid camera system when other third person action games like tomb raider assassins creed dark souls and plenty of others work fine i want free camera control and i don t want the main character s back to take 30 of my screen space oh i m on a roll here what else do i hate censorship gow games were violent but this one is watered down why it s still 18 first enemies don t have red blood anymore except in some cases second violent scenes are censored the camera just pans away seriously in previous games you could watch how kratos tears the eye out and here you can t even see how kratos severs the head why ok ok enough good things combat holy f it s fun you get different weapons you have ranged attacks and you can use atreus to help you combat is diverse fast and requires you to use the whole arsenal while it s quite simple it might be hard to master gameplay is simply amazing maybe not as good as horizon zero dawn but it s so satisfying and so good that it outweighs all the negatives slash through enemies rip them apart watch how atreus fights along you it feels so good you also can craft and upgrade weapons and armor that applies to both kratos and atreus for that you need various materials and when you get enough you get to upgrade or craft the gear but sadly even when it comes to gameplay i have to point out some negative things did you ever hear a term collectathlon yes it s here i see developers probably are a huge fans of ubi t there are collectibles on every step like insane amount of them you pick up trash every 10 steps like that is not enough you hunt crows those act as completely useless collectibles you must find them and kill them why i m asking again why stop with that trash collecting crap already graphics are very pretty the locations look stunning artistically extremely cinematic presentation and also extremely atmospheric which makes you more immersed in this mythical world from a technical standpoint the graphics are a bit dated the game still looks great it s just that you clearly see its not a recent game nevertheless considering this is a console port it looks stunning the port quality and performance is outstanding the game runs smooth as silk maxed out without dlss the optimization is amazing and for those with weaker pc s you can enable dlss for that fps boost like that is not enough this game supports ultrawide out of the box developers went through the game once more and adapted everything to ultrawide it looks stunning every cut scene every transition to gameplay everything looks so much better in ultrawide this is one of the best ports ever played on 5800x rtx3080 32gb 3440x1440 the sound design is what it should be in a aaa title it s outstanding from voice acting to epic soundtrack i have zero complaints kratos sounds tough and angry as always and other characters are voiced very well too and then there s music it s just awesome to hear not even for a second you will be bored by sounds overall this is a good action game worth buying on sale the world the gameplay graphics outweigh all the negatives it may lack enemy variety and good story or character development but it s an action game and action in this is polished almost to perfection prosawesome combat mechanicsdiverse and fluid combat always feels freshgreat graphics and artistic designoutstanding sound
