2018 early access review as of writing this review i ve owned the game for at least a year or so and have played 200 hours i ve enjoyed every hour of this game no matter how frustrating some bits can get for how advanced the game is it runs well on my rig i often like to hop on and go for a drive in cars that i can only dream of owning this game has gotten me further interested in cars than i was before every penny spent on this game was a penny well spent
