2016 this game in a nutshell i can sum up in one word genuine this game is a genuine slow cooked old fashioned game that had it come out 20 years ago would have taken its place amongst some of the classics as a great game now the same fate i have never felt such genuinely emotional feelings playing a game for quite some time now ive been playing for a quarter century by now the writing feels genuinely alive the seasons feel genuinely alive the characters feel so genuinely alive that i swear ive known some of these people from real life it is a game that warms my heart like a cup of hot cocoa on a cold rainy day given to me by my loving wife i cried during some of the events my hearts melted at others what is this game like well you need to play it to find out do not expect the game to rush you though oh no this game wants you to know you can relax and take it easy you can pause anytime you like getting in and out is a breeze everything from the mechanics to the story can be taken slowly and easily one at a time and in an age where quantity often rules over quality i find this to be a well crafted piece of cookery done by concernedape a chef who apparently knows that sometimes a good recipe takes time to stew cheers to you mate for all the years waiting
