2020 first a bit about me i use a g29 wheel pedals i play offline with ai in races and without any competitors with practice and hot lap modes i am a newbie when it comes to circuit racing i don t know all the courses by heart i don t know all the intricacies regarding the rules for the race series and i don t know the ins outs of each car i initially was on the fence about getting this game due to the limited class of cars also while i really wanted to like the original assetto corsa i was turned off by the unpolished ui and it needed a lot of tweaking to get my wheel running properly what can i say i m a casual i guess i bought acc on a whim and went into it without much expectation and have to say i ve been really impressed overall while your car choices are more limited than other racing games it does what it does really well the menus and ux are much improved over the original assetto corsa and my wheel pedals felt good to me right out of the box regarding the cars i ve found i really don t mind just having the gt3 class gt4 is now available through dlc too i usually enjoy driving historic cars due to the nostalgia factor but i have other options for those in other games and honestly i find i usually don t use half the available cars in other games any ways the game is getting regular updates and there is additional dlc planned british gt
