though there are some historical inaccuracies i love that this game focuses on a time and region that doesn t get a lot of rts treatment i play these games in part to learn about people places and events in history and my knowledge of ancient egypt and the context in which famous names existed has been greatly improved also the game play is fun with cool units and unique strategies for desert terrain and there are so many interesting faction options especially the sea people they dropped the price for what ended up being a better than usual game package better than three kingdoms imo with tons of content and free updates they ve definitely made up for the not so great launch and burnished their reputation with this one they seem to actually give a damn what we hardcore fans been a player since medieval ii think and say rare in game devs these days i love p tw
