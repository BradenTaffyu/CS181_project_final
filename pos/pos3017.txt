2023 took me 3 or 4 restarts before everything clicked but once it did holy moly great game best rpg i ve played since witcher 3 it s definitely not for everyone but those willing to put the patience and time into it will get a great experience so much work went into making a cohesive world where everyone has something unique to say and ways to approach situations can vary greatly depending on character items experience choices you ve made before for people not used to this kind of rpg just have some patience and fine the groove that works for you i restarted until i found mine because everything i ve heard or seen about this game told me it would be worth it and it is highly recommended and i m eager to dive deep into the developer s other games as well
