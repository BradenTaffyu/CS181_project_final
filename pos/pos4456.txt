2016 this game looks like a potato but it tastes like pie or any other of your favorite sweets in other words the graphics are but don t let that discourage you from trying out this game if you ve ever liked the medieval times but hate it when games set in this time period are inaccurate this game does not do that when you re female people like to treat you like when you re a peasant people like to treat you like wanna kiss up to a king in this game and kill all of his enemies and get of land you can do that wanna go start your very own kingdom and crush all the other ones it s a pain in the ass but you can do that wanna be a bandit and pillage villages you can do that but if you wanna do things like make your own bandit kingdom or some just download a mod speaking of which this game has one of the best modding communities out there wanna be a badass samurai warrior there s a mod for that i should also mention this is not a fantasy game there are no magic and dragons and this is hardcore medieval times all in all for how cheap this game is and what little space it takes i think it s not even a gigabyte it is definately worth it
