2017 early access review im super excited for the release date if you re into dragon age or rpgs with turn based combat id strongly recommend it this is the first of the dos games i tried but after trying the alpha which ive spent 30 hours in of the suggested 8 12 hours i went back and played the d os 1 i was genuinely surprised to see it was a decent game but also realizing that it actually is lightyears behind this one d os 2 it doesnt have the live combat which da has but its turn based where the attack time is based on your characters strengths and weakness for lack of better simplistic explanation id personally take the real time action over this one but it still seems to be well made i think its a bit deceiving with the main character s customization as the characters you find throughout the game can matter just as much if not more only benefit is a bit of options to change the look additionally i think its a shame you can swap the discovered characters in between different conflicting speccs as you find them as in mage or warrior and not just pick between whether you want the warrior to be in a defensive or aggressive build it ruins a bit of the rp feel of the characters in my mind you could have the option to swap between the conflicting paths but then you should get a rp story explaining why that it is a possibility and only have it as a rare trait to some of them if you re playing on high difficulty having this would mean you directly need to find a healer tank rogue to unlock certain skills benefits im lacking a bit of character story and overall story which you can find in the early dragon age games but it hardly affects my belief of the game im excited to see how the late game develops as im afraid you get overpowered a bit too soon in addition to the fact that the cookie cutter builds seem to be a bit too either overpowered or obvious one thing i actually spite is the fact that the amount of discovered hidden legendary weapons are slightly too many and of too high importance if you re playing on max difficulty you re almost forced to google to find them in order to being able to beat the npc ai atleast this is the case if youre in the range of my skill level which admittedly isn t perfect everything i could think of on the spot september cant come soon enough
