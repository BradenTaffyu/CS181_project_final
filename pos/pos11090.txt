2021 overall i recommend this game as a fan of the jwe series there s a lot of goodies the advanced needs of dinosaurs is one of the hilights of this game making them feel like actual living things in your park you can make some really beautiful enclosures for your dinos and the variety of dinos in this game is really impressive but if you haven t played the first i recommend you start there there are some parts of the game that have been simplified and other parts that have added a laundry list of steps that feel really unnecessary my main complaint about this game is the amount of trivial time consuming tasks that were added there is a lot of dead time you ll experience between waiting for research waiting for scientists to finish synthesizing dinos waiting for scientist to incubate eggs you even have to wait for scientist to come back from vacation not to mention all the time you waste just trying to scrape together enough money to progress your park the devs added a fast forward button as if they knew this was a problem but there will even be times where i permanently keep fast forward on and things still feel too slow the fist game didnt have this feature and i still didn t run into as much dead time as this game still a fun game just a few wrong turns
