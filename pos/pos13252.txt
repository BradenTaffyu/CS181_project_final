2022 outstanding modding community decided that the base game wasnt hard enough and so added the real solar system roughly 10x gravity and size as stock engine failures radiation life support tank tooling crew training pain and suffering manually directed communications realistic heating and a whole host of other stuff kerbal space program is the end all be all of space sims and is just a genuinely enjoyable game which has inspired a strong passion for rocketry and space in me and millions of others i wish the best for ksp2 and cannot wait to play multiplayer with friends there a sincere fan since 2015
