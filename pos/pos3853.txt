2022 what a joy what a great game it has been so long since i enjoyed a game this much this is easily one of the best gaming surprises i have had in recent years and it was totally unexpected i am almost 100 hours in i have no idea how long i have left for the game story to end but i hope it is longer than that i really do this game is the true definition of a hidden gem a game that steam charts show with an average player count of around 200 players per month a game with a 94 steam rating you found it congrats you are up for a great time enjoy this is not x com or x com ii games with a proven developer firaxis and a huge publisher 2k this is a small game developed by a south korean indie studio that you have never heard about dandylion they developed this game and it is their only game and you know what i am enjoying this game way more than any x com game i have played and i am not saying this lightly do not get me wrong i did enjoy both x com and x com ii i had to play them considering that i loved the original games from the nineties i also played and liked remakes like xenonauts or japanese games like fae tactics but believe me when i tell you troubleshooter abandoned children is my new favourite by far nothing gets close to this a search in indiedb com shows that this game was being developed as early as mar 2016 if you look deeper you will find that the developers are passionate about their work they comment on every single review they are active on the forums they are polite helpful and dedicated the whole game is clearly a labour of love a gaming fest this is not your typical review i did not get into any game details i could do that but i choose not to if that is what you need then you have plenty of reviews with a lot of details instead i focused on praising a game that is criminally overlooked i am truly thankful for the joy it has given me and believe me i have played a lot of games so big thanks to the devs for creating this masterpiece i hope the game gets more exposure keep up the good work
