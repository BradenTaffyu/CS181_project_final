2019 for those who don t know total war warhammer is a work in progress trilogy warhammer 2 is the latest game and if you own the first game and mortal empires then they combine into just this one game warhammer 2 adds high elves dark elves skaven and lizardmen and its dlcs add tomb kings and vampire coast unfortunately there will be no other factions added they really should add araby since we have their lands but they won t the dlc for this game contains some of the absolute best faction packs culture packs in total war history they really are amazing the total war warhammer games are more focused on the real time tactics battles than the turn based strategy but both elements remain solid the strategy element has less depth than most of the historical games i do wish this wasn t the case but the main things this game lacks are naval battles and truly epic level design modders achieve the latter but this needs full scale naval battles to do the dark elves and vampire coast justice this game is fairly moddable so be sure to check out the workshop before starting a campaign most importantly gccm map packs and possibly sfo 2 for more lore friendliness like every other recent total war game optimization is lacking considering the type of game this is it is still truly a dx11 game with a useless dx12 implementation if total war would become a true dx12 game we d see a massive performance boost thanks to superior multithreading async compute and more features seen in ashes of the singularity and id tech games hopefully warhammer 3 gets there if you re not in a rush to play this series you can wait until the third game comes out since it ll integrate all content from the first two games
