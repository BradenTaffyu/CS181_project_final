2020 early access review 118 hours more in and i still endorse everything i wrote here i am a fan of roguelikes and have been for a long time in the late 2000s i played a lot of ivan and the 2 0 tales of middle earth zangband as well i ve never finished or ascended in any of them that said i ve been playing qud off and on for a few years and it may very well be my favorite entry in the genre the game has an excellent setting very reminiscent of gamma world for those of you familiar with old tsr rpgs mechanically the game is excellent and very consistent mutants animals psychic powers and high tech devices hang together nicely not so balanced together to be bland but not so lumpy in distribution to make alternative play styles unworkable the real draw for me to this game is the impressively deep lore the developers have written libraries of books and stories that drench the world in depth and history if you play for more than five minutes your character becomes part of a web of reality that the game weaves and really draws you in if you read books in the elder scrolls game the literary tradition of qud is a must see i have had a lot of pleasant contact with the guys at freehold and i am a fan of their other work such as sproggiwood brian bucklew has helped me with c and unity as well for my personal projects which is far and beyond what anyone can expect from a professional developer only one other dev has ever answered that sort of question for me and it was john carmack pretty good company i cannot recommend this game and this development team enough
