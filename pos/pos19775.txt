2020 i thought that they just re released the absolute killer rts with slightly better graphics i ve never been more wrong in my entire life they not only re worked all the animations both in game and on unit portraits but managed to add health bars to both resources and building ques to maximise efficiency they released all the expansions ergo they have more cultures than a mormon has wives they re balanced factions aka saracens mamelukes no longer wrek every match up they attribute each faction based on their culture towards warfare to the best of their ability without making anyone too op cause let s be serious the mongols had europe by the balls due to the parthian shot and subotai they give an overlay of each map it has seamless graphics and quite frankly it has reignited my passion for an rts i haven t played for over a decade i may be just a casual gamer but since the day my brothers and i pried open a nutri grain box of cereal to find the pandoras box which was age of empires 1 i have been enamoured with this work of art that is the golen horde standard of rts if i had the head to pull off a hat i would take it off for you fine gentlemen and women you have truly outdone yourselves and have transformed a year spent in quarantine for a laid off teacher into a few months of conquering bliss i imagine this is how timurlane felt minus all the genocide
