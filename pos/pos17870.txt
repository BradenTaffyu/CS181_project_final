2023 it is sad to see but the strategy community seems to get more toxic every year seen it with total war aoe warno etc i think its because people of the genre are growing old and are still living in the good old times where everything was more balanced and better and more innovative what they dont get is that this genre is basically dying and we should be happy that some developers still do stuff like this i bought this game for 40euro the day it came out considering the two single player campaigns and new units factions this is more then fair especially considering that through the huge modding community you have so much more content aaa games come out way more unfinished all the time and nowadays they charge 70 80 euro for it yes they get backlash aswell but after a couple of days nobody cares anymore and the game has good reviews but not for strategy games noo no those guys have to pay because the game is not as good as i remember it to have been 10 years ago average player numbers are at 1300 the last 30 days why should developers give a but instead of trying to make the best of it and cherishing what is good and fair in those game they just get i think this genre is doomed and it makes me sad
