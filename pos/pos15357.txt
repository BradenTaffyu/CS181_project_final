2020 first i d like to say that i have not played don t starve the single player game i can t compare them i can however review this as the standalone it is i bought this a couple of days ago and considering i ve already got 20 hours on it it s fair to say it s addictive i really do think the charm in this game is together i ve played alone a couple of times and it s really not as fun as playing with your friends you can also play with strangers which is fine too i like the different set of characters each with perks and quirks when you play with friends and you all play as different characters it s fun to see how you struggle with different things as you struggle together the lore is good and needless to say the tim burton esque art style is really compelling too don t starve together is hard there s no denying you can create your own server and change the rules and difficulty you can add guidelines to the randomly generated worlds one thing i found annoying though i can t seem to find the balance the standard settings always seemed to kill us within the first weeks but when we created a server with more crops spawning we didn t even struggle to get to day 30 then the winter boss spawned and we didn t stand the slightest chance to me it s either too easy or waaaay too hard there s none of that sweet barely making it but still surviving the thing i struggled the most with was the lack of information i guess that s a part of the game the empiricism but i d like there to be an option to get something of a tutorial or tips as you go along we had to google so many things to get an idea of how the game works maybe we were overly attached to the thought of success and that s why we kept googling how to do everything the best way but i just really wish for some clearer guidelines if you and your friends are in for a challenge this is a good one just be aware that sometimes it feels more tideous than fun and don t get too attached to your base becuase it could be destroyed by a giant deerclops sooner than you know it
