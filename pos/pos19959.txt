2018 why fallout new vegas is a game that should be in everyone s library the world ended on october 23 2077 nuclear warheads touched down in almost every country across the world devastating the planet similarly another story starts with death the opening scene of fallout new vegas you the courier are shot in the head after digging your own grave outside the small town of goodsprings in 2010 new vegas is released as the sixth video game in the world of fallout a post apocalyptic roleplaying series in a world similar to our own a game that any who calls themselves a gamer or game enthusiast should play the entertaining plot and story the aspect of replayability and the equation of price vs time played are reason enough to get the game now open world games such as those in the fallout series have a huge following due to the main mechanics of being an open world and rpg role playing game these games at base level give tons of freedom to the player one of the allures that draws people in there are no set ways to play fallout new vegas you as the player can make the choices that affect the world inside the game this basis sets the groundwork to make the story and plot so incredible each player starts off the same life just saved by the kind doctor of goodsprings set loose on a world as demented as the sin city itself las vegas or in this case new vegas dwevy a gamer who has written several reviews describes how new vegas allows for the story to unfold for you this game won t hold your hand once you ve left doc michells home once you leave you re free to do what you wish explore and venture into caves or explore old history it s up to you on how you confront problems weather that s with a gun or with kind words you have that freedom the story of the courier can lead you down paths of righteousness or sin or more likely straddling the line of good and bad with the mechanic of karma helping people doing the moral thing will grant you good karma killing innocents stealing or other debaucheries will give you bad karma have enough karma tipped to one side and you will begin to see how others treat you right off the bat the plot and main story are so interesting that you can only focus those quests and still feel as though you were in an award winning story when i played through the game i took my time exploring every location on the map completing as many quests and adventures as i could this is something i recommend doing no matter how you play as the courier new vegas will be an exciting journey to travel the idea that a game can be replayable or not can make or break someone s decision to purchase it contracts420 comments on their view of replay originally posted by contracts420 replayability is nice to have through game design or extra features but all i need to replay a game is have it be a great experience i don t listen to a song i really like once and never bother again i don t watch a movie i really enjoy and never bother to see it again if something is great i will want to experience it again and again alongside the base game there are also additional content addons commonly called downloadable content or dlc for short these dlc s add new items characters and locations for optional play these addons add more atmosphere and story to the areas surrounding the wasteland open world games previously mentioned give freedom to the player this freedom allows for different playstyles and the ability to play differently each time did you play as the charismatic mailman who speaks first and then shoots later or did you play as the bumbling buffoon who only knows how to swing a blunt object fallout new vegas gives you the opportunity to do both and still see different sides of the game this is the art of replayability the last aspect to think about is price the typical price for the base game of fallout new vegas is 9 99 and the ultimate edition which adds 6 dlc can be bought for 19 99 to compare to the newest edition of the fallout series fallout 4 that released in 2015 was sold at 60 00 one way to decide if the game is worth buying is to plug in the average play time divided by the price for new vegas the average play time is around 40 hours playing the base game fallout new vegas in theory you would be paying 4 for every hour played the equation would roughly give the same answer for the 85 hour play time for the ultimate edition if a game is enjoyable you will spend lots of time playing it if the game bores you you won t get many hours out of it i enjoyed walking the mojave wasteland as the courier so much that i spent 129 hours in the game no formula can equate to the feeling that a game will give you only you can decide that
