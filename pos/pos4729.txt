2015 tldr fallout 4 has great gunplay shooter combat but falls flat in the rpg department compared to a predecessor like fallout new vegas the main story isn t all that interesting the dialogue options don t really feel like choices as most of them lead towards the same result anyway and there is no real viable option to roleplay as a villain in the commonwealth wasteland the saving grace of fallout 4 is that there are plenty of mods that you can install to change the feel of the game to your liking genre open world sandbox post apocalyptic shooter featuring lite rpg elementsgameplay you start by creating a character and assigning s p e c i a l points based on a playstyle of your preference e g strength focused for melee build or perception focused for run and gun build once you enter the commonwealth you are free to roam the map to pursue the main quest look for side quests scour for loot and explore other activities you can partake in include weapon crafting and settlement building fallout 4 features an extensive crafting system where you can take junk materials and use them to upgrade pretty much every single weapon s components such as adding silencers grips scopes etc settlement management is an optional game mechanic where you can also use junk materials to build bases for settlements that you free up in the wasteland to protect locals faction members from roaming enemies you can basically build housing furniture defensive weapon stations and power supplies if you want to be creative graphics fallout 4 presents itself rather nicely it certainly looks better than fallout 3 and new vegas as human models textures lighting and more all look pretty good the post apocalyptic world does often look more colorful than in previous fallout games which is a plus for me there are a few areas in the game where framerate could take a hit such as in densely populated streets with lots of buildings in the surrounding area story after a series of events play out following your entry into a vault you find yourself in the wasteland on the hunt for a member of your family as you pursue this person s tracks you will meet different representatives of various factions in the game who ask for your assistance and in turn may or may not give you information that you seek eventually the factions grow tired of their constant quarrels against their enemies and place a weighty decision in your hands to decide the future of the commonwealth strengths noticeable improvements were made in the handling of gun combat compared to previous titles weapons like pistols smg s and rifles all feel nice to shoot and bullets actually feel like they hit your designated targets the crafting and weapon upgrade system is pretty cool you can make upgrades to any weapon that you like and basically use that weapon up until the endgame if you want to there is a big list of different attachments you can make for every weapon part so customization feels unique and meaningful the radio station is jam packed with a bunch of tunes that are perfect for a fallout setting i came out of the game with a newfound appreciation for the particular genre of music there is a big modding scene for fallout 4 filled with small mods like new clothing and new weapons and also larger upcoming mod projects that overhaul the entire game if you don t like something about the game chances are there is an existing mod to change it to your liking weaknesses in my opinion one of the biggest flaws to fallout 4 was giving the player character a voice having a voice limits the dialogue in such a way that more often than not you don t have anything interesting to say rather the common meme about the player dialogue choice is to choose between yes yes maybe sarcastic yes and no under thoses circumstances you even see that most of the time your choice doesn t really matter because you pretty much always end up at a certain result no matter which yes you chose in the options you can t roleplay as a villain as well as you could in new vegas you aren t really given options to berate or belittle enemies in dialogue most of the time you are railroaded no pun intended to being a hero and a good guy and it sucks that you can t just be evil by choice numeric score if you care 7 10fallout 4 s great gunplay is slightly marred by its disappointing rpg gameplay it is a fun shooter game but not a great fallout game checkbox reviews are lazy copy paste bullsh t ascii art reviews tell you nothing let s be honest i only wrote this review for awards is a waste of everyone s time if you are interested in genuine detailed game reviews feel free to check out my others here or don t i don t tell you what to do
