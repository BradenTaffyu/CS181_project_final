stardew valley is an incredibly personal game to me on top of being just one of the best most fun and addicting games i ve ever played having played 250 hours on steam and probably like 600 on switch i ve still not touched a bunch of endgame and or perfection related content yet i ve enjoyed every minute i played i love the way you unlock more abilities and crafting recipes for every branch of the game the more you focus on them i love the fact that everything you can do in the game is a solid way to make a living hell you could probably toss your hoe away and finish a lot of the game without touching the farming aspect which is crazy for a farming game my personal favourite way to make money especially in the early game is to just go fishing the mini game is challenging and rewarding the more you play it the more things you unlock to add an extra challenge and make more money get more diverse catches and so on and so forth this is amplified tenfold by the new update bringing new events related to fishing in particular and the mastery system it adds is a great way to incentivize players to revisit previously completed aspects of the game bit of a tangent but the multiplayer is a fantastic addition added in 1 3 being a large timesink for myself i myself had played the game mainly on switch when this dropped having once handed my switch to my mom and saying i think you d like this game i got it back like a week later she was absolutely hooked and eventually got her own switch in 2020 to play animal crossing and play stardew valley together with me which we spent a good few hundred hours on she bought the game for me on steam in 2016 when i was 13 and i bought the game for her on switch in 2020 when i d recently turned 17 so it was kind of a personal gift for me to buy her rest in peace mom you would ve adored 1 6 and absolutely despised the squidfest event miss you every day
