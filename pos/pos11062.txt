2022 this game jurassic world evolution 2 is a real improvement over jurassic world evolution 1 improved management improved creativity improved dinosaurs improved maps improved graphics improved everthing although i wish they would bring back slow motion from the first game for capture mode frontier have really reviewed the lacking features of jurassic world evolution 1 and decided to improve them the introduction of the scientists into the game really makes the game feel well rounded and boosts the management you must make sure that your staff is not overworked or undertrained or you will be sabotaged and tasks cannot be carried out it adds that new layer of management that we have been sorely lacking in jurassic world evolution 1 the dinosaurs also feel way more alive the problem with jurassic world evolution 1 is that the dinosaurs feel don t have that feeling of having a soul interactions between each other are just standing in cult circles and that was about it but now in jurassic world evolution 2 we can get unique social animations with some being utterly adorable even the t rex gets a social animation which kind of remind me of two dogs rubbing and playing with each other there are also pack hunting and the fighting system has been slightly improved but perhaps not as much as we would have liked the dinosaurs still square up to each other butthey can perform random unique attacks while fighting for example when a rex and spino are fighting there will be a chance that they will perform a unique animation where both dinosaurs will leap over do a elegant swirl snap at each other and the result is that they have switched sides that there will be the normal biting animation this does improve the fighting system but i wish they could implement ambush attacks perhaps when a spino isn t watching and sits down next to a forest the t rex could sneak up on the spino and land a surprise attack the last major improvement is the creativity and customisation we get so much new decorations in jurassic world evolution 2 from planters and fountains to sheds and lights it really allows us to decorate the empty spaces within our park and really make it interesting to look at contrast this to the first game and you will really see the difference not only that but you can change the looks of some amenity buildings such as shops and guest attractions you can change the signage roof styles ground decorations colour of the lights of the building and the colour of the building itself all these show that jurassic world evolution 2 is leaps and bounds better than jurassic world evolution 1 but no game is perfect and jurassic world evolution does need to implement certain improvements in some areas such as new dinosaur attractions we have viewing galleries towers tours and monorails but that is about it we need more attractions real theme parks have uncountable amounts of different attractions that will give guests unique experiences and that is something that we sorely lack in jurassic world evolution 2 the dinosaur roster is big enough we don t need new dinosaurs we need more attractions for me i will give this game a solid 8 5 10 it is really fun and an absolute blast of a experience i really want this game to reach a solid 9 5 out of ten of course no game will ever reach 10 10 i recommend this game to any jurassic fans and also to the previous fans of jurassic world evolution 1 thanks for reading
