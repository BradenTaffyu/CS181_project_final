2021 early access review indie developers have certainly earned their place in gaming and the 5 people responsible for this project have 100 earned my respect and my support i can t believe 5 developers who have started from scratch released such a polished and addicting and awesome automation game wow game is in early access and still has a long way to go there are some minor feedbacks i will probably share with the devs no doubt this project will change but so far i love this game
