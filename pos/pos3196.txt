2021 a very detailed game set in a rich dense world i would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy rpgs with lots of interesting characters worldbuilding and player choices even if turn based combat isn t your thing it wasn t mine i found the game s battle system really fun and engaging it really won me over only issue is that i keep getting sidetracked by exploration and side quests npcs and so it took me almost 50 hours to get off the starting island
