2022 love it game is so addicting and every race has unique mechanics that have the campaign feeling fresh each playthrough for anyone looking to buy i want to give a fair warning however this game is cpu intensive and will run your machine hot majority of the time to help remedy this i turned off ssao and shadows as well as lowered the unit size slightly this helped improve temps by a large margin if you are a laptop user i highly recommend these tweaks no matter what your specs are as even with modern cpu gpu combos the high temps just cant seem to be avoided
