2016 with so many failed harvest moon clones i was sceptic about stardew valley however this game not only brings back that nostalgia it surpasses hm completely there isn t any aspect of this game that i didn t love and there will be even more things added i only wish i could also play it on my 3ds because this one is addicting as hell big plus for likable characters and cool town festivals creator even planned multiplayer and still makes new things for this game
