2022 a newbie s review of fallout 76 i m a newcomer to the fallout franchise and i think this kinda gives me to ability to have an impartial review of the game but what i can tell you right now is that fallout 76 sparked my interest into the other games in the series at the time i m at about 100 hours played and tried almost every system and activity the game has to offer so without any further ado this is my report positives the dialog and storytelling from my point of view is spot on i really got immersed and didn t what to stop until completing the story i was on i love the aspect of player housing c a m p and the fact that i can build wherever and whatever i want players seem to be really friendly and helpful and so far no nukes were dropped on my camp if you really want to listen to every dialog and complete every quest you see you ll probably get 200 hours worth of content combat is above average and you have a variety of builds you can try although the most used one from what i ve seen is the heavy gunner build which is hella fun and i recommend you give it a try if you haven t already when you first bring up the map it appears to be really small but be assured you have a lot to explore and if you re a lore nut you ll have a blast it s super fun to play with friends if you have any willing to play negatives the bugs i know that it s a different game from the launch version and many many bugs got fixed but there still are a lot of them and random crashes and i m hopeful they will get patched down the road princes in atomic shop are insane like 1800 atoms for some random skin a wallpaper and an icon atoms are not that hard to get if you want to complete all the personal challenges but it s still a grind and i don t think the prices are justified although they increased the stash limit personal storage twice and still think is not enough if you sell stuff to a random vendor to the point where he runs out of caps good luck with selling anything anymore for that day because all the fix spawn vendor share the caps so if you leave a trader with 0 caps and you travel to another one that second vendor will have 0 caps as well and i find that very annoying travelling merchants don t share caps with regular vendors so you can sell to them if you find one that s all i have to report for now thank you for taking the time to read my review and i hope you have a fantastic time playing fallout 76 see you in the wasteland
