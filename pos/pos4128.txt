2017 early access review oh what a game what a lovely game genuinely delighted with this game as a fan of the card game genre instead of locking content behind a sneaky f2p model all the content is already there i have heard that some people have found it too hard or the that the rng is too much and im sure there are many other nit picks i would say of course theres rng its a card game and yes its hard you liked hearthstone and x com didn t you as for hard what about ftl or dark souls these games are revered for being hard so not a valid reason not to try this the design is great and the greatest enemy will be yourself as you try to greedily snap up that unneccessary power because its cool or the artifact that will cost you health or spending all your gold too early or not at all these are the factors that make this title stand out learn to synergise or just all out greed it up or try and be sensible either way the core loop is not so long that failure feels terrible occassionally the card order can ruin a good run but imo this is not too often and occurs in other rng titlesi paid the full 12 for this and have come away delighted with the result this game needs more exposure and nothing would please me more to see more characters an endless mode and more of those awesome cards right now its underrated but im hoping that changes as so many aaa titles are pushed our way with pr and exposure yet true gamers will miss out on this because not many have heard of it
