2020 total war warhammer 2 is a total improvement upon the first game it starts you off with 4 base races the dark elves the high elves the skaven and the lizardmen each has their own feel and unique strategies to use each faction has several lords to use which drastically switch up how that race is played there s also several free factions available for download and various factions that cost its also important to note that if you have total war warhammer 1 you ll get mortal empires campaign for free the mortal empire campaign brings back all the classic races from the 1st game and give you access to a variety of faction options gameplay is broken down into battles and diplomacy although each race faction has their own prejudices you re given free reign to forms ties with whomever you want each lord has various traits that tell how they will react to the player and what kind of person they are diplomacy is huge many battles can be won by just having the right diplomatic mind in the battlefield you command hundreds thousands of troops things like the terrain or slope of the battlefield moral of the soldiers and even how tired they are all play a role in winning or losing a game build up cities provinces trade agrees alliances and well there s just alot to do plus the battles are fun to watch just last night i was bringing my dragons to land among archers and watched as the dragon feasted enemies units at the same time giant minotaurs that towers 30 feet above my soldiers heads made short work of a group of underpowered infantry
