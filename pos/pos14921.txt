2021 early access review i gotta say i had been waiting a few months for this game to finally be released and when it got out i immediatly bought it and when i played it for the first time wow it wasnt what i expected it was even better i absolutely loved the out of the campaign wich was the part i was least looking forward to but after playing the game for about 10 hours thru the story i found it even more fun than the sandbox the story was good the missions were fun they were not hard and not easy the sandbox feels just like garry s mod but everything is destructable and you would think of course you need a bit of a decent pc to be able to run this but it handles everything so well and way better than expected i feel like this game is something new mixed with something old this game really mixes with minecraft in a lot of ways but there are a few things different that make it better the voxels are smaller and everything has physics the only downfault would be that you cant dig down whats even better now too is that they added an workshop with mods that make so much more fun i expected very much from this game and was still overwhelmed by how good it was now i know this game isnt perfect yet lots of things still have to change buildings have very weird falling physics and is sometimes a bit buggy and lag is still to be expected but if you put the graphics on the lowest it is very much reduced there is just one thing that bothers me much that it isnt added yet and that is multiplayer i do hope that they will add that someday and i would understand that that would be a very big challenge but yea so my review of this game would be an 9 10 amazing and overwhelmingly good game but it still needs to work on a few things for an early acces this is already amazing great job tuxedo labs
