2020 this is one of the best sandbox games i ve played in a long time as you can see i m probably hooked one thing that makes it even better is that there is still updates i would probably put this game up there with other games such as totally accurate battle simulator or even garry s mod i think overwhelmingly positive is a accurate review to this game one thing i would change is that when you are uploading a creation to the workshop you cant choose a tag or like a category such as it being a building vehicle or a machine to put it in overall very good game and also huge thanks to all developers working on this game and for bringing it to the public
