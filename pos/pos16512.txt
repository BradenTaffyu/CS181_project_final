2021 early access review one of the greatest games i ve ever played i love the way the game presents itself i tend to call it the finland simulator or the hell simulator as it gives you no tutorial nothing to give you to assist in your endeavor of this game except the dialogue presented to you you basically need to keep yourself from dying while being side swiped with lore and trying to balance 5 things at once graphics could use some work but the gameplay is so great that you can t even care about them my summer car taught me a lot about how cars work even though it s based in the 90s it is an extremely interesting game with so much comedy that makes others wonder why you find so much humor off it this game is one of the best investments you ll ever make at the moment of this review i have about 200 hours invested into it but every time i start a new game i spend hours upon hours in every playthrough you build the car but get distracted with trying to keep up with bills which leads you through the story wake up in the middle of the night by drunkmen wanting a ride home then lead yourself to wandering about the map avoid drunkmen as they wander about the roads get thrown in jail because of punching said drunkmen this game is going to be the best thing you ve ever played in a long time support this guy my winter car is coming soon and i m absolutely going to buy it upon release
