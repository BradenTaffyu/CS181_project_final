just beaten it for the first time after beating dark souls 1 once and elden ring like 15 times dark souls 3 is now my favorite game in the series like sure a lot of bosses in the first half aren t that fun with a few exceptions like the abyss watchers but the second half of the game is worth going through aldritch and the irithyll dungeon 100 dragonslayer armor abyss watchers and soul of cinder are some of the best fights in the series and the only two fights that compare in elden ring are maliketh and godfrey my main criticism is that because the game is so linear you can t really get your build together quickly like you can in elden ring or dark souls 1 depending on how you wann play the game might just say beat half the game before you can use what you want and then you can t even play a different build and change it later because that fails one npcs questline so if you want to complete that you can t respec and her quest is only complete after the second to last boss for the first playthrough i d recommend a quality build where you level dexterity and strength equally you will meet the stat requirements for a lot of weapons so you can just try anything out to see what you like and use the talk option when talking to npcs they will usually explain important gameplay features and lore to you anyways 8 10 game the first half is a bit underwhelming but consider it warmup for the second half that is insanely hard but also where the real fun is found i also look forward to trying the dlcs which are just as good as the main game from what i ve heard
