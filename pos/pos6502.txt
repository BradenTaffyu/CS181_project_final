2020 in a world dominated by first person shooters action adventure rpgs and the like it s nice to just come home from work and relax with a slower paced game that s still lots of fun what is it about jumping on here and delivering load after load or that one 4 000 km load that s just so satisfying is it unlocking new perks as you level up is it exploring the new countries that continue to be added or is it trying to get that roads explored section up to 100 the achievements perhaps it s all of this and more if you re in a simple mood you can just drive around on or off the job take detours shortcuts new routes see new sights there s something in here for everyone and though not everyone will get 225 hours of enjoyment out of it there are thousands if not hundreds of thousands of people who do just like me i definitely recommend this game for anyone who isn t bored at the thought of getting behind the wheel of a big rig just so it s out there i have just about as many hours in american truck simulator as well both great games
