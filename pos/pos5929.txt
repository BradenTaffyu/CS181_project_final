so just bought the game and have played like 5 6 hours i ve seen a lot of negative reviews about performance and crashes it kinda made me hesitant when i went to buy it but i ended up going for it anyways i gotta say i m not really sure what all the fuss is about i don t have a beefy computer by any means and in fact my computer is outdated in terms of hardware by at least 3 4 years the game has run very decently for me the only issue i had was in city free roam there was some stutter everything else ran very well update so after playing a little more up to 12 hours now i ve gotten to play around a bit more and i can see more what people are talking about there is a lot of stutter in free roam in the city i mostly play my career when i m in game it runs perfectly cut scenes are mostly okay although sometimes it stutters for a few seconds then skips forward like 1 2 seconds cant really speak for online games as i stick to my career with all that being said i still am enjoying the game so i still recommend it it s not perfect by any means and they def need a few performance fixes to fix all the stutters but still very playable
