2015 early access review hey sexy mama wanna kill all humans but seriously this game is actually really fun and a nice twist of a strategy game you basically are a disease trying to wipe out humanity before they can finalize a cure to wipe you out in turn you get a variety of symptoms to inflict various ways to transmit your plague and abilities that vary depending on what type of pathogen you are you even get to cause global mind control zombie apocalypses and ape uprisings with certain plagues oh yeah did i mention you can compete with other players to see who can infect the world first or that the game has a workshop
