2018 finished it with my wife i played with a mage and a healer she played with a tank and a melee dps we had also played and completed the first game so we knew what we were getting into the game fulfilled and surpassed our expectations great character customization and very interesting pre made ones with their own stories and quests we loved the new races classes and skills added so many different playstyles you could never get bored beautifully designed and written quests and main storyline good itemization system you will never get stuck with the same item for very long one of the best rpg games i have ever played
