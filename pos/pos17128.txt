2017 improvement over tw warhammer in every way campaign is really satisfying to progress through keeps you playing endlessly in the just one more turn kind of way the new vortex win mechanic is a blast puts pressure on you to not only complete missions but to expand capture key locations forge alliances and intervene in other races progress that being said you can t just abandon your homelands either or you might end up paying the chaos price makes for some interesting decisions played through as dark elfs and fufilled my game of thrones fantasy of having 3 dragons in one army i d like to see more races come in and probably could have done with 2 more in the base game but still a great time the map itself feels absolutely massive just kept on giving the layout was clearly inspired by earth but thats not a bad thing i also enjoy the weather habitable mechanic because it makes you stop and consider other options then just purely brute forcing capturing everything in sight
