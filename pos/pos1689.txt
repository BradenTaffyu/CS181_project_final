2023 comment i was hesitant to play this game and expected to not enjoy it because of 2b butt meme and all that but it s easily one of my all time favourite games an amazing and beautiful game through and through good the soundtrack is amazing captivating and emotional story i enjoy the world a lot likeable cast of characters character movement feels nice and fluid interesting mix of different camera angles and gameplay elements for different areas of the game plugin chips character enhancements can be customized to suit your playstyle side quests add to the experience rather than just being chores no difficulty based achievements exploration is encouraged and rewarded additional customization options within easier difficulty settings makes the game more accessible for people with disabilities limited unofficial moddability but it exists neutral knowledge of previous installments adds to the experience but is not required to enjoy the story combat can be a bit button mashy the map and menu takes some getting used to 60 fps lock unlockable but speeds up certain elements so i don t recommend it graphics look outdated for its time but it doesn t make the game any less enjoyable fan service in female character designs something to keep in mind if it s something you feel strongly about bad without movement speed plugin chips dashing is faster than running incentivizing you to spam dash to move around i can t stop obsessing over it i hear the soundtrack playing in my head all day every day i even bought a body pillow
