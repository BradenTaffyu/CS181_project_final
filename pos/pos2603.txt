i normally don t bother writing a serious review as most of the time it will be glossed over or not even seen but this game deserves it it is so much more than just a mediocre gacha slop that you can find with three seconds of looking with it hardly even feeling like a gacha with how generous it is the combat in the game has impact and flashy the music is phenomenal from the ambiance themes to combat and to mili s beautiful work as always and the story oh the story is so lovely it does start a bit slow with the first two canto s being relatively tame but afterwards it s a ship setting sail for your heart especially canto 4 it is amazing the only gripe i have is the lack of a good tutorial as i needed assistance from a friend to fully grasp the nuance this game possess but their are youtube tutorials that do a good job of explaining that but all in all this game is something i have been having a blast playing and i wholeheartedly encourage people to pick it up if not just for the story
