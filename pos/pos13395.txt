2017 my 9 year old son and i have enjoyed this game greatly over the last few years and i am sorry to see its review stats being affected by people complaining over 1 line of 1 language it has been localised too this has to be the best game ever for helping to appreciate orbital mechanics as well as easy to understand modular approach to complex vehicle construction great fun and educational for all ages
