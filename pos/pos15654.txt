2020 early access review awesome aim trainer i ve been using kovaaks for awhile now but i recently came across aim lab and decided to give it a shot so far i ve really liked it and have found it easier to improve or at least see my improvement in aim lab i still use kovaaks for specific exercises and to benchmark my improvements on specific tasks but for most of my practice i ve switched over to aim lab aim lab pros free can t beat that much more detailed feedback instead of just showing you accuracy kills and score it shows things like where one the screen you are more less accurate as well as time to kill and precision practice feels more focused exercises are broken up into categories like speed precision and tracking with similar exercises in each category that focus on those specific aspects i ve found this makes it easier for me to spend some time focused on improving my precision with small targets and other time focused on being faster with larger targets that disappear sooner while still feeling consistency between the different exercises much better trend tracking in kovaaks the only history it shows you is your previous high score this makes it difficult to see the improvement unless you are consistently making new high scores or loading your logs into an external program to track in aim lab after every exercise it shows you a history of your score accuracy and time to kill which makes it way easier to see that even if i m not setting a new high score even my bad days are better than my old good days or that i m improving my accuracy instead it also helps me to see when i need to take a break if my scores are dropping instead of going up this feature is huge for me and has helped me stay more consistent and motivated built in ranking system broken up into categories on the main screen aim lab shows an overall score for flicking tracking speed precision perception and cognition as well as an overall rank like ruby i having these individual areas listed out helps me to know which areas i should focus on to improve my overall aim and these categories align with the exercise categories to make it easy to find exercises that will help a specific aspect of my aim additionally having all of these helps me see my improvement and feel more motivated to keep practicing ai exercises these exercises tune aspects of the difficulty based on your performance in other exercises this helps keep you training at the edge and helps force you to push yourself a little bit and work on specific weaknesses for example if you are really good at hitting medium targets it might give you slightly smaller targets or it might make them disappear faster or put them in spots you struggle to hit these are harder to see your improvement on since the difficulty scales but i think they are an awesome way to be able to push yourself video content before every exercise there is a short video describing how to approach each exercise i found this really helpful to know what i should be focusing on within the exercise aim lab cons much fewer exercises at this moment aim lab has a lot less options for exercises and some of the areas feel weaker to me for example there aren t a lot of pure tracking exercises one of the things i still pull up kovaaks for but i also understand they are right now working on a custom content creator which hopefully should resolve this issue in the future sometimes it can feel slow to go between exercises because you have to navigate in an out of menus i ve played with playlists a little bit but i don t really use them much because i ve kept my training fairly dynamic general feedback i ve really liked what i ve seen so far especially for early access they are off to a really solid start i m really looking forward to seeing where aim lab goes in the future there are some features i would love to see though i don t know whether they will actually happen aim lab offers some recommended trainings i m not sure whether these are recommended for me specifically or just a pre populated list i would really love to see a dynamic recommended playlist tailored to me that helps me maximize my own improvement and adjusts based on future performance and weaknesses something like a personal coach guiding me through the exercises i should be doing i don t know how realistic this is but it would be an awesome feature more variety within some of the categories especially tracking most of the tracking exercises are closer to target switching and i would love to see some variety like long short strafes etc maybe even an ai mode that adapts to your specific tracking weaknesses
