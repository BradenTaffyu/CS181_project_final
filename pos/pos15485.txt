2021 i am loving this release as someone who owns and played 2015 and 2018 with 11 dlcs i ve been waiting for this to come out it appears they did a lot under the hood of this game it runs far smoother than 2018 did i really enjoy the new additions and how the overall shop space you get feels i like they added fluids balancing alignment and more i have to say i have read other reviews and wow people just don t seem to have an understanding of the world many people complaining about the price must never have bought a aaa game people deserve to get paid for their work and licensing cars costs money let s talk bang for the buck personally i have 180 hour of game play with cms2018 and i a probably paid about what a aaa game costs overall the other thing you will see from people thumbing down the game is most haven t even played it yet the have play times under 2 hours you have to level up to open things to try them so what have they even played yet i love the this should have been a dlc cheap people frankly if it was a dlc it should be priced exactly the same as it is so now what if you are someone that enjoys a good simulator someone that has been a fan of the series and wants it more refined than it was someone that has fun restoring ugly things to looking good or someone that isn t afraid to pay for what they get in life then this game is for you if you are a whiny cheap i never want to pay for anything in life i want it all for free someone that complains over anything and everything then move along this isn t for you update an update to my review after more hours played more of the story done and more of the garage opened wow there is so much more packed in this version than i realized the number of cars is insane a lot of mod and dlc cars that i had in 2018 are part of the base game now just not branded you recognize them immediately i bought the nissan dlc the cars were already in the game imo nissan dlc is not required at this time new from 2018 lathe can turn brakesheadlight wheel alignmentcar washrepair body partsnew auction mode lets you go straight to the car and inspect it before biddingnew auction sells you salvaged cars the junkyard still exists you can salvage worthless parts and then use the currency to upgrade other partsi was reading there are phone jobs that hire you to increase car performance by a certain looking forward to this i am only lvl 15 who knows what else i haven t found yet
