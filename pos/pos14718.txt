2019 i m well aware of civ played it since the floppy disk version of the original game going through all the way around for all the series through out my gaming career still love the series through out different mechanics along the versions now whether this civ vi is the best civ installment or not its debatable but i can still say that it can still live up the name worth to bear the franchise i played only the vanilla version so far but still hands down recommended more if you love the civ series get it on sale though
