2018 after playing this game for a few weeks i can say that dos2 has replaced skyrim as my all time favorite rpg it s that good pros voice acting graphics turn based combat immersion factors all get a solid 10 i haven t finished the game but so far the story is interesting and even if the story ending stinks it still has that draw you in factor as for re playability it s already apparent to me that i ll have to play it again with the other available characters so i can experience their stories there is the main story line and each of the 5 pre created characters have their own stories i chose to create my own character which means i have 3 of the 5 available pre created characters as my compatriots each with their own stories to be completed with my current playthough i m not going to know how sebille or lohse s stories finish out they re not in my party so i gotta play again with them to find out how their stories end an extremely well crafted rpg this one is a clear and unmistakable winner kudos to larian for self publishing to avoid the pressure to release the game before they completed what they intended the game to be you guys got it correct although i m not a fan of third person overlooking the party view point games i prefer first person eyeballs forward this one succeeds in grasping my attention and refusing to let it go i m drawn in focused worried and sssso happy when a fight is over and all the characters under my control are still alive i m almost bouncing up and down in my seat ready for the loot it s a blast to play the only downside i ve felt so far and it s not really terrible is inventory management there s a load of stats and as with any rpg we all want all the stats to be as high as possible well it ain t gonna happen there s the agonizing struggle around applying the puny number of level up points to a plethora of possibilities and the loot that s uncovered has a variety of statistical applications that can be distributed to well do i want this who best to give it to arrrrgh i like those extra points with that but this one has these two stats which one to choose maybe i could give it to this character but then i lose those stats grrrrr maybe i should keep it for later on no maybe i ll just sell it no should i wait maybe it ll be useful in this situation what ever should i do blank it i ll just sell it no i ll keep it for later arrrgh it s involved at times frustrating and can be overly time consuming there s so many items that can enhance a variety of disparet statistics it can be overwhelming it s like a 20 page menu of delicious food at a great restaraunt to a starving man i want it all i ve always been of the opinion that less is more this game does not embrace that there s a lot of items that do a lot of different things and i ve probably spent more time trying to figure out who should get what for the maximum impact than i ve spent exploring i m not really unhappy about that though for me it s at most a minor annoyance there is a crafting mechanism that i could take a deep dive into which some people will do because they like exploring that type of mystery me i try not to be an item hoarding but ultimately i lose out on certain discoveries but hey it s all good y know i may miss out on a side quest here or there but there s too much other content to discover so even though i ve broken a few side quests so far i ve forgotten about them so i just press onward with the quests that are currently before me let me put it this way inventory management can be tedious but if you explore it certain items can open additional quests sheesh as if there wasn t enough to do already oh and if you put a point into pet pal you can talk to the animals which open up probably a few dozen side quests to have fun with i mean why wouldn t you there s only a hundred quests along the way so why not open up a few dozen more awww go on you got the time this game is easily worth the current price of around 40 my favorite gaming experiences have been with rpg s and divinity original sin 2 is now my favorite of all time well done larian
