2017 early access review this game is an absolute blast combining rogue like elements with challenging combat and awesome aesthetics the combat is super fluid and it took me about 16 hours to finish my first game there s a learning curve in terms of items levels monsters etc and upon release in early access this is only supposed to be 40 50 of the total game this is already crazy good value are there cons sure since the game is procedurally generated after playing this game for 29 hours there are certain patterns that i can recognize sometimes the levels just aren t as good as your previous run but then you can just start over again because of the way the levels are generated you also never really loop around which can be really cool in a metroidvania game which is something i do miss at the moment of writing the game has just released in early access and there are certainly features that i d love to see in the final product achievements more upgrades more bosses more monsters to fight etc but for its current price it s absolutely worth it already i can t wait to see what more updates will come along so hell yea i will totally recommend this game to anyone the combat is super fun the music the aesthetics are amazing gameplay is fast paced and has optional challenges in it as well to make it even more compelling to me an absolute blast
