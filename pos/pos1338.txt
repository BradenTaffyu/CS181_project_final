2023 early access review it s simply sims but for men to be honest everything about zombies were always complete boredom for me but project zomboid changed my perspective a lot about zombie themed games if you think this game is just another zombie survival game that you just shoot zombies mindlessly to survive i must say you re terribly wrong about this game project zomboid contains a lot of realism and details that it s almost mind blowing you re the only survivor people you know and you care about are now just craving for your flesh you need to move silent as possible you can and you must always pay attention to your surroundings if you don t want to be eaten alive you need to loot and find shelter so you can fight for your life another day indeed this game can be harsh for beginners but it s actually pretty simple to adapt to zomboid s unforgiving world and learn the mechanics that will help you survive i m not saying you must but if you want to live more than 4 or maybe 5 months which is pretty impressive in my opinion you need to treat your character as you treat yourself keep your character fit by exercising regularly so char won t get exhausted easily you did looted that meals and drinks for a reason it s a relief that game gives some kind of abundance for food items try to keep char s hunger and hydration levels at acceptable rates if your character is exhausted or even worse needs to sleep do not ever try to fight go to somewhere safe and rest try to stay light grab most essential items like food weapons fuel etc over looting mostly gets you killed if you get stratched or get similar minor damage it s not a biggie you can disinfect the injured area and bandage it but there is always a chance to get infected even from a scratch if you got bitten it s game over just take a cup and fill that with a bleach and sip it while questioning your decisions in life youtube video why project zomboid is amazing views 543 316 is project zomboid worth buying in 2022 if you are thinking on trying it out i hope this helps you decide i really wanted to make this video essay review to share how much i love this game and but if you re still alive and you feel like you can take care of yourself now you may want to explore zomboid s open world to get better better gear and other essential items i mentioned map is massive but all of the places are pretty accessible via driving i ve never seen a dev team that much cares about their game and their player base they re working on a gigantic update now which contains map expansions more farming variations farm animals new gears and a lot of things to make this masterpiece even better even game s modding community is a chief s kiss i m talking about elder scrolls level kind of modding variety zomboid is definitely not for everyone it s a hard game like i said even the game starts with these words this is how you died but i think it s better this way it keeps you present and forces you to focus if looting securing a base and fighting hordes are not your thing you can always build yourself a cabin in the woods and start your farming adventure though
