early access review absolutely stellar game its sincerely an amazing thing to experience the development of a project firsthand by way of playing the thing a masterpiece truly folks refusing to play because they dont like the developers opinions on things are missing out on something awesome its been exciting to see caves of qud grow and its a little bittersweet to see the full release on the horizon in a time when half baked broken video games come with a 70 dollar pricetag are a common occurence caves of qud stands apart in quality and enjoyment live and drink
