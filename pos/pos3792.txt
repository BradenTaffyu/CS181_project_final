2023 dear developer you created a very good game the best i played in 2022 please make a sequel and i will buy if you want the sequel to be excellent please improve the following points 1 you need to have a global unit editor a big table list with all units where you can check stats order stats to see who are the best add items change squad if capacity available it is currently very difficult to manage 200 units without such tool 2 hire a good pro to write the story i believe you have cash for that now you quote shakespeare in attempt to sound clever but the truth is it could be much better as many people pointed out its cringy in several occasions you did a good job on some characters these things engage the player and make the game much more immersive and enjoyable 3 put more rpg like features in the game for example i add hidden treasures in some of the maps and give hints through the story or sell a treasure map in the shop or make an npc tell you if you approach him etc ii secret areas for example a cave leads to a new hidden area with tough enemies and good loot4 characters relationships were a nice idea but it would be nice to make it richer and to have more consequences5 we should have more diversity of items some which could enable more team configurations i e making them competitive through item use for example ranger is so poor how could you make it better with an item
