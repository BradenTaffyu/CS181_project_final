2016 early access review i ve heard so many people say that this game is like dwarf fortress mixed together with prison architect is that true probably but having played both those games i would have to say this is more like something else altogether i ve had this game for a long time much longer than it has been on steam if you re looking for a game that delivers on cost to play time value buy this game and go have fun for hours on end watch as your settlers fall in love cry as they get mowed down by raiders laugh as the pyromaniac sets fire to your kitchen chase elephants off your medical crops with a light machine gun start it all again when the sun sets
