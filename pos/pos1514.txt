2019 early access review i remember a few years back some friends invited me over for a nice game session just to chill and have fun they were playing an odd game graphics were a tad lackluster controls seemed stiff but i gave in to peer pressure and got it too i remember how confused i was when first playing no map no super in depth tutorial my friends panicking and me not knowing why long story short i died we all died and i thought the game was just too insane and a tad boring ohh boy was i wrong fast forward a few hours in and i got addicted i adore zombie games played tens of zombie games in my life watched almost every zombie movie out there and project zomboid is the only game to really scratch that urge and wish to experience a zombie apocalypse myself the game is brutal you will die countless times and start over but man ohh man the satisfaction you get when you evade a horde the sweet sensation of finding a working car the joy of exploring and starting up your own base i haven t got that kind of thrill to such an extent before the game is still in early access but dont let that discourage you constant updates improving gameplay netcode graphics weather effects all make me want to see how this game will look like down the line you get a huge bang for your buck with this one even at full price i do recommend playing it with a friend or two things get a lot more fun when you have to kill them after they get bitten long story short 9 0 10 best zombie game i ever played
