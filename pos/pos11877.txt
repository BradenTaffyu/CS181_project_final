2021 this game punishes mistakes brutally but fairly it s always your fault when a run comes to a sudden end so if you re honest about what you did wrong you ll improve which feels great the devs are also very active in testing their own game and watching how the community plays and they make frequent free updates to ensure the meta never becomes stale all around it s just a good experience i nominated dead cells for labor of love steam awards 2021 i nominated dead cells for labor of love steam awards 2022 i nominated dead cells for labor of love steam awards 2023
