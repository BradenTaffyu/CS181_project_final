2015 this game is best enjoyed if you like to hotlap alone or to play in private servers the ai is bad at this moment the official content is a bit poor there will be dlcs career mode is simple premade themed individual races no story no unlocks no car improvements and playing online against random people in open servers sucks bad trolls everywhere you know but if you enjoy the pleasure of driving in a very realistic way even alone this is one of the best car simulators of the last years the mod support makes the game even better with tons of community content as cars tracks or in game apps steering wheel very recommended
