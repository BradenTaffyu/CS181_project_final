i have 300ish hours in the game and can tell you it s a fun game but not exactly replayable achievements are the only reason you d kind of ever want to play it again but some are just straight up grindy like the kill 50 screechers or the godforsaken 50 anglerfish the main issue with wanting to play the game again is because your motivation to beat the game is to find out where the story goes and find all the new islands and once you ve already done that once there s no reason to do it again besides with friends still got 2 achievements left with the game but don t know if i ll ever get around to 100 ing it so it s a fun story game but not replayable least in my opinion cheers
