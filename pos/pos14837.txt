2020 early access review full destruction what more is there to say well a lot the story is brilliant how it is told and how it ties the missions together and makes you care it is all very well done i can t wait for part two there is so much potential the mission structure is very elegant no hand holding and lets you figure it out with trial and error quicksave load is your friend you determine how difficult you want it to be by trying to do it all or just the required elements long periods of mission prep come with a huge payoff when you make it out of there without getting caught while there is some repetition in strict terms steal a bunch of things or break a bunch of things the variety imparted in each mission keeps it fresh and the story keeps you motivated the player is rewarded for just poking around each map there are valuable items hidden sometimes very well around the maps that turn into money you can use to upgrade your kit it rewards people like me who like to spend time looking around vehicles i think the cars are well implemented some of the construction vehicles particularly the bulldozer are a little too fragile to be tremendously useful sometimes boat handling is realistic enough for me i haven t had this much fun with a new game in a long time there are so many different directions the developers could go with new maps and challenges i could see an awesome prison break style level or a time limited teardown challenge in summary it s great the devs really made this into a proper game instead of a tech demo and i m glad they did so before letting it out into the world i am eagerly awaiting updates
