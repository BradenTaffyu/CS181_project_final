2016 i wish there was an eh button for the review because i feel like hoi4 falls into that category i can t really pinpoint why i feel that way about the game either its substantially better than stellaris ie its actually a game and everything actually works as intended but at the same time its not on par with hoi2 i think the reason for that is that what takes away from this game is a litany of small annoyances dozens of tiny things that could have just been done slightly better rather than a single glaring problem for example the ui makes everything just slightly too inconvenient to do its slightly too annoying to move planes up with your troops and if you re fighting on the border of one of the predefined air zones there isn t really a good way to divide up your planes between them the land theater ui is also just a little too annoying to use there really needs to be just a general advance foward command or a way for it to dynamically assign divisions to a front based on current needs the current system becomes a problem when you re rapidly advancing into an area with borders from multiple countries or terrain features like lakes everytime your front reaches one of those it splits into two new fronts which divides your units up based on whichever front they re closer to rather than whichever front needs them the most this requires you to do a tremendous amount of tedious and unnecessary micromanaging to resolve something that shouldn t even be an issue in the first place ie a lake or new border shouldn t split the front submarines are also annoying to fight against once you clear out a country s main navy you tend to just get bogged down dealing with submarines because they start combat unattackable they can only be attacked once they decide to engage but they won t engage against unfavorable odds this results in your fleets just becoming stuck in a permanent unending combat against them which lasts until their country surrenders because they don t need to remain in supply to just sit in a zone and continually force your ships to just sit there waiting for them to surface again this isn t game breaking but its annoying and that really sums up a lot about the game it has a lot of good points and a lot of things that seem like they could be fun but when you get into it everything is just slightly too inconveniant for you to think man this is really a worthy successor to hoi2 i ultimately came down on the thumbs up side for this because despite its flaws its still a decent game and with stellaris and moo being the turds that they are its really the best thing on the market right now given that if you re itching to play a grand strategy game its worth your 40 if you just saw a post about the game on a site somewhere and are looking to jump on the hype train without any real interest in the genre then its probably not worth your money
