2017 to start off i was initially hesitant to purchase this game because of my dislike for it s publisher chucklefish also i am not a big fan of farming simulation games despite enjoying harvest moon and other city empire building sims and 4x games most farming sims seem to reach a point of feeling like another job if you wanted to truly succeed needing to follow a maximized layout for efficiency that being said stardew valley truly captured my heart for several reasons it starts very much like harvest moon in that you sort of inherit a farmhouse and some land and you have access to a neighboring town with it s citizens to interact with you do your farming duties as expected and try to make money to build structures common for a farm upgrade tools and interact with the surrounding environment and it s inhabitants within a seemingly short day night cycle what sets it apart from my expectations was how balanced the overall experience feels there are tasks you will always want to complete short and long term goals to strive for variety of activities to persue each day with little pressure to complete them aside from that which the player puts on themselves there are seasonal and weather specific items and events to find catch interact with but they aren t vital unless you want them to be the sprites color palete music ambience and overall charm of the game are just right you can spend most of your time just farming and going that maximized layout route for highest efficiency if you wanted though it isn t important you can spend more time fishing which is a fairly enjoyable mini game if you can get the hang of it you can forage and explore a dungeon style mining areas with an acceptable combat system you can get married to any townsperson with the single status male or female and have a family when a game like this puts multiple suitors to choose from to form a more serious relationship it needs to give each a variety of personalities and quirks there are stereotypes but they have a deeper backstory and feel more relatable to a player of any age and not so generalized to make them seem like cookie cut outs with expected reactions and desires there are adult themes but presented in a way that is acceptable and understandable to anyone overall it s a very solid game that is more than just a farming family simulator has excellent music great time spent for enjoyment per dollar plenty of goals to persue and achieve without seeming over burdened or underwhelmed just enough feeling and charms without the need for feels 1 word review balanced
