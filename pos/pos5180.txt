2017 three hundred plus hours and i m still feeling conflicted i played through on survival mode until that was patched into something very different then played on very hard after that i never used fast travel though i did use teleportation and vertibirds when they were respectively available the core of the gameplay i enjoy from fallout is still here exploration discovery varying quests to go on but at the same time things are more modular than before the radiant quests quickly become cookie cutter affairs with nothing to offer i literally visited the same school three or four times after getitng a quest to wipe out ghouls there after the first time i d just march through the school and there literally would be one ghoul who d stand up to obligingly provide a target i d kill that ghoul then return to collect my reward when i felt like it still there are marked improvements the game looks fantastic compared to its predecessors though animations are as janky as ever right now i have a survivor whose hands clip into her pouches if she goes into idle stance when certain robots were given the ability to run they weren t given a running animation instead they walk super fast in an animation that would go along well with yakety sax having conversations modeled after mass effect with full voice is a welcome improvement to me it at least gives an excuse to look at my painstakingly modelled character companions are vastly better than fallout 3 though they tend to be a mixed bag with some having genuinely great writing while others flounder in bizarre self contradictory ways like the one companion motivated solely by family that then chastises you for saving a child at your own modest personal cost increasing one s relationships is an obtuse and unclear system that at times will require you to consult a game guide to make heads or tails of one time i made best friends with somebody by robbing a totally abandoned house this impressed him somehow settlement creation is a lot of fun when the clunky lego style construction system isn t frustrating with its unexplained quirks building large buildings to the sky was my favorite part but ultimately it doesn t matter too much by making it entirely optional there s no profound rewards after making two dozen or so havens of humanity i mean i feel a little better after bothering but that was a lot of time spent on something the game fundamentally doesn t reward of course playing without fast travel made them more personally useful for me as waystations and crafting zone but if you re playing the game as designed there s less of a point enemies are improved with better animations and more variety though only modestly so instead of just having guy with gun that shoots at you and creature that charges to bite or claw you also have some tunneling monsters ghouls will zig zag and lunge deathclaws will throw stones at you when out of range but the improvements are slight mostly it s still guns and biting still effort was made some enemies are legendary a stupid way of saying they re damage soaks that contain a random item these are a big deal until you ve settled on a loadout of rare items after which point they become pinatas with more saleable loot perks are now plentiful and can be leveled up but generally don t vastly change things some are still annoying just gating mechanisms crafting hacking lockpicking while others specialize you with numeric bonuses some enable more serious changes like trade routes which become essential if you re into building but they re in the minority in general the idea of a build is dampened a bit as you ll often be just getting into the gating perks right off the bat and not getting to specialize until dozens of levels in the story is the biggest weakness while you have unparalleled choice in many of the system elements the story requires you to settle on some degree of moral compromise unless you pick the boring guys with no ability to change the beliefs or policies of the faction you re with the factions are there to change you not the other way around and all you can do is just settle the score under whatever flag you choose even if it s a way you never wanted to do it for a faction you likely feel distasteful though bethesda likely thought having this kind of forced moral ambiguity was more deep narratively it mostly just makes you feel like a prisoner of the script after all this why did i put in 300 hours and give this a thumbs up because despite all that this is still one of the top open world exploration games out there its most exciting moments are unplanned like that time i was trapped in a house early on in a deathclaw afraid to step out to get slaughtered building my power armor museum over the river beating a super mutant boss with my sword too close for him to wind up his miniguns hell i haven t even started up on mods which will likely improve my experience massively as that community grows and develops so it s flawed but its ambition makes it consistently compelling nonetheless though i ve finished my survivor s story i ll be coming back with mods maybe a year down the road and maybe another 300 hours we ll see
