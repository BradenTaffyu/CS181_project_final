2016 finally ca got most of the things right this time around few things are still missing or have been downgraded such as the siege battles but i m willing to look past those shortcomings overall this is not a typical tw experience tww is a new kind of tw game as it should be dlc is still a major problem but i m not ashamed to say that i m a sucker for warhammer fantasy universe and i ve bought every single one of em but that does not mean that i condone that sort of underhanded business moves
