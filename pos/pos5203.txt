2019 this is a good game but not a great one i find that their settlement building idea is a problem throughout the whole game it would have been a far better game with existing settlements and decent npc s in them the dlc far harbor seemed like the best part of fallout 4 passing off workshop stuff as dlc was a very poor decision hey bethesda if you re paying attention you still owe everybody that bought the season pass three quality dlc if bethesda had learned anything from fallout new vegas this would have been a far better game fallout 76 could have been a great single player game if they had paid attention and learned from fallout new vegas they really should remake 76 as a single player only that works on your computer with a proper story enough of trying to milk more money from the few people that bought that 76 catastrophe since microsoft has purchased bethesda maybe we can finally get some amazing new fallout games in the future perhaps obsidian will be doing another fallout
