2017 early access review this is easily one of my favourite games and it isn t for some people i respect that but i see a lot of red reviews from people who are just plain bad so i thought i d try this opinion thing oxygen not included oni appears to be a fun light happy little game but it really isn t it is clever difficult and will punish your mistakes like an ex girlfriend quietly and of many magnitudes higher than the original offence while not always textbook oni really takes its science to heart rewarding players for considering physics conservation of mass specific heat capacity density etc consider this simple scenario build thing thing needs power build generator build battery in basement battery holds energy electricity emits heat heat rises base begins to warm heat builds plants die duplicants begin to stress out of desperation seal betteries in insulated room base is saved battery room begins to boil batteries start to fail ohdamn jpg get idea build air pump pump hot air from battery room away from base room cools but batteries cant disperse heat in a vacuum batteries break no power storage rolling brown outs in base systems failing stress mounting such is life in the rock and lastly anybody reading about omg outbreak broke mah game the germs in the game behave like germs they multiply and spread stop charging into a biohazard zone until you have the resources to handle the diseases it exposes you to things like wash basins ore scrubbers air filters air locks etc pace yourself think ahead survive
