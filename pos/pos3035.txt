2017 this game joined my top 5 games of all time list i didn t enjoyed top down rpgs like wasteland 2 i find them boring but this game is in another level the story is well done the characters have great voice actors behind them and overall experiencing this game is a lovely ride so much detail has been put to this game from armours weapons side quests random crap on the ground that it is amazing and gratifying that there are still developers out there that make games pure out of love and try to make the best thing ever thank you larian studios for this game oh and the music my favourite is the beast theme the definitive edition fixed most bugs and reworked the last chapter developers keep on giving a year later
