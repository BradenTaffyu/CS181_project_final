2020 so at the time i m writing this review the mandate of heaven dlc has been out for a few weeks now and the game is on version 1 4 0 as a preface i should make it clear that i have read the romance of the three kingdoms played numerous games and watched numerous films and tv dramas about the period so i consider myself something of an enthusiast the only other total war game i ve played is shogun 2 which i love and have a few hundred hours in over multiple campaigns now that the qualifying info is out of the way i can get to the actual review this game is absolutely fantastic and possibly the best 3k related game i ve played it s very well balanced and concise for a game of its breadth with an actually functional diplomacy system for the first time in the series the artwork both 2d and 3d is absolutely gorgeous and the sound design is great particularly the mandarin voice dub which i highly recommend using even if you don t speak mandarin the battles feel great to play and aren t at all a slog the downsides are the same thing everyone else cites lack of unit variety and thus tactical variety ranged and cavalry absolutely dominate the battlefield in this game unit variety is something that s very very likely to come with additional dlcs and patches and what currently exists in the game isn t limited enough to bother me my armies in three kingdoms are already much more diverse than the yari ashigaru fest that was shogun 2 there s also a relatively small number of unique characters compared to other three kingdoms games which is again something that they have been actively adding more of in each patch as well as multiple popular mods to implement more however many of the unique characters that are in the game like the famous and very powerful zhuge liang and dian wei are only realistically usable by one particular faction in the campaign so the availability is limited regarding complexity the game is easy to pick up and takes some time to master which i consider perfect for strategy games i d easily recommend this game to newcomers to the genre and on that note you don t need to be as familiar with the history and the novel as i am i would absolutely still recommend this game to someone who s never heard the name guan yu in their life and so i give this game a strong recommendation to all and hope you enjoy the game as much as i have
