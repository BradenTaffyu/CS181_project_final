2016 for the first time in a long time the battles actually feel weighted which is a good thing i am currently playing as the dwarves and i feel like the lore has been fleshed out very well you really feel immersed in the kingdom you are branching out i do recommend this game for fans of rts as well as warhammer fans i have not come across any bugs in my very short playthrough so far my set up is i5 4670k 16gbs ddr3 ram clocked at 1866 msi 970 i am getting a steady 55 60 fps 55 when the magic fields are heavy in my regions i will post a more in depth review after more hours of gameplay
