2020 i m a 54 year old who discovered the mental relaxation aspect of gaming a couple of years ago i was browsing around walmart and found something called fallout 4 i like post apocalypse anything so i thought i d try it i was hooked since then i ve discovered steam and played many other games some of which i enjoyed but nothing nothing touches the richness of experience that fallout provides so now i m late to trying out 76 but so far i like it the world is immersive and gorgeous i don t really like the perk card system i ve watched several videos about how it works but i still don t get it so basically i m just throwing cards wherever i also don t like the workshop situation i claim a workshop start to build but then when i m off someone else can claim it from me i spent until level 10 gathering supplies and then built lots of work benches all i d need at my first workshop site but when i logged back in it all was gone not much incentive to build which is a bit of a pity for me because i loved the building aspect of fo4 but i m still trying to get the hang of it all and i just love being in the world oh i hate the scorchers and i do wish i wouldn t get ganged up on by mutants or scorchers or anything else when i can t even be at a level where i can use power armor fo76 is harsh when you re starting out but still i wouldn t trade it for the world i ll keep exploring and trying to figure out how to survive in appalachia
