2016 from the outset i would just like to say i do own project cars and have at the time of writing 630 hours but only 16 hours of assetto corsa just bought it people say that ac s more accurate physics simulation over pcars features and looks makes it the better purchase but i beleive that some compromise between ac and pcars would make for a more rounded and enjoyable simulation bphysicsimo the physics of assetto corsa tend to lean quite heavily on understeer much like grand turismo and pcars on oversteer it feels as though every car wants to understeer but the result of this is that assetto corsa rewards you more for precise and smooth driving whereas pcars you can generally chuck the car around and achieve ridiculous lap times in terms of braking i managed to get the settings at a somewhat decent level but the fact that you cannot adjust brake pressure or disk size is quite debilitating the braking quite often feels mushy mushy mushy full lock and so you are severly punished for not using abs which at factory level is simulated quite well pcars on the other hand better handles progressive braking however it s too rare that you lock your wheels which is unrealistic assetto corsa though does a better job at simulating the impact of flat spotting your tires the default setup on ac seems to be heavily biased towards the front brakes and so you will almost always lock the fronts rather than the rears but i immediately noticed in ac i felt way more comfortable trail braking than in pcars in pcars i felt i had a better idea of what needed to be changed in the setup in order to drive faster or smoother whereas with ac you can t really see or feel the difference in two setups you can only judge them by laptimes ac doesn t quite have the level of detail when it comes to tuning your cars and the impact seems less emphasised ffbthis has been constantly praised as far better than pcars but it is hard to describe why because it is based on feeling as with pcars the default ffb isn t great and so it will take a short while to get it to feel how you want but ac has a great custom app that will adjust the ffb strength on a per car basis on the fly ac also has the advantage that you can creat a lut curve to adjust the linearity of your wheels motor pcars however has a greater range of options for ffb which can be a blessing and a curse when i first started playing ac i couldn t shake the idea that something was missing in the feel through ffb and it took me a while but i realised it was the body of the car pcars feels as though you have the road tires springs suspension steering wheel whereas ac seems to skip the springs part the result is you feel a disconnect between you and the car and the game ends up feeling clinical you also don t visually see any roll in the body of the car more later understeerin terms of understeer you can add the enhanced understeer option which is a great indicator through the ffb but i feel that it hampers your ability to try and correct and at times the understeer feels like your set in it you can turn that feature off though and understeer is pretty much the same as pcars oversteeroversteer on the other hand is completely different with pcars you can sometimes feel locked into a spin and correcting it is almost impossible whereas ac the oversteer is more progressive and you can feel the different stages of slip and you can correct it far easier and it feels more intuitive getting the car back straightened out brakingac does a better job of brake rumble and you can feel more accurately when the wheels are locking up and so you can adjust your braking in comparison pcars you only know when you ve locked up your wheels when you try to steer and nothing happens except in an open wheeler where you can tell by looking accelerationthis might come up again later but i feel as though pcars gives you a better sense through ffb of acceleration effects so even if you weren t looking you could better tell whether you are going quickly or slowly track surfaceimo the differences aren t that significant but i do feel that pcars has overdone the bumps a little whereas ac is a little more subtle and realistic but then again pcars the feel of the bumps differs based on springs and dampers whereas i haven t yet detected that in ac visualsthis one should be quite quick it is more of a subjective category but i do feel pcars looks so much better and specifically more involving in terms of the track pcars has ac licked it feels better seeing the trees and waving flags but a pretty track does not a good sim make the cars in ac from the inside feel fake and a bit two dimensional they have nothing on pcars and look only slightly better than something codemasters would do which is a little disappointing because they have ferrari and lamborghini the result of this is you start to feel detached a word that keeps coming from the game and more like a casual observer rather than feeling as though you are in the car the outside of the car is really no better they look arcade y and again it s not such a big deal but with cool brands in the game it is a little bit of a let down one thing i find quite important is the camera shake and movement especially look to apex i think this is something ac definitely needs to work on as pcars gets it right and ac is too sterile resulting in you not feeling the speed of the car you are driving in pcars you get a sense of rush and anticipation when trying to spot the braking zone because everything is speeding past you so quickly in ac you can only really get an idea of your speed by looking at the speedometer contentcarsthis one is a little more tough pcars has many more tracks and cars by default and so the range is a little more extensive and i imagine when pcars2 comes out this divide will only grow larger however ac has those exclusive cars like ferrari lamborghini fiat and alfa romeo which jeremy clarkson says is the ultimate petrol head s car maker and most importantly i think lotus road cars ac tends to lean more on road cars like grand turismo but i think pcars has a better more vast selection of race class vehicles trackspcars has more tracks for sure and has more of the race tracks we all know quite well but i don t think it has more or less variety than ac in terms of the type of tracks ac does however have a nice drift playground the most important thing in terms of content though is that ac is far easier to mod and so there is a literal boatload of cars and tracks you can download again this needs to be taken with a pinch of salt as the quality of the mods are not all that great where as if you get mdmt s modded vehicles for pcars the quality is absolutely mind blowing for a mod but they take a while to make featuresboth have career modes done differently ac is more like grand turismo the careers are a mix of challenges and races whereas pcars simulates a drivers journey through the ranks with race contracts offered based on performance in your class i much prefer practice qrw on pcars as you can drive a setup and pop into the pits with your tires still warm and grab a bit more fuel and that creates more motivation for longevity during practice mode ac has a quite disappointing pit system conclusioni recommend both this and pcars the choice is up to you do you need to own both no should you buy both i say yes overall my impression is that ac is more accurate but far less involving and exciting ac can feel a bit bland in regards to content and overall feel buy ac to hone your racing skills but buy pcars to have fun
