2021 i used to hate this game after a few hours of playing expecting a similar experience to fallout 4 after a while i got used to the new mechanics and started to enjoy the game i think most people like to hate on this game because it s different from what they where used to and the bugs that plague it treat it as a something you re not used to and you might enjoy it give it time
