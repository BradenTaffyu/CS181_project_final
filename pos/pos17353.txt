2020 solid total war game artistically the best of them all gameplaywise an improvement of their core mechanics while i currently only have 439 hours in this game this has been consistently a game worth coming back to replayability is a mixed bag it almost always feels like the most action is in the north some factions feel the same whilst others feel completely different or provide for a greater challenge it would benefit from a random generation mode for the world and different factions overall 69 75 very good tai hao le
