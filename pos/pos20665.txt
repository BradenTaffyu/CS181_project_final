2022 a true masterpiece can t recommend this game enough godlike soundtrack awesome story characters extremely well written dialog great balance between serious sad matters and really humorous funny ones absolutely stunning environments no matter what you look at it feels like it s an artwork on its own satisfying fluid combat with lots of stuff to find and get gradually more powerful customizable combat with different skills which are all useful and add a bit of unique flavor to the battle very enjoyable alternation of combat story and environmental puzzle solvingfor me it was the first gow i played while i don t think it s absolutely necessary to be able to follow the story i highly recommend to recap the story of kratos for the previous three games to better understand his motifes and decisions
