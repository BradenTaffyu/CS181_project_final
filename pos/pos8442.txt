2023 i got this game last weekend because it came in really good sale bundle i had heard of it but never really looked into what it was i am so glad i gave it a shot yet somewhat regretful because i have become so obsessed this game is frustratingly difficult i love it even if you think you have everything set up perfectly it can all come crashing down within seconds but it is so worth it when you finally reach the end of a scenario it s a city builder with resource management and harsh survivor mechanics each scenario sets you up a bit different but beyond resources and labor you need to also maintain hope and discontent levels of your people for most scenarios at least you can lead your people down a path of faith or order hold religion over your people s heads or rule them with an iron fist all of these needs are constantly battling for your attention and you re never truly in an abundance of any needs being met a decision you make early in the game could be the reason for your downfall 5hrs into the game later this game has massive replayabilty i usually never replay games but i can t stop redoing scenarios to achieve different results not even to mention the variety of difficulty setting you can play with the game is still worth it on its own but the expansion does a really good job of changing it up while still feeling like the same game making gameplay feel endless i can not wait for the sequel to come out next year i would love to see some spin off type titles to go along with the world building they ve set up they leave some of the lore loose on purpose but i it just leaves me dying for more answers
