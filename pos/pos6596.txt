2015 honestly i don t even enjoy playing video games anymore i feel so dead and empty inside all the time nothing gives me any pleasure at all the only reason i play anymore is as a distraction from the hole inside my heart i come home from work and have nothing else to do because i m so exhausted so i m just like what game should i play euro truck simulator 2 every time anything else requires too much commitment i have to learn how to play the game and all the meta which isn t worth it since i couldn t possibly enjoy anything at this point but this is just comfy as and immerses me in a world where i m far more successful and own a small trucking company i have 3 lil truckers in my company and i like to think about who they are what they re doing and that s half the fun when i fire people i like to imagine myself pulling them into my office at the garage like cameron uhh noticed you brought home a profit of only around 300 euros 3 trips in a row and then huh yeah it looks like you couldn t even find a job and charged me 588 euros for maintenance and fuel i mean honestly i ve already hired your replacement jeff why don t you finish the route you re scheduled for and hand over the volvo to jeff i m sure he ll do a better job than you you piece of edit due to the rising popularity of this review a surprising number of worthless neets have somehow found it appropriate to send me friend requests to ask if i will buy them a copy of this game i have no idea where you guys get off thinking this is an okay or normal thing to do it s rude enough to directly ask a friend to give you a gift but it s a whole nother level of delusional entitlement to think it s okay to ask a stranger to spend their money to buy you a video game if you were considering adding me to do this try adding me on skype instead so i can make eye contact with you while you kill yourself
