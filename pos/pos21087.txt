2016 early access review i thought i was being clever by platforming my way over a wall turned out the developers were one step ahead of me and put stuff on the other side of it plus a way to get back and then i got a jetpack the developers were still thinking ahead of me and made lots of neat platforms and cliffs to climb to so once i was done skyrim ing my way around i started collecting slimes and bringing them back to my ranch to snuggle and everything was fine forever 10 10 would cuddle blobs again
