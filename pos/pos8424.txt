2019 excellent atmosphere and many solidly designed systems are slightly held back by there only really being a couple of correct ways to play the game both of those also require the same exact early game to be followed to a tee on any difficulty above normal with the hardest difficulty only being doable with favourable randomization despite this restriction the various story modes and scenarios tweak available resources and provide unique challenges which add a surprising amount of replay ability that specific strategy that was the only way to beat one scenario on hard mode might even be impossible to pull off on another worth the cost at full price for survival strategy fans but at 50 at time of writing it s a solid pick for anyone who appreciates atmosphere and or hard choices ratings disclaimer i m harsh i ve worked on cutting edge vr tech so it takes a lot to impress me a 3 5 is good graphics 4 5lots of little things come together to make this game look so nice and there are some surprisingly appreciable graphical options if needed such as disabling various screen space effects sound 4 5the soundtrack could use a little more variety but it never really felt stale to me either as what is there is very good and suits the atmosphere perfectly decent sfx and an excellent score help make the great atmosphere that keeps me hooked however there are only a few spoken lines in the whole game and you ll hear them fairly regularly but not repeatedly gameplay 4 5lots of tech options and a good sense of freedom the concept of concentric city planning and building is surprisingly addictive story 3 5while the setting and lore is very strong there are certain story elements that sort of have to happen in every scenario triggered by a new building or law enactment for example which get old when once you ve seen them a few times a little variety in that regard would make subsequent playthroughs feel more like a new story usability 2 5the game s only real shortcoming is some difficulty in finding out what you should actually be doing and what you re doing wrong there s a tutorial but you ll never really feel prepared for what is thrown at you until you ve failed several times even if your first game feels like it s going well like mine did you ll suddenly find that just scraping by isn t good enough but a mostly solid ui and an easy to access set of tutorial tips keeps this from being an insurmountable hurdle i recommend visiting youtube first if you want to play on harder difficulties there are a lot of things you can do wrong without even knowing it overall 4 5despite the initial frustration i love this game but i thrive on problem solving and overcoming challenges if that sounds like you don t miss this one p s trying a new review format because i know how much i appreciate reviews like this feel free to review my review p
