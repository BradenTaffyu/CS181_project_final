2021 full underground base chemfuel stored in a granite room with no cables in the walls so i figured it was safe a zzzt event set a colonist on fire who fled into the chemfuel stockpile the stockpile exploded destroying the wall between it and the hallway the initial explosion was fairly well contained but the heat from the fire raised the temperature in the communal hall to several hundred degrees in about 15 seconds then all the furniture caught fire as well there was nowhere for the heat to go and relatively little space to heat up so it turned the whole place into a furnace even the coolers caught fire then the food caught fire the communal hall included all the hallways that went throughout my base ironically to make temperature control easier so there was no way to get out of the base other than to go through the communal hall one dumbass died in the initial explosion three caught fire in the halls before reaching the shelter of the adjacent rooms those already in those rooms caught fire as they were dying of heatstroke the communal hall reached over two thousand degrees celsius there were no survivors
