2020 i ve been playing this game for years and i m very happy to see it come to steam i don t know exactly how many hours i actually have but i m sure it s well over 3 4 000 sometimes that is a mark of shame and sometimes that is a mark of pride is it still worth playing hell yes i ve been playing for many years and i still find stuff to do every single day will you enjoy your time that s for you to find out everyone is different and what people look for in mmos is no exception imo this is one of the greatest mmos ever made but that does not mean it isn t without flaws the content releases are few and far between but there is so much already here that s not necessarily an issue sometimes ea has been known to flex their cash shop muscle in annoying ways and i won t lie this community is one of the more toxic ones i ve been apart of there are some very good people who play and will give you the world but there are also a ton who will put you down for breathing the wrong way turn chat off when you re not enjoying group content and you ll probably be much happier if you like star wars and a decent storyline you will love this game and all of its branching paths even after finishing the 8 class stories there are ways to play those stories differently on a second run it s entirely possible to lose yourself while creating alternate characters and imo that s a great thing also it should be mentioned this is probably the only mmo where you can bang several npcs yes that is an important feature bioware did not forget their hopeless romantics and perverts just saying first a few bits of advice if you subscribe once you get all current content permanently and that is a lot of content after you do so if it s only the access to content you re after you no longer need to keep subscribing the free to play version was improved recently and now you can have up to 1 million credits at a time this will still get you decently far even in the game s current economy get a legacy bank and put your money inside of it this bank is legacy wide meaning you can access it on multiple characters you can do this by buying the dromund kaas or coruscant stronghold it s very cheap and placing the one you get in the mail anywhere inside of your room note you may need to level your legacy a little bit when you re about to go over 1 million credits store it there add the security key app to your phone and connect it to your account you get 100 free cartel coins cash shop currency every single month that is a big deal it adds up quickly you will not regret it when you first make a new character press y they don t tell you to do this make a legacy give yourself a last name for all your characters do it asap because you ll want to level that baby it s important if you do subscribe don t waste your time in the cash shop everything in the cash shop you can get in the game without spending real money by simply farming credits there are many many many ways to farm quickly but there is a guide by swtorista which explains it best go find her and watch a bunch of her videos she s great the real value in this game are the 8 class stories and the dlc story content this is not an mmo where the end game actually matters or will even go anywhere if you find a friend group interested and they re fun to get involved with fine but if you re not enjoying the storylines there is very little point to playing don t skip the cutscenes the first time around give this one a fighting chance when you re leveling even on free to play you can skip most of the side quests there are a ton of them stick to the story and do all the heroics on every planet you ll get the gear you need and likely be appropriate level each class has a buff they can share with other people when you finish a class story you can use that buff on other classes this is why some people can share all 4 buffs at once if you re enjoying the game leveling each class type only 4 bh trooper sw jk agent smuggler inq consular might be a decent goal to keep in mind and finally don t fall in love with quinn he s a jerk kidding if you ever want to know more check out swtorista s guides she s an old gem and has a whole series dedicated to the steam players coming in this game isn t terribly complicated to get into or even play especially for people who are familiar to mmos but they might help should you need it i hope you enjoy your time i know i have
