2022 came from shogun 2 this game has way more mechanics and the artstyle is an acquired taste the battles are very weird imo where in shogun 2 a charge could wipe out a unit these charges feel very weak from all units other than cav and heroes i dont know why but every unit feels like theyre fighting with foam swords and constantly route with 90 of their guys alive only to run back in lose 5 more guys route run back in and repeat i still like it but mainly for the diplomacy now much better than shogun by miles
