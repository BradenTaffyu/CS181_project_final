2023 where to start with this game i guess it s fairly easier to simply say that the only thing that should detract you from buying and playing it is if you happen to strongly dislike tactical rpgs that s the tldr bullet points below if the game s tactical combat seems interesting to you and you re looking for an entry game into this specific rpg type i d say this is absolutely perfect and even more so if you already enjoy other subgenres of turn based combat i think the classic difficulty is satisfyingly challenging and adequate for the average person who would consider playing this but you can always change the setting if you so wish in other words given what i said above i also think that it is extraordinarily hard for someone to dislike divinity original sin ii if they for any reason are interested in it already and in an attempt to convince you further i shall also note that you can expect an enormous amount of freedom in how you approach almost all situations exploration that feels natural and engaging and extremely well designed areas a wonderful combat system which paired up with your own strategy and creativity becomes even more rewarding even if frustratingly difficult at times premade characters that are very well integrated into the story all are worth having in your party they will undoubtedly be one of the most important parts of your journey in fact their own journeys are awesome some more than others as with everything of course the game is not perfect some shortcomings become more evident as you play on but in truth it is a beautifully crafted experience and one i can point to and say it achieves excellence in a way only this medium can achieve the story may be a bit fantasy baseline bland for some but it is satisfying given everything that surrounds it even if the last act can feel a bit rushed the overall experience is honestly for me a 10 10 a big piece of advice i can give you is to explore everything you can naturally but if you feel stuck for some reason and or are facing enemies above your level consult an area level map just to direct you example divinityoriginalsin2 vidyawiki com towards the areas you should clear before advancing especially for act 2 fortunately we are in the age of easily accessible walkthroughs i would cry otherwise as my first rpg of the sort i leave with a new favorite game some characters and an experience i ll never forget and as a fan of larian studios my only regret is not playing this sooner
