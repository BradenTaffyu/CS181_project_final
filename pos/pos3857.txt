2022 i got into this game thinking it was going to be anime xcom it s much more than that the missions can be an uphill battle but i can always go back to the previous ones if i need to getting my party leveled up and even adjusting the speed of both my party and the enemy s if i find it to be going slowly there s a long list of masteries to unlock mostly through battles and it was admittedly very intimidating to see after a couple of hours and a useful guide i completely understood how fun it actually is to mix and match them honestly a fantastic game and even without a sale the price for it is more than fair for the hours i m getting out of it
