game time long enough for a cup of tea short average long to infinity and beyond price there is no price worth the price if u have some spare money left not recommended you could also just burn your money bugs never heard of minor bugs can get annoying assassin s creed unity the game itself is a big terrarium for bugsrimworld is an achievement of game creation and shows how a game doesn t need mind bending graphics or a life altering soundtrack to be truly amazing with three different storytellers and 6 different difficulties the game can be as easy or as difficult as you want if you want it can be a casual base building game where you can make a thriving utopia and be the pinnacle of civilization on this chaotic nightmare of a planet it could also be a nightmarish hellscape of difficulty that leaves you questioning your sanity as each and every one of your colonists desperately clings to the last remnants of their fleeting hope while snorting yayo to numb the pain of their missing eye graphics and sound look it s a base building game from a top down perspective and your colonists don t have arms games released in 1997 had better graphics but its art style is delightfully charming nothing ever looks confusing colonists often are differentiated enough that you can tell them apart from a glance and the pop of color is never overwhelming the soundtrack is very repetitive due to the cyclical nature of the game but the accompaniment never detracts from the moment and after you lose your 9th colonist in a bandit attack you ll be grateful for the sound of familiar calm music at sunrise the next morning gameplay i would be willing to bet the reason most people quit the game is due to the learning curve nothing is particularly difficult but the game certainly does have a learning curve to it there are hard lessons to learn tricks to base building and defense construction and ways to manipulate the system that the game does not teach you yes you could easily look up a few tutorials or suggestions online but part of the charm is learning through failure due to this however you will lose a few colonies and that s okay the game isn t necessarily about escaping the world although that is the premise story that point brings us to our story it s simple ship blew up in orbit you re not sure why but it really doesn t matter because you re here now and you better build a shelter or you re going to die the entire game is spent attempting to research technology to increase your colony s quality of life and eventually escape however the true story of this game lies in what you make of it do you want to create a colony of pirates and raiders you can do that do you want to create the wealthiest colony in existence profiting off of trade and using your vast fortunes to build sprawling colonies of extravagance you can do that do you want to be a minimalistic cannibal starving your colonists by forcing them to eat human flesh and augment them with bionics and drugs to turn them into super soldiers you can do that the true story of rimworld isn t the escape its what you do with your time and how your colonists progress a 17 year old tribal girl missing an arm may spend 10 years with your colony mature into a hardened badass get married lose her husband become addicted to hard drugs and go on a murderous rampage after eating one too many meals of raw food the story is in the people and what happens to them in your attempts to drive your colony towards a specific goal cons there are very few i ve come across only a handful of very small bugs during my playtime and none that drastically effected me small quality of life improvements could always be implemented though many of them can be fixed with rather popular mods and most are personal preference over any sort of fundamental design flaw the developers are active and care about this game and it shows conclusion rimworld is one of the best games on steam the money is well worth the purchase and it is quite easy to lose hours upon hours of your day to this game it has the civilization effect of one more day but these days are spent fighting off robot attacks and figuring out how to provide food for the seventeen huskies that you ve let breed out of control go get this game lose a few colonies and discover the joys of rimworld in short 11 10 it s okay i guess
