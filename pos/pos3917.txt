2021 buy the game this was on my radar since it was released on early access i had the suspicion that the game was different and grabbed my attention and damn was i right before getting into the review i want to clarify something the game is very rough specially in areas like ui animations and english translation i will get into those later but if you decide to play the game which i really recommend you do know that it will require some effort from you compared to other games with that said lets get into the review the best the best part of this game are by far the developers when all you see in the gaming industry is fake apologies trend chasing blatant cash grabs games designed from the very start to be as monetisable as possible with the biggest market appeal that it can have and then see a group of devs that are trying to make a game they want to play and to prove with actions that they care about their playerbase to an insane degree since day one and continuing to do so every day makes me want to do everything i can as a consumer to see this game succeed and do well passion projects like these are things i want to see more inside this industry and just for this reason alone i would say the game is worth supporting the good the game has some things that are very well done one of them specially stands out to me which is how the devs are able to make story and gameplay tell the exact same thing solving the issue of ludonarrative dissonance an example of this is how at the start of the game the game tells you how in the lore the way the troubleshooter companies make money is not through missions themselves but through selling the loot that they get on said missions this is echoed in the gameplay you barely make any money out of missions directly and most of the money you get in the game comes from selling loot there are a few things like this where the thing thats being told in the story correlates to actual gameplay and that is amazing almost every videogame this aspect up from 1 person games to aaa studios and its great to see it be well executed more often than not another very good thing in this game is that the gameplay has a lot of depth with very good potential to make builds that really feel different in this game swapping 1 build for another can make the character feel completely different to the point where you can barely tell its the same character if you get used to a specific build this gives a lot of freedom and room for players that like the game to really sink their teeth into it same thing with the story there is a lot of content in this game thats entertaining with interesting characters that develop slowly over time and are not one dimensional this game doesnt rush the story and it really benefits from it other games feel the need to cram a whole character life story in 30 minutes before they stop growing or showing more sides of their personality thats not really a problem that this game suffers from although the writing quality varies between characters speaking of characters there are some fantastic characters in this game they feel human and flawed just as proper characters should be presented the story is also presented in a way where it hints very heavily on what characters think or feel but dont tell you outright this game respects the player enough to allow them to connect the dots themselves something you just dont see in other games where you are treated like a child that needs everything explained to them to make sure they dont get lost in a simple character interaction the game respects you as a player and that is so good the mediocre and what could be improved the translation to english is the most obvious thing to mention for most of the game characters are just speaking in a weird manner but you can still understand what they are trying to communicate but a few times across the game you will just have no idea what they are trying to say its extremely rare for it to get that bad though also some core aspects to the story require knowledge about south korean society or google to understand an example of this is the spoonage and the idea of spoon class theory en wikipedia org if you are not aware of this while you are playing the game you are going to think wow the developers are really hyped about food utensils another issue the game struggles with is pacing at the start of the game the game feels very aimless and slow during the first 10 hours or so of the story later it becomes more interesting but i think a lot of players wont be willing to spend a long time waiting until it gets better but if you can push through it s worth it another issue i want to mention although its mostly solved in the newer missions is that the game difficulty relies a lot on volume of enemies the way they make the missions harder is just by throwing more enemies at you rather than make a smaller number of enemies be significantly tougher and deadlier this would not be a big issue in of itself but on fights where you are fighting against 30 40 enemies at once with no option to disable enemy turn animations hence taking a good 3 5 minutes between every action you take can be quite frustrating so an option to simply disable enemy animations on movement and such would really speed up the game it eventually gets tiring to have to wait so much between character turns again this issue is pretty much gone on the more recent missions in the game now there are less tougher enemies which is a much smoother way of handling the difficulty the bad most of my issues with the game are quality of life related but they are mostly related to uithe ui in this game specially outside of combat when you are at the base is not refined at all an example of the clunkiness of the ui is for example how when you are trying to equip a mastery you dont have but have all the necessary materials for you are not given an option to instantly create it from the character build menu you have to exit the character menu go to the mastery menu find it craft it then get out and go back to the character build menu and equip it when creating a new build you could easily go through this process 15 times another example is eating at the bar the display info of morale gained when eating only fits 8 characters so once the animation ends they play another one to showcase the ones that didnt fit in that first tab wasting a few seconds on info that could have very easily displayed all at once with either multiple tabs displayed side by side or a bigger tab fitting everyone these things are very minor but they add up and the game would feel a lot cleaner and less clunky if these quality of life issues were fixed another big issue i have with this game is the location of the story it s supposed to be a city but it often feels like it is what the writer needs it to be at that moment in the plot sometimes it gets treated as a city sometimes it gets treated as a country it s nebulous at the start of the game they make the idea of citizens moving between city districs as a big deal but then during the gameplay you go to all sorts of different places are we still inside the district when we go to the forest is this the whole city do troubleshooters have a special permit to move around without restrictions its not that well explained in my opinion final thoughts even with how rough it is i still love this game and really recommend it i just wish there were more ways to financially support the devs and help them financially to keep the game going and im sure the community would love to help out with the translation to english we want to help more even if its just financially
