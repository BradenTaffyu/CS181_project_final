early access review don t expect a total war game in therms of battle frecuency it is a city management game your focus is going to grow your settlement and keep them safe from hunger but then it integrates that element of battles to add realism to the whole city builder genre first vs raiders then vs a strong ai that is gonna require you to have a strategy from the start and here there is an element that i don t think anyone has pointed out the area where you start is random and is going to force you to adapt and if you add to that the development and policies tree you have an element of old rts game aoe style that is what is going to add that replayability 100 recomended game still needs content but considering the price tag and that it was made by only one developer i think if you like this type of genre you will enjoy it a lot
