2017 early access review my summer car is an open world survival game i suppose so but that doesn t explain it well finnish barryboy simulator 1995 is a game that doesn t help you or hold your hand it plops you into some backwater nordic town in the mid 90 s theres no tutorial or objective other than your motive bars hunger sleep etc but there s a garage attached to your house with all the parts for a datsun 100a or cherry think 1970 s nissan micra a tiny little japanese car that you can build yourself piece by piece tune upgrade and even use to compete in rally s nothing can quite describe the satisfaction you feel when you first get that piece of s engine started obviously parts alone will not get the car started you re gonna need oil coolant brake clutch fluid and a new fan belt and maybe some mods and you re going to need the time to do it motives ticking down so you re going to need money theres a few ways in game to make money and you have access to 3 other vehicles that can be used to pick up this stuff and perform jobs these 4 vehicles are essentially the game little blue van based on a version of the toyota hiace you can use this to pick up your drunk mates down the pub when they call you you can use it to pick up stuff for the car or food and drink and for all you alcoholics out there it can only store up to 100 crates of beer it behaves quite realistically the back end is boaty when its empty and the van is prone to tip more as it s top heavy and the engine takes a little bit to start when its cold and you need to let it warm up a bit before putting it in gear because it runs on diesel yes diesel it runs on diesel just making sure you put the right one in when you get fuel because some people might have put petrol in there tried to drive off and think the games bugging out when the engine explodes not me though i m smart innocent whistle occasionally people will call up and asked to have their septic tanks drained for money fortunately you have a septic truck which is based on a finnish sisu m series m 162 lorry truck which has 3 axels rear one can be lifted for more speed and better mpg at the expense of stability and the air brakes have realistic air pressure things i didn t see in any of those truck simulator games you can drive up to the peoples houses put the pipe into their drain and suck away their crap what you do with the waste after is totally up to you my personal favorite is in a policeman s face at the speed traps the sisu can also tow wrecked cars which can be sold for scrap theres also a tractor when people call up asking for lumber you can go to the barn near your house chop up some wood and fill the nearby trailer you can then use the tractor to tow the wood filled trailor to the person s house in give them your wood insert smutty inuendo here the tractor can also be used to tow your car if you happen to break down or crash somewhere and survive and you can use it to tow wrecked cars stashed around the map but i recommend you use the sisu lorry truck for that if you truly love cars this is the game for you yeah theres no ferrari s or anything flash but its the best car mechanic simulation game i ve ever seen the building and tunning is the closest i ve seen to real life theres a few bugs but its a small developer and they do patch it last patch was xmas 2016 and they threw in a wrapped present containing a flashing neon light for your cars interior and a bottle of vodka the graphics aren t great the people look horrible for example but it doesn t effect gameplay it is realistic and yet it doesn t take itself too seriously and it s full of charm humour and love and finnish easter eggs something that big budget titles lack these days it just needs more everything more cars jobs maybe a motorcycle but it s definitely worth every penny of the 10 99 i paid for it if you re okay with no map and hand holding this game is a real gem
