2020 where do i even start with this if i had to choose one game that is the most well crafted has had the most heart and soul poured into it it is rimworld from its release until now the developer has slowly cultivated this game into something truly unique it s hard to explain but if you re thinking of buying it you probably already have a good idea about what it is so i won t go into the gameplay specifics this game holds a special place in my heart as it was the game that lead me to steam i have so many memories about watching all the youtubers most of whom are dead channels right now play this through this game i found out about more small indie games although this is definitely not a small game anymore which ultimately led to me buying a pc so i guess you could say that this game in a way considerably changed my life i want to give a long review about this but i just cannot put it into words if you aren t sure about buying it maybe my astonishment can serve as a deciding factor for you and before i end this i can t forget to mention alistair lindsey he made the music for this and believe me the music is something else good job
