2021 editing my review to note that the latest patch has fixed most of the technical issues with the game i haven t played with it myself but it seems to by and large fix most of the issues pc players were experiencing i can t say enough good things about automata everything from the gameplay to the story has been crafted with a specific purpose in mind i think this game is best experienced with as little knowledge of it as possible not only when it comes to the story but also the mechanics of the game you ll get the most out of it if you allow yourself to get immersed into the story and it s characters if there is one small gripe that i have with the game is that there definitely are some parts that can feel quite padded you will be revisiting the same areas multiple times for separate side quests and sometimes the things you need to get are in exactly the same area as the previous quest took you to considering all the items you pick up in the game all look like a small glowing orb a lot of these side quests can end up feeling as if you are simply retreading your steps for a very slight reward but you could argue that this gameplay loop ties into the bigger philosophy of the game itself if you absolutely hate redoing the same content you might not like that part of automata s design very much the dlc includes new costumes for the character s in the game alongside a great extra bit of story from some characters that are mentioned but not explored in the base game i loved the way it fleshed out the story for me the dlc for this game is just as good as the base game and since it comes included with game of the yorha edition it s a really great bang for your buck if you are an achievement hunter this game is a pretty easy one in which to get 100 completion some of the trophies are a bit more grindy to get but there is an in game way to reduce the grind to near 0 once you have completed the whole game tl dr all in all it s a fantastic game with tight gameplay and an amazing story the soundtrack is stellar and it creates such a cohesive atmosphere that it s hard not to fall in love with all of it just mod the game before you get started and get ready for an amazing ride if you re like me you ll cry more than once
