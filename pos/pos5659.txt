2023 i m not sure what it is about the mount blade series that i love so much bannerlord has horrible diplomacy terrible ai no way to actually rule a kingdom meaningfully you re a ruler in name but can t direct armies that you don t lead yourself for instance however the gameplay is just so good no game gives the same feeling of progression going from having no army and no money to being a millionaire leader of a kingdom is magnificent this game is something you just have to try and enjoy
