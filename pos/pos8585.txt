2019 3 out of 5 stars i explane why because it could easy got 5 stars lets start with that i think the game is great it s fun it s huge lot s of missions and stuff to explore can recommend the game if you like hunting this game is really cool my thoughts on pros and cons pros lots of locations and huge maps lots of mission and gameplay you can play this game forever they are still updating the game they still come out with new content its fun and easy to hunt but still a little hard to stalk your game track and so on they got that just right lots of different animals you can hunt and different on each mapcons they want money for every little addon the weapon selection could be bigger they could add fishing hunting dog but it looks like they are working on that fish you can allready see in the water i think the character is a little too loud especially when you got an backpack just the smallest one will add so much extra noise no mods that could really be great if they open up for that so why i think that they dont deserve 5 stars right now i and many more have a problem with the game and the gpu i googled alot and found out many have the same problem some gpu s mid high range crash the game with the note that the gpu hung and the game had to be ended it started after one update of them i have talked to them tried to contact them multiple times in the end the answer i got was we are sorry that you cant play the game anymore come on what kind of customer service is that i found out that i have to underclock my gpu to play the game without crash i have a gforce 880m with 8gb and i found hundreds with the same problem and if they cant fix something that bothers so many then i cant give them 5 stars but if you look away from that then the game is awesome
