2020 very nice maps decent animals look great behave somewhat realistic most of the time very convincing soundscape mostly luring animals with calls animals make some scary noises some animals can be aggressive although some like bears could be a bit more new scoring system is more fair coop is usually working like it should quite some dlcs but no microshit rare for this genre tracking by inspecting literal sh t weapons are somewhat shallow callibers don t really fit well with eachother performance wise very limited zeroing 3 step only unlockable by 2 perks only a couple of scopes with quite a grind to unlock them and the same for each weapon class although you only need to unlock them once some common hunting attachments missing like supressors some basic features like freelook missing no immersion stuff like compass and watch or something like that no skinning cooking eating some ambient bird sounds are really loud keep playing and even seem to move with player sleeping costs money not a lot but still water cant be traversed can be really annoying canoes would be great in some maps like layton and yukon weather sometimes changes like every minute game could use some more birds on the various maps no dogs would be interesting to track animals without the glowing but with dog 23 11 20 update 23 10 2021 meanwhile dogs have been added did not try them yet but they appear to be appreciatedmy advise would be walk around map need zones by following tracks dont expect to walk into animals when making a lot of noise then when you have some interesting zones try to ambush them at the right time especially drink zones map ranking somewhat personal but i wouldnt recommend the last three unless you are looking for their specific species i feel like vurhonga cuatro and parque are a bit bland terrain wise just a heightmap with vegetation however vurhonga adds a lot of unique species and the openess kinda fits the theme silver peaks is nice but doesnt add a lot of new things medved has also some overlap but has a really unique atmosphere yukon also has some double species but the terrain is really epic and also features some dynamic weather yes1 yukon2 medved3 vurhongamaybe4 silver peaksnot really5 cuatro6 parque weapon packsi would pick only one or two with weapons you are really interested in when bought you can get the weapons for free from the store
