2016 this is easily one of my favorite games of all time i had been anticipating its release for some time i am not going to write an exhaustive review as there are many other great ones already just know that this game is a great mix of harvest moon zelda animal crossing as a big fan of those games this scratched that itch and more i often worried because of the small developer i would see shortcomings or glaring flaws not at all this game is stellar in every way and vastly improves upon systems in all the games it was assumedly inspired by i wholeheartedly recommend this to everyone that ever enjoyed games like terraria harvest moon zelda and animal crossing
