perfection what a ride i am a bad player not really used much to crpg really one of the first i played i failed over and over again restarting game completely rolling new characters several times trying different cmbinations of classes then i finished my character main story quest at hour 200 and final game about 20 hours laters full playthrough took me around 80 100 hours game is hard requires you to know what you are doing at many occasions tutorial doesnt really prepare you on what you are about to face there were times i was frustrated when i was nearly throwing mouse across the room story wise it was perfect perfect down to the last minute detail i am writing this review minutes after finishing the game what the ending did to me is hard to put into words i am moved in world of aaaa games which i think it stands for long scream into the abyss with same developers creating same games over and over again dulled empty and repetetive i was given something authentic something with soul buy this game give it a try even if just as me you wll need to go on vacation from it for about a year it s worth every peny no it s actually worth more as a 30 years old dude i was given my childhood back dear larian studios thank you thank you for this absolute perfection of world thank you for allowing me to once again feel joy between long days of overhours at my job you raised the bar so high that i fear i might not enjoy anything else in a long long time i cannot remember when was the last time i valued a game so high perfection
