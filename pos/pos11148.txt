2019 a perfect management game with a lots of good humour i m very happy to say that it is a true spiritual successor to theme hospital dedicated not only to those oldschool folks like myself but also to new players that have never played the original two point hospital through some unknown mysterious to me power manages to strike a perfect balance in mixing up old enjoyable gameplay known from all old tycoon simulator games with up to date comics like graphics bunch of good humour and excellent yet vastly simplified strategy mechanics and like original the game can be a bit hard around the edges but nothing comparable to theme hospital it s very enjoyable experience to finish all the goals and advance through hospitals it took me around 75 hours to finish everything and that doesn t take into account dlcs that i m yet to try i can very happily recommend this game to all people that are looking for a good management builder as long as managing your own hospital sounds like something you d be interested to do i very much hope that we ll see more of two point in the future if all the successors will be as polished as this one maybe we could even revive the tycoon genre and make it great again my wet sadly unrealistic dream good job devs if you liked my review you can find more of them on my profile and on my curator page
