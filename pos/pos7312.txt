2017 i have no idea how realistic this is compared to a real truck and i do not care this is fun a lot of fun with so many reviews before this one there might not be anything to say that has not been said they did a great job condensing the areas of the cities that i am familiar with i ll bet the rest of them are just as good if for some reason this is the only review you have read of this and are still wondering if you should buy it stop wondering and add it to the cart you will not be dissapointed i recommend this to anyone who already enjoys driving simulators and games i also recommend this to anyone who is wondering what it is like to drive across america it will take a while but eventually they will have all the states that are able to be reached via truck be careful the scenery might distract you with it s detail
