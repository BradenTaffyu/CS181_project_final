2021 early access review my first foray into 7 days to die went like this after getting through the tutorial i met up with the trader then proceeded to accept a quest from her to gather supplies from a location about a kilometer and a half away en route to this location i happened across an abandoned hardware store and decided to investigate during my visit i encountered several zombies and a zombified guard dog all at the same time i managed to survive but with severe lacerations a broken arm and leg and an infection i had the supplies on me to splint the broken limbs and bandage my laceration but they still took some time to heal and the infection wasn t going anywhere i retreated to the trader but she had no antibiotics for sale which meant i was on my own for the infeciton i attempted to move onwards instead coming across an abandoned hospital reasoning that i could likely find medical supplies yet to be plundered or spoiled inside i girded myself and broke in fighting my way through several floors worth of the undead midway through during a quick outdoor run through a small open air garden to get around a barricaded part of the hospital i discovered birds could be zombified as well and was promptly attacked by a flock of the rotten budgies i was able to fight them off but this upgraded my infection to serious and gave me a fresh laceration thankfully i had located bandages several floors went by and no antibiotics the infection was progressing rapidly at this point and the undead were showing no signs of thinning after several hordes and an encounter with some strange zombie that ran on all fours but thankfully was at dodging makeshift arrows i was able to make it to the rooftops of the hospital upon travelling upwards i found a huge cache of ammunition however i had no gun i left it lay and continued onwards to the rooftop peering carefully over the edge i saw no less than a dozen zombies led by one that seemed much larger than the others by now my food supplies were exhausted my water supplies were running low and i had no means to make a campfire to replenish either deciding to declare bollocks to this i carefully made my way back down out of the hospital upon exiting the hospital i found out that bears could become zombified as one spotted me in the parking lot and thus was the end of my survivor s tale as i also discovered humans cannot outrun bears at this point i almost gave up until i noticed that it was past 4 00 am and that i d been playing for four hours solid so clearly the game is doing something right verdict very promising start for an early access game 10 10 would get mauled to death by a zombified yogi bear again
