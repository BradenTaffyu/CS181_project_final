2016 first off if you have never played any of the previous fallout game s and like sandbox gameplay like shooter game s plus with some rpg elements then just go and get this mixed feelings here but even tho with all the dumbed down things the game still goes out to be pretty fun and valid for its price buyer beware i d say grab it on a sale even tho with the 60 price tag the game still provides enough value while taking a more streamlined approach this time to appeal to larger audiences it isn t all that bad sure many disappointments but many improvements also as well its a best story here for a bethesda game the bad blurry texture s terrible u i many a i bug s some poor pc controls many clipping issues physics related bugs many shallow side quests lacking dialogue not many choices no fov slider missing options a horrendous amount of loading screen s many performance issues specially in cities poor facial animations and lip syncing at time s skill tree and character progression has been dumbed down by much degree the good mod support good hit detection one of the best sky box great music and sounds a big variety of weapons beautiful scenery at times one of the best character editor some pretty good side quest s a bigger amount of companions overall really enjoyable game play settlements farming and much more vastly improved combat no longer feel s wonky main story has it s good moments not the best but still weapons are really well modeled same for the animations many new mechanics as well a inclusion of radiation storm legendary equipment items weapons etc carried over from skyrim great presentation the artworks the icons animations for the all things all thing s to craft up modify weapon s armor s chem s grenade s power armor s good sand box game play due to the fact you can make your own structures and so on lot s to explore there s many thing s which aren t even marked on the map as place s where you can find some neat fine stuff great particle effects from laser beams to explosions as well you can destroy cars now the concept of power armor has been significantly improved no longer it feels like just a re skin of a usual armor instead its got its own hud a power management system and lots more in depthso here we have one of the most hyped game of 2015 it was did it live up certainly not for many but the game isn t bad specifically people who haven t played the previous ones i can say will enjoy as well including old fans who have a love and hate relationship with the game but one thing s for certain this game in average won t provide the fun of making a second play through as we did in the previous fallout s the a i it s one of the major frustration s here from companions to enemies companions will get stuck in stairs walls not get in elevator in all they won t follow around perfect they won t be of much help they will aim badly general npcs enemies they will sometimes not be able to find the path or just glitch out this is what s called poor a i simply i know i know it s a huge game so it should be common but come on after many years they still haven t programmed the companions to get out of doors in all it s not that bad but it adds up to frustration specially with the companions while other than that it s fine generally in combat as well there s more options now on what a companion can domuddy textures it feels as if a blur thing is always turned on hdr specifically in daytime is way to bright really not suiting for the eyes easily one of the best explosion effects night specially does look good great sky box much of the particle effects have been seriously improved in total the graphics aren t really bad as people say sure not for today s standard but pretty big improvement the collusion detection is messed up it s always been like that over the course of so many year s they still haven t managed to fix it up cats lying on peoples heads dogs going under the ground things getting attached to npcs not really kidding one time a hellmat got attached onto the face of my dog fallout 4 a screenshot of fallout 4 by jangli fallout 4 a screenshot of fallout 4 by jangli now lets talk about optimization is it optimized well or just a average console port well unfortunately it s the second answer it s a bad console port but not as bad as arkham night that s just another story but here the game is 30 fps locked requiring you to change it up from files really and there is many many areas which lag for many people such as a specific tower area and so on as well people with monitors that have more refresh rate then 70 are in bad luck as running the game more than 75 fps causes the physics to break up as well many bad technical problems after a month or so i wanted to play the game it just wouldn t give me any audio i ve tried doing the directx fix the audio settings but nothing s worked at all as well there s much other problems like these it can be a lot better as well with the 30 fps lock for starters adds up to similar as a console port character progressionits really down graded from all the previous games the special skill things are gone take the small frame or many other ones for example in over all it s just been dumbed down in terms of the fallout games but it s not bad actually compared to other games out there it offers a lot it s just not in tune with the fallout games down graded from the previous games for sure but it still offers a lot compared to other games in the market could been better but what there is isn t badthe dialogue being the main thing of all the previous games its just disappointing just to take a more casual and similar to mass effect game s approach this doesn t help at all the choices are really limited compared to almost all of the series seriously lacking while not terrible but lacking is the word i ll usenow lets jump to the conclusion while a disappointment for many including myself its still a fine game despite its technical problem s and so why because i can still go on my own adventures and not give a frick about any story or any missions i can be that i can go out and collect good i can go out with my companions and raid the out of raider scum the sandbox is also really great specially with the building mechanics now there s a lot of variety turrets houses defenses etc as well with the inclusion of many new mechanics it really adds up for a more fresher experience radiation storms crafting base building and so on in all while taking a different turn from the others in the series its a really enjoyable game there s easily more than 50 hours game play value here which in terms is perfectly appropriate for a 60 dollar game you ll have many adventures you ll have many disappointments as you progress but in the end you are gonna still have fun which is why we play video games
