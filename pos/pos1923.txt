first of all i got way more hours into this game than it shows here i played on and off from 2012 up to this very day i skip years then come back and play for a year or two and drop it again on the ea launcher and only recently i installed it via steam i think i have at least 1000 hours or more the base game is a letter of love to star wars fans more specifically star wars the old republic fans the worldbuilding is beautiful the lore is consistent you have fully voiced storylines and even sidequests and planet quests all the way to level 50 or so there is a lot of content to unpack and explore if you really love star wars you will be immersed in the story and the characters the bad thing is the gameplay itself being a mmo it is very dated and grindy by default full of boring quests mundane activities and backtracking it is not engaging specially if you are playing by yourself updates made the game a lot easier than what it was when i started playing i bet you you can be very casual about it and you won t struggle to kill any bosses or progress you can play clicking with your mouse instead of using keyboard biding and macros the endgame and current state of the game is where things get scuffed even if you love star wars you will be playing space barbie and collecting fancy things for your character to use or for your in game house devs make dodgy decisions to say the least at times repressing negative comments all expansions post vanilla content stray further and further from the original storylines that made this game so great and don t get me wrong i like them but we had 16 different unique storylines that got somehow merged into one there is no possible way you could retain the quality of them all pvp can be fun but it is broken also no servers outside us europe so if you live in sa or asia you get used to play with high ping this game was made by bioware on its apex and you can tell by it s great worldbuilding and dialogue it was incredibly good even if the mmo aspects of it always held it down in my opinion what really killed this game was ea terrible decisions over the course of many years first and foremost they gave us a amazing storyline but even at its prime the mmo aspect was always lacking and this was supposed to be the wow killer at its peak but it lacked too much wow content they made the game free2play but they ostracized f2p ers like they were the plague nowadays is not so bad but back them f2p could not even equip artifact items had incredibly low credit cap couldn t use dyes received way less xp could only play 5 matches of pvp per day even if you paid money to subscribe for a while or buy premium currency you would become preffered but still be very limited the game is limited for free players still but way more lenient nowadays this was one of the biggest mistakes players specially in a multiplayer game are content this is proof by the fact many games nowadays make themselves free to play to attract as many players as possible instead of treating their free players like garbage like ea did i am a lonely person but even for me this game feels way too lonely at times i remember playing with planets full of people hanging out in the cantina doing raids and pvps in group you can still have some semblance of that nowadays if you join a guild or a discord or something like that i guess it feels almost wrong to recommend this game because of all these flaws ea s greed mediocre devs bland gameplay bad endgame but the original vision for this game by it s original developers were good they were onto something there unfortunately they were victims of ea lack of vision and pettiness who made a supbar mmo with a great singleplayer story alienated it s free playerbase and never bothered to expand to sa even though theres lots of star wars fans here as well this game goes down in my books as one of the most missed potential of all time the foundation for something great is there but it devolved over the course of many years and years of bad decisions pilling it up and corroding the integrity of the game ultimately i think this game is a easy skip if you aren t into star wars just play some other singleplayer rpg instead like fallout skyrim witcher elden ring but if you love star wars i think you must at least check the original storylines because the expansions are lame and flanderize the characters the endgame is boring the community is kinda dead the gameplay is boring however this game is the only game to this day that truly lets you be a jedi a sith a bounty hunter a smuggler a stormtrooper or a imperial agent this game remains to this very day even with all it s flaws the ultimate star wars experience you can get
