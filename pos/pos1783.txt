2017 nier automata is an amazing emotional experience and i liked it so much that i even played it on the playstation 4 after i beat it on the pc including the dlc it is an open world action rpg by platinum games and square enix with intense hack n slash battles and a fantastic story which slowly unfolds itself during several playthroughs and over 30 hours the main protagonist is yorha unit 2b however she isn t the only playable character but i don t want to tell too much about the story since it is an important part of the game the music is simply terrific and it s so much fun to just explore the world while listening to the pleasant tunes i found myself just staying there or riding an albino boar enjoying the scenery and soundtrack a lot the english dubbing is also very well done and not annoying at all but you can switch to japanese as well if you like the game also features many great mechanics swords can be leveled up by collection the necessary parts and with the help of various plug in chips you can not only improve your skills but also add hud elements for example you can get faster do more damage with your swords raise your health bar display a mini map and much more by killing enemies or as a purchase in shops you obtain lots of chips after a while to make the game way easier but beware if you die you lose your entire chipset so be quick and grab it from your dead android body before it vanishes all together i love nier automata play it it s worth it glory to mankind
