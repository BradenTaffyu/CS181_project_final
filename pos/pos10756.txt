italy focus all of their power to the free american empire while the rest of the world just sits and watches and donate some divisions every once and a while after many nukes and many slaughtered californian hipsters the americans surrender breadsticks and wine were enjoyed thoroughly in rome that dayedit 6 26 17now don t get me wrong paradox s dlc policy is absolutely terrible although there are so many incredible free mods out there for this game that give you a never ending enjoyable experience the ceo of paradox released a statement basically saying he will not give into a mob in order to sustain his position and power it appears that an authoritarian coup d etat has succeeded in the company if you want to protest this dlc policy don t buy it and leave a bad review because they don t care about what you think they just want their money and that is exactly what you re giving them just download mods and free content probably not worth the original 40 price tag because of the lack of variation between most of the countries on the planet in the base game only 8 countries off the top of my head have their own focus tree which leaves many important countries like spain and china with the same goals and focuses as other less important countries like el salvador and luxembourg which as you can imagine is a problem after you get into it and begin to have an understanding of what the hell is going on during the course of a playthrough you ll find it to be shallow if they added more custimization to domestic affairs such as border policies and tax etc the game would be a lot more enjoyable since there are long periods of doing absolutely nothing but waiting vanilla game i d give it a 7 10 including the current dlc as of june 2017 probably an 8 10
