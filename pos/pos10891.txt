2016 are you a hearts of iron 3 player that never managed to learn the game or are you new to the series and not sure if you should try it out well hearts of iron 4 is definitely the place to start the tutorials are nice and the game is much more easier to get into than hearts of iron 3 was even though the game has been simplified in ways it still provides quite a challenge and if you re a veteran player i would definitely recommend this game for you too the game isn t as complex as it was before so it s way easier for a completely newcomer to paradox games to get into it after a few hours of toying around in the game and watching some tutorials the graphics in this game are a huge step up from previous paradox games and the game really looks gorgeous the diplomacy feature has been vastly improved and it s always intriguing to plot coups in other nations and boosting your own party s popularity although i do miss the intelligence system quite a bit as i currently see no way to steal tech from your opponents or spy on your opponent s military movements overall rating 9 10 definitely would recommend few quirks here and there but overall an amazing game
