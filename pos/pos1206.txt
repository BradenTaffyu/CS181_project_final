2019 early access review criminally underrated survival horror game the approach on the zombie thematic culturally speaking is the same as in majority of movies games and books no surprise on that what this game really excels however is on the build in atmosphere that goes around it the music is a masterpiece one being the base lines on the huge atmosphere this game packs easily dissecting on how dark horrible and depressing a zombie apocalypse can could be being either played solo or coop the experience gets better if you play with friends although it still it is great even on solo the objective is simple build bases and scavenge abandoned cities full of hordes of zombies while the minor of the mistakes could be your very last survive as much as you can read books to fine your skills build defenses and stack your food because day after day the horde grows further and stronger really challenging detailed and addicting game super recommend it
