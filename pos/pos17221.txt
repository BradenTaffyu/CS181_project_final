2019 total war warhammer 2 is a really good game with a lot of content and a lot of extremely hard to justify dlc pricing the game itself is actually really good it s total war of course it s good a mix between a light 4x turn based game at the top layer and an extremely solid large scale rts at the battle layer with diverse troop choices compositions and heroes for each faction with a level of aaa polish that makes you grin every time you watch your horde of little dudes smash into the other sides horde of little dudes this all is rather derailed a little by the dlc it s staggeringly rough paradox levels of rough the dlc not counting total war warhammer 1 we ll get to that is about fifty five dollars canadian about two thirds of the price of the game itself when they re not on sale there is it must be said a decent number of free dlc as in content updates rather than balance tweaks and a genuine commitment to support on the part of the developers with continuing tweaks tw w2 introduces mortal empires a way to voltron together it and its precursor into one giant slightly impractical game with every faction from both games playable this of course means you ve got to actually you know own warhammer 1 and all its dlc if you want to use those factions it s a slightly piss taking proposition they still have a lot more respect for warhammer fantasy than games workshop has for quite a while and it s certainly in line with that benighted company s own spirit to charge through the nose so i suppose fair play there if you re in it for a warhammer fantasy experience you re not getting anything better than this you want a game you can play for weeks at a time right on just y know don t buy it unless it s on sale because by sigmar are you paying a lot of money
