2023 early access review caves of qud is one of those roguelikes that s pretty deep but isn t totally inaccessible to the regular masses part of what makes caves of qud in my opinion is the ui you can use traditional controls which consist of just keybinds or you can explore the menus with the click of a mouse then you have your skills on the bottom too which helps with knowing exactly what you can use at any given moment i only wish that there were better ways of introducing the players to the game i know the game has done so much more in regards to having the useful data available immediately and it s all well written that you re not really left to guess the mechanics of the game starting and playing the game is an entirely different thing though there s a mod out there that has a friendly tutorial that s limited but works well to ease you in to the game i recommend people look at the workshop for it after you buy it to give you a decent shot at enjoying the game also look at some gameplay guides on youtube they re immensely helpful even if they re a little old the base game hasn t changed much so pretty much everything in regards to playing the game are still largely the same
