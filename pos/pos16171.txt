2016 awesome engine that can run nearly any tabletop game just check the workshop for yourself there are tons of good games that you d prolly never know existed or be able to play due to region price age or w e it s also a good way to test a game before buying it physically tts still being constantly updated and the community s really helpful when you don t know how to perfectly play the game try read the rulebook or something beforehand tho we all know that playing a tabletop games on the pc isn t as swift to as it is irl but that s the price we have pay for not having to move to other ppl s places if it s even possible everytime you want to play a few games at least some of the game s functions can be automated with scripts is the modder has the patience to do it and no one has to clean the table after flipping it
