2017 if there was a neutral review that is what i whould give this game thehunter is a very pretty game with lots of land to explore and i mean lots a good but not great animal variety but they are planning on adding new maps and possibly new modes like fishing etc as they mentioned in their livestreams multiplayer is good and the servers have no issues though i whould say that the game needs an in game voice chat though for group hunts this game is in no way pay to win and has a grinding feel to it with starter guns you will be left tracking down that male moose for hours intil it either disappers or you just give up that leads me into the next argument bugs bugs bugs the animals ai is good intil its not animals will constantly get stuck in trees and ruin the atmosphere and that bit of proudness when you kill an animal sometimes you cant even pick up that elk you ve tracked and your just sitting there looking at it animal tracks sometimes say the animal is going one way when they arent most commonly though is when animals just vanish they will go through water btw you can t go into water litterly vanish when you shoot them and leave no trail but most commonly they somehow climb ridicolous mountains that are impossible to climb im talking straight up steep walls that not even atv s can go over the reason in this review it is labled reccomended is because despite the bugs this is the best hunting sim out there they have a good premise and dont get me wrong the game is fun but it sometimes feels like its in beta stages i will admit that this game is beautiful and one of my screenshot s from the top of a mountain in my wallpaper 6 5 10
