2022 this game is a great game if you re just getting into the cms sim games but it is not so when you ve played cms before i am a long time fan of this series and i ve been playing the games ever since cms 2014 and i was having a blast and then 2015 came along and i had even more of a blast even though that game was a bit boring and lacking in content the real turning point in this series was cms 2018 it introduced so much new stuff into the game new cars new parts a repair table tuning dyno more tools more customization more skills the ability to buy used cars and flip them for a profit it was great fun and i was really excited for cms 2021 i picked it up on release and after 10 hours or so i realized this is exactly like cms 2018 with a fresh coat of paint some new cars and a few qol improvements here and there we ve been waiting 3 years for this everything you can do in cms 2018 you can do here it s no different except for some new mechanics and i say new because these mechanics are in cms 2018 but were recycled and improved for this game overall this game is really disappointing for old fans of the series but it s a great game on it s own for people who have never played cms before
