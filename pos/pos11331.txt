2016 early access review so i ve had 7dtd since they first dropped it for early access i played it a bunch even when it was still very rough cut and rough cut it was but i still had plenty of fun with it and was especially impressed with the building physics and support mechanics that force you to build something structurally sound the drawback however is that it used to be a bit of a grind and the grind overwhelmed me a bit so i took a very long break from playing more than a year to wait for some updates i just came back last week and was not disappointed they overhauled the crafting system added a leveling system complete with tiered perks and skills that train as you use them combat is a lot more fun now that they added a ton of animations to the zombies movements and attacks they changed the way materials gather from sources so that the game is much less of a grind survival especially in the beginning of the game is still pretty brutal and unforgiving unless you have good luck the challenge is definitely still there if you like zombie survival games give this one a chance and be patient it beats the hell out of all the others i was worried for a while because updates have been a bit slow to come out but i m just glad to see that these guys aren t rushing production like so many others and when they drop an update it s a fatty i still have hope this is the best zombie survival game on the market already ifinitely better than dayz infinitely better than h1z1 and it s only in alpha dig it
