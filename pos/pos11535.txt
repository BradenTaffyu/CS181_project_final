2020 early access review this review is updated for the game releasing to 1 0i want to strictly express this game is way better with friends but it still playable solo but can be more difficult i had friends introduce me to this game it truly blew me away being very replayable going from staying overnight at a small station to making my own base and taking on to looting factories and military camps and bases playing solo is very possible but can be a bit more difficult juggling more duties playing co op is more feasible with your friends taking on roles like the mechanic farmer cook and so on solo you are doing everything i always loved making the comparison of this game to minecraft i always get the itch to play for both games they both have an insane amount of crafting resource gathering and base building however 7dtd is more focused on loot as much as you can to survive i won t spoil what zombie specials and variants there are that is for you to find out survivor just make sure you are prepared for the day 7
