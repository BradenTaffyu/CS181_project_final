2016 a generally relaxing grind game if you like clear set objectives and earning your way to bigger and better things you ll very likely enjoy this game my company is big enough now that i can just cruise around and see the sights while my employees earn the big euros for me i find it really pleasant to listen to the radio while driving to a place on the map that i ve never been to before i also really appreciate that the development team constantly adds little tweaks and improvements for example finally being able to set my own destination on the gps one minor but annoying aspect is the limited number of drivers you can hire i know there are many many drivers to hire and it may seems pointless to offer any more but i ve hired every single available driver and there are still lots of cities where i haven t built garages yet point being i want to hire more drivers but can t apparently i have single handedly reduced unemployment for a whole section of europe
