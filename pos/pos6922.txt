2020 early access review usually i don t write reviews but the raft game is really worth it raft is a survival game which puts us in the middle of the ocean you ll immediately notice the small sized raft you re on we have to start collecting materials from the sea immediately planks palm tree leaves plastic etc to be able to expand our boat otherwise we ll perish thanks to the shark swimming the closest things are getting interesting when our raft is big enough for us to sleep on a bed build a grill for preparing food or a purifier for cleaning salt water and even have a research table close by to come up with new plans once a new material is found e g ore or copper from the depths of the sea it can be added to all plans requiring it as a prerequisite later on we can start growing our own vegetables plant our own flowers or trees and can start building our own pieces of furniture to make accommodation feel more comfortable anchoring will be important in case we wish to explore the islands we find vegetation on these masses of land can be quite lush but we should also pay attention to the precious ore or junk found underwater spear and bow will be at our disposal to fight the shark that is lurking close to us at all times those with a more strategic approach can use fish as bait to lure the creature away crafting and exploring with a friend is a joy in this game there are some glitches here and there and there are many more things to be added but raft still offers many hours of playtime in its current state it isn t a very pretty game but it has acceptable graphics day night cycle happens quite often and looks nice after all there s an achievement that makes it a must to be ashore for over a year if you liked the forest and you are not seasick pick this one up when on sale
