2022 i never thought this game would be the game i go to at the end of the work day one of my fondest memories would be the times my family drove across the united states visiting friends and family across the country this would be in the mid 2000 s and the cars dashboards had defined red blue yellow and green colored lights the cars all smelled the same when you hopped in them after they sat in the sun for awhile i remember my family borrowed a friend s 1998 chevy suburban that was a navy blue the suv was heavy and took bumps on the road like a champ i fell asleep often to the droning sound of the wheels on the road and the click clacks you hear when going over a bridge all these sounds colors and locations i associated with positive memories i guess that s why i feel so connected to the way america is simulated in this game not only do i get hits of nostalgia but i love the business simulator side of the game i m addicted to working towards buying new garages and filling them with trucks and employees so we can beat last quarters earnings finding the best contracts and depots to operate out of is always fun and going on long deliveries seems to be therapeutic i don t have a lot of time outside of work between college classes and spending time with my 2 year old son ats is perfect for me since once i get home late at night i jump into my game put on king of the hill or futurama on my second monitor play for 1 2 hours and call it a night
