2016 early access review this game is wonderful i have never written a review before but i felt like i just had too with all the super greatness this game shoves down our throats there was some bitterness to the taste where did the story go please don t tell me that the whole story is being told by e mail i do realize that this is a work in progress so i am sure that the story elements will be better developed later on as far as game play mechanics go perfection run jump jet backs vacuum gun all of it perfection even when you try to catch a chicken and it decides to fly off in random directions i m really upset i played this game as early as i did i want more and i want it now can t wait to see the final product
