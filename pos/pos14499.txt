2023 civ vi a monster of a game absolute beast in scale and execution but not perfect problems will only become apparent after more than a hundred hours into the game to sum up seasoned veterans will lament how the world seed and ai progression delivers a somewhat on rails experience meaning creativity is sometimes stifled because that s not how the game wants you to play and theyve already planned for this in the scripting and the seed generation where you start every game has already been calculated by seed balancing to ensure equal strengths over the course of the game so sometimes its noticable when you veer of that track how the game limits you so trying to settle in lands you re not supposed to can make unrealistic barbarian hostility or settling near a natural wonder far from your capital will make other civs hostile to you or just accidently roaming the seas and uncovering land that is good for settling where the ai could have settled but have not yet but would give you an advantage to settle there will cause the ai to aggressively settle there like their maps show where you ve explored many things like that overall a very accomplished title in the series yet one hopes the developers dont fall over each other trying to deliver a balanced consensus of a game as civ vi represents an evolution of the formula clearly taking inspirations from the feedback from the game and its players over time lest it become contrived in its purposes and not find its roots in being a groundbreaking title
