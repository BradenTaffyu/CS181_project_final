all the main endings are done and to be honest the story wasn t as good as i thought it would be all the other things like osts gameplay combat characters etc were surprisingly good but as i said i might be thinking like this because i haven t played the replicant or the drakengard yet the story was underwhelming i m not saying that i hate it but the final was just an ending not a heartbreaking soul crushing unforgettable masterpiece as the community says i d give it an 8 out of 10 tho
