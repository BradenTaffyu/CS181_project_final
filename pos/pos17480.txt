2016 i ll start with this ooooooh man is this game pretty i ll follow up with this ooooooh man the game runs like a dream so yes i find it hard to describe the feeling of quality the game radiates everything just seem to have been worked on until it s as they wanted it and nothing else the feeling i get is like the perfect mix between total war and heroes of might magic all the factions are different not only the units but they also have a faction specific feature like offices for empire raise dead for vampires and so on playing another faction really is another faction and not just recoloured units with changed names battles are tough the ai uses cavalry units so damn well i keep getting surrounded and hammered on which really have me watch how i do battle more carefully lords generals and heroes agents now have a very solid skill system much like a roleplaying game when they level up also heroes can actually be in the battle with you you really get the feeling that this is fantasy and that these people are something out of the ordinary as i said above it s like the perfect union of total war and heroes of might magic
