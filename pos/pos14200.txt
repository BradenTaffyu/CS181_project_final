2023 the depth this game provides is just crazy it s the reason why oni is probably one of my all time favorites eventhough my laptop is about to explode everytime i play the game but especially the dlc with the new radiation system and the increased importance of space travel is amazing oh and the workshop support is also really nice playing on the minibase and on titan was really exciting d it s actually a shame that i ve been playing this game for only 449 hours at this point
