2022 as a licensed b double driver i can can definitely recommend this this game with steering wheel shifter and a ranger splitter with a vr headset is hands down the best trucking experience out there i also use a hotas x56 throttle i use for windows suspension up down and headlights and all peripherals connect with no issue the depth to the audio the raindrops leave lines wherever your window was open till the recently tweaked lighting it all adds up to be so realistic and immersive its breathtaking at times i could honestly see this as a driver training aid
