2021 long review below perhaps one of the best star wars games you can play nowadays from a role playing perspective i m a huge fan of kotor 1 and 2 and swtor did not disappoint there s unimaginable story content here even as a free to play player so you ll be rocking this for a long time before you ll even think of subbing even though it s worth the price in my opinion just a word of warning please use the official swtor site to sub since the steam method can mess it up in the sense that you ll end paying but you won t receive the subscription in the game that aside what s swtor about timeline is set after kotor 2 but the first two games aren t necessary in order to play this one even though there are many throwbacks and characters that are related to the first two the story takes places thousands of years before the events of darth vader and it s not connected to any of the sw movies in case you disliked or hated the movies this world is something else entirely the events take place in a massive all out war between the republic and the empire vouching for supremacy over the galaxy you start as a pretty much nobody and you ll have to crawl your way up through each faction to become a force to be reckoned with you can pick between 8 stories each character has two sub classes and these are split into 3 skill trees damage tank healer the stories you can play are solid and you can become quite invested if you can pick a path that resembles your preference or personality type your faction does not inherently define your character you can play in the empire as a good guy trying to change the empire s view or methods and shape them in your vision you can play in the republic as a bad guy or where the end justifies the mean evil and good are just points of view here by the end of it no side is clean or without flaws you define the way the story goes and how characters get to perceive you a similar game that comes close to swtor is dragon age origins which uses the same engine graphics aren t bad in the slightest the lightning in particular adds a lot to the atmosphere of each planet or location you ll visit the soundtrack is great authentic using both movies and sounds from the first two games while coming up with some original ones as well the sound design is good and the acting is top notch which can get you quite immersed into the world as you keep playing however expect to grind quite a bit as each quest or mission requires you to explore and kill plenty of enemies as a result you ll be fighting quite a lot in order to finish part of the story but play at your own pace and you ll be rewarded there s lots of activities to do many planets to explore items to find and quests to complete flashpoints and story missions can be done with friends or alone though later content will ask that you play with several party members that s where guilds can become quite handy as a multiplayer game there s pvp content pve and a few modes such as galactic starfighter where you fly a ship and fight other players the game engine is a little bit outdated so combat may seem a bit strange or clunky at first but if you are able to pass its shortcomings and you love story based games then this will draw you in swtor has quite a few expansions that add many great hours of gameplay and continue your character s storyline the best part is that now two of them are free you ll end up playing for hours and hours as you keep leveling up meeting new characters and build up your team followers decisions you make throughout the story do have an impact on the world in the game and can have long lasting effects obviously it s not a perfect but it s quite different and an interesting mmropg you can try many cool armours in the game are quite expensive through the cartel market but the galactic trade network or other players can sell them for a decent price even without paying a considerable amount of money you can get a decent looking character you ll be comfortable with i can t say that the game is all that fair with its prices some items are quite expensive but most of it its cosmetics which you can do without lots of good looking armours can be bought for cheap prices or can be found in the game for free so unless you re too picky you ll enjoy yourself as it is the main downside is that it does a poor job at explaining what stories you should go for after you finish your character s main storyline i highly recommend you use a guide on the internet to see in what order you should play your missions so that you avoid confusion or miss out on content should you pick it up for the story most definitely should you pick it up for its multiplayer it has more ups than downs but there are flaws will non star wars fans enjoy it try out the smuggler republic trooper imperial or bounty hunter classes they re great for people that are new to the genre so yes is it a good mmorpg yes and no it has its good parts and bad parts do i have to subscribe you can play the game for many hours doing lots of things without paying a penny but the game will limit your inventory the amount of credits you can hold and other annoying features that will be an inconvenience nonetheless there s a lot to enjoy without spending money during the pandemic swtor has been a blessing
