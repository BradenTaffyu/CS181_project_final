2023 early access review for me this is one of those games where for most of the play time i couldn t put it down it was a lot of fun building up to the next milestone and just today i was still having a blast with it even though i had completed most of the tech tree and upgrades and my most ambitious dyson sphere was well under way around a distant star with a good energy bonus and then like a light switch i realized i had pretty much seen everything the game has to offer but could either continue to scale up for the sake of scaling up or stop there and i closed the game and will probably never play it again its weird how it goes from one extreme to the other so fast maybe that s just me still highly recommend if you like automation games
