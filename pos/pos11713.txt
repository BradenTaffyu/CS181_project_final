2018 early access review pre alpha 17 i would recommend this game but as i tried today alpha 17 when it finally came out i dont like it exactly as i though i will not like it everything is now so damn slow animations upgrading blocks etc stamina getting lower all the time is annoying same with health after the first day trying to get somewhere to set up a base i am now stuck at 56 stamina that doesnt regenerate beyond that got only 63 health as i got attacked by 2 dogs and 5 snakes at a car camp that had literally nothing inside and that wont go up either and is stuck at that with this stamina i can run for like 3 second and i am out i cant even break a door without running out thats probably the most annoying part another part would be the god awful fps worse than i had in alpha 16 especially inside buildings thats really bad on top of all those bad changes there is another thing those blueprints u cant learn because u need skill for them so u have to carry them around like an idiot with that very annoyingly limited carry capacity the more u carry more u are slow like if it was not enough that we were already having trouble with inventory space that brings me to the other thing the inventory its just not good i hate when u are slow in a game and with this u are slow until u get high enough level to unlock those slots which is imo just waste of perk and i wish some other perks stayed in the game instaed of that and scrap that whole overencumbered system another thing i noticed the difficulty i play on lowest i am a builder and i like to rather spend time building disturbed by as few easy to kill zombies as possible however with this patch it seems that is gonna be a problem with lowest difficulty setting i still had to kill 20 zombies to enter one house and they were for sure not one shot 3 or 4 of them were the fat zombie lady and 2 other fat zombies thats kinda crazy never happened to me before in alpha 16 that i would have so many zombies in a building the only positive i would say atm is the lightning it looks really nice also nice textures of wood and stone buildings but hard to enjoy with really bad lag hopefully things are gonna get better when this comes out of experimental
