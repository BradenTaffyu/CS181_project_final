2021 i bought this game on a steam sale a couple years ago and never played it for some reason i kept telling myself i didn t like the play style of a top down rpg and so this game sat collecting virtual duststarted playing this a few days ago and i can t put it down this is a true rpg unlike most games that claim to be the story is awesome immersive and seemingly never ending there is so many secrets puzzles and tricks that i just can t put the game down for the first time in a long time i want to explore every inch of the map talk to every npc amd solve every puzzle i m 20 or so hours in and haven t even finished the first act of the game definitely recommend picking this up
