2021 early access review the game is shaping up and the result is promising to say the least it s already far beyond the previous mount blade and each update brings something new the performance is okay and content is plentiful but it s a sandbox first and foremost despite many small quests you are to entertain yourself it s good because of endless possibilities and playing style but it becomes repetitive if you like to be narratively guided instead absolutely worth going back each month to see what has changed and to give yourself a new challenge a new siege a new type of weaponry to master or probably a new kingdom to found and rule
