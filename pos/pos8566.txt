2019 i have nearly 400 hours in cotw and had 250 hours in thehunter these games are by far the best hunting games i have played to date maps are beautiful lots of selection maps and animals solid multiplayer experience i ran into my first real issue with the game this morning after 386 hours of play time and after posting my issue i had one of the devs respond in 10 minutes with the fix i needed i don t really ever write reviews not a good look but given the amount of play time i had to write one for cotw overall for the money you will spend on this game every penny is worth it 10 10
