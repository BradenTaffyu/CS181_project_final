2017 this game is a lot of fun but some servers are really bad espacially in darkrp you are hardly able to drive a car due to lags but if they could fix this it would be perfect i like the most that the gmod community is very active and there are all kinds of things available in the workshop if you play alone it can be very boring sometimes but if you have a headset i definitely recommend a headset because the game kinda depends on voice chatting espacially in darkrp or in ttt when you want to do a shoutout you will find some new friends very quickly i would give a rating of 8 10 because the game is a lot of fun with friends i like to play ttt on my private server we are just a few people and not on an online server with 20 people or so buy this game its really great i hope it helped you out xd
