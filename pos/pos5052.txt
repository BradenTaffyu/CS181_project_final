2015 the game detected my hardware and instantly set the graphic settings to lowi feel so ashamedbut in all seriousness the game is rubbish in so many aspects story is super duper weak when compared to fallout 3 s weak story most of the gameplay revolves around just shooting raiders or supermutants for idiot farmers skills have been removed so you re a jack of all trades in everything now they put crafting and settlement building to appeal to the minecraft kidz most of the companions you get are dull as hell with a few exceptions etc etc etcoh and guess what it turns out that fallout 4 is basically just a 60 expansion pack of that one quest in fallout 3 called the replicated man it just works todd howard 2015
