2019 early access review game definitely is still in early access with it constantly crashing every 30 mins or so what was the level sitting bull about the berserkers were stuck in the floor lying on their backs and i used only archers it seemed like i was watching an execution the level snakes from above has problems where the red units are spawned inside of buildings and are impossible to kill in sandbox mod the king texture glitches out and becomes black randomly priest vs priest is the most exciting match you can watch units getting their weapons stuck on walls is a common issue and snakes also get stuck on walls constantly make levels frustrating when all you have left are halflings units also have trouble walking across dead bodies game is has been vastly improved both gameplay and graphics wise from the closed alpha pretty smooth gameplay otherwise i know its supposed to be a silly game and all but the ai is ridiculously bad like the units will prioritize two enemies over the 20 units coming towards them in the ancient 1 map even worse because the catapult is big and gets stuck in the hole so it becomes useless it is extremely frustrating to watch these dumb pieces of shi atleast it was not an april fools joke and was actually released on 1st april warning game has almost half of the old units from the alpha missing and has only a few new units shown in videos by landfall im sure they will add it in future updates but for now you should still buy the game as the publishers seem promising also game is pretty buggy now
