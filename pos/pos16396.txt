2017 early access review i m gonna tell y all a story around 2005 i bought a game called microsoft train simulator it was my first simulator game and quickly became my 1 favorite game i was a kid who couldn t get enough of trains and railroading however playing that game for as long as i did made me wonder what would it look like if someone made a car simmulator one where you had to do everything the average driver has to do everyday start the engine release the parking break get in gear apply power with the accelerator etc none of the games i ve played that involved driving a car ever satisfied that old idea i had with train simulator but now i have my summer car this game simulator cuts no corners when it comes to realism you have to put your car together from the ground up and make sure everthing is properly fastened a loose bolt will come back to haunt you and like a real car you need to be reasonable when driving coming off the road and crashing is a real possibility in this game and it can be a matter of life and death for the protagonist sure you can start over again but that just gets frustrating why risk starting over again when you can just drive smart and keep on going if your a fan of the simulation genre do not pass this one by
