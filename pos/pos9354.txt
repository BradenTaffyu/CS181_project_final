2014 early access review let me be as frank and honest as possible this game is absolutely amazing but there is a caveat so i did not really play racing games sims and one day i saw grid autosport and it had a really fun look to it so i picked it up and with my xbox controller started having fun the ai is terrible on that game but in multiplayer with friends its a great time i enjoyed it so much i thought have i missed out on one of the best genres of games so i picked up assetto corsa and tried it out it was fun in third person view with the controller but as i read through forums and spoke to others i was missing out this is a simulator a program designed to mimic real life driving and thus cannot be enjoyed fully with sticks and buttons and that a wheel no a good wheel was going to improve my experience well for my birthday my wife got me the g27 wheel and my goodness this is where this game absolutely excels there is nothing like it i truly feel as though i am driving the car to a point and i love it i tried grid with the wheel and its not bad not bad at all its the difference between outrun and getting a day at a real racing track playing ac there is also modding support so if i want to drift one night i have a some drift cars want to drive f1 those are there and the amount of tracks and cars provided by the community are increasing daily so to sum it up if you are looking for a game this probably isnt for you but if you are looking to have a real racing experience this is where its at
