2019 i highly recommend this game but understand that it isn t for everyone once you pass the learning curve it becomes a very enjoyable experience because of the feeling you get from overcoming a challenge ignore all the stupid kids yelling git gud whenever you ask for help while getting good is definitely the primary way to pass a hard area the game is amazingly designed so that you can always overcome the challenge somehow whether it s by grinding trying something else leveling up or asking a white phantom a friend for help don t be scarred away by the difficultly just rise to the challenge
