2017 this review has been updated update since the update i have noticed that the small animals ie rabbits and squirrels are no longer wearing rain jackets and thus no longer sound like they are running through empty bags of doritos however when tracking a moose that i shot i completely lost the blood trail randomly i don t know if this is a new feature or what but the moose circled around in the area of an old trail and while i found plenty of tracks i found no more blood trail which is key to finding a wounded animal and keeping on the right track that could have been an issue on my end i suppose and i ll have to look into this a bit more in order to determine if this is some sort of bug also it is obvious that the crouch walking works better now in this new update and you get spotted less frequently when you are crouched and moving on the downside though you walk painfully slower when traveling this way but i suppose that s supposed to be realistic so that s fair is it worth buying at this point that s for you to decide there are both positives and negatives about the current state of this game keep reading starting with the positives about the game the settings are great from the visuals in the scenery to the audio with raindrops and the wind blowing through the leaves the background really is pretty stunning you don t have a wide variety of animals to shoot at this point but those that you can they look very well done the animals also sound really good and often behave like wild animals if you don t get good shot placement you can very much rely on having to track a wounded animal for some time until you can either finally put it down or it eventually succumbs to it s injuries the little stories in singleplayer and missions are also pretty neat and on to the negatives why do the squirrels and rabbits sound like they are wearing little little rainjackets when they run around while the game animals sound fairly normal as they walk through the grass and brush the smaller critters sound like they are wearing plastic as they romp about the trees and meadows nothing breaks the immersion as you re sighting in on a large buck as you suddenly hear a pair of squirrels wearing windsuits dashing about the boulder you ve perched on to take your shot and as you suddenly look around to see what is going on around you your buck notices the movement and shoots off like a rocket into the safety of the forest as you silently curse the creators of these squirrels also at random times the game suddenly decides that it s done playing nice and your leisurely stroll through the meadow as you search for a black bear takes a sudden turn as you notice that you are now walking in slow motion so you switch for your tracker to a rifle so you can walk a bit faster for a bit but soon you re still forced to a virtual crawl as your walk becomes visibly slower and so you have to restart the game sometimes you come across an animal that is stuck in some way sometimes it is stuck between a tree and a rock for example at other times it s stuck in a loop walking or running in a sort of circle and so you fire a shot at the stuck animal sometimes you ll kill it sometimes you ll just scare it and it will run faster even though it s still stuck now and again it ll take one hit but it won t kill it even though it just runs faster and faster and as you shoot at it over and over again at times you ll see the shot take effect and it stumbles to the ground it ll get back up and refuse to die and you ll have to restart the game because you re never going to kill it sometimes you ll shoot a stuck animal and no matter how point blank you shoot it the bullets magically fail to hit their intended target other times you ll clearly and visibly hit the animal and it ll eventually run off but when you come up to find the blood trail you ll see that there is no blood even though the animal clearly fell the ground and got back up to run away there s no blood you may have hit it three or four times and there s no blood trail and when you eventually give up you suddenly notice that you don t see animal tracks anymore and if you fire a shot at something it magically misses although it does expend ammo sometimes this can be fixed by fast traveling to an outpost you might think that the negatives outweigh the positives or vice versa and that s up to you decide for me even though the game is currently frustrating at it s present state i still enjoy it the visuals are well done the animal movements are excellent etc but it s also frustrating and a little buggy the immersion breaks at points especially when you or a small animal moves through the brush and grass the game crawls at times and you sometimes can t hit what your aiming at even if you could literally touch the animal you re shooting at would i recommend this game yes with the caveats that this game is currently buggy but i do believe that the developers will get it fixed the makers of this game have done well with other games in the thehunter line and there s no reason to think they won t get these problems fixed for that reason i do recommend this game
