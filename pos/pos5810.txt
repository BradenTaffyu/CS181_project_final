2020 early access review very fun some mods make it a bit more bearable for the early game as well just google let me play very swell mod which kills off the brother and starts you off with the ability to form your kingdom of course you still have to take over somebody s castle so be strong enough i have a few complaints namely they should show which villages have a quest without having to directly go into them conversations that take around 5 10 seconds to load could be avoided entirely with certain groups looking at you looters if you re going into this expecting a prettier warband with some extra addons you won t be disappointed as of now a few bugs exist and this game turns your computer into a heater for the winter months i would give this an honest rating of 7 10 for the time being until they clear up some of the issues
