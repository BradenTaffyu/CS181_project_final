2020 early access review have you ever been playing like skyrim or something and you walk into an idyllic fishing village off the northern shores wind whipping your beard about like a cat toy hoarfrost glazing your eyes and you go wow i really wish i could knock over the supporting beams of that longhouse collapsing the roof on those inside along with their furniture and then light the remains of that longhouse on fire before spraypainting pee pee gang is responsible on the dirt outside why would you do that that s weird that s really weird go do your quests go beat a wolf to death bare handed and throw its body into the river because that s less weird and more feasible than what you ve just considered doing to that longhouse unrelated but this game teardown lets you do exactly that thing you wanted to do with the longhouse minus crushing people yet i guess if you still want to go through with your awful longhouse homicide operation you can play teardown you weirdo
