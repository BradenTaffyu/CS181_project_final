2020 early access review very nice game you need to work to earn money to buy food pay the bills and to rebuild your car something that i most love about this game is that there is no incorrect or correct way to play it you decide what you want to do you can decide if you want to keep your car stock or make it rally capable or if you want to make it a sleeper or rice it etc you can be a responsible citizen or be a drunk guy you can die in all sort of ways by crashing your car or simply just by answering your phone in a thunderstorm and last but no least this game have all sorts of bugs that make it special bugs that you re going to love and hate at the same time
