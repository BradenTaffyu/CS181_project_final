2020 tldr ds3 delivers a great dark souls rpg experience more akin to the first dark souls than ds2 fun boss encounters with a variety of builds possible would recommend installing the cinders mod to fix issues with base game like poise making all builds weapons viable be way of online play as you might encounter hackers interacting with them may get you banned from the online matchmaking genre dark fantasy action combat souls like rpg gameplay if you re familiar with previous dark souls games the gameplay for the most part is the same you begin by creating a character and picking a starting class e g knight pyromancer sorcerer with predefined stats and equipment you progress from area to area killing monsters and absorbing souls from fallen enemies at the world hub you can spend your souls to upgrade your stats to make the build you see fit bonfires are scattered around and are basically zone checkpoints that you return to once you die or you can teleport from one bonfire to any other bonfire in the world you progress through the game by clearing zones and killing the zones bosses namely a specific set of bosses need to die before the game s final boss becomes available but you ll eventually encounter every other boss along the way in terms of what is new in ds3 that isn t found in ds1 or ds2 ds3 introduces weapon arts to the game which are pretty much a secondary attack style animation besides from the l1 l2 attack inherent in pretty much every weapon in the game weapon arts expunge the fp blue meter to use and therefore have a finite amount of uses like spells graphics the art style of ds3 like previous dark souls titles is deliberately very bleak and oppressing the world lacks much color and gives you an apocalyptic feeling as everything in the world is soulless and wants to kill you the environments and game effects are nicely textured the weapons and armor and unique and interesting animations are great and give you a clear sign of what an enemy is attempting to do and overall everything came together nicely some areas can get quite dark so bring a torch light spell if you can t see so you don t get surprised by a mob lurking in the shadows story you play the role as the ashen one an undead who rises from the grave to fulfill the purpose of returning the souls of the lords of cinder to their thrones in order to end the curse of the undead and end the cycle of the first flame there s a lot more going on that you have do discover yourself by reading item descriptions and listening to npc conversations ds3 has a lot of lore to be discovered and if you are highly interested there are many videos out there that explain it in much detail strengths ds3 feels like a return to form as most movement and combat animations are similar to the original dark souls if you played ds2 and everything in that game felt looked awkward you ll be happy to know that s been rectified here the game can be a great challenge for newbies and veterans alike you are constantly kept on your toes on the lookout for possible enemy ambushes as there are plenty of deliberate item and enemy placements throughout the game hundreds of weapons armor pieces and rings to equip and create a build from the introduction of weapon arts makes weapon choice a lot more interesting as you can choose a weapon based on its attack style specific weapon art properties boss encounters are unique and fun only a few are gimmicked to be defeated a certain way but otherwise you can defeat them how you want solo with help with swords with magic etc pvp exists in the form of covenant based red orb invasions where players intrude into other online players instances and attempt to defeat them by however they choose to there are also unofficial but more honorable pvp locations where players duel each other and usually abide by a set of honorable rules e g no healing allowed technically pvp is an opt in feature as you can disable all pvp by playing in offline mode but that would also disable co op viability the cinders mod is touted as the definitive way to experience ds3 as it brings into the game armors and weapons from previous dark souls games fixes enhances the poise system in the base game mixes up enemy placements in the world adds new enemies into previous zones creates alternate routing by connecting previously unconnected zones and adds in toggleable difficulty settings in firelink shrine to make the game even harder for the veterans out there did my most recently playthrough of ds3 as an all around caster using cinders and it was great fun gets my recommendation for sure weaknesses online play is a hit or miss you can run into legit players doing some honest or not so honest but at least not cheating pvp or you might encounter someone who just one shots you because cheats this is a double edged sword as interacting with hackers might get you on a banlist that matchmakes you only with other people that are also on the banlist it s a slippery slope that i cannot provide much insight on as i haven t played online since 2016 when i last tried building a caster in 2016 i recall that it felt very underpowered underwhelming i don t know if casting has since been buffed but playing as a caster felt comfortable and natural with the cinders mod so you might want to use the mod if you decide to create a build in such a fashion numeric score if you care 8 5 10a good return to the feeling of ds1 and a good departure from the dread of ds2 solid rpg combat a deep engrossing world if you choose to look into it and an overall fun time killing everything before it kills you checkbox reviews are lazy copy paste bullsh t ascii art reviews tell you nothing let s be honest i only wrote this review for awards is a waste of everyone s time if you are interested in genuine detailed game reviews feel free to check out my others here or don t i don t tell you what to do
