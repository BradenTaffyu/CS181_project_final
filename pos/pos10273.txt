2020 one of the most detailed colony simulation out there also one of the best story generator out there if these two are something you enjoy then it is a must to have this in your library detailed simulation of many aspects of the colony not as detailed as something like dwarf fortress so if you are scared it will overwhelm you this game doesn t do it that much multiple difficulties you want a peaceful colony sim or a warzone sim it s entirely up to you procedurally generated done right this game is an ocean s deep with an ocean s width mods are kinda required to simplify some of the work in this game vanilla is still 100 playable but mods do help however the mod support in this game is good so it s kind of a neutral point rng can you up sometimes ui is ugly and needs more improvement
