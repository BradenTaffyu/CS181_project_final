2014 early access review this is my first steam review i hadn t felt much inclined to really write one before now but after 100 hours on assetto corsa i feel compelled to i m definitely a car game enthusiast and assetto corsa is the best racing simulation i have ever played no other game in my opinion comes close to conveying such a sense of how it really must feel to drive these cars assetto corsa has nice graphics and sounds but it s the laser scanned tracks and an advanced physics model that really set it apart to provide specific ideas as to what this means weight transfer is beautifully conveyed the way the cars behave makes sense and you are driving on surfaces that virtually exactly match reality something i really enjoyed for example was how the same cars handling varies with tyre choice take a street tyre for example you will feel the tyre roll and the car slide relatively easily and quite predictably put on a racing compound however and you now feel the car chassis working harder and when the grip does give out the slide is much more dramatic and less easy to control there is huge depth and many hours to enjoy exploring such aspects without it ever becoming frustrating or unintuitive assetto corsa is still early access as i write this but there is already a promising and welcoming community and plenty of good content with more coming in the form of additional manufacturer and track licenses this is a must have for any driving enthusiasts game library
