early access review an excellent game disclaimer about the reviews most of the negative reviews are from people with hundereds of hours in the game who are just mad about a couple of things that in reality aren t that big an issue the state of the game is fine the rest are well because the devs fumbled a lil since this isn t the full game free to play it s a demo which will probably be clarified soon enough but even in it s demo state don t feel like you re missing out on too much with the high roller dungeon being off limits the last hundereds of hours i ve played have all been in the standard dungeon because it s simply more fun and solves pretty much all of the issues that those high hour play count gamers are mad about it means extracting gear is pointless outside of it s sell value sure but frankly the way the game is set up means you re gonna have a better time playing in the normal dungeon finding the loot and playing with it in the delve itself this would be an issue in another game where higher tier loot presents different mechanics and playstyles but in this game higher tier loot is just pure stat increases on mechanics that are for 99 of cases identical in lower tier variants so the game turns from gearchecking in highroller to actual engaging combat in the standard dungeon with well defined classes the only thing that sucks about the f2p version is the lack of character slots perks are a pretty big part of the game and having to let go of all of them to try a new class is a slightly disheartening endeavour but i highly encourage everyone to give the game a shot play around with the classes and don t feel afraid to delete your character to experience the variety in them all and if you end up getting absorbed enjoying one a lot but really wanna fledge out your roster then by that point you should have enough hours in the game to gauge if 30 bucks is a worthwhile investment for you to do so i know for me it is so i hope to see you all in the dungeons
