2020 10 10 would force child labor and cause amputations again this game had my full attention and became an obsession for a solid 41 hours it s beautifully done the music in particular is wonderfully woven into the gameplay both haunting and gripping i especially loved how its intensity escalates as the storm approaches the gameplay itself is a bit like a realtime strategy however there are really no enemies or armies to worry about this game is about resource management and choosing laws to keep your people warm happy and hopeful while not being too nice and endangering the well being of your settlement as a result the scenarios are quite tough and unforgiving expect to save and load a lot you really have to keep an eye on how much resources you have coming in and ensure you won t run out because if you do it can be fatal and you would have to load i restarted the main scenario over and over for the first 10 hours of playing just to ensure i had everything set up to successfully finish it after learning more about the tech tree what changes are coming later on etc a challenging game but lots of fun don t play it before going to bed or you will dream it all night and the music will haunt you i highly recommend it
