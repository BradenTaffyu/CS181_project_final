this game will take some a lot of time to get used to and a lot of researching it is the positive and negative aspects of the game the catch 22 the two sided blade fun 2d colony city builder but at the price of time commitment and research i ll recommend this one with a major caution sign before purchase not going to lie though i didn t know playing with liquids and gasses can be this much fun another helpful hint about this game is that there is an encyclopedia within the game to help explain the finer details oxygen not included oni is a fun colony city builder the gameplay is quite basic and complex at the same time the player can see and command everything from a 2d view while many complex options are available to customise the colony it s underwhelming and overwhelming at the same time the premise of the game is to be able to regulate use and refine the minerals gases and liquids in the surrounding areas to keep the colony alive oxygen is an important premise of the game so is understanding what gases are heavier than others the player can use rudimentary methods to power a colony or even save it when oxygen is low which included using different gases in the game accessing these gases requires research and foreknowledge of where the gas will go hopefully not to the sleeping quarters to access these gases or other upgrades in the game requires the player to research the research tree is quite extensive and every new unlock can be quite confusing the game takes a little patience to properly understand to maximise its potentials and likes to throw obstacles towards the player such as keeping duplicants happy and healthy a colony covered in puke isn t hygienic the visuals and graphics feel quite unique to the game i really enjoyed all the animations between the duplicants and their environment and the environment acting on its own tie this in with how smoothly the gas moves around the map and a formula for an addictive game appears never thought a video game could have a slight hvac educational value to it the sounds and music were also well done and do not overpower the speakers and do not repeat annoyingly as busy as this game is how the sounds were managed certainly deserve a mention overall would recommend but my goodness it can have an insane learning curve for every new researched content automated wires what filters what what needs to go to what how wires interact where to generate power the hole can seem endless sometimes with no light at the end the game is addicting and certainly is worth its rating if you re someone who looks for major depth in a game here it is early access rating 8 3 10 gameplay b story campaign b visuals user interface b sounds music b replay ability b overall b
