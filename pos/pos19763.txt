2020 this is everything a remaster is supposed to be you remember playing this game over a decade ago and the graphics weren t that bad but nostalgia is a cruel mistress you play the original again and you can barely stand it the comes the hd version which was alright playable but then the real remaster the definitive edition you start playing the game and it feels like it used to feel like it is supposed to look it is quite obviously way better than it used to be but it feels the same if you ever liked playing this game and want to play it again this won t disappoint you especially with the distinct lack of rts games in the last decade or so this still holds true as one of the best ones
