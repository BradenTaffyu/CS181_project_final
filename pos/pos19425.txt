2018 let s give an honest critique of this game in 2018 now that the fallout series is basically on life support and depending on what bethesda does at this year s e3 probably about to have the plug pulled new vegas is a competant role playing experience and an enjoyable one it s aged about as well as dry pondscum but with enb and graphical modding available for free on the pc that s a moot point it does however commit the cardinal rpg sin of railroading players whether by invisible walls or by placing super sonic murder wasps just a few miles north of the starting area to force you to take a circuitous route to your destination but this game unlike fallout 4 has a soul it has a tortured soul that is at once terrible and beautiful like watching glass shatter in slow motion your actions have consequences your past is a mystery the future is yours to claim and in this fleeting moment we call the present all you can do is take the path that lies before you our path the player s path as well as that of the fanbase does not lie at bethesda s back following mindlessly where they would have us go our path is for us to choose we the players will choose whether or not fallout survives into the next era of gaming by weighing the actions of hubristic companies making what will sell instead of what is worthy of being called art for all it s jank gameplay issues bugs and flaws new vegas is the truest fallout experience don t be railroaded into giving bethesda money it doesn t deserve for a series it has squandered thank you for your time may fortune favor you and may your soul know peace
