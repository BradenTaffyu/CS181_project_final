2023 it s a really great game but honestly you eventually get tired of being nickle and dimed with the dlc which are only moderately well received i m not sure if the silly pricing is a steam issue or a paradox issue the base game is great if the 300 in dlc for the full experience seems ridiculous which it kind of is then there is galactic civ 3 and endless space 2 both of which are incredibly great games that don t milk their player base quite as much as paradox that being said this is a fantastic game that i ve had lots of fun with
