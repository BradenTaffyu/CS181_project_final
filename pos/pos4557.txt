2016 stay with me on this one this is a tale of victory of betrayal of revenge and of consequence i was but a simple lord with a simple goal to make the kingdom of the nords the most powerful kingdom caldaria had ever seen i fought alongside my king and fellow lords as equals on the battlefields and many a heroic battle was fought and won i asked for very little but my own slew of personal conquests saw fit to reward me with personal lands i accepted these fiefs with grace and invested all of my time money and effort into making sure my villages prospered and were safe from enemy attacks and that s when it all went bad it was a day much like any other day i was scouting around my castle for enemy lords who would dare assault me that s when my weekly budget came in i gave it a quick glance and almost tossed it aside when i noticed some error a village was missing for a moment i was confused had my messenger tower failed and my village been raided without my knowledge no that cannot be the village would still be listed bewildered i investigated the cause of this discrepancy on the world map and noticed that the castle to which my village belonged to was no longer allied to the nords but the rhodoks how could this be we were not at war with them at the time so how did this happen as i investigated further i found the cause of my problems jarl gearth or as he is now known count gearth this weaselly dastard has always rubbed me the wrong way and now all my suspicions had paid off in a most unfortunate manner he had defected from the kingdom of the nords and allied himself with the rhodoks with him he took all the castles he had owned and with the castles went their adjoining villages as such tadsamesh now belonged to the rhodoks and along with it all my effort it seemed to me as a lord who was bound by honor that there was only one course of action long story short i murdered gearth s army and he s currently sitting in my dungeon 10 10 gonna go take his castle now too screw whatever peace treaty we had
