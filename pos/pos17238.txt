2020 i ve spent many hours playing the historical total war games i put more hours into the original rome than any other game i still have the cd sitting on my shelf i was initially disappointed the focus shifted from the historical settings to the warhammer universe and dubious about trying the game out someone finally convinced me to pick up it up after warhammer ii was launched and i m really glad they did the game is thick with detail well polished and incredibly fun there are a few obvious exploits which makes the game very easy even on the highest difficulty but it s far from game breaking if warhammer isn t your cup of tea but you love total war i d recommend you still give it a try i m very happy with the purchase
