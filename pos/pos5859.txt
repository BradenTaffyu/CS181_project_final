2021 early access review depends on expectations if you are expecting rich story that will suck you in for a x of hours nope it is not that kind of a game if you are expecting advanced in game mechanics like deep politics between states comperhensive economy and unforgiving enemies yeah i m looking on you ai then it is not that kind of a game but after more than 150h in game i cannot say that it is overall bad product i like historic period way of managing troops mean from a position of field commander rather than typical for strategy games bird view and freedom of choice also fight mechanic is something i enjoyed all other basic mechanincs looks ok ish so to say found only minor bugs that even if was a bit of immerse destructive didn t prevent me from playing from the other hand i have seen various comments about more serious cases and i m able to belive them that there was experience crashing issues so maybe i m just lucky but rather i will say it is a matter of attitude for me it is finally after whole day i have an hour for my own lets go and mindlessly hunt x th pack of bandints than wow this side quest was awesome and i cannot wait for the next one kind of experience and realy had some fun from it other thing worth noticing it that it is still an early access technically i will say cause of that i can belive that game will get more valiuable content but i m not expecting much and will be more than happy to be positively supprised so if i will have to decide now i will rather look on this as almost done product and by that i do not mean how i imagine that this game should look rather what i think will be the final release state of it and consider if this is what i would like to pay for or not
