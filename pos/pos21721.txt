2017 this is my first souls game i bought this game on a wednesday night after work when it was on sale i ran through the cemetery hacking and slashing undead with ease with the utmost confidence i took the sword out of the kneeling titan and was promptly returned to reality several times so many times that i returned the game that night saying it wasn t my cup of tea but a little voice lived in my head it called me a quitter quitters never win long story short i bought the game again in the same night and played until i beat him feeling victory in this game is exhilarating the messages on the ground are not the tutorial iudex gundyr is the tutorial and he will teach you patience and persistence the rest is up to you
