2019 pros it s a total war game so if you know what that entails and you re looking to scratch that itch you should enjoy what s on offer here it looks pretty and the way the heroes work adds a new dimension to the battles zooming in to watch individual soldiers fight is still enjoyable and satisfying with lots of cool battle animations the ui ux design has been overhauled and is excellent for the most part for the first time in the series in a long while the character portraits look good the ui is intuitive and the f1 help overlay is a godsend for players new to the franchise whoever was responsible for overhauling the ui good job i imagine we re now going to see variations of this ux for the next decade of total war games the diplomacy system is the best and most flexible in any tw game to date the flavour and overall localisation is excellent especially if you put all the audio in chinese though if you re looking for strict historical accuracy you re going to feel let downcons the variety between units and factions isn t really there every faction essentially plays the same way with essentially the exact same set of units the unique units for factions don t feel unique or even particularly special and often they re not really worth their huge purchase upkeep costs compared with cheaper units compared with warhammer ii total war this game feels rather samey the battles have been made into a rock paper scissors deal cavalry beats archers which beats infantry which beats cavalry and although this has made the battles simpler it also greatly limits your potential strategies the ai is pretty stupid and doesn t play by the same rules as you do and because of the way it works many factions have certain combinations of unique abilities that can basically break the single player game despite the diplomacy system being much improved unless you spend hours in the diplomacy screen every turn then every game will devolve into everyone ganging up on you your ability to manipulate enemies through any other means than direct confrontation is extremely limited although the ui is greatly improved from previous tw games there are some little inconsistencies or lack of considerations that are quite annoying for example not being able to see how two generals get along unless you put them in an army together or the annoyingly long animation for loading the reform and some other screens you essentially end up building the same buildings at pretty much every settlement some fairly long load times and performance issues for large scale battles and lategame campaign they charge money to add blood gore to the game which is pretty lamei ve played 180 hours of this game and feel very much like i got my value for money but at this point i feel like i m done with it compared with other total war games 180 hours isn t that much while it s by no means perfect overall i d definitely recommend it particularly if this is your first tw game
