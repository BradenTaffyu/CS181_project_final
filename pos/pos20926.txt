2019 it s the first time a video game makes me cry so much and holy sh i empathize whit the characters so well that make me cry is so well done that it s completely worth buying the other dlcs to follow the story the fact that what you do in the past changes the future of the game is impressive and for wanting to make the best decisions i take more time than usual to finish it i will clearly buy the other two games before the storm is the beginning of the story seen from the side of chloe and the importance rachel has in her life and how the story changes when she disappears i haven t seen much of the second game yet but it still looks striking and engaging for me this game is 10 10 for what i said there are no games that make me get to the point of crying and this succeeded the rest as the graphic detail increases the experience and obviously it s not a game that you finish in a couple of hours a lot of fun and tension this is clearly a masterpiece give it a try
