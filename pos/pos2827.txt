2019 it s impossible not to recommend this game to anyone that likes tactical rpgs it just ticks off so many boxes looks great amazing music deep characters first class voice acting great battles and a solid inventory system the best part of the game however is the impressive number of different ways you can play the game by that i mean choices classes freedom of exploration and the number of ways in which you can complete a quest that last one is most important i m constantly surprised when i try something strange and it works or when i see someone else had a completely different approach there are lots of different ways to achieve your goals and there are many pathways to get there the only real downside is that though the world is open you can quickly find yourself in trouble in an underleveled fight if you veer down the wrong road at the wrong time you can retrace your steps but it does push you into a roughly broad linear pathway but exploration is heavily rewarded and it s very easy to uncover things you didn t know were there including some great side quests the final act can also be a little daunting in that you ll find yourself in an area beset on all sides with game changing decisions and some very powerful enemies it s a very long game though so you should be prepared by that point maybe this is one of the finest games of its sort it s not to be missed if you like tactics and variety oh and it s multiplayer
