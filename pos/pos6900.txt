2020 early access review very chill game you ll start slow but then once you get collection nets you ll get resources pretty quickly i only wish i had friends to play it with cuz it seems like it would be even better with friends edit i am very flattered that so many people tried to send me friend requests but i just have to say the above was a joke i m too socially awkward to actually try and make new friends but i appreciate the attempt xd
