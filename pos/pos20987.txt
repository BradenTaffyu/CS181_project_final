2023 early access review there hasn t been a game that s captivated me like this has in quite some time i ve put close to 12 hours in and think i m near the end of the early access content but i keep being surprised by new mechanics that open up there s a lot more to this game than initially meets the eye and the mechanics are rolled out slowly enough that you feel like you have firm footing at every stage of the game so far i truly can t find fault with this the game just oozes character the art and animations are superb the music is great the mechanics are actually pretty interesting and non trivial don t be turned off by the casual tag there is definitely some challenge to both parts of the game at the same time they re not super stressful the restaurant part of the game isn t a cakewalk i rarely have a perfect night but it s a far cry from something like overcooked i haven t found myself genuinely smiling or laughing at a game like i have with this in a long time to have that alongside genuinely interesting gameplay and all around good vibes is a treat definitely recommend checking this out
