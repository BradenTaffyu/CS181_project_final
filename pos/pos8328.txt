2020 tl dr excellent and very engaging survival city sim with gorgeous aesthetics extra bonus beyond smooth and pretty intuitive ui now story time warning minor spoilers i wake up before the early morning shift at 6 am wondering how much longer the coal miners can handle these 14 hour shifts discontent is too high to force them to keep this up if they demand a rest but i always remember that my prison guards can make short work of those who step out of line too far the situation is too delicate to allow dissidence propaganda keeps the citizen s hopes up in this god less place as well as the ever watching eye of my guards and the loudspeakers that push our workers beyond breaking point the descent into authoritarianism was not intentional but a desperate measure or so i tell myself last night a group of 70 refugees came to our city 30 of them ill my medical posts are overburdened as it is and i can barely keep my people warm and fed eventually i decided to take the 40 refugees capable of work and sighed as i watched the ill stagger off into the wasteland to their imminent doom i take pride in the little things unlike other cities our children don t labour in the camps with the other workers instead they are given warm beds in the children s homes and help tend to the ill houses are kept warm and all hospitals are fully operational of course some amputations had to be made but at least they re alive the storm is coming as i continuously punish citizens for stealing food supplies or not doing their fair part in labour i urge them to keep pressing on for the ultimate goal our survival depends on cooperation and hoarding of precious coal and food if we all work together we will all survive the grim truth is only half of us will but the people can t know that or i m done for
