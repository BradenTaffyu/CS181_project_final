2016 updated 23 11 2016 nominated to steam rewards just 5 more minutes stellaris a screenshot of stellaris by duncan al naaris space the final frontier these are the voyages of the starship enterprise it s five year mission i m not a trekkie but if you can imagine william shatner reading those words at the start of a new game of stellaris continue reading stellaris is for paradox a new beginning in a long curriculum of strategy games they have change earth for the galaxy and they have done a good game where you can invest a lot of hours just in your first game with your custom race at the moment of this review i have played for 33 hours just with my first race and i have seen 1 3 of the galaxy and contacted with just 6 other races there were some bugs at the previous versions that are fixed and the most common problem is that there are not enough events at mid end game but with mods this is not a real problem because the mod community is very active in this game the game like vanilla is pretty good choose race play with it just at the beginning of space era and start exploring the galaxy with your ships in one of the 3 types of engines you can travel through the galaxy warp like star trek hyperjump like endless space and wormholes like farscape then first contact with a new galactic empire politics alliance war all this appears in it s right moment and you don t get bored but it s really with mods allowed and promoted by paradox that this game really shines do you want to play like klingons with their ships models and warp adapted to star trek rules 3 days of cd instead of 20 fighting to romulans feds and borg you can to play like the tau ri of stargate yeah or navigate through the space searching for arrakis like an atreides yep that too change your ships colors music rules hud planets races all you can imagine is possible so this game is in fact a lot of games inside just one stellaris a screenshot of stellaris by duncan al naaris graphics beautiful with the last patch the space boxes has been improved and using two keys you hide the hud sound stellaris music is good specially the opening theme creation and beyond which is epic the others themes are there while you are exploring the galaxy but just as background story well you make your own story but in the game there are events that appear on planets or new contacts or from the orbit of a planet with your science ship researching the ruins of an ancient culture these events start quest chains which uses to give a boost of science a plus to damage to the species you are analyzing the ia is pretty good you have 3 levels of difficulty so choose wisely combat it remembers me sins of a solar empire it s adaptable because you have different weapons with different ranges and accuracy shields and a lot of kind of ships race options espionage i really miss this but you have a lot of options to tune up your race slavery first contact emigration edits to boost science sectors when you arrive to manage a lot of planets you can group them into sectors ruled by a governor who will done all for you while you keep managing your most important planets i could say more but these points are the most important if you like what you have read you will be in love with this game guiding your race to explore strange new worlds to seek out new life and new civilizations to boldly go where no man has gone before rings and moons a screenshot of stellaris by duncan al naaris some tips if you are an achievement hunter you have to play ironman mode that means you have to look at your mods very carefully because they can be the reason you get no achievement if you are a screenshot hunter this game can offer you some very nice shots if you want to learn more about this take a look at my guide update edit 20 hours more played so i can say something more espionage is not really necessary it would be nice to know more about your competitors but when you contact a race you know each political change done for it each alliance each war this can turn you into madness because except wormhole ftl normally you send some explorers ships around the galaxy and when you met a new race you get a plus of influence for each new contact you let them to research your language to start the communications if you do it you will lose time on other research but when you known about their existence you will get information of each political movement of all of them once you see a ship of that race you can analyze and see the components which will tell you their ftl spec weapons etc and you can start to adapt your ships in case of war sectors the way to fragment your empire into sectors is very helpful because now i have about 20 planets plus ships plus diplomatic contacts plus terraforming planets plus frontier fortifications plus investigation plus problems with my robotic population soooo really a good idea to let you group planets to let the ia to manage them for you building and upgrading buildings and build ships to build stations around planets to get energy minerals a lot of build there you tell them what to be focused on and that s all also you will continue be allowed to send orders to the orbital stations to build any ship you want including colony ships combat when you see a new tech about orbital station choose that because that will allow you to build bigger ships which is the key to win wars also energy and weapons must be balanced to a powerful ship you won t be allowed to use the biggest weapon if you are with the first energy generator a nice detail when you contact the space creatures named ameabas and you defeat them you can study their remains this will allow you to build one of the best fighters weapon of the game combat shipwars to start a war you have to sign a document saying why to get this planet to integrate him into my empire to humiliate them you have to add the reasons and each one will have a number which means the damage you have to inflict to that empire to surrender and negotiate with you the terms if you have added to the document that you want 2 planets you can demand them but you can t ask for a 3rd planet you have to think before star a war wars don t last forever even when you fight to a superior empire that declared war to you you can stand hold and with time you will be able to ask white peace that means a draw this can sound strange but in game it creates a break in the situacion example i was fighting to an empire and idiot during that fight another empire declared war to me not a trouble but he was in a coalition with a very strong empire who joined the fight so i was fighting against 3 empires at once i could finish one war and stand with the other 2 empires they give me a lot of troubles but i hold and could declare white peace that gives you time to recover yourself and your fleet change tactics weapons search allies research for more techs and when peace time is over let s see again our faces this method gives you and the others empires a way to survive and not be smashed for another one like a bug
