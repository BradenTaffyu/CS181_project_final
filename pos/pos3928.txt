2020 this game is insane it s mindboggling the immense value you get for you money here this game should be 49 99 it s ludicrous the amount of replayability content and fun are packed into this title at this price the character progression and how you customize them is extremely deep and varied there are classes you can essnetially multi class there are masteries to equip with set bonus depending on the set you equip there are items of course and you can customize which abilities you have the story is incredibly engaging interesting and rewarding it has an in built replay function so if you want to test out other choices in past missions and see how that goes you can do so easily there are loads of characters you can eventually get in your troubleshooter team the enemies are varied with humans of all kind animals and later on even robots the missions are very varied with lots of stories and little cutscenes accompanying them characters are also very diverse and flavorful the graphics are nice and the different combat abilities have great visuals imo there are also loads of camera options so you can tailor the experience to your desire this also holds for ui and difficulty and other things lots of choice the amount of content again insane the devs just released a free dlc with 2 new characters and new missions get it seriously
