2017 total war games are something of an odditity in the strategy genre having survived through the post age of empires slump that seemed to trail off somewhere in the early noughties rome ii is one of the first of a new generation of total war games that manages to support it s original concept the focus on realistic pitched battles and the development of it s expanded empire management that is more typical in the last few years this new generation was marked with both adherance to it s customer community with a whole host of quality of life hud updates focus on slick and simple concepts and defiance with much of the game s full content locked behind paywalls and dlc packages that were very poorly recieved and tarnished much of the company s support throughout the following years rome total war was one of total war s more popular games encouraging rts fans and history hobbyists alike the bbc even made a television show around playing the game time commanders which was not too long ago renewed for a new series ran with rome ii watching this original series got me very interested in tactical leadership and lead me to a great number of games and perhaps even the rts series of games originally rome ii is a revisitation of both rome total war as a concept but also total war mechanics with a decent attempt to addorn with culture and art from the times it is only sometimes lacking in full historical acurracy but is perhaps the best game to roleplay the expansion of the roman empire featuring more in depth policial options the game very neatly presents itself as a game you can run as a commander an administrator or both at any given time you do not need to focus too heavily on province management if you are a skilled commander and likewise you do not need to focus too heavily on micromanaging battles if you are an adept administrator with exciting new sea and coastal battles rome ii offers a new perspective on tactics but the execution of this new concept is perhaps what leads the game into my next subject and one fatal flaw in all total war games the ability of the ai while the ai can certainly provide competative and effective executions early on in the game any kind of familiarity with the computer finds you learning how best to trick the computer into making mistakes that a perceptive human is simply not capable of making whilst some tricks do have merit such as drawing out an army into an ambush the ai responds as a palpable switch flicking the exact second you take an action from across the battlefield in coastal battles you need only pick the right boats to funnel the ai into sticking points strange formations and ultimately absolute victories and while any human would make very concious decisions that could change the outcome of these battles correctly placed siege bowmen etc the ai does not learn at all partly this is the limitations of technology in a game with so many potential placement options and to a skilled commander diverse range of tactical tricks it is only natural that the current generation of ai would fall behind the alternative would be the ai being capable of always landing perfect manouvers and the switch mechanism i spoke about would only become more obvious in the grand campaign the starting to middle stages of the game find you using whatever diplomatic resources and savvy you have to survive but the late game is just sweeping across the board purchasing the top units and throwing them at any problem that said the campaign is a long juicy endevour that you will still enjoy building for the most trying parts overall rome ii was the best of total war at the time and offers a great deal of unique gameplay for its s price i reccommend buying this game and killing some time playing it
