when i purchased this game i set out a little challenge for myself to try and gauge if this was a good buy although i had purchased some map dlc s during a christmas sale i vowed not to go to them until i finished the base maps that you get when you purchase this game standalone along with filling the one free hunting lodge you receive i fully expected to get bored and uninstall before i reached my goal this game pleasantly surprised me granted this game is not for everyone but when you buy a hunting simulation you know what you re getting into the base game consists of 2 maps of a couple kilometers miles in diameter that you can explore seamlessly without any loading beyond the initial booting up of the game one set in germany and the other set in america each with 8 different animals with which to hunt totalling 16 initially it might not sound like a lot of animals but the game hooks you in with a trophy score system of which you re chasing forever more incrementally higher trophy scores each of which is separated into 4 tiers bronze silver gold and diamond along with a worse than bronze tier which doesn t award anything and a special great one tier above diamond which is for special spawns that have a unique skin each map has a story associated with it of which you ll be hunting z number of y in x area with w weapon though it spices things up by making you take pictures occasionally tracking foot pawprints some of which belong to people one quest that lets you choose to either take a photograph or put down a creature at the behest of two competing rivals you can choose both without penalty or needing to time travel and you even put out a fire at one point the story is dictated to you by a single entity who acts as a sort of manager who interacts with your employers on your behalf forwarding requests and payment upon completion all the while dictating whats going on in these peoples lives as it happens you never actually meet another human unless you join a multiplayer game i would say i m a pretty average player when it comes to this game but in order to complete both maps story mode of which i completed my collection of gold or better trophy s on the way through it took me 132 hours i d say that s pretty good value for money considering i only paid 5 dollars for it 20 if you count every dlc i purchased you ll hear a lot of complaints about the nickle and diming the game does with its dlc and i partially agree on the topics of the vehicle of which not getting it has no downfall beyond unlocking initial survey points thanks to the fast travel system and the dogs which is actually a quality of life improvement when it comes to tracking bleeding marks or not having to move from your hunting blind to capture ducks and geese something i think should be in the base game honestly you could buy the base game and have a decently good time without purchasing any dlc but i have anyway and am looking forward to exploring africa and australia with my dog and my atv on a footnote i feel like the game doesn t have much to spend your in game currency on yet paradoxically i still seem to constantly be running out setting up your lodge just the way you like is very satisfying
