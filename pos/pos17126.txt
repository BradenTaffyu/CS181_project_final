2019 gather the elector countsthanks to creative assembly warhammer fantasy lives on in total war for me warhammer ii is the pinnacle of the total war series the first warhammer game revolutionised the series with it s new features where the historical total war games had struggled with providing enough variety between factions however the fantasy setting allowed for truly varied factions based on different races with different rosters providing so much more replayability lords and heroes with large skill trees a robust magic system and monsters of varying shapes and sizes all of this helped breath new life into what was let s face it a stagnating series prior to warhammer this game is a lot of fun and will have you sitting glued to your screen for hours and hours as you try to wipe knife ears and stunties off the map while trying to defend your borders from vampire pirates and chaos mutants it s also worth a mention that many of the workshop mods are mind blowing any weakness in the base game can be rectified by one mod or another allowing you to unlock all unplayable factions add entirely new races change up existing races or completely change overhaul the base game with mods such as steel faith overhaul now sfo grimhammer 29 06 2020 with every new dlc drop comes a wealth of free changes most old world races from the first game have been brought up to the second game s standards notably the empire and greenskin factions
