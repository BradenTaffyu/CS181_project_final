2017 early access review i ve barely scratched the surface of what this game can do in terms of it s mechanics i ve probably uncovered maybe 10 of what is possible even after watching tutorials playthroughs and series i keep discovering new things places creatures items the simplicity of the sprites and graphical side hide just how complex and intricate this game is this is a prime example of don t judge a book by it s cover this game this world it s intoxicatingly beautiful mechnically complex and intricatley and lovingly crafted and just overwhelms you making you want more and more and more this isn t a love letter to the old asci roguelikes this is the true rebirth pros actual rogue like bearing this title with a proud and well deserved fist to the face of those who falsely claim to be similar the game is bru tal simple graphics a clear call back to the days of asci and it s ilk actually very endearing when you get to know the various sprites and what they are represent incredibly deep character building incredibly interesting lore oddly endearing sense of humour mixes the old roguelike gameplay loop with a basic survival aspect of hunger and thirst food can be collected with the right abilties or bought crafting is pretty nifty needing both knowledge proper character set up and a good array of materials found in the world or bought a lot of features mechanics potentially hundreds if not thousands of character builds procedural generation allows for a hell of a lot of replay ability one of those titles that can either be a short and sweet run before work or a good solid friday night with a can of juice beer and a load of snacks cons early access though proving to be incredibly useful for this game does mess with saves from time to time brutal learning curve needs a fair deal of research and patience to actually survive a lot of people may be put off by the simplicity of the graphical side not for the impatient or temper prone very very unforgiving to those who just rush in head first without thought could be considered tedious in terms of the hunger and thirst as many have and probably will utterly forget that the two exist and can kill you permadeath is a thing i know a great many folk who utterly hate permadeath thought it was worth a note tip for newbies food can be scarce thanks to rng kill glowfish in the areas surrounding the starting town joppa and pick up their corpses the more the better just don t overload your inventory they are plentiful and food will be less of an issue for you at the begining few areas and levels live and drink friends and may you find shade where you choose to rest
