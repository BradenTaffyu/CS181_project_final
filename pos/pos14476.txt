2021 finally hit 100 hours so i m going to finally leave a review civ 6 is a fantastic 4x game that in my opinion is an improvement on civ 5 however there is one caveat the two main dlcs are essential for the game to be great not the frontier pass i highly suggest you wait for a sale to pick up the game with the dlcs for the best experience if you are on a budget and can t get the dlc just buy civ v with the dlc pretty cheap since game is old as that is a better experience than base civ 6 but with the dlc the mechanics and turn to turn decisions are a huge improvement even rising above civ v dlc if you are a civ v veteran give this game a try with an open mind its going be different but once you learn the mechanics you will fall in love with the game a lot of civ v players hate districts at first but once you understand them and learn how to play with them you will find that you will probably actually prefer the district system districts add depth and interesting decisions when deciding on district type and placement civ 6 dlc 9 10base civ 6 6 10
