2020 my kids and i have had so much fun with this game that between steam and ps4 i wound up buying separate licenses for everyone in my family the slimes are adorable and the game mechanics are simple enough for anyone to play from at least age 6 years to adult but also complex enough that one doesnt run out of things to do for quite some time if ever we haven t gotten bored yet i think my favorite slime is the puddle slime but my kids really enjoyed feeding the gordos until they explode gameplay is relaxing and humorous a good pick me up on a bad day the smiles on the elated slimes are contagious
