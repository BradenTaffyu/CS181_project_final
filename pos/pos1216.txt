2022 early access review one of the few early access titles i recommend getting due to it s healthy player base and the developer s passion on the surface it s a zombie survival game but done so well due to it s carefully crafted actions clothing stats vehicles etc there s so much depth in this that it might seem overwhelming at first i haven t felt this overwhelmed with choices since the days of minecraft you can be met with some unfair situations but each death delivers a hard blow of truth you are always vulnerable i recommend this game for people looking for a game that gives you a closest to real zombie survival experience
