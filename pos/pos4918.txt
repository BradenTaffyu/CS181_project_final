2020 first things first fallout 4 is a huge shooty open world game with rpg elements that manages to be kind of fun despite extreme bloat the clunkiness of almost all of it systems and a pervasive all encompassing blandness this is a firm recommendation despite all these caveats it s the kind of game you turn your brain off to enjoy and roll your eyes at after every other npc dialog but still play more of to get beyond that hill into those irradiated woods and yeah mods as usual help a lot but you probably know what you re getting into let me dig into the sort of thing that puts me off the game so that i play it in spurts with months long pauses in between let me tell you a story it s called a boy in the fridge wandering the wastes with my faithful dog as you do i hear calls for help coming from an abandoned fridge nearby as you also may have done now this area is full of outlaws and other critters so fully expecting a trap i open it to find a ghoul child who s been trapped there for decades i don t get a chance to ask how the hell no one came to his rescue or for a free snack in the intervening time since my character s options are basically a child let us eat its soul or oh you poor child i shall save you and also bye after some forgettable back and forth unfortunately the only kind this game deals in we settle on trying to find young billy s old family house from before the bombs fell more than a century ago i think i haven t played in a while also i ve begun ignoring the lore in this game while walking there a sketchy evil looking maybe not at all wholesome figure the game points out is called bullet walks up to us and offers to buy the kid saying he ll take good care of him and questioning my parenting skills should i decide to keep him he also very hammily makes it very clear he doesn t have good intentions for him though he doesn t elaborate at all on it and did i mention he looks about as trustworthy as boris johnson anyhow i send bullet off on his merry way and make it to the kid s old house and wouldn t you know it not only is it still standing but both his parents were also turned to ghouls when the bombs fell and they ve been waiting in the family kitchen for some good soul to return their precious brood back to them from where he was trapped not a five minute s walk away ever since the tearful celebration is soon cut short by dear old skeevy bullet who has in the short while it took me to get here rounded up a posse to demand i turn over the kid again plus his parents for reasons i guess slavery is the obvious one but why does he have such a hard on for this family and his faction are dug in this general area so why hasn t he used his superior firepower to get them all ages ago anyhow i m sure the character has a twenty page character motivation bible somewhere at bethesda hq that explains all this in any case my options are basically do you want me to kill them all for you too or oh no you villain you shan t and also bye i being the boring ass goodie two shoes that i ve been playing instead of a boring ass boo hiss villain i probably should have but that would entail more combat and no thanks kill all the bad guys and the grateful parent gives me a measly few post apocalyptic dollars the end to be fair there are some quests in the game that don t seem to be implemented off the back of a napkin although the writing quality never gets much better but this is the quest i m going to use as an example in this gaming trend that bethesda bioware and ubisoft have fallen headfirst into to varying degrees quantity over quality content over fleshed out thought out stories lazy crap that wouldn t fly on a saturday morning cartoon show or ok maybe would just about fly on a saturday morning cartoon show let s not get carried away here but one of the crappy ones and it doesn t have to be this way this is why the witcher 3 is so loved i think it s for sure the reason i ll pay full price for cyberpunk when that comes out and why i may wait until elder scrolls 6 goes on sale before i buy it ah who do i think i m kidding
