played f76 from the very beginning and boy it was a rough start with a mediocre performance and an empty world regarding npc nonetheless the world building was great if you like immersive walking simulators roaming around appalachia is great with tons of nice locations and small little details and stories to explore and since the beginning bethesda managed to bring new factions into the game added more questlines and more dungeons to explore the storylines itself are mostly forgettable but on the other hand not overly bad as well the greatest plus is that you can change your character on the fly in contrast to the beginning times of the game change your stats and change your perks and try out different play styles for the tons of weapons and armours you ll find ingame trading with other players is possible as well so there are more ways to find your prefered gear and the other biggest plus the community is great f76 really lives the words from travis miles the radio host in fallout 4 the vault dweller showed up and lend them a hand or a gun and if you are new into this game expect some high level characters to appear at the entrance to vault 76 and give you nice presents like stim paks or weapons to make the first hours of the game a lot easier for you even it is not a difficult game at all if you loved the build mode in fallout 4 f76 won t disappoint you the building area is way smaller but you can do great things in this limited space and besides point of interests you are mostly free to decide where to build the ingame shop is for cosmetics only but you can usually grind those items if you play the seasoned board game which means continous grinding xp long enough you can buy xp boosters as well but in general it is not necessary because with ingame items like food or special quests you can easily make tons of xp in a short time as mentioned before f76 is not a difficult game you can easily enjoy it alone as well in a group with foreigners or friends if you like narrative exploring like in fallout4 this game is definitely for you as a shooter it is mostly solid at best and as a looting game this is heaven for you due to the great variety and the lots of playstyles you can easily try out
