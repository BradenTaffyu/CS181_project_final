2015 do you have what it takes to change history most games difficulty can be judged by the percentage of players who have completed the achievements in europa universalis 4 around 14 have completed the basic ones so this game is very hard and there s a reason to why but more on this later it doesn t take very long to get in to because the tutorials are great europa universalis 4 is very complex in a paradox interactive way but i find it very challenging and rewarding at the same time what i like the most is the diplomacy and the forging of alliances everything falls into place when war breaks out then you will either regret or cherish the alliances you ve made so you have to be on your toes and pay attention to the world around you not only in order to accomplish your goals but to strike when other nations fall apart suing for peace is another thing i like where the options are based on how well the war is going or went if you completely destroyed your enemy the ai use these options too with various outcome the trade system in europa universalis 4 is complex but well worth taking a closer look at and understand well because it generates the money for your nation there are details and other brilliant things worth mentioning too but i ll leave them for you to find europa universalis 4 doesn t tell you what to do so you have to challenge yourself with your own goals there are missions and decisions where the game asks you to do things like build fort in province x increase reputation with nation x as examples of missions these missions rewards you with different things which helps your nation the decisions can be form empire from x which gives your nation a boost in certain areas during a set date but you don t have to do these if you don t like missions you can chose them and then cancel them the decisions you don t care about you just ignore so there s nothing stopping you making your own history the history and current progress of the world is written in a ledger which is quite interesting the ledger is a very useful tool and probably worth a review on its own there are events historical and generic the historical events are the only thing which force you to do things as they were unfortunately i hate the generic ones i ve read that they re meant to give the player something to do and balance things but for me they are just frustrating and just there to work against you for example there s one where your heir falls ill you can either spend money to send for a physician or not spending money or ducats as they re called the spend money option gives the heir 50 chance of dying the other where you don t spend money a 75 chance i always chose the 50 option spend money and every time the heir dies other generic things happen depending on different things even though they shouldn t happen they do happen and always in the most inappropriate time and some are bound to happen sooner or later so these generic events gives me a love hate relation to this game the iron man mode which you have to be in to get the achievements i guess i can cope with in the long run in iron man mode you only have one save game and the game saves every month and overwrites that save game every time which results in two things 1 the game progress very slowly as you wait for the save file to be written 70 of the time you play 2 things which happen either your own wrong doing or the generic events are irreversible so if you do a mistake or are screwed by an event you have to start all over from 1444 having someone nearby who can comfort you and give you advice does help to overcome these things if you are unsure wait for it to come on sale because this game is great and a must buy for everyone who love strategy games
