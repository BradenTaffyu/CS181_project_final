2019 10 10after recently completing the game acheivements and all i can say without hesitation that this game is a masterpeice admittedly the experience can be enhanced with a handful of mods a bit buggy at times and the filters are a bit dull regardless the game is very rich in narrative and it is extremely immersive with high replay ability it is very commendable to see how much time and effort went into creating and maintining the fluid story line of both the vanilla game as well as the dlc please buy the goty version if you intend to purchase if you give this game a chance you will not be dissapointed this game is one of the few titles that every video game enthusiast should play through atleast once war never changes
