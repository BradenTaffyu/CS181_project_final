2016 well it was about time i got to writing a review about this game i think i can accurately say the positives and negatives about the game with my 600 plus hours into it and heres what i think first review as well for my first game i ever bought on steam seems fitting h1 pro s h1 very realistic for the most part you have to know what you are doing and learn how basic orbits work and what not to really learn how to play the game funny this is that other part the game isnt perfect and you can mess around all you want with it and do some silly things like launch kerbals from the moon not land and then take off and not in a ship but literally launch the kerbal from the moon it was fun satisfying once you set foot on the mun moon equivalent then a nice lil bit of joy and happiness rushes over you you feel this giant accomplishment and this does dwindle after every other landing even on other bodies but it is still there and once you actually land back on kerbin thats almost as sweet customization build rockets and stuff however you want just need to make sure they work engineer consthere isnt much inherently bad with the game the only problem with it is this personal drive you have to want to go to the mun duna or other bodies or create that perfect plane that can take off from kerbin and go somewhere in space without a hitch if you dont have that large drive then the game is boring no sense of direction nothing to do really things of that nature so if youre gonna get the game make sure to ask yourself can i set my own goals and actually achieve them want too edit i did forget to mention the new career missions that you can do in career mode thanks to one person who saw my review those can definitely extend the life of the game i personally did not find them too much fun but they are indeed there and are fun for many others as well my personal opinioni have not actively played kerbal space program in just under 2 years or so one of the updates wiped my save unfortunately which made younger me mad and not want to play it anymore now i just dont care anymore to really play it on my own i did what i personally wanted to do which was to land on every planet and a few moons and make a space station i did that and i feel like i beat the game now every time i go back its all just ya i remember doing that but then i just go play something else i tell people that i love this game and i truly do its just i already beat it for me but i will still gladly play it to show friends the ropes and just to make sure i still know how to do it should you buy it yes if you like sandbox space games this is probably one of the finer ones out there but make sure you have the drive to do it otherwise you will stop playing it before you achieve anything all the people that love this game have that drive and are the ones that still playing it that reach higher hours than i have and i commend them for it they have that drive that i have lost for now buy the game though its fun to watch things explode d
