2023 graphics you forget what reality is beautiful good decent bad don t look too long at it ms dosthe artstyle is simple yet pleasant as is the case with almost everything in the game it can be changed with mods gameplay very good good it s just gameplay mehh watch paint dry instead just don ti m giving this a good instead of very good because in my opinion it does require a significant amount of mods to give it the needed polish i would recommend trying out vanilla first then visiting the workshop and sorting by the most popular mods of all time if any of them sound like they fix or change something you found frustrating try them audio eargasm very good good not too bad bad i m now deafthe audio is fine and the music is nice but i don t think it s a centerpiece of the game audience kids teens adults grandmathough this game is famous for the war crimes you can commit i wouldn t call it a central part of the game i think that anyone can have fun with this game but it might be a bit complicated for children pc requirements check if you can run paint potato decent fast rich boi ask nasa if they have a spare computerdespite the simple graphics the game can actually get quite demanding in later stages when there will be hundreds of characters on the map at a time there are performance mods that can help difficulty just press w easy easy to learn hard to master significant brain usage difficult dark soulsif you have never played a game like this before i think it would be overwhelming at first with that said the fundamentals are not all that complex there are a lot of tips and tricks that you ll have to pick up over time making progression and improvement a rewarding experience grind nothing to grind only if you care about leaderboards ranks isn t necessary to progress average grind level too much grind you ll need a second life for grindingyou are only required to play as much as you want to story no story some lore average good lovely it ll replace your lifewhile the game bills itself as a story generator i wouldn t say there is very much lore in a traditional sense game time long enough for a cup of coffee short average long to infinity and beyondbecause of its design and the near limitless mods available the game is inherently one to be replayed no two playthroughs will be the same price it s free worth the price if it s on sale if you have some spare money left not recommended you could also just burn your moneyi personally waited for it to be on sale but in retrospect i can say that it is 100 worth the asking price bugs never heard of minor bugs can get annoying ark survival evolved the game itself is a big terrarium for bugsthere are occasional bugs especially if you heavily mod your game but they are tolerable 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10i thoroughly enjoyed my time in rimworld so far and i doubt that this will be the end of it i would give this game a 10 if it was a bit more optimized and polished without mods
