2022 game is great current meta of the game sucks the fun out of playing ranked i wish we had other modes to play perhaps a legacy card mode for ranked i hope that with event duels they take the opportunity to limit allowed cards for this mode to create creative limited builds for the event if we could skip the tutorials for decks in solo that would be fantastic as it s always something i dread to deal with they need to reduce the turn limit time as currently there is so much time given to players where basically there is 5 mins of set up and likely to just one turn kill you i hope in the future we could get anime stories to play through in solo for anyone who doesn t know if you create a sr or ur of a card in a pack it unlocks the secret pack this should really be explained more clearly otherwise i can imagine players buying the master packs in hopes of trying to get the secret pack
