2023 early access review i woke up in my small house in the town called riverside the tv was on talking about a knox event or whatever i went outside to check what was going on and low and behold my neighbor was feasting on his wife or whoever she was i quickly ran inside to grab the nearest weapon i had but i only had a few cooking utensils and some books i picked up a frying pan i had put in a cabinet and ventured out through by backdoor my yard wasnt really that big a dozen of people i had never seen before was roaming around the yard groaning and yelling i run inside again and decide it might be a better idea to go out the frontdoor instead my neighbor was still eating on a now unregonsiseable corpse he notices me and groans at me slowly getting on his feet he and stumbling closer and closer to me i take out the frying pan and when he got close enough to me i bashed him on his head he made a sound and fell to the ground he wasnt dead yet but just writhing in pain on the ground even though it should had given him atleast some brain damage he got up again and attacked me again without any luck of course i hit him a few more times and at last he stops breathing and making noises i take no time to think what had just happend because behind me 3 or more shamblers had heard all the commotion and were now walking towards me me and my frying pan were no match for all of these folk so i run across the street were my neighboor had a car parked i jump inside the car hoping the car was still intact but of couse it wasnt the shamblers were getting closer to the car i was sitting in and i quickly jumped out and ran into the house the car was parked infront of the owner was home only he was quite dead a woman stood at the window banging on it while groaing i sneak up behind her and bang her on the head she like the other one falls to the ground and instead of waiting for her to get up i bash her brains in with my trusty frying pan the other shamblers were now at the front door banging on it i quickly ran out of the back door and went around the corner but what i hadnt noticed was that 2 shamblers had for some unknown reason decided to stand right there i couldnt manage to stop sprinting so i plow through them bad decision i fall to the ground with a scraped knee and the other shambler couldnt resist and she took a bite out of my shoulder panic hit me and i ran onto the main street and took my socks off and ripped them so i could use them as makeshift bandage the comics i had read a long time ago talked about if you were bitten by the undead which i assumed these shamblers were you were destined to die and become one of them across the street i saw a pharmacy and thought i got nothing to lose now might aswell check for something to cure me or atleast take the pain away i run to the main entrance but the door is closed so i took out my frying pan and busted the windows open i had forgot the glass shards and so i cut myself when going through the window my right arm was completly ripped open i checked the shelves for some disinfectant but there werent any but i did find some painkillers i chuck down a pack or 2 of painkillers and decided to hide in the backrooms of the building i was still bleeding profusely and i heard all of the undead enter the building this was the end not even a day in and i was already going to die the shamblers were now at the door to the room i was in bashing and hitting the door eager to get to me so they could feast on my tasty flesh they kick down the door and make their way towards me i hit as many as i can but there were too many one of them bites my leg and i get thrown to the floor they were all over me now biting and scrathing all of my limbs the pain was immesurabel i was screaming and crying they were literally tearing me apart until i couldnt handle it anymore and passed away not so peacefully and turned into one of them that s basically how my first game of project zomboid went chaotic dramatic and funny as hell you ve heard it before but i ll say it again best survival game to date
