2020 early access review did you ever line up armies of toy soldiers facing one another as a kid well in tabs you can also press play and watch them duke it out in the most hilarous fashion possible the physics based sandbox provides some truly hilarious interractions a lot of great content has been added during the course of the games early access and as of this review i think the game is in a healthy state the biggest shortcomings would be the simplistic unit ai and its difficulty navigating any of the more complex maps
