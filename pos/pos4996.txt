2016 update due to the the fact people cannot understand simple thing i will explain it again in a more detailed way it feels so bland if you compare it to the other fallout games however understand i am upvoting this game as it is a good game by itself it just doesn t feel like a true fallout game so please stop arguing about my review its my choice to like the game and its my choice to dislike the many aspects of the game get over it the game looks pretty the game can be fun at times moral choices do not really impact anything other than follower like dislikes the gameplay is really well done storyline falls short and while some aspects may be nice it just feels very forced in my opinion endgame sidequests go here kill that go back there kill that again i just feel they could have done more weapons are kinda meh sure there are a lot of ways to customise them but there are so few base weapons to build them from it just feels like they tried to shovel weapon mods into the weapon pile to make it look bigger voice acting the voices are really well done while most people dislike it i find it quite nice they tried to add a little more depth to the game since they decided to lack in others the dialog system is kinda a joke having to guess what i am going to say causes me to reload a few times while i know there is a mod to replace this back as it was in the older games i feel like it should have been added in the game from the start without the need of the community to do it for them companions feel alive and i find it easy to get attached to them the jetpack why tease us like that power armor i find it fun to customise i like the idea of armor mods and hope they add more in the future my overall rating would be a 7 10please note my review will be updated as dlc is added to the game hopefully bethesda will listen to their fans and improve on many of the faults also i am not saying this is a bad game its just not the type of game fallout fans expected
