2023 early access review i came to this game from dungeon crawl stone soup where victory can only be achieved through sheer paranoia and ruthless tactics i approached my first qud run that way i played a true kin studied the dungeons and enemies and methodically killed my foes by bumping into them repeatedly it worked for a while at some point i went up a stairs and was one shotted out of nowhere by something called a neutronic heptasludge at that moment i suddenly achieved enlightenment and realized how you re really supposed to play this game actually first i spent half an hour on the wiki trying to figure out exactly what i had just died to in my latest run my character doesn t fight by bumping into things repeatedly he tears apart the entire dungeon with corrosive gas and mind controls and or mind explodes anyone who gets in the way i ve all but stopped following the main quest in favor of better pursuits like trying to turn myself into a slug permanently i ve lately wandered my way through a trash compaction plant home to an angry cult of baboons and an ancient slime drenched university one thing i love is how the game areas in qud take on unscripted lives of their own ex right before the neutronic heptasludge incident i was trying to get through a crypt where two factions were at war with each other for some reason the human side was launching explosive rockets that were wrecking the place and the ferret side was never mind it s complicated the other thing i love is that there s just this overwhelming feeling of chillness that pervades the game unwinding after work by trudging down the jungle river making camp and battling goatfolk it just feels right for some reason overall this game delivers ruthless tactics and it delivers garbage chute baboon cults 10 10
