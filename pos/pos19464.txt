2019 graphical immersion prototype for the matrix press f12 for new desktop background fits the gameplay experiance art direction could have used work amateur art design perhaps the creator needs an art tutorial ink block simulator gameplay immersion forgot i wasnt controlling it with my brain fliud controls great player agency once controls were established i could play it control schemes are hard to learn no control over the character i pressed jump not to stand still audio immersion harmony was achieved i wish real life sounded like this the sound fit the experiance volume controls needed adjusting would fit better in a casino arcade was probably made with a kazoo difficulity immersion must have iq of 180 or above to play i think the game might be cheating save your progress often the boss levels arent to bad press x to pay respects this is a screensaver game progression perhaps you should get a spreadsheet has a level up perk system flows nicely as skills improve player will experiance tedious situtations repeat the same experiance over and over you ll need an auto clicker story might inspire a cultural revolution original and thought provoking common tropes used effectivly story was an afterthought was it even edited for spelling errors n a play time your life went by and you forgot to notice it is probably a hobby to play a good amount of time set aside a day or so about as long as a chess match it should be on a cell phone price for the experiance pay to win a little steep but typical wait untill it is on sale support the creators they deserve it any amount is to much n a bugs attempting to break the game is futile have to try to break it rare if played normally you ll experiance them but easy to forgive you ll experiance them and it raises your blood pressure annoying and borederline broken not even suitable for a proof of concept personal touches i started the series with fallout 3 and i have been playing games on the creation engine since oblivion not as long as a great deal of fans but experainced enough to know that this game is probably the best desinged and executed game using this engine and from the looks of it as of 2019 it will probably be the best one despite the graphics being behind alot of other games that came out in the same era they used what they had to promote an atmosphere that is so far unparrelled in the franchise the game was so effective that modders of the modern franchise are attempting to recreate it and with hopefully great success this is a survival game with added quests and loot that a player can get lost in for days it can also be a somewhat quick game that only lasts a few hours it is up to the player to decide
