2022 perma death with consequences coupled with nearly infinite variations and potential self imposed scenarios the further you get into the game the more complicated it becomes and that leads to overconfidence in order to even attempt the harder difficulties on just the starting storyteller game engine the developers continually update their product and each of their dlcs gives the players something almost priceless nowadays agency being the freedom of individual choice without some kind of narrative or outwardly imposed morality you could be the nicest of people or the most bloodthirsty cannibalistic slavers to ever be known of that doesnt even touch on the mod community want there to be an emphasis on stone age sword shield and bow gameplay there s a mod for that want there to be fantasy elements magic dwarves and elves and simulate something like dungeons and dragons there s a mod for that want to have the highest of technology and go to war with the world because of your powerful defenses there s a mod for that want to have it basically be a farmville simulator and be simple traders with expanded options there s a mod for that the sheer love people have for this game shines through and through from the developers to the players to the modders to the social media content creators it truly is a phenomenon and i would highly encourage anyone to give it a try if they see it on sale the entry price for everything at full value being around 40 is way cheaper than a aaa title game but can be a bit expensive for those with a more frugal mindset i will be honest and say the most daunting thing about rimworld is when you re starting out for the very first time understanding the various zones and especially animals and getting them to stay in certain areas at certain times can be extremely frustrating to the point you either go on youtube to figure it out or you just abandon those aspects entirely however if the new player perseveres beyond their initial failure of a run they at least have learned some new things to deploy in their next attempt its an experience that continues to grow with you and over time there are still better or different or more unique ways to try to do the same sort of tasks 10 10 fun and repeatability10 10 music and lighting4 10 graphics quite charming though and mods can rectify this to an extent 10 10 ai game design for unique rogue lite experiences10 10 community interactionin conclusion when is the last time you found a game that was made by one of the big brands that was actually good for more than 5 20 hours give rimworld a try and i think you ll be pleasantly surprised by how much fun unfolds from the gift that keeps on giving
