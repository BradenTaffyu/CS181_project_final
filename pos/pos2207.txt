wait for sale until it s 10 15 maybe even 20 bucks game is worth it and has waaaaaay more content now than it did at launch plus they just give out free stuff every day now most negative reviews about being banned is because they went on the nexus and grabbed esp s to see items through walls know a handful of people who thought they wouldn t get banned for it then came here to complain about how they weren t cheating overall pretty decent they also have a fast track start so new players can skip the grind from level 1 to 20 and instead now start at level 20 with a pre made build which you can swap around whenever you like for the most part i will say this and it is important some addons do work i can t recommend it though as it s a massive grey area and you are subject to ban at any time so with that in mind be careful with what you download anything esp related will flag you and get you gone in maybe a week so wouldn t recommend it however there is a chat mod that adds text chat into the game with a global filter for all those who also have the mod good for trading finding events to farm and so on so fourth even a mapbook i think that will help you find items you look for on the map showing you where things may spawn and what not where bodies of water are so you can plan out the perfect spot for bases with water purifiers pretty neat stuff game is way better and has had some faction quest reworks since launch seeing the introduction of npc s awhile back
