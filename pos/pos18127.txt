2013 i have tried the other games in the total war franchise how can people even begin to call this game a heap of crap in comparison to the other titles in the series are we even playing the same game if ca released games like empire or medieval 2 today i can garuntee it would get on like no other game before how can people complain about the graphics in rome 2 when they are the best in the series this is the first game in the series that has a serious graphical texture to it i simply can t get over how cartoony the majority of others look the music in this game fits perfectly and as a student majoring in music at the university of toronto i like to think i have an educated opinion on the subject this game demands background music and it delivers it is not riddled with melody because that would simply be too distracting the rips in the french horn and the glorious moments from the brass section capture the modern view on rome excellently when i first booted up medieval 2 i was surprised to hear that a kyrie was playing on the menu screen at first i thought they had actually brough medieval music into the game but once i entered the game i was met disapointing upbeat synth rome 2 has a huge emphasis on diplomacy whole alliances of several smaller states rising up against my larger empire removes the old steamroll that was found in the previous total wars in empire once i became larger than any one of my neighbors i was usually able to steamroll my way across the land in rome each civilization is a challenge and their much more aggressive behaviour makes it even harder however there are a few options such as the threaten to declare war option and the ability to ask for give land that i sorely miss from past total war titles however this lack of options does not mean that rome 2 s diplomacy is broken and if anything the diplomacy in rome 2 is stronger than any other title seen before the political system is not as complete trash as most people are saying it is but it is definetly several steps back from the previous titles ca sorely needs to implement a family tree system and create a logical political system asap another thing that i miss about medieval 2 is the numerous traits that generals gained generals had so many traits that eventually i could get to really know them as people in rome 2 there are hints at the general s personalities but nothing as emersive as medieval s the seiges suck but after playing empire where the entire reason i stopped playing was because of the crappy seiges and how rediculously frequent they were seiges in rome 2 feel amazing the ai has gotten much better with seiges but they definetly need improvement this includes waiting to build seige equipment before attacking and attacking with all said equipment all at once instead of a few at a time also giving the ai the ability to attack from multiple angles is sorely needed i believe these issues can be fixed however one important point to note is that seiges are much less frequent in this game the majority of the battles i fight are out in the field and absolutely glorious the ai contrary to popular belief uses the terrain to it s advantage i had one battle where the ai used a massive sand dune to move its entire army and thereby get right behind my balistas with the use of provinces the number of walled cities has significantly been reduced which therefore reduces seiges the size of the map also lends a hand to the increased number of field battles many people are saying rome 2 is drop dead easy rome 2 is the first of the total war games where i have actually lost a campaign the ai brilliantly attacks vulnerable cities and effectively uses agents to cut off armies from eachother the ai is very very clearly the best i have seen in the series so far one important factor to take into account when looking at rome 2 is that there is now a restriction on the number of armies one may have this massively improves the game and i feel like not a single person has touched upon the subject in empire the ai would have hundreds of small armies running around making it impossible to strategically place my own armies with a restriction on armies i now have to strategically place my armies once ive reached the limit in the late game as opposed to simply pumping out 10 at a time in the late game once money no longer matters this restriction on armies now grants the possibility for one to actually have their empire crumble as opposed to being unstoppable with unlimited armies people are complaining about how clunky and bad naval battles are and while i agree the ai isn t the smartest it is not nearly as bad as people thing people need to realize that ancient naval battles simply were not very tactical especially when compared to the naval battles in the napoleonic era this grants the illusion that naval battles are broken but in my opinion they are exactly as boring and free of strategy as they would have been in the ancient world in terms of bugs and crashes i have experienced very few i had an issue with my game not loading past the title screen but this was easily fixed the only major bug i found was with the balance of power back in patch one where every faction i encountered thought they were exactly as powerful as myself even though i may have been an absolute superpower this ended up destroying diplomacy especially as a barbarian faction as many barbarian factions wont trade join confederation if they think you are not a total badass some are saying that pikes need a buff i have never seen more in my life pikes are easily the most powerful units in the game when used effectively the units themselves are next to the level of the mob as they should be when placed in proper positions pikes absolutely wreck people simply need to learn to play the game to apreciate their power another issue with the game is the auto resolve option while it is broken and generally kills more units than you should lose i don t have a problem with this issue it forces you to actually play most battles which should be the entire focus of the game practicing battles and getting emersed into how your empire is forming if the entire game could be auto resolved i would have little connection to my empire and the history of its expansion this game now has a stigma against it for being terrible and people are failing to see that it has it s issues but they are so minor that they can easily be ignored this game is the best in the series that i have played i have heard great things about shogun but i would not be able to get past the lack of variety in the game and the narrow portion of history that the game has to go off of with rome there is so much history to explore recreate and change if you are a fan of the series do not buy into the crap that these dramatic haters are giving this game look at it objectively compared to the rest of the series and you will know that it is one of the best
