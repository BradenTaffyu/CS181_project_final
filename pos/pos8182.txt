game is fun and nostalgic until you duel against someone using meta decks that take forever to set up so you are just sitting there trying to keep up with whatever is going on then when it s finally your turn it s really not because for every action you take you have to wait for them to decide if they are negating or setting up additional stuff in their field would love a playlist with cards from the original anime only
