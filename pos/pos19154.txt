fallout new vegas is what i consider the best fallout game in my opinion mainly because how important speech dialogues affect you during gameplay and the environment is fantastic too the weapons and armor for the game are great and the story for the game is what i consider the best story for the entire fallout series however this comes at a heavy cost due to the fact it is confirmed all cats have been extinct during the events of the game because this mod is very mod friendly you can have multiple mods that bring back cats thus now appearing in new vegas because every area needs cats i consider this to be both the best fallout game and cat game of all time 3
