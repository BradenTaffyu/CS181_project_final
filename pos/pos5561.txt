2021 early access review great game who need 1 or 2 years of development tl dr mid game turn into a micromanagment hell the game is fantastic until a certain point you start as a mercenary one party 50 150 soldiers doing missions small battles or bigger fights joining armies good graphics brutal engagments with 200 1000 units at the same time if your computer can handle playing as a soldier is a blast the problems start when you get a few towns and a bigger family the micromanagement never stops and gets worse overtime you have to physically move your party to towns to fix their issues when your lords get captured escapes they ll go into a random town until you pick em again then you ll have to reform the party same with caravanes for trading if they get captured you ll have to go in his town and recreate the caravan you have to partially fill towns with soldiers manually from your own soldiers all the little fun things of the beginning soon become a hassle as you can t delegate messengers are not a thing you can t manage a town at a distance you can t tell a party member to move to a location or guard a territory they do whatever they want if they re out of your army party so you have to do it yourself either you re leading your huge army to fight what is basically an enless war mid game or you take care of your cities while the rest of your faction fight with various success some commanders are pretty good other will throw waves of recruits at highly trained arbalists in the open backed with cavalry protip don t be a recruit in an imperial army you can t tell a party you created to guard an area or to kill all bandits attacking your villagers it s up to you or the ia if it feel like it worst if you let the parties you created roam around parties group of 70 200 soldiers under a lord they can be temporarily drafted in other armies of your kingdom and you ll have to physically move to the army talk to the leader and pay some reputation to get them back of course large armies are slow this leads the the next problem swarms my worst fear is not a massive army it s an army disbanded in the middle of my territory the small parties usually start raiding all villages in the vicinity while being too fast to be catched by a big army raided villages impact your town castle loyalty and gold quite heavily sure you could disband your army and hunt them yourself but that makes you take a step back and all your parties would reform under another army you can t control and man some army commanders are really really stupid verdun style charge in the open against walls of archers cavalry in a forest vs pikemens you name it i can t count the time i had parties wiped in someone else army but let s say you managed to capture the lords burning your villages the capture system is broken captured lords escape a lot i had some escape 20 seconds after being captured they never stay in a jail for more than a few in game days once they escape they magically teleport to their hometown rebuild a fast 80 mens army in the blink of an eye and go back to raiding villages ai cheat with recruits they will always find soldiers in town even if they re empty for you executions you say if you execute a lord no matter how much of an a hole he she is the whole faction will hate you he raided dozens of villages and killed hundreds of peasants still not good enough you just can t kill a lord without suffering heavy consequences down the line and you ll need those lords to be friendly later worth to mention capturing the leader of a faction won t stop a war last peace war is on off i had 600 days of continuous war followed by 600 days of complete peace in the entire map due to a bug apparently and i m now back at 300 days of war not a single day of peace when one war stop another start immediatly they will just never ever stop fighting can t catch a breath can t leave the front of your lose towns oh and the main quest randomly failed after 875 days or so i would still recommand the game it s really fun for a while but it need a huge qol update
