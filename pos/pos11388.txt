2017 early access review 129 unforgettable days burried in corpses or surrounded by concrete the steady whirl of blade traps replaced the sound of song birds so long ago part if the ever increasing cost of security and it still wasn t enough my nephew we lost to the influence of over nutrition i miss keeping him alive though maybe i tried to hard and his timid approach to survival the silence since he ate himself to death while sometimes peaceful brought back a more serious mood and the sound of the horrors of the night at least i know he is in a better place my sister fell in love with a zombie so much so that she became one of them never saw that coming but we were powerless to stop it even if we had wanted to who were we to deny the passions of anothers heart we found her wandering in an aimless search for her love who likely got blended into the concrete by one of our blade traps no amount of beer would give us the courage to put her down so we tied her to a bike and sent sent her off into the sunset to continue her search i think she would have thanked us after my sister there was only myself and felix we became an efficient zombie crushing duo brutally effective at laying down the mob glorious fireworks and choking mists of blood the madness of our experience was starting to show and we embraced it everything felt right until felix wandered too far and became severely irradiated the effects were so bad that he went almost completely blind he refused to accept his state and even though i would have gladly provided for him he was a warrior and wanted a warriors death so i took him up north a place he always talked about gave him a broken hammer and asked him if he had any regrets as he went on talking i rounded up some frozen lumberjacks and set them on him in retrospect i dont know if this was the right thing to do but i got some great pics out of it so now he has taken his last bike ride to the great redoubt in the sky and i alone carry the burden of life for they are all there but one i m34t last of the gomeshians on the dawn of day 8 if you choose to carry on you know you have true grit 10 10
