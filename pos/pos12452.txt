2020 its got its ups and downs garry s mod is a modification of the game half life 2 which allows players to mess around with props and objects from that game and mess around with certain tools aswell however there is also a thriving modding community for the game which allows fun gamemodes like trouble in traitor town amazing fun and dark roleplay get money guns etc one setback for this game is that when loading in servers you immediately see pink errors and stuff because of the missing texture problem to fix that you can either just install counter strike source if you own it or go to the internet and download all the textures for it if you are having issues connecting to servers and find yourself waiting ridiculous times you can also pre download mods which is a heck of alot faster overall its fun
