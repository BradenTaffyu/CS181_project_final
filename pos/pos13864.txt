2018 a huge thumbs up for this game i have to say the first time i played it i wasn t the biggest fan and i uninstalled it then i started to see videos of how you could play wwii scenarios and i decided to re install it i went through boot camp again as it had been a long time since i played it from that moment forward i can t stop playing this game whenever i have time i have only been a pc guy for less than two years now so you could say i m moving away from the quick pick up and play to the truly emersive games my taste for gaming has evolved and once i started putting time in games like dcs i thought it was only natural to put the time into this game and go through the learning curve as so many people have said this is not a pick up and play game which for some people is the curse but now for me thats the beauty of it i m drawn to come back and play more so i can improve and learn more i want to get better and i enjoy learning how to improve and have the drive to do so there are so many mods for this game and that is truly what makes the game amazing and will continue to make it amazing you can never get bored as there are a million mods to keep the game interesting it truly is a war game sandbox want to play wwii style cool want to play as the us british german soviets polish etc not a problem want to play in the vietnam error modern era future era no problem there is something for every gamer that enjoys a war game the graphics are quite good but the game is very poorly optimized so it really drains on your computer and puts plenty of strain on your gpu and cpu it is very difficult to get good and consistent frame rates out of this game still very enjoyable though the sound is quite good although i wish the wwii era weapons sounded more like the mods from day of infamy in my opinion doi and the mods out there provide the best sounds and weapon skins the gameplay is so customizable its frustrating at first but as you start to learn it becomes a blessing don t expect instant action but that becomes the beauty as you will find yourself at the edge of your chair looking for any little hint of enemy movement and sometimes going prone because you thought you saw something and trying to determine if you truly did or did not early on i little jumped when i walked into unexpected gunfire you will never get this type of immersion with any other game in summary buy it put in some time give it 10 hours to start getting the feel and from there on out you will be hooked as you continue to learn and improve time flies when you play this game by the way love it and can t wait till there is an arma 4 with a new engine which leads to better optimization and fps hopefully the developers learn from all the modders and make some many great things they have provided as standard in arma 4 this game needs to provide a huge shout out to the modders as they keep this game going and will for a long time bless the modders
