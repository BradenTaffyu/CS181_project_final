2016 honestly i cannot say enough good about this game you will come to love it and i haven t met anyone with a bad opinion of this game sure it s not everyone s cup of tea but if you are even slightly curious or interested in this game at all get it it s very relaxing and you can take the game at your own pace whether that is speed running and getting all achievements and as much money as fast as possible or slowly adventuring uprgrading your house tools weapons or just fishing the entire day away this game has a huge plethora of things to do which will likely keep you busy for a very long time and if that s not enough incentive to buy this game then another incentive would be that the developer actually listens to people s feedback if you have a problem or a bug that needs fixed or simply just some critiscism or appraisal the developer concernedape of this game will listen and act upon this all around fantastic game and fantastic developer 11 10 from me
