2015 fallout 4 was an amazing inprovement from the previous games in the series fallout 3 fallout new vegas ect on launching fallout 4 the main menu was very attractive a good impression but on actual gameplay it lacks previous elements of fallout 3 that i enjoyed such as the vac system not freezing time but on saying this the devlopers bethesda did improve the third person and the actual aiming system to be a lot more friendly and overall comfortable to use the graphics are great with rich colors used to make the waste land have some diffrence in color tones over all a well made game very enjoyable
