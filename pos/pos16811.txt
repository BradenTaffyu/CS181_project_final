2019 i don t normally leave many reviews but felt compelled to after seeing that this game was being review bombed by a group of angry entitled gamers for selling dlc house flipper is very much worth the price its amazing how many hours you can put into cleaning and fixing up houses i have 18 hours just on this account but on others i have played the whole game over twice its very relaxing to put on a video sit back and fix up a place the time flies by the devs are super responsive for such a small studio and willing to listen to any comments and bug reports the fact that the game is being subject to a targeted attack is quite frankly a crime and i hope steam takes action to weed out the people hurting the reputation of the devs
