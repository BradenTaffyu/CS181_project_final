2022 this game is an enhanced edition of forza 4 gameplay mechanics are still semi arcade style graphics have improved a bit by increasing the effect of water reflection i have to mention the map though how could you have managed to make a game s map so lifeless i never thought driving a car in a game with such graphics could be so boring in forza 6 you should design the map very carefully otherwise playerbase would react very harsh when it comes to reviewing
