2022 iracing and rfactor2 snob here i was very skeptical about the acc experience even though i had driven kunos s stuff from way back and know how good it can be a buddy of mine was driving acc and saying positive stuff and seemed to be somewhat addicted to it so i thought i d have a peek i bought it and starting driving first i thought the cars felt stiff compared to the previously mentioned titles but the more i pushed the more i thought this feels really good i can get a great sense of what the tires are up to and push accordingly the more i pushed the better it felt i went back to my favs and drove them and decided after all the acc actual physical driving experience is at least as good if not better plus the sound and graphics add up to a very strongly immersive experience yes it s limited in scope but the subject it covers is not small and has a great capacity for variety within the somewhat confined limits there are several cars that i haven t even heard the engines for much less driven potential fun the single player work up is really good a full campaign to be mr awesome driver and really good practice oriented stuff to play with also there is a deep ratings system that requires the driver to prove he she is serious about actually racing and is just a lot of fun to learn and develope your own personal ratings i really can t think of anything bad to say about the sim it drives great sounds amazing and is thoroughly fun hats off to kunos thanks buddy great stuff i love it
