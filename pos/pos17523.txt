2017 you love total war you love warhammer you re going to love this this game manages to capture the lore narrative and setting of warhammer fantasy to perfection although if you re looking for the nitty gritty realism or complexity of other total war games specially if you re looking for rome medieval 2 empire napoleon or shogun 2 kind of complexity you re in for a dissapointment this total war is more arcadey more streamline and more focused on pure fun and spectacularity siege battles for instance are heavily simplified and considerably shorter than other total war games the campaign map is extremely big but the campaign itself is not too hard the battles are fast paced and mistakes are easily solved and forgiving does it mean it s a bad or worse game than its predecessors nope it s a very fun spectuacular looking and sounding adaptation of the total war flavour into a very reach and inspiring franchise the visuals are simply epic from the design of the units and their animations to the sheer scale and detail of the world the faster paced gameplay is fun and easy to grasp but still makes you feel like in epic battles and wars which is what the essence of the franchise is all about i admit i somtimes miss the complexity of rome and medieval in this but it s a different beast with a distinct flavour from the originals
