2020 disclosure an adaptation of a game i designed in the name of odin is available as dlc for this game i was not paid for this to happen and i do not make a profit off additional sales of the dlc or the base game the following is my personal opinion as an owner of the game a copy of which i bought for myself it has some kinks that you need to learn to ignore or work around but i vastly prefer it to its main competitor the selection of unofficial and official add ons in the workshop is staggering and the official dlcs are professionally done and available at a fraction of the cost of the physical game add to that the option to create your own games very helpful with prototyping new titles and its general universal utility and there s really no question whether you should own it if there is a chance you ll be playing board games online with some friends or if you enjoy solo gaming i guess
