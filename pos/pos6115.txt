2021 yes this game has quite a big amount of dlc however it s plenty enjoyable without buying them all modding community is huge and base game has plenty to offer as well i reccomend it for creative gamers since the fun you re going to have depends on your imagination most of your playtime will be spent creating creating families and creating houses as well as community lots there s one thing that irked me a bit in this title lots in sims 3 you could freely place empty lots wherever you want and choose a size in sims 4 every town has preset lots you can t edit their size 64x64 lots are not present in the base game
