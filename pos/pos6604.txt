2017 at first i had no interest in trucks but i was interested in driving racing and by seeing how well this was going on steam charts was more played than rust at the time paired with it being on sale for 3 its really suprised me i bought it and started off not really having a clue about how the game would work or how it would be but i found it actually very chill to play and slightly relaxing the journeys are interesting when you see the roads for the first time and i am far from driving them all as now i have 125hrs and have driven just under 60 of the roads the addition of real radios in the game has been really interesting aswell and adds to the realism of the game being able to drive home from work listening to radio 1 and then half an hour later be driving a 55 ton crane around poland while listening to the same presenter as earlier is very nice i initially played it loads was the most hours ive ever played in the shortest amount of time racking up 86 hours in just under 9 days the dlc s were still on sale so i bought all map extensions as well as a few customisation ones the map extensions are definatley worth it and the tease of the italy extension this year is very interesting i would get this game if you have any interest in simulation driving or fancy a change from racing
