2018 early access review i had reservations at first but the amount of depth and customization in this game is staggering character and mutation customizing freedom of developing your friendly ally npcs modding your weapons and armor as you see fit obviously as a roguelike it has somewhat of a learning curve to get used to everything and at the start you ll probably die your fair or unfair share of deaths however each death only serves as experience to the player and each time you ll figure a more stable class or build toward progressing farther than you have before caves of qud is open ended in that you can choose either to be a mutant class steadily evolving to what you can choose to be a four armed dual wielding combat pragmatist or an esper with the ability to make clones of yourself and simultaneously cast pyrokinesis over a horde of enemies in the safety of your own psychic shield and those are just two possibilites the fun is experimenting and finding unique mutations that can play off each other since the game is still in development there might be a few bugs here or there and the lore and story and main quest as a result are still in progress though from what i ve seen active progress updates seem to happen on each friday so expect new content every week however post game is slightly less balanced right now so once you beat the main story things tend to scale a bit exponentially difficult past story the soundtrack is nice to listen to the ambiance definitely fits the mood hopefully we ll see even more variety for different areas and landscapes as the game develops the graphics tend to be hit or miss for people i personally don t mind ascii and the tileset for this game is pretty detailed and accurate as can be for a true roguelike if you feel put off by the retro graphics let the gameplay speak for itself finally the replay value well let the hours i ve played on the game speak for itself the maps are proceduraly generated based on each new character and world playthrough so you never have the same adventure twice things i d have to be critical on would be the lack of general quests and towns static trading hubs which i can count on one hand and the faction system though impressive that you can ally yourself with any npc group in the game don t really interact much with other groups outside of fighting in random encounters on the map early game is punishing but manageable and rewarding to learn but the lack of development late game means you ll be facing enemies that can sometimes one shot you even with a developed character as placeholders for late game enemies to be replaced as well as the deathlands in general in conclusion the game has it s flaws as a game currently in early access but developed enough for deeply immersive wide array customization gameplay with nearly endless replayability and weekly updates the caves are dark but the future looks bright
