2020 ok i only have 265 hours on this but im gonna be honest and say that i played a lot of the game on a pirated copy way back in the day first off the game is smooth has very pleasing visual aesthetic and colour palettes great animations and a bit of customisation the player skins which are all 100 unlockable ingame it should be able to run on a plethora of machines and even though they advise for the user to utilise a controller i didn t feel the need for one second off this is a rogue like unlike most rogue likes you first runs will probably be pretty good after beating the game initially you ll be met by the option to add difficulty i advise against jumping on this until you unlock some items and perks in the lowest difficulty possible the item and perk mutation drops is either rng or a guarantee depending on the difficulty and type of item a complete run can last up to 1 hour 1 hour and a half depending on the difficulty route and personal skill dying is not bad i repeat dying is not bad this game teaches you stuff through death and it s a great learning tool you get destroyed by an enemy you ve never seen before great now you know to play safe around them or avoid them altogether difficulty is split into 6 no cell difficulty one cell etcetera until 5 cell difficulty you earn these cells by beating the final boss the hand of the king unlike a lot of games deadcells implenets and interesting choice of adding difficulty while adding damage and armor or health to certain enemies higher difficulties will also throw new enemies at you new mechanics to watch out for malaise and also give you more loot items chests shops etc each cell difficulty has it s own differences to the previous or next and it s great to take your time and grow accustomed to all of them third off the community is great the devs speak to the community try to understand their complaints and strongly deliver unless you re a total rogue like god this game should give you more than enough hours of entertainment fun and rage i strongly recommend this game to anyone willing to either dive into the genre or further explore it
