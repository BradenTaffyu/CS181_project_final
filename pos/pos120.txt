2017 stardew valley is a fantastic game and it deserves to be played for an infinite number of hours i will recommend this game to anyone without any doubt and in this review i will try to explain why this game should be played and enjoyed my progress i imgur com 1 storywell the story is quite simple you are a hard working person who is employed by a big corporate firm but you are starting to get flooded with work your grandpa has recently died and left you a typed letter which you can open when you are most in need you think this is the time and you open the letter whereby your grandpa tells you that when a certain part of life comes you need a change in order to feel normal again in this case he invites you to go to his farm in the valley which is now unattended 2 gameplaythe game offers a huge amount of gameplay mechanics which are very nicely implemented into the game you have chiefly 6 gameplay mechanics farming fishing mining foraging combat and seasons in my opinion farming is the main focus of the game you can plant crops water protect and harvest them they are your main source of income the variety of crops is huge and since the game has 4 seasons there are crops which only grow in particular season while other crops can grow for consecutive seasons picture of the farm durring autumn i imgur com fishing is quite hard depending on how much time you want to invest in it again affect the types of fish you can catch catching fish was my main priority in my first hours in the game and my main source of money it s quite hard to make money out of fishing but i found out how to later you can find treasures while fishing so keep that in mind mining is good for when you get bored of fishing or doing stuff on your farm it s very interesting and after couple of visits to the mines you will be planning how many levels you are going to do in 1 day in the mines you are going to find all kind of items like minerals geodes which can be opened by the local blacksmith and stones which can be used in crafting other items there are quite a few types of monsters located in the mines depending on how deep you are in the mines monsters differ in damage done to you and how long you need to attack them to defeat them foraging is focused on chopping down wood and harvesting wild fruits and foraging items of course i m not covering the other gameplay mechanics in detail because there s really a lot it s like trying to explain how life works to someone from another planet and doesn t know how planet earth is like there are more mechanics like cooking crafting various items the valley s own social community quest lines which are quite large in number community center which needs to be rebuilt by you local museum which needs new artifacts books and minerals to be donated there is a ton of stuff to be done in the game in order to become even remotely close of completing the game you need to invest a lot of hours into the game which is nice 3 character customization and selecting farm typebefore the game starts you need to create your character by selecting a vast amount of characteristics skin colour type of clothes colour of the clothes facial hair for males hair type etc the game offers a lot of variety for your character you can create a pretty normal character or a very strange looking one there are also a couple of farm types or layouts you need to choose from each has its own pros and cons i went with the forest type which offers more wood but it limits the space of your farm where you can plant crops i think there is a farm type which is very hardcore but i can t speak from experience 4 soundtrackthe game has a spectacular soundtrack and i absolutely adore it it s more than 2 hours long which is quite long for an indie game the music is always right on spot and gives you a relaxing feeling while playing i always love when the game and the soundtrack are actually talking to each other and complement one another perfectly 5 secrets no spoilers this game starts slow with you working at the farm but that s just the tip of the iceberg you will be amazed at how many things you can do and find in this game super rare secret event i imgur com 6 stardew valley s wiki page and look up anything mod wiki page is your best friend in this game it s a life saver it helped me so many times when looking for things i could never learn inside the game i honestly don t know how you are supposed to find anything without this wiki page now while i was play stardew i had like 20 tabs open on my browser and all of them were wiki pages and i was constantly alt tabbing it was getting frustrating after 80 hours of doing it one day i looked at stardew s subreddit and saw a guy sharing a similar experience with 20 tabs open and another dude sharing about a mod where you can do all the wiki related stuff without alt tabbing well the mod is awesome you simply click f1 when you are hovering over something with your cursor and a window with info pops up it s very useful but some people are calling it a cheat though i don t think so there are also mods for finding artifacts but then that s really cheating link for the mod www nexusmods com 7 collectablesthey are hard really hard you have a special section in your in game menu dedicated to tracking your progress and seeing what have you collected so far one tab for the general items crops foraged items monster loot crops and animal products which shows you the types and quantities of crops you have sold another tab for fishing shows all types of fish in game a tab for minerals that can be obtained from opening geodes and breaking stones in the mines or by unlocking treasures while fishing one tab for artifacts they are probably the hardest part of the game since they are kind of randomly generated the grind for them is real final tab is for cooking which shows every recipe you ve cooked even if you somehow found a complete meal you will need to actually cook it in order for it to pop up in the list sadly i ve reach steam s review maximum characters and i can t post the whole reveiw at once i even try to split it in half the first half here and the rest in the comments but it s not going to work so i ve used external site where i post reviews as well and i will kindly ask you to go there and see the rest there are like 3 more points remaining of the reveiw which are very interesting in my opinion also there you will see how screenshots are implemented in the review way better than steam again i m very devastated by that i can t post the whole reveiw here and i probably will lose many readers like that sorry t t link
