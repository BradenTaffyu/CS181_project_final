2019 writing this with just under 5 hours in game i m hauling cargo from las vegas to los angeles or some darn thing doing 90 mph on the freeway in the rain dawn s just arriving i go to change lanes toward the driver side and find myself my actual physical self sitting at my desk turning my head left to check my blind spot as it turns out my office printer wasn t thinking of passing that kind of immersion deserves a positive review
