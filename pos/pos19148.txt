2014 one of the greatest rpg games of all time in my opinion lots of people say fallout 3 is better i admit it is hard to decide between the two positives fallout 3 had a better atmosphere compared to fallout new vegas it actually felt less of a wasteland in new vegas less of a gritty and depressing feeling and more of a cowboy western feel the story in fallout new vegas is utterly amazing it can go many ways depending on who you side with later on in the game which brings me to another point later on in the game you have much more choice and freedom on which path to take which allies you want aiding you who you don t want to work with etc the game starts off very slow paced a bit like any rpg and is most likely the part where most people are going to turn it off at but once you get going it becomes addicting the characters are detailed and some of the guys you encounter you will either like or hate fallout 3 had 20 levels no dlc and 30 levels with dlc so if you thought that was too little you will be glad to know that fallout nv has 30 levels no dlc and 50 levels with dlc many people argue that fallout 3 had a bigger map this may be true i m not sure but i feel that fonv has more unique locations to visit i also found the dlc in fonv much more interesting than fo3 it wasn t a case of i just want to finish this damn dlc so i can get the items last thing is there are factions which weren t in the previous game which is pretty damn cool once again opening a path for your character on who to side with legion ftw you can at least create attachments for your guns in this game unlike fallout 3tons of mods which spices the gameplay up a lot negatives the only downside to this game is that it of course uses the same engine as fo3 so it may feel a bit outdated along with the graphics not like they matter sadly they do for some people one thing that annoys me the most about this game is the fact you cannot work alone later on in the game you must have the aid of someone else if you choose to spoilers take over vegas once you hit max level it gets really boring all you can really do is do the side quests and explore conclusion great game definitely buy it worth way more than the price it is 9 10
