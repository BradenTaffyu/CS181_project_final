2018 early access review so i have owned this game for years but never played for more than 2 hours at a time life stuff other games always cut my time short in game then i found 7 days to die and became hooked on that even going so far as to completely learning to mod the game in pursuit if a hardcore zombie challenge this vehicle build me and the mrs decided to buckle down and learn it proper we always wanted to first few days were full of setting everything up scouting nice starter locations and getting mods to play nice together we restarted several times getting to know the traits and ins and outs so last night we finally start 7 hours fly by we started small taking a lone trailer in the woods making quick silent runs to nearby houses scavenging we found 2 nice cars saw crowbar wrench an engine and lots of books each night we read and skilled up and survived on canned food and berries each day we run and scavenge 5 crates full of items at our trailer home just north of muldragh i believe we got a nice forge and campfire set up down the road from our place found 2 more cars but the engines need work and the tire is missing from one im learning mechanics so soon we will be able to repair those i m sorting our bookshelves i just built and planning out expansion to the trailer when i hear a buzz in the distance i m utterly confused is this an ambient sound like the dogs barking or something more it goes away after a bit of searching around so i went back to cooking our stir fries i hear it again only this time louder its definitely coming our way a helicopter the look on my wife s face when we ran out to the road and saw that massive horde coming our way following that helicopter blindly walking straight through our campfire and lighting themselves on fire the entire forest was set ablaze all was lost and our home was destroyed i realize i could have just ran away but honestly i was so jazzed that after mastering a game like 7 days to die something could catch me totally off guard and scare me it was glorious and we literally were screaming in our chairs trying to fight them off while watching our entire area go up in smoke hats off to tis for standing their ground and giving a seasoned player something to get excited about again i didnt think it was possible but they have devised a game where even a simple decision on day 1 like placing a fire can impact you 10 days later fan 4 life
