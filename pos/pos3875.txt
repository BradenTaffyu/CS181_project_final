2020 early access review never played xcom or any of the clones that came with its rise in popularity but this thing does everything that interested me about xcom while eliminating everything that scared me away from that game it s a passion project and a masterpiece in my eyes and with 137 hours in and still wondering whether i ve even passed half the game i cannot recommend this enough for anyone who s a fan of tactics and story driven games and for anyone who d like an xcom like experience without the rogue like risk of losing hard earned characters pros fantastic story and great characters great combat and tactics system that allow for casual players to easily get a grip of and for hardcore players to go wild great art style deep leveling crafting and customization systems very long great soundtrack little resource penalty for losing earned characters don t diecons bad translation not unenjoyable but may be difficult to understand at times needs to be always online price may be a little high for a work in progress occasional cringy humour graphics may look outdatedi bought it last christmas at full price and haven t regretted my purchase for a second and i rarely buy games that randomly showed up in my recommended this game deserves more attention and with more features promised to come by the developers any support will only make it better
