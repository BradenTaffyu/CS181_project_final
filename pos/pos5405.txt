2021 early access review the saw hander had chased me well past it s hold through the salt marshes i m quick but not quick enough i try to line up a shot with my chain pistols but the saw hander is a pillar of the robot community a people i wish to befriend so i keep running to the southwest through witchwood and saltvine i stumble my 4 hands carrying the crysteel blades tight my knuckles tinted white away from their natural green i come to a river the river zym i ve managed to create some space between me and the saw hander but not enough if i run along the side i ll be dismembered there s only one option i take a deep breath and dive in furiously swimming to the southwest it isn t far i should be able to make it but then i see them madpoles swarming up from the depths a mass of fish with distended jaws of mangled teeth they want me for dinner i swim harder not hard enough they start on my feet and hands the pain is white hot i can barely focus on the movements of my limbs my extremeities begin to regrow but more and more madpoles surround me it s done my fate is sealed another life claimed by qud 10 10 would recommend
