2020 i have over 150 hours into fallout 76 and i was one of the few who really enjoyed it from the get go i did come in later about 4 or so months after launch so i am thinking a lot of the bugs were taken out i have played most of the game solo with the exception of some of the end game stuff i also have a friend who plays and we spend time playing together and it is great playing fallout with a buddy launching a nuke taking on a scortchbeast queen and all that stuff but it is also a great solo game c a m p building is great and ghas been expanded from fallout 4 the amount of outfits you can get is great the world is wonderful and the quests are really great now with wastelanders out it s a whole new level it really feels like a brand new fallout game i really am enjoying my time i have only really been doing the ally questlines so far but they are really great with great acting and writing and interesting story game def is not for everybody but i really have enjoyed my time with fallout 76 it s my comfort food game
