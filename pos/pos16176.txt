2019 good it s my new virtual desktop that i use even for work i m ingame most of the time just switching boards i can play any tabletop that is available by default from workshop from saves found in internet i can create some diagrams and share them with other people while talking inside the game objects and groups of objects can be saved sorted by folders and reused in all your boards i finally was able to play pokemon trading card game with my friends by finding images of decks in internet and creating my own decks etc scripting i even integrated chatbot into it many games come with some useful additions like steps card slots dice rolls etc lua rocks ban kick bad players and rewind time back flipping the table is fun but rewind freezes the game for 2 3 sec configurable server permissions like disabling items context menu copying items flipping painting fog of war can be configured to work differently for different users and hide all by default vr support you can upload your creations to workshop directly from the game different grids support rectangle hex change object colors physics etcand many morequestionable default object set is not very big tho really useful and allows custom things but that s completely negligible when you can use saved objects from other places import your own not able to copy paste images into the game directly but that can be done using components custom tile submitted that at game forum because that could really be a cool stuff requires a bit of time to get into and understand what things are used for but anyway quite feature richbad people with very slow internet connection will face issues while loading heavy games of other players but of course that s expected just notifyingoverall 100 10 and i guess that with more support this game can be a game changer so to say alot of potential in right hands all the best luck to dev s
