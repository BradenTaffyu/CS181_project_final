2018 early access review one of the greatest and deepest sim management games available fulfilling mechanics with the trademark klei quirky aesthetic if you re even remotely into physics chemistry and enjoy simtower style games check it out pros lots to see and do great sound and visual design every failure is a lesson great dev support and frequent content updatescons difficulty spike may be offputting to casual players cascading failures punish the player a lot command priorities are hit and miss in my experience
