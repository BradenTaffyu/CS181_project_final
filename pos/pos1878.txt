2023 i think the best way i can describe this game is an online rpg rather than a traditional mmo although it does have the essentials dungeons raids world bosses etc the worlds themselves are pretty empty most of the time go into swtor with a solo mindset understand you re rarely going to see people doing story content 10 years after the game s launch but that s not a bad thing the endgame community is very active and those planets areas are always full of players however having low populated areas has little effect on a story based game like swtor i actually just started playing for the first time in 2023 and feel like i would hate the 2012 2014 swarms of players buzzing around constantly and much prefer the less player cluttered experience swtor has 8 origin stories to complete for 100 free this is easily over 300 hours of free content even if you blast through it i am almost done 2 stories agent warrior and i still only have 80 hours if you do choose to subscribe for just 1 month you get to keep all dlc content forever no mmo i ve ever played has a monetization system this good so for 15 you get close to 400 500 hours of star wars content all created by one of the best story driven game developers on the planet bioware everything is fully voice acted and your decisions can really affect the outcome of your characters story
