2019 probably has the best gun play of any fallout game the rpg aspect is lacking choices dont feel like they matter as much in this game as they did in fallout new vegas still pretty solid fun with a lot to do although there is nothing notably special about this game would recommend if you like open world adventure games maybe stay away if you want a more rpg like game but might want to check it out if its on sale and you have nothing else to play 5 10 rating please note that i m very conservative when giving ratings with a 5 10 being neutral meaning there is usually nothing notably special about it
