2021 i ve put 20 hours into the game and i can already say that i will put another hundred this game may seem like a farming game i wont refute but it is definitely more than that this is a farming fishing foraging gathering breeding and mining game i am sure i could put more examples but i seem to remember just this portion you are not just working in this valley there are several people you would probably care about and some you can even marry i remember putting a stupid smile just because i made a npc happy the soundtrack is amazing as well puts you on the mood real quick while playing this game you can relax and just do what you want or pay attention to time and events it is all up to you it offers much freedom like choosing farm or your lifestyle i recommend it to everyone at least take a shot the creator is amazing too
