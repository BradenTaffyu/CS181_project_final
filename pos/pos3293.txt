2021 i was someone who was not really into these types of games however fear not this game has everything that a great rpg needs top tier story and quests your choices do matter you can change many things that happen in end game by doing something in act 1 this game has turn based combat and that can turn some players off initially however it is masterfully done there is so many ways to approach each battle that you will fall in love with turn based combat that is present here you can re spec your character s for free so even if you royally screw up your build just re spec and you re good whenever you hear witcher stan mouth breathers say that witcher 3 is the best rpg game slap em and then gift them this gem as compensation they will be forever in your dept hope that this review helps
