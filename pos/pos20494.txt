2020 this game is more than 10 years old already and it still holds up to this day tl dr 10 10 would recommend this game to anyone interested in the tower defense genre this was among the earliest tower defense games i have played when i was younger i had a retail version of it and only recently bought it on steam because of the sale and because of nostalgia too it had been almost 10 years since i last played this game and i still remember all the mechanics after completing all the game achievements here are my findings the good very easy to understand mechanics even a child could play it not too easy not too difficult if you re a newcomer it s got endless levels which is great for endurance runs and hardcore players you don t need a beast pc to play this game the neutral no hotkeys the game is played with only the mouse it can be tiring at some times and it would have been great if they made hotkeys ex pressing 1 will let you automatically select sunflower pressing q will select peashooter despite having many plant varieties the strategy you use is ultimately always the same for a specific area it can get boring playing through the adventure mode doing almost always the same thing the bad it s a shame that the first game is the most superior game and the sequel had to be a mobile cashgrab
