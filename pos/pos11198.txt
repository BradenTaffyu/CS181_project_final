2021 two point hospital isn t such a simulation game like the most others in fact it s far away from showing the reality but that is what the game makes special and lovely it includes a lot of sarcasm and humorism in general the diseases illnesses the patient have follow this line and are therefore more funny than anything of realistic i mean we re speaking from illnesses like cubism floppy discs grey anatomy jazz hand premature mummification cauliflower ears flat packed etc and really it makes so much fun to discover all these different diseases and everytime you experience something new you have to laugh because it s always connected with a funny anecdote and in general it has to be said that two point hospital has such a lot of lovely details in it which makes the game only even more great with that i mean for example the loudspeaker announcements this woman is so funny with the little things she tells and you often have to smile about it the same goes with the announcements trough the radio and the stil of the graphic fits also perfectly and even if you only have the main game without any dlc you can spend a lot of time in that game i spent round about 100 hours only in the main game because i had a lot of fun to collect all possible stars for every different hospital it gets never boring i can also tell that the dlc are worth it too because there is also so many new things to discover new diseases new hospitals new challenges new landscapes etc i don t say that often but i have no negative aspect about that game i m just really happy with it
