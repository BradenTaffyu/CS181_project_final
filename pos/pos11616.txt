2016 early access review day 1 this is pretty cool like minecraft with zombies and better graphics day 2 sweet jesus the map is pretty damn big day 3 why did i spawn in this damn wasteland day 4 that s a big group of zombies i should check it out day 4 5 that was a terrible idea day 5 hey i got some guns day 6 well it s one more day until the horde comes day 7 i should buy a boat day 7 5 how the crap did all of the zombies burrow under my house day 8 i honestly have no idea how any of that happened and how i survived this game is outstanding it s challenging intriguing and fun all in one i ve died a good number of times because of dumb mistakes see day 4 but when you are able to make it through each of the horde days it s just satisfying i haven t spent as much time playing as others and i m only through about 20 something days but this game is just fun it would be even better if i could set up my own server and have a few friends in it and all of us were playing together i m looking forward to see what the future updates and actual release of the game look like
