2022 raft is a good beginner style survivor open world game the story graphics and game play is child friendly and easy to master i have had no issues on the default difficulty in thriving and building my raft into a boat i even have a grand piano on the top deck the story is difficult to follow this is due to audio issues where the game seems to have trouble knowing what sounds take priority and it is not consistent which choice is made i fiddled with the audio having to turn most things down by over fifty percent to better hear the voices while sometimes having to turn the audio down because the voice audio becomes abruptly loud in all this is not a make or break and only impacts the story aspects all but the voice audio was fine the music is relaxing and well chosen the game play feels a little dated having to rely heavily on a micromanaging method of having items in the specific interaction overall the game played nice and controlling the raft and using the equipment is fantastic it is the crafting or combined tools being used that the rules become inconsistent what might have worked for most things will not always work for all things even if the process is exactly the same the graphics are great but require frequent reloading after prolonged play the water levels seem to overcome the raft in a time played equals higher water levels not sure what causes this but it becomes quite comically bad i left the game on overnight to see how it would turn out and i was not disappointed the bottom deck was nearly completely submerged with waves starting to show on the deck above it this is fixed with a reloading of the game the game is pleasant to view up to that point overall raft is a fantastic game with issues that are present but do not overtake the experience the game is kid friendly and an excellent introduction into open world survival gaming
