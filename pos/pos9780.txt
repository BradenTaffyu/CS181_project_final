2016 early access review ran a sweet little colony called haven this random brawler joins us called bowman turns out he s awesome with a spear so i give him hunting duties bowman fearlessly defends the colony on several occasions from tribals and pirates anyway for some reason a bunch of beavers show up and start eating all the trees this is unacceptable because wood is a key resource for me so i dispatch bowman to go and deal with them the situation gets the better of him and unfortunately both his arms are torn off by beavers i send another colonist out to go and rescue him and he s in a hospital bed just in time to save his life this is annoying that i ve now lost my best melee defender but whatever i ll just buy some new arms for him and turn him into some sort of cyborg hunting machine as luck would have it a passing trader just so happens to have a single bionic arm so i snap one up and schedule an operation to install it my resident doctor a criminal surgeon is enjoying a few beers in the community centre and decides to head down to surgery because he s dedicated like that and besides it s not like there s any laws on this planet against surgically installing bionic implants whilst under the influence i watch the surgery progress with a bit of blood being splashed around but i have full confidence in my drunk skill level 6 surgeon but then things take a turn for a worse and i am notified that regretably bowman has not survived the procedure devestated i go and inspect the colonists health panel and discover that my semi competent semi sober surgeon has accidentally surgically removed his heart i have never in my life laughed so hard whilst playing a computer game long story short in the days preceeding a ton of pirates show up kill the vast majority of my colonists enslave the rest and then burn my colony to the ground that in a nutshell is the story of haven
