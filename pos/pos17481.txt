2016 diplomacy actually works in this one as the empire i managed to a form a grand alliance between myself brettonia and the dwarves and everybody teamed up to cancel the apocalypse you can tell your allies where to put their armies and coordinate solid strategies to make sure everything goes down as planned probably the best total war game so far better even than shogun 2 since it doesn t have an infuriating realm divide mechanic nor does it have a max number of turns you keep going until somebody wins balance could probably be better the vampire counts can pull up so many units in a single turn that they re basically unbeatable on the campaign map if you use them at all competently on the flipside every empire unit except stanks and demigryphs just cannot make its upkeep back compared to the other armies equivalent units i do wonder how they re going to fit all the races in their appropriate places without massively redrawing the map but that s a bidge to cross when we come to it
