2019 one of my most played games i absolutly love it but its under developed it lacks something everytime there is a update like the valentine one with new kitchen parts missing a corner piece and the fact we still cant change the color on the side of stairs i really think the game would have alot more value if they could focus on making the game mod supported free content for them free content for us less time for them to stress about making new stuff and more hours of content for us im really thinking this game is gonna be huge in a few years and i enjoy seeing the game develope cant wait to try the garden expansion when ever that finally comes out also seriosly you guys need to work on your set up for the people ive added like 10 dressers and closets and still gotten the no place for my cloths comment along with alot of other ones not working like they should
