early access review minecraft but for adults the best survival crafting game i ve ever played after 500 hours playing vanilla with my so through 3 alpha updates playing 70 hours on a modded server and slaughtering countless zombies i am finally recommending this to anyone on the fence being in alpha for 10 years gets a lot of flak in online communities but if it was any other developer they d be charging for dlc for all the new releases it s the opposite of a money grab each new alpha is like a different game and if you hate a version you can always rollback to a previous release if you re sick of vanilla join a server mod it or just change your settings and play style scared of zombies just turn them off hate defending your expertly built fortress against hoards of the undead every 7 days turn it off tons of settings to adjust difficulty if you re overwhelmed or bored you can pick it up for less than 10 during sales but it s worth every penny of the suggested retail price
