2020 remember the days when klei were saying that don t starve will be singleplayer only and networking is too difficult to implement good times i am really happy that the game is still as fresh and fun if not more as it was many many years ago as alive as ever to make it short just get it if you re at least slightly interested in this type of game and or like the artstyle the difficulty can be tweaked easily in game plus mods mods millions of mods other than that networking is much better than it used to be if you remember reading anything about it in the past and the game has tons of content variability and mystery which will easily give you hundreds of hours of not starving or at the very least you trying not to absolutely recommended p s needless to say it gets labor of love nomination from me 3
