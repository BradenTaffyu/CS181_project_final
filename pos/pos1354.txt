2021 early access review one of if not the best zombie survival games out there it is a very realistic zombie survival simulator where you are in the fictional knox country based on a real place which is ground zero for the zombie infection ways you can survive scavenge search for what supplies are left not a solution that can be used forever but good when you need some quick supplies or are starting out barricade zombies about to break in need just a little more time to jimmy that window open to escape or maybe you just want some extra protection well fear no more with barricading just grab a heavy object and put in front of a door or use planks and nails to keep that baby shut for a looong time farm take a trip to the country grow food in or on the outskirts of the many towns as scavenging wont last forever be healthy you can freeze to death be lacerated overheat break fracture a bone fall from a 10 story building become zombie food and get bitten getting a zombie infection is almost always going to result in slow death followed shorty by zombification there is no cure seriously you get bit get a zombie infection its game over being scratched is most likely not going to make you a deadhead but it can happen while being bit is certain death apart from that infections can happen where you get a fever and sick but with medicine and or good care to yourself you can make it through fracturing breaking a bone requires a splint to heal and that part will be mostly ineffective for the healing process you can guess what extreme tempature treatments are cool down warm up changing seasons are a problem too fight or flight if you want a chance at surviving you must quickly examine a fight situation and determine what is best a group of two or more zombies and you have a butter knife flight have one zombie and a butter knife fight if you have to get past it or just forget these and make your own solution go around get the zombie s attention hop through a window wait for it to slither through then stomp its head in when its on the ground the possibilities are endless conclusionit is a amazing game with so much to offer and there are things like the lore seasons and farming i kinda glossed over but its because you should experience the game just one thing if you want to play this game then switch to build 41 anyway bye old review new review okay so with the new build 41 release and multiplayer along with louisville i thought i d update my review this is the most detailed zombie survival game to date period can you play as a maniac who raids other players gets all the guns and goes on a killing spree sure can you be the cool car guy who can repair any car and maintain them while running over zombies yep or can you be the doctor farmer or carpenter metalworker who maintains the foodstocks helps others who are injured and builds stuff of course there are so many ways to play this game and approach situations everyone has a different experience now when you start out you will not be any of the above you are the equivalent of a new hatched baby duckling waddling out into the world just to be torn apart by zombies okay maybe the baby ducklings don t get chomped by zombies but you get the point for your first few characters you will die it takes a lot to survive a month week or even just a couple days in this game also don t be turned off if it sounds too hard for you you can try easier settings in sandbox then work your way up character creation is choosing your profession that determines some basic skills and using a point system to determine how much of a dunce or out of shape beta male they are in exchange for points that you can invest into being a giga chad oh sandbox is great too you can have waddling zombies who are slow but great in terms of strength and finding you you can have sprinters who can catch up and overwhelm you with just 2 or 3 but they are weaker and have less numbers you can make things such as food or firearms more common or more rare depending on how masochistic you are feeling that day if you re learning the ropes then disabling zombie infections and reducing their numbers can help sandbox is an amazing thing that allows infinite replayability the map is huge with the real life towns of muldraugh and west point along with louisville and the fictional ones such as riverside and rosewood it s constantly expanding with more locations like fort knox and brandenberg planned to be added the lore of this game is also amazing when you re not out scavenging you can watch tv and listen to radio and see the situation deteriorate outside kentucky and the exclusion zone watching channels sign off for the last time as zombies broke down the door of the studios was actually unnerving for me and it adds to the fact that even in multiplayer no help is coming and you are truly alone the modding community of this game is insane and some content might as well be part of the original game cars guns traits more events different zombie ai different environments etc just go on the workshop for this game and browse around if you aren t sold already and think the game might not be to your liking or replayability the mods will fix it this game has amazing immersion even though it looks like the sims the detail is amazing you can see clothes you put on you can sweat if it s hot or there are too many clothes you can trip if you run or sprint over fences while panicked or simply due to bad luck drinking river water is no good and you will get the ouchies if you do your character can get bored if they spend too long inside you character can get anxious by being infected bloody or due to being where a lot of zombies are the previous two that i just talked about can make your character depressed and they will do actions slower get it now the devs deserve it and you won t be disappointed
