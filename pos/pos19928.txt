2020 okay so it s not perfect but it s not far from being great i was part of the beta program and honestly didn t play it all too much it felt very ropey to me so how the game was at launch was not much of a surprise they did however follow it up a month later with a great balancing patch which has improved things across the board it s very playable at this point has some very nice quality of life features queuing actions researches and auto reseeding farms to name a few which don t detract from the game at all just nice to have the main question is why play this rather than the hd or voobly versions voobly is as of writing jan 2020 still the competitive baseline though de will likely creep towards replacing this over time especially given that the new multiplayer system in de is a better system for the regular user will be interesting to see though it s great that de has a growing ranked playerbase hd has never been considered much of a competitive platform but has been great for the casual playerbase to get into aoe2 i d say that asides from those with lower spec machines de is close to a straight replacement so all in all it comes down to whether you trust microsoft to continue investing into aoe2de to fill in the gaps needed to put de on par with voobly if you do de is where you should be regardless of where you choose to play there s still players in all of them and moving between each one is pretty easy so no worries about switching later on i ll be playing de for the qol features and the growing playerbase
