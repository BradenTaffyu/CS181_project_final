2015 it s fallout 4 need i say more seriously though it is amazing it looks great i seriously do not understand everyones issues here yes if you get really close to a tree or a wall it pretty much looks like skyrim on pc but who cares all the npcs look incredible and your player character is just superb easily the best and most enjoyale character creation i have ever done i really do think you d have to try damn hard to make an ugly character which when you think back to oblivion and previous fallouts is just incredible also the female voice actor is super for me personally up there with fem shep can t say about the male one haven t played yet the gunplay is greatly improved no longer do you struggle to shoot anything more than shotgun distance away even melee combat is fun and engaging now not just spam attack button forever you have to think most the time the new armor crafting is basically just skyrim level crafting well not crafting think improving weapons and armor in skyrim without actually being able to build a weapon from scratch it is rather annoying to be honest i have 700 steel and cannot craft armor for myself so have to find a random left metal arm on some low lifes corpse then i can customise it the world is massive maybe not strictly in size but the amount of things you have to do is seriously overwhelming at times i am lvl 20 and haven t even done the second main story quest yet i do have a few issues though for starters the intro starts out great but abut 2 5 minutes after you have finished making your character the bombs have dropped and you are thrust in to the wasteland with little connection to your character or their family i really struggled to care about any of the characters because of this then after 20 minutes you are given power armor a mini gun and your first settlement to build recieving power freaking armor this early on just baffles me you all remember how hard we worked how long we waited to be able to wear that awesome armor in fallout 3 well not here it s yours for free no perks needed no patience required the settlement building is awful because it is just forced on you here you go this is your home base now build build build and be happy about it the ui for the building is horrible aswell i have only just gotten used to it after 15 hours also when do we get to make our own settlement completely customised with new people joining y know the biggest new feature or is it just customising existing areas for no obvious reason seriously why do they need food and water i have not recieved a single bonus from them existing if they weren t there i could still just use the workbench and that anyway so what is the point of settlers even being there i am still adjusting to the sudden disappearance of skillpoints and the newly adopted perk only system i guess it s cool that lockpicking is now just decided by what rank you have in the lock picking perk rather than actually spending skill points it might just be me or maybe because i am deliberately avoiding the main story line which may ease you in to things but i am finding the game to be quite hard nearly every enemy has a skull over their head and can kill me in about 10 shots with automatic weapons thats bad i am playing on normal difficulty there is no karma or reputation system where did it go i know they didn t make new vegas but after the massive rep and faction system in that i thought it would go forwards not backwards how can i roleplay if my actions aren t having an impact on peoples opinion of me why in the world is mass effects dialogue system here yes sarcastic comedic comments can be funny and are for the most part well written but come on i feel like i am just being funneled in to the inevitable yes sir i will do this task sir response in previous fallouts you can pretty much tell everyone to get f d and kill them all especially with the console commands lol finally ending on a high the game runs perfectly don t listen to all these nay sayers i have it cranked to ultra and am getting silky smooth 60 fps aside from when there are explosions going on or highly detailed interiors even then it sits at 45 50 and i have a gtx 980 16 gb ram and an i 5 4690 k 4 ghz tl drpros graphics are awesome don t listen to everyone game runs perfectly either i am very lucky or people need to double check the specs and their drivers character creation a voice acting a world is maybe smaller but filled with things to do and battles to be fought gunplay is 3000x better than in previous fallouts cons armor crafting is a tad underwhelming as you can t actually create yourself some armor from scratch or at least i can t being level 20 which you would assume you could do by now also why no actually being able to edit and change the appearance of your actual clothes i mean come on it s 2015 now stupid mass effect dialogue system no real freedom in conversations just funny rude nice and questions about the mission that s it the intro was crap honestly what was that we finally get to see the world before the war for all of thirty seconds how am i supposed to care about my family if i have known them for literally 5 minutes no karma system what so ever am i good or evil really disappointing as i now feel my actions don t have much of an effect on the world settlement building is god awful ui is bad your forced in to it and don t really get anything from it after i built them houses water food and beds i don t even get caps for rent sigh you get power armor way to quickly instead of feeling almighty and god like it s just another piece of loot thrown at your feet as soon as you leave not sure but i have now twice gone to an area i had already been to only to find all the enemies had respawned and not only that but in the exact same places with the exact same numbers as if i had never been there before special system because you can just pile points in to all of your special stats everyone will just end up having 10 everything which is quite disappointing update after playing a lot further in to the game and only having about 2 legitimate quest chains to follow that arent just repeated go here kill this get reward add infinity i can definitley say the map and by extension world is tiny and is filled with little more than so far mindless boring fetch quests area clearing and scavenger hunts i only have 2 main quests and 2 miscellanious quests that are investigate x the rest is boredom personified that con list is nearly double the size of the pro list and yet it is still a great game maybe get it on sale p update 2 scrap what i said above you just have to look harder and you will find plenty of things to do
