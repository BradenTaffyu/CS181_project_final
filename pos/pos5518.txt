2015 early access review looking for a roguelike that doubles as a vocabulary builder enjoyed sproggiwood s charm yet yearned for a little more freedom want to sacrifice some baboon carcasses to an orb wrough from chromium plated ancient technology to attain a mighty weapon if any of this appeals to you caves of qud may be for you in you can explore a mostly randomly generated world interacting with it s denizens grapple with the faction system wreaking havok on you and innocent npcs working as intended if not fix incoming follow the main storyline as it currently leads you to the two most challenging dungeons available you can craft explore find treasure trade harvest butcher and destroy characters come from a wide selection of either mutated humans with differing powers and abilities or the mostly intact human tribes scattered around the land there are three main hubs for selling and questing randomized traveling merchants and at least three hidden traders if you can find them in short stay out of the deathlands and don t be too surprised when your tongue rots out have fun
