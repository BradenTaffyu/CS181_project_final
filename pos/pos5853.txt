2020 early access review in early access is the game good yes are there flaws yes i played very little of the other m b games i did enjoy warband and did two different runs then got distracted by other games so i m not a hardcore m b fan just an average gamer this game does a lot of things right which can be found in other reviews i m just going to leave my suggestions here for the future of the game i don t really know what they are already planning so it could be on the way already 1 add a follow function on the campaign map there are quests to guard caravans the two times i have attempted this quest the caravan will get attacked out of no where no bandits on the map it just happens right after they exit the town it is instant since you re not part of the caravan you have to manually click and follow this caravan which means some of them will die on top of that having the bandits just appear kind of sucks it wouldn t be as bad if you saw them coming 2 add a way to craft clothes and shields i like the smithy and it is good money making it would be cool to do more 3 add a way to buy land and hire farmers miners fishermen etc i don t play the game for the raiding i play it as a neutral and eventually join a group that is what i like doing i think being able to buy land and get people to work the lands would help with the neutral bit 4 add more political conversation options with lords all the conversations i have with lords are either for a quest or nothing maybe i am missing something but there is really nothing yet oh and play a game it would be cool to keep doing quests for a town and become the leader that way or talk to lords and actually make allegiances before joining their forces 5 allow more men to raid a bandit camp i could just be really stupid and missing something but even with an army of 40 men it randomly gives me about 10 guys to go with after the first one you fight during the tutorial there is really no reason to ever do more some camps have way more then 10 people i dont understand why we can t raid with all our men i would understand if you couldnt bring calvary men with you but with an army of all land walkers there shouldn t be an issue 6 dispatch companions to look for someone it would be cool if your companion who has a decent scout level could be dispatched to find someone you are looking for this would not only help with the main quest it would help when trying to hunt someone down 7 personally i think calvary should just have their own category and not be an upgrade horsemen archers for example i don t really know how to describe it but when i upgraded my archers to horseback it was more of a negative then a pro it seems a bit buggy still or maybe just because they switched to horseback that their aim is worse but i noticed my archer strat took a small hit when i upgraded a good portion of them i move my shield infantry to the slope of a hill and put archers on top then calvary to the far left or right once the enemy gets close to my infantry i have the calvary charge archers raining down still once one gets close to my infantry then i have them charge as well works against most enemy forces and helped me win an early 23 vs 34 fight 8 more of a bug but in some tournaments there is a 2v2v2v2 i have had it happen about twice out of 8 tournaments with 2v2v2v2 what happens is one of the 2 s spawns in your team and as a played when you load in they are behind you the fight starts instantly and you get hit from behind one easy fix may be just add a second start button when you load into a tournament before action starts so you can atleast respond otherwise just fixing the spawns would also solve it 9 become a bandit i m not a raider normally i like to do gimicky runs with one main run when i play games like this i think a gimick that would be fun is being a bandit starting up your own bandit camp if it is a thing i haven t noticed it 10 hire people to accompany you i have been given mercs by lords to trade to other lords which btw is a great way for ez money if you have the right social skills i have yet to see a way to hire people to join you i think it would also be cool if there were pros and cons to how you barter and who you barter with each merc leader has their own traits one might be more honorable of a leader then others so his men are less likely to steal your stuff but he is more expensive then you may have a cheaper merc leader and he doesnt hold his men to the same standards and his mens might take a fur here and there also add a barter mechanic where you may overpay any merc leader to ensure nothing goes missing which is optional to any leader you also may not be 100 sure which one is more honorable by just cause their gear and units would also affect as well as how in demand they are like other pricing in the game
