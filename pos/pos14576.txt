2022 the game will make you lose track of time it will slowly trap you into just one more turn the amount of little battles and wars constructions and border expansions that you have going on will keep you playing the game you can t just leave your military units in production you ll forget why you got them in the first place so you keep going until they ve finished their job you can t just leave a wonder half constructed someone might beat you to it so you keep going until you get a beautiful cutscene of it being completed overall a very enjoyable game
