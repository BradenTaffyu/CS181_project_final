2023 vr sucks but the physics and force feedback is pretty incredible the casual lobbies are kind of hit or miss depending on the time that you hop in but when they work out they are incredible i would love to see more optimizations so i can run vr on my rtx 3080 intel 10700kf 32 gb of ddr4 and reverb g2 but with crew chief and the dynamic radar it s my favorite way to race online
