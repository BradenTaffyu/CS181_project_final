2016 at first this game looks boring i mean truck simulator really but from the first tutorial job the majesty and depth of the game begins to sink in the intricacies of traffic laws random speed traps along the highways getting fined for not using your headlights and much more even more just hitting the open roads is an experience to be had as you watch the countryside glide by at terrific speeds in your all too finicky multi ton truck coming form euro truck simulator 2 which is a masterpiece in itself i was afraid that this game would just be a carbon copy of that one transplanted in america although many interface pieces look similar to the other the depth of this game strikes me despite the compressed map size despite being a company out of europe they have completely nailed the feeling of small town and large city usa alike just the feeling of driving through some municipality and seeing the small diners and trinket shops gives it a feeling of authenticity not to mention the feeling of driving across the vegas strip or the golden gate bridge is an amazing experience in itself although there are no real npcs to interact with and no real way to leave your truck i believe it keeps the player more focused on the main act the open road and that i believe is enough even after building your empire with garages trucks and drivers across the two currently included states just taking a job and hitting the highway with the included internet radio streams such as smooth jazz or flower power radio and driving through a relaxing and sometimes hilarious experience makes this game a gem worth purchasing for those not ready to pull the trigger on the full game i recommend the free demo this includes the entire state of california and if and when you decide to purchase the full product all your progress transfers over although it may seem like a hefty price just for two states the depth is much worth the cost and you are buying into expanding the game further the developers have a free arizona update in the works and wish to push to the east coast eventually 9 5 10update please stop leaving hateful spam comments on this review they are not helpful to anyone
