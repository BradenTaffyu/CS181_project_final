2023 it really is one of the best roguelike metroidvania games i ve ever played the excellent musical score amazingly responsive controls huge variety of weapons challenging bosses the developers have really just put everything together in an amazingly tight package props on the longevity of support too the game came out 2018 and there s a new free content patch that just entered beta testing this week dead cells has over 100 weapons each fitting into at least one of the following categories brutality tactics survival brutality weapons tend to be fast but hit for smaller amounts swords and daggers mostly tactics are almost all ranged weapons bows crossbows and whips mostly while survival weapons are almost all hard hitting very slow weapons mauls hammers etc many weapons fall under two categories for instance most crossbows are both tactics and survival so that you can wield multiple weapons using a single upgrade path you ve also got two slots for skills which follow the same rules as weapons but can be anything from traps buffs magic attacks or pets pets are handy because with the exception of the owl you can just summon them at the start of a level and let them do their thing most of the other skills are more powerful but require you to actually remember to use them when they re available to get the most utility out of them which can be a problem in the hectic frenzy of combat that is dead cells everything in dead cells from the music to the timed doors at the end of levels pushes you to be a whirlwind of destruction endlessly running forward to kill everything before you it s actually not a horrible strategy if you can accomplish it without getting hit dead cell s major claim to fame is it s extended game specifically its system of boss cells acting as a new game system each time you win the game under an increased number of cells you unlock a new boss cell these increase the difficulty of the game mostly by introducing harder enemies and reducing and or removing the healing stations between levels however they also increase the number of scrolls available which can drastically increase the damage of your weapons as well as unlock how many cells can be spent on the forge which can increase the potency of weapons that you find on a run it s pretty much the perfect game for when you just want to go balls to the wall killing some dudes for half an hour expect most runs to end in failure but those runs that do not are some of the most amazing adrenaline highs you ll ever experience
