2020 really addictive was watching an unrelated documentary on the black death got into the mood for something medieval so dragged this game out of my library of unplayed steam sale shame because it had the best reviews those reviews are fully earned and the very first time i tried m b w i left it running all day as i worked and did other stuff because it s that good so upfront yes it s dated the graphics are old and clunky but at times you can still admire some really beautiful sunsets over the battlefield horizon the ui is likewise imho old school and clunky but usable the upshot is that it ll run on a potato so no pressure for a bleeding edge rig to play a great game how i wound up describing m b w to a friend was this is like a roleplaying strategy game for people who dislike regular strategy games you may or may not agree with that summary but at its core this game is essentially about your character going from unknown poor adventurer attracting a few merry men and hunting bandits to becoming a conqueror of lands building alliances with powerful lords and jostling for your rank on the hierarchy generating enough wealth to afford armies and land holdings and maybe just maybe eventually becoming the ruler of all you ve got a whole lot going on with this game and i hope you enjoy reading immersive narrative because this game has got that in spades there s a mixture of real time combat you can set to first person or third person view an interactive overland map and instanced city areas you ll also get the chance to retain levelable and equippable companions with their own distinct personalities to build for specialty roles in your army i should note here that this game chose to present gender inequity in gameplay rather than make it egalitarian for today s modern players females get different starting choices which affects stats some of the lords make dismissive quips and they can have a harder time being granted fiefdoms on the flip side they can marry easier apparently have not tried yet and steam offers more achievements for female playthroughs diplomacy with various factions and a small level of economics are also part of the game and you ll spend time figuring out how to pay for all the followers wages and food along with your own armoring needs you can buy tradesmen shops in the cities to help pad your coffers or play merchant yourself by figuring out where and what to buy low and sell high raiding your enemies can also get you some wealth as can quests so for usd 4 99 on sale you get a whole lot of stellar gaming that ll keep you busy for a while
