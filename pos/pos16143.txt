2015 early access review although the title itself may make it seem it ll probably be one of those unfunny games like goat simulator this game is pretty fun when i picked up this game i honestly thought the community would be a dread and that i wouldn t be able to play a serious game without people flicking everywhere however i have met some great people on this game and so far there s been very limited annoyance workshop support is what really makes this game stand out in my opinion without it it d may still be a good game but the workshop allows many other games to be played whether that is card games or board games there is an endless stream of games to play created by users so you re not restricted to a few games that are preset you can pretty much find any classic board game or card game on there and if it s not on there well you should make it before anyone else takes that idea or wait for a smarter and more productive person to do that for you however the game itself doesn t have a lot of players and it can be sometimes tricky to get in a public game i only see about 5 or 6 public servers out of the 100s of servers there are which is slightly disappointing but that is not really the games fault but this can be sometimes frustrating as you are only forced to select a few games and not all of them you will like so you would have to host a server and wait for a long amount of time to see of anyone wants to play go fish with you which surprisingly most people don t go fish more like go yourself also this game cannot really be played by yourself bit of a no brainer but it s true if you didn t know that you can t play chess by yourself i m pretty concerned onto how you have the intelligence or attention span to read this i don t even see why to put in a singleplayer option sometimes it s really boring and nearly impossible to play by yourself the whole point of single player is to play by yourself how in god s name can i play checkers by myself the only game i ve seem to found to play myself is solitaire however i won t lie that the single player feature is useful but very limited to being useful apart from the custom content creator if you have friends at your house you can whip out the single player but it may be sort of awkward as you would need to constantly switch places to move the piece on the computer i ve never tried it but what s the whole point of playing monopoly on the computer solo with my friend next to me when i can just get the game out in real life if you do not have a certain game though then this can be pretty useful in some cases but only with board games however i do like to play online with friends and sometimes strangers it s a shame that not more of my friends have this game as it s spectacular fun and i especially like this game i guess for my interest in board games and card games there s a few glitches in it and it can be annoying at times but i would say get this game if you re interested in board games card games etc if not then this game may not be for you but there are plenty of games on the workshop
