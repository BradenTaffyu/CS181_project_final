2017 if you are a newcomer to the civilization series and you see the majority of these reviews you would probably think civ vi is not a good game in all reality the game is very fun well made pretty and better than the majority of games in it s genre the real problem comes in living up to the civilization name specifically because civ v is one of the greatest video games in history and civ v is also on sale for like 5 dollars all the time the majority of complaints when civ vi came out have been solved we have mods now the ai is smarter than it once was and less needlessly hostile and most glitches have been ironed out i think the art direction is perfectly fine and i think it s just a vocal minority that isn t okay with the new style the new district system city state envoy system and seperate civic and tech trees make every game of civ vi more different than a game of civ v after putting hundreds of hours into both games i can say for certain that i have a more varied experience every time i play civ vi but that still doesn t change the fact that something feels missing compared to civ v the lack of world congress may be it but i think a large factor is that it simply isn t a cornerstone of the steam community yet and thus can t be enjoyed with as many friends as people do when they play civilization v online
