2017 early access review my most resent set up of rim world was my best and my worst i started out great got electricity i had plenty of food i had two cash crops corn that became simple meals and herbal meds that i was selling to the traders even got up to 7 people everything was going great till one day it was like every other day just a normal day i just got through the hard summer and now in the fall with no heat injuries which was a first everything was looking up then a raid came i have already been through a bunch so i knew the drill i had sandbags already lined up in a defensive positon i posted up all my people all in the right spots they all had great weapons for that point in the game snipers and lmg what made this raid different was something i did not see till it was too late i normally check the enemy s weapons to know what i a dealing with but i missed one enemy and guess what that mother f ker had frag gerandes we starting firing i got two of the three down i had this in the bag till that threw that grenade and killed two of my colonist it was now a bad day one was a best friend and a fianc the other was a best friend to the whole group i was also upset i lost a great builder that day and a great craft s man i had to re group the rest of the team to prepare for the big mood drops i had to hold them together after the hard winter and three colonists going bezerk the winter was finally over we hit the spring with the colonist were almost done with their mood drops i was getting happy that we made it through with no more people dying plus we even had a new couple get married but what i learn is that rim world is not for happy endings the first heat wave was setting in the problem is that this one was the worst i had two coolers for the colonists but it was not enough they were going down with heat strokes i was getting worried but i kept my drive i quickly threw in that new cooler but it was not fast enough with only one to two more days left on that mood drop the heat wave took out 3 of my last 5 my last two were pushing but then the worst came one of my last two ran out to mine something she went down i made my last guy go save her i was lucky too he knew some medical skill i thought i could first save my doc then the rest but then that red flashy box drops down mad f king amianl i was like ruuunnnnnn but that animal caught up to him it bit him and he went down all my colonist was unable to walk i watched in shock for 10secs before i turned off my computer i was hurt that my best colony ended up with the worst ending the moral of the story is to f king check every enemy because those freaking frag grenades are no joke
