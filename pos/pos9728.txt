2022 years ago i dismissed this game as a casualized dwarf fortress clone i toyed with it but never got deeply involved recently i saw df was coming to steam about a week from df s release i decided to get myself in the mood for df by giving rimworld a genuine chance i found myself enjoying it a lot more than i expected then a week or two prior to me writing this df actually released leaving aside for a moment that df s new ui is less polished than rw s and that s not minor in a colony management sim the interface is most of the game playing df again gave me an appreciation of a concept i had not fully grasped while it is undeniably true that df is more complex than rw just because something is complex doesn t mean it s more interesting i always balked at the fact that you have only a tiny handful of pawns in rw but what i didn t realize is that when you have dozens of dwarves their complexity becomes white noise in any game like this the more colonists you have the harder it is to make meaningful decisions about them as individuals i dropped df almost immediately and continued playing rw i recognize that df essentially birthed the genre of colony management sims and for that i will always be grateful but i think i ll be sticking with rw for the foreseeable future i haven t even gotten into the dlcs yet
