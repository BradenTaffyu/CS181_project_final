2021 dude where are the mods the sim racing community didn t take it very well when assetto corsa competizione came out in early access back in 2018 unlike the spiritual predecessor assetto corsa there was no mod support and the game would rock the unreal engine instead of kunos simulazioni s proprietary engine that used to power assetto corsa and netkar pro and it wouldn t be a jack of all trades either blancpain gt3 content only which meant that the car and track list would be limited to the ones that are used in real life from a brand that consolidated itself thanks to being the people s favorite moddable platform one could say it was a bold move would it still be able to stay relevant and stand out from the competitors that also offered gt3 content one of the advantages of narrowing down the content variety is that it allows for extra care and attention to detail which kunos took full advantage of every one of the 32 gt3 cars handle differently with realistic performance figures taken directly from the manufacturers along with unique engine sounds that make real life sound dull in comparison by far the best sound effects out there making the competition sound like bumper cars the modeling is also impeccable both internally and externally with fantastic texturing that looks just like the real thing when they meant an authentic gt3 simulation they weren t kidding but we all know that a racing simulator isn t just made of cars tracks are important too kunos knows that very well and doesn t disappoint each one of the 11 base game tracks is masterfully replicated through laser scanning which means they are just like the real thing in every sense of the word every bump crack elevation change weathering and so on is carried over to the simulator so that both cars and surfaces can offer unparalleled accuracy the other 8 dlc tracks are equally as good as far as game modes are concerned acc delivers the usual stuff career mode multiplayer hot lap practice and free race unfortunately it doesn t sport a full fledged career mode like the f1 franchise for example but it s good enough from humble beginnings to the top of the category with an excruciatingly slow introduction in monza which takes away from the experience a little bit but doesn t fully compromise it if you want to buy it just for the career mode don t with that being said the single player races within and outside the career mode are very engaging thanks to a very good ai that can either be very fast or very forgiving depending on difficulty you can customize the length 10 20 30 minutes and so on weather time of day grid size mandatory or optional pit stops qualifying length or just disable it altogether just like most modern sims would races are very engaging and the rating system is a stimulus to keep you going oh yes the rating system it goes up if you race cleanly goes down if you crash into other drivers it might be strange at first but it certainly helps to transform you into a clean racer making you drive like the gentleman driver the sport expects you to the multiplayer mode is decent thanks to the rating system there are official races where you get competition points for winning that improve your driver rating and non official where only the safety rating gets deducted or increased and the track and car control related ratings server owners can set a minimum amount of safety rating points so that people with low sa can t join and ruin the race by crashing into everyone making it so most races are trouble free this doesn t mean that incidents don t happen they are just less encouraged because the perpetrators get punished as far as additional content goes there s a dlc that brings the international gt series and 4 new tracks another one with gt4 cars 11 of them and a british gt dlc that replicates the 2019 bgt season as accurately as it can be along with three new tracks for their respective price tags one could say it s a whole lotta bang for the buck transforming a very complete gt experience into an even more refined product assetto corsa competizione like fine wine got better over time from a troubled early access start with people questioning its physics and lack of content to hands down one of the most complete and authentic simulators on the market
