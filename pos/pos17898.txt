2023 the game is continually being updated and adjusted the graphics are very good but still a few bugs to work out such as destroyed tanks flipping around up in the sky some of the new features in coh3 are really great such as tank riding the tech trees troops firing from flat rooftops and also the fact that you don t need to keep pioneer units or engineer units at you base to build new buildings that is one of the best features the single player tactical pause is also a great addition especially for newer players coh 1 was the standard in my opinion and they took some of the best elements from that game and carried them over into coh 3 coh 3 is the best of the series in my opinion and they are still making improvements it will be well polished when they are complete
