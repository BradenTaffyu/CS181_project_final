2020 fantastic game don t let the cute graphics fool you this game is very deep and complex start off building toilets setting up farms and bedrooms keeping that oxygen flowing before you know it you re building heat exchangers to cool down your freshly refined petroleum harnessing volcanoes for geothermal power exploring space with several different types of rocket very grounded in real physics within the restrictions of the game if you don t already have a familiarity with concepts like specific heat capacity and state changes then prepare to learn i ve played for over 500 hours and yet still keep learning new ways to build things new concepts and surprising effects all whilst hoping my colony doesn t collapse in on itself highly recommended for sandbox and simulation game players imagine a hybrid of rimworld and factorio
