2023 early access review graphics you forget what reality is beautiful good decent bad don t look too long at it ms dosthe game s graphics are inherently bad due to the resolution and my distaste for isometric view but the artstyle used really makes up for it gameplay very good good it s just gameplay mehh watch paint dry instead just don tthis game is not just a game it s a zombie survival simulation many systems to do many things cars farms health and many other things await you audio eargasm very good good not too bad bad i m now deafthe sound design is pretty good not next level or anything but the music oh my god beautiful soundtrack audience kids teens adults grandmathis game is on the darker side especially if you actually listen to the lore there s customizable gore levels but the violence mainly remains the same pc requirements check if you can run paint potato decent fast rich boi ask nasa if they have a spare computerthis game doesn t require anything beefy due to the low res graphics massive amounts of zombies may cause issues i ve yet to have problems difficulty just press w easy easy to learn hard to master significant brain usage difficult dark soulsthe difficulty is customizable so you can play how you want too easy increase population or decrease loot too hard decrease zombie senses or your exhaustion rate i personally run a low population urban based with the walking dead type zombies i m also bad so grind nothing to grind only if u care about leaderboards ranks isn t necessary to progress average grind level too much grind you ll need a second life for grindingyou can alter loot levels but the default level has a decent amount of grind for supplies guns etc story no story some lore average good lovely it ll replace your lifethe lore is kinda hidden in the game but if you pay attention it s definitely there game time long enough for a cup of coffee short average long to infinity and beyondthis solely depends on difficulty skill level price it s free worth the price if it s on sale if u have some spare money left not recommended you could also just burn your moneymy philosophy is 1 dollar for every hour i spend playing this game will definitely win bugs never heard of minor bugs can get annoying ark survival evolved the game itself is a big terrarium for bugsthere s the occasional hiccup but it s rare 10 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10amazing game love the customization for difficulty and the ability to change the rules of the world good work devs
