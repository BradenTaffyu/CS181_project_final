2020 early access review the most in depth and realistic zombie game that i have played and a very good survival game in itself definitely an exciting and unique experience every time until your inevitable death don t play if you get upset after losing a character with 40 hours and a lot of projects done when your character dies they gone that s it game over you will restart a lot then you will learn the basics and play the same character for months in game only to get bitten by a zed outside your car as you are just trying to lure them farther from your safehouse hypothetically you learn more every time you play and get better every time you play 10 10 will waste too much time on a character that dissipates into the void again
