2018 after 9 hours in this ea sim already i feel like i can make an assessment of this title as someone who bought ac in ea buying this was no problem for me kunos delivered with ac so i have complete faith and trust in them to do it again the first ea release contains just one car lambo hurracan gt3 and one track the wonderfulnurburgring gp gt circuit it looks wonderful and sounds amazing i have a fairly beefy system and it runs well in daylight dropping to between 40 and 60fps atnight in the rain at 1080p replays also drop down to this lower frame rate this is with all the graphics on epic with the exception of mirrors high and motion blur off the car drives wonderfully well and the force feedback on my thrustmaster t300rs seems to be very good other players are having some problems dialling it in but it seems fine to me there are only a few limited things to do in the release which is to be expected a road map was clearly laid out for anyone taking time to look so people moaning about a lack of content only have themselves to blame back to the content you can practice hotlap hotstint and race against ai you can set the time which you can speed up and the weather the weather can not be set to dynamic yet that s coming in a future update all these modes are fun and are surprisingly addictive there s a box up in the right corner of the screen that gives feedback on your driving performance and helps you to improve all in all i m blown away by how good this first ea is albeit with limited content the content is top quality though and this sim is just so addictive roll on next month when we get misano and the bentley continental 8 5 10update 25th july 2020 kunos have recently released the gt4 pack for this game and it s simply awesome the game is getting updates and bug fixes and is being shown a lot of love by the devs it just keeps going from strength to strength 9 10
