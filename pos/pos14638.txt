2016 at first i was very skeptical of the graphics everything looked very cartoonish once i started playing however i immediately fell in love the graphics actually make the game very playable by not taking too much processing power sometimes 5 and even beyond earth became too frustrating to play those larger games with more computer human players the civ team was very smart in not putting too much effort into the graphics by making sure this is playable on most hardware even making it simple enough to easily put it on a mobile platform as for game mechanics this version introduces a lot and re introduces what we love about previous versions new to the franchise they brought districts to the map limited actions for builders policy card decks envoys super enhanced diplomacy and culture researching then they made sure to include features that i love about previous versions like religion choosing government rebels trade and natural wonders this makes the base game already feel really complete it s hard to imagine what they might include in the expansions other than new civs and maps or maybe i m just blindsighted at how awesome the game already is for long time civilization players this is the game we ve always wanted
