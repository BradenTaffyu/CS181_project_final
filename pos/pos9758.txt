2021 yeah okay this reluctant reviewer will pen one for this incredible masterpiece quality work of art first of all if you re waiting for a sale don t it never goes on sale i ve seen it on sale once at the time of this reviewing for 10 so don t shop around and it s worth giving the developer your money i even bought the dlc when i had heard many of the dlc features were either better done in mods or not really that great of an addition to support the developer because this was my favourite game for a long time secondly do you remember firefly that old sci fi space western with only one season nathan filion and the hot wife from deadpool that s what this game is very loosely based on you crash land on a planet which you get to choose where on the planet to crash lmao great realism and your handful of starting colonists start building a base or they starve to death or get murdered you don t have to be good at this game and you basically explore your own long term interests this is a sandbox game that isn t boring you know how in some games like factorio you have to set your own goals well that s not explicitly required for this game you can just react to things that happen to you random events both good bad and neutral will happen on a semi predetermined basis based on the storyteller you ve chosen which you can change at any time in the pause menu you can choose between the one that escalates difficulty based on how complex wealthy your base is if you want the random events to be scaled off how well you re doing the one that gives you a lot of time between events if you want a really chill experience where you can just farm and build and craft things and tame animals and become a business enterprise and the one who is completely random and will just throw chaos at you at every opportunity further divided these storytellers can be set to various difficulty levels so you can have the chill storyteller on hardest difficulty and each random event will potentially obliterate your base but there ll be plenty of time between them or you could set random storyteller on easiest difficulty and have really weird things happen to you over and over again without really challenging your defences now what i mean by random events is like really quite complex and varied manhunting packs of animals from labradors to goats to megasloths to elephants to rhinos raids from other towns and villages and tribes and pirates who live elsewhere on the planet trading caravans who hang around and try to trade with you so you can sell you accumulated or buy the they brought to sell you even groups of tamed animals that just show up and want to join your colony because they re lonely or whatever oh yeah remember mimics those chests in rpg games that aren t chests they re actually monsters waiting for you to come close and get mauled human and animal versions of those occasionally show up and join too have fun with those now one thing a lot of people are always surprised about this game is just how deep these interactions and random events can be like you get spoiled for complexity in this game this game made me realize how shallow and repetitive so many other games are they promise immersion and replay value and such but it s just the same gameplay experience slightly harder even dark souls like if you only play with a sword and shield over and over it gets boring fast but if you play with a halberd or punching gloves you can have more replay value because you re playing under constraints or trying to play the game differently rimworld is the same with this but it s way more than just oh i ll play it this different way you can straight up decide how you want your base to be you want to be an organ harvesting nightmare compound that skins captured enemy prisoners and unlucky crashlanded humans harvests their hearts and lungs and brains and tans their skin into leather makes them into hats and jackets and sells them to passing orbital trade ships you can do it you want to be a zoo where you have dozens of different animals all living in harmony with humans and everyone s vegan and nobody eats meat you can do it you want to have a chill bachelor pad where your colonists hang around with tamed foxes smoking weed and doing cocaine and watching megascreen television and playing poker until the enemy comes knocking and then they ride their majestic rhinoceros into battle with miniguns obliterating anyone stupid enough to try and take your go for it this is all just in the base game except riding animals i think and now let s address the modding situation this is quite possibly the best modded game i have ever played in my life i don t think i d ever be able to go back to the base game simply because the mods just add so much variety you can get the aforementioned riding animals mod animal armour mod alpha animals mod which adds hundreds of new kinds of animals into the game dozens of different military equipment mods giving you incredible new amounts of guns armour support equipment fashion mods that give you a bunch of different clothes your colonists can make carpet mods allowing you to turn any kind of textile cloth mushroom fibre animal wool animal skin into carpet and wallpaper so in that organ harvesting colony i mentioned before you can have carpet and wallpaper made from human skin find that in another game there s a lot of different mining and factory and medical mods too giving you access to oil processing so you can drill for oil then refine it into plastic and other materials to use as construction materials or fuel medical wise you can have genetic engineering mods prosthetic bionic mods so if anyone suffers a permanent injury yeah colonists can get eyes shot out and limbs torn off in the base game you can grow a natural replacement to give to them or just embrace your futuristic destiny and craft a bunch of advanced bionic prosthetics that allow your colonists to become cyborgs some colonists hate this because they re body purists who want natural bodies but other colonists love this deal and can t wait to get their advanced bionic limbs you can also make bionics and prosthetics for animals your favourite tamed timber wolf got his spine shot out and now he s quadriplegic just make him a bionic spine hell give him some bionic eyes and bionic jaw while you re at it now when he attacks enemies as you can train him to do he can devastate them way better tamed timber wolf cyborgs that you can use to defend your futuristic weed farm just buy the game already why are you still reading this trust me when i say this is one of the best games of all time and i utterly pray that other developers and game makers would take some pointers from how this game is made and incorporate some of the foundational gameplay principles into their own ethos tl dr buy the best colony simulation game ever made
