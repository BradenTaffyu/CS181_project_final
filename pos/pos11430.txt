2015 early access review survival isn t about immense power gluttony or the ability to safely forage farm or store an infinite amount of food in your home survival is about a constant struggle to stay alive in a dangerous and uncertain environment where the odds are most certainly stacked against you and it is this essence which 7 days to die captures adequately and beautifully in the beginning but which eventually diminishes and peters out due to the game s lack of late game content starting out in 7 days to die is hard very hard the game is similar to minecraft it has no storyline or tutorial to guide you on what to do next instead you are simply thrown in the middle of the world in your underpants no tools only a can of chili a bottle of water a bandage and a torch to your name and tasked to survive juggling your character s various needs and managing your daylight time properly are both essential components of a viable survival strategy and it s what makes 7 days to die so compelling and stimulating to play because frankly speaking you never quite have enough at the start and depending on your luck that undesirable state may persist for a few more in game days the fun pimps have rightly in my opinion made some of tools that are important but not strictly necessary to survival in the beginning difficult to obtain and herein lies 7 days to die s biggest problem because so much of its appeal is derived from putting its players in the seat of a survivor who never quite has enough to eat drink and is constantly struggling to stay alive against the odds which the game stacks heavily against them from the getgo the lack of a forceful impetus to survive in the middle or later portion of a game as one s character gains in strength and survivability ultimately and ironically detracts from that appeal this weakness speaks more to 7 days to die s apparent lack of late game content than its heavy reliance on a relatively unsustainable premise such as survivability at the moment the game fully expects and encourages you to become stronger but imposes no additional challenges to test your new found strength zombies stay the same develop no new capabilities and although the game attempts to shake things up by throwing massive hordes of zombies at you every 7 in game days or so they are easily countered if you properly fortify your stronghold i fully expect and have faith that the fun pimps will properly flesh out 7 days to die s content at the moment 7 days to die is still capable of offering its players many hours of deep and complex gameplay i have only spent 50 hours playing it so far and i believe i will continue to spend more time exploring surviving and building in in 7 days to die as an early access game 7 days to die is definitely worth your money
