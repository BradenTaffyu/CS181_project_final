2016 though this games launch was absoulutely attrocious the emperor edition fixes the majority of the problems though many problems are still prevalent which of course can be fixed with a few good mods i have put in a good 200 hours into this game and i greatly reccomend this product pro s runs like a dream looks beautiful multiplayer battles are extremely intense great modding community great setting nothing feels as good as sacking rome campaign is one of the best a proper working auto resolve button con s unit rosters are a bit lacking mods fix this the campaigns mid to late game becomes way too easy town battles auto resolving fixes this generals die like flies 4 turns per year mod fixes this dlc market is attrocious you have to pay for blood gore
