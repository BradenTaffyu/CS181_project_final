2017 i don t know where to start or what to say that hasn t already been said this game is pretty much a choose your own adventure book turned into a game you can kill pretty much anyone you can act however you want towards people you can side with any faction do all the side quests before you do the main quests or travel wherever right off the bat you pretty much have the ultimate choice to do whatever you want in this game and still to this day a lot of games can t replicate this for some reason to top that off you ve got a well written cast of characters many celebrity actors are in this game ron perlman matthew perry etc the story is also great compared to fallout 3 or 4 where your backstory is written out for you you start off as a courier and that is it it s a clean slate story you get to write out yourself i don t want to spoil anything but the rest of the story is great you re gonna have to trust me on that the game is a true blue rpg there are many dialogue options which let you decide how you want to act towards people the choices you make will affect the way people interact with you you can be smug be nice be rude etc there are a lot of skills to learn that will help you out through the game overall an amazing improvement over fallout 3 and sadly was the start of a decline in the fallout series with 4 new vegas itself is amazing and i feel like it s the true fallout 3 we should ve got 9 10 extremely strong fallout title i d even say it s debateable on whether or not it s better than fallout 1 or 2 i d give it a 10 but it was a fairly rushed game due to the extremely short deadline to get it out is it noticeable honestly not really but the world probably could have had more things to see luckily it s set in a desert so it doesn t seem noticeable without a doubt buy this over fallout 4 it s cheaper it s better i wouldn t even bother playing fallout 4 in your lifetime it s awful
