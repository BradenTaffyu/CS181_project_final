2022 this review will be more of an essay about how this game has helped me cope with a lot of things in life infj t is what defines me through and through anxiety induced insomnia not diagnosed i should add because i ve never been to therapy might just be synonymous with life for me at the depths or height of which i have even been up for days at end the longest duration of which was something around 75 hours hours days months all getting muddled up into a big splotch of nothingness this was the first of the souls games i ve played and i can in no way do justice to the help the game has given me by writing this review repetition pattern the more you play the game the more you get into the intricate patterns the game throws at you repetition and keeping a level mind is of utmost importance patience is key and this game exemplifies teaching that to the players a virtue that is as relevant in real life as it is in the game a quality that will never go out of fashion exploring the unknown the game or any game for that matter brings with it an element of anxiety in that you need to move about in an unknown area and interact with things and find out more about them in order to understand how they work and how you can use them to your advantage this game has helped me a lot in getting over the unsettling feeling of exploring the unknown again here as well the game excels in giving it s players a life long and potentially life changing lesson in staying calm the significance of a bonfire this might just be the most important part of this review for me being able to write this and express what i feel brings me a lot of joy the concept of which is immensely subjective and difficult to understand in the game a bonfire is a place where you can rest after all the exploring and fighting and you get healed and re filled this spoke to me the bonfires gave me the mental peace almost nothing else could the best sleep i have ever gotten was after resting at a bonfire after a 5 hour long fight and repeat session the bonfire is a light in the darkness it represents a tranquility that can be achieved just beyond what looks impossible to defeat it symbolizes hope it signifies the fact that no matter how big the obstacle you are facing is you innately have the necessary skills to overcome it and if not innately it will just be a matter of time for you to find a way of going around it if not over it as for the recommendation regarding the game yes yes and again yes
