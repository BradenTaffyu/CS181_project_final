2021 even though it was released in 2015 its still one of the best sandbox games i ve ever played it helps you understand how real spaceflight and orbital mechanics work the kerbals and their faces in the bottom right corner just add a lot of charme to the game it amazes me that the devs stil add new content to the game and fixing bugs due to simulating realistic orbital mechanics and physics its not the easiest game to get into the ingame tutorials are ok for the basics but not much more if you whant to purcase this game just prepare to watch a lot of youtube tutorials also due to the game being released in 2015 the graphics aren t comparable with modern games but the devs have worked on improving the surfaces of the planets all in all its still a very fun game to play with a lot of uniqueness i personaly would recomend purcasing the dlc s if you played a bit and enjoy the game you could also wait for the ksp 2 release presumably next year if graphics are that important to you
