2020 product received for free this is a great simulator game one of the best i ve played and if you have a steering wheel full setup it s even better runs smoothly and looks decent some routes are a little strange though and some roads are incorrect in terms of what kinds of roads they are where they go after getting some dlcsi get way more roads to travel on way more miles to travel small little recommendation though if you want to do long journey faster disable the speed limiter and set speed limits to car speed limits
