i really enjoyed this game as you can see i poured lots of hours into it the first 10 missions or so is easy but after that you will have to learn about masteries and mastery sets for your characters to suit your playing style and to make the missions much more fun to complete it s not hard if you re willing to explore or just copy off someone else s from guides or discussions which there are plenty of good ones love the art in the cut scenes and story part of the game the frustrating part is waiting for the enemies to complete their turn especially when there are lots of them in the mission as this is a turn based game however i learned later that you can speed it up which makes it not so bad so you can do that too from what i read on the discussions it seems the developer dandylion listens to their players and makes an effort to improve the game now and then that s awesome and i m looking forward to troubleshooter 2 when it comes out it was fun and challenging to complete every achievements
