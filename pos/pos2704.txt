2019 short version a more than worthy successor to divinity original sin if you played the first game and enjoyed it you ll love this one long version it improves on the first game in a number of areas but falls short of the original one regard for starters combat is more strategic due to the introduction of physical and magical armor due to the existence of these armor types statuses are no longer automatic like they were in the first game all statuses and thus spells are resisted by one of the two armor types thus in order to stick a status on an enemy you first need to strip the associated armor type away however once the armor is stripped off the status is 100 effective on a hit the whole thing lends to a much more cerebral tactical game play as the player tries to figure out the most effective way to strip armors go for the weak ones and apply statuses crowd control cc is a huge aspect of the combat the game also introduces the concept of origin characters these are characters you can play and or use as companions think of them like minsc and viconia from baldur s gate only you can actually choose one of them to be your main character they are fully voiced with rich background stories and a couple of them have some fairly epic quest lines the stories of all the origin characters are tied deeply to the overall narrative of the game the player is still free to make a generic custom adventurer but the game arguably provides a more interesting narrative with an origin character behind the wheel the story itself is probably a bit more cohesive than its predecessor the game is not quite as whimsical as its predecessor but it still doesn t take itself too seriously like pillars of eternity and there is quite a bit of levity throughout the game the voice acting is very well done too as far as other drastic changes go dos2 has largely removed the need for crafting armor and weapons all good weapons and armor are now either found by killing enemies acquired as quest rewards which is nicely done or bought from vendors crafting is still valuable in other areas however particularly with the power to create scrolls potions and runes speaking of runes they are a nice but not overpowered addition to the game certain pieces of equipment allow for the slotting of a rune which can add to damage resists or primary stats enclosing a rune in a frame can add some significant bonuses as well finally the game introduces the use of source spells which are typically very powerful spells that require the explicit use of source the characters in your party will learn to harness their source growing their source pool as they advance allowing them to cast more powerful versions of source spells as the game goes along replenishing source becomes an important part of the game so that the player and his her companions always have their most powerful skills and spells available where the game falls short a bit at least for me compared to its predecessor is in the area of epic encounters dos1 had some very memorable and epic encounters in it twins by fire joined braccus rex the final dragon etc dos2 lacks those sorts of encounters for the most part there are still one or two that are fairly epic but overall the variety of enemies and the epic big and wondrous creatures of the first game are very far and few between the player will find themselves attacking mostly humanoids or humanoid sized creatures for the duration of the game a few more epic boss encounters would have been welcome here but that s minor nitpick the game is wonderful challenging and fun
