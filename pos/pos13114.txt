2017 kerbal space program is basically science made fun it is a remarkably valid physics simulation while still remaining a very fun game albeit with an astronomically high learning curve it s tough as nails to learn and balance out probably learned more about physics while playing ksp than in actual physics classes during college absolutely fantastic indie title with immeasurable educational value and an awesome sandbox mode
