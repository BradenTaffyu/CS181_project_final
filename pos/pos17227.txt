2022 total war warhammer 2 is a beautiful culmination of many of the features styles and design choices that makes total war games so enjoyable it is probably one of the most accessible games in the entire iconic franchise and is certainly the most modern gameplaythe game is basically split into 2 core sections of gameplay the campaign map which functions much like a 4x strategy game and the battles which are rts combats arenas in which you fight for territory cities forts and more the overworld map is beautifully detailed and wonderfully immersive the battles contain gorgeously detailed models which you control in regiments squads or as single units battle maps themselves are also beautifully rendered combat can become chaotic messy and desperate quickly leading to some very intense moments if you are not adequately prepared lords and heroes can become extremely powerful on and off the battlefield wielding both immense physical prowess and sometimes the winds of magic magic as a system is incredibly powerful on the battlefield and can be your greatest asset in times of desperation there are many different factions to choose from and multiple subfactions per faction as well in most races even the subfactions have incredible variety between their playstyles which means the game is incredibly re playable storywhile the story is not exactly impressive from an originality standpoint it does drawn upon one of the longest running entertainment franchises in modern gaming media warhammer this fact alone allows the game to utilize the myriad of entertaining and engaging characters that already exist in the warhammer universe and the game s story is all the better for it factions have long histories of grudges conflict and alliances and much of that history spills over into the game creating a world that feels carefully crafted the characters all have over the top voice acting that fits perfectly into such a self serious setting and the pre rendered cutscenes vary from cheesy and funny to very grounded and immersive the story unfortunately falls down a bit in connecting with the actual gameplay as the only actual interaction you have with the story is a set of pre made missions the missions honestly feel completely optional and i frequently delay doing them until i ve already conquered a significant portion of the map overall i would say that the hilarious voice acting must do the heavy lifting to support both the story and themes of the setting whether you care about story in your strategy games determines whether this is an upside or downside for you audiofrom a technical standpoint the sounds of battle are incredible steel clashes with shield monsters roar and the units react with screams of terror and heroic battle cries to the carnage around them lowering your camera into the action and just listening to the din is one of the most immersive and cinematic parts of this game in my opinion however the music simply falls short of being excellent most tracks are completely forgettable and many of the iconic themes of total war games past ring stand out as being significantly better than what is on offer here the music is not grating or annoying it is simply fine technical performancethe game performs adequately on both the campaign map and battlefield and there are no obvious weak points or frame drops in normal gameplay the time between turns can drag out past a minute on late game saves but installing the game onto an ssd seems to mostly resolve the issue of long loading times i would highly recommend an ssd for this game the only time my ryzen 2700x gtx 1660 struggled to maintain 50 60fps was when i brought several armies that contained many models per unit into one battle overall i would treat the recommended specs as the minimum for this game and discard their minimum specs entirely dlcthis game treats dlc in a strange way if you want to play the mortal empires game mode which is essentially a large sand box in which to map paint with your empire you must purchase total war warhammer 1 this is the biggest caveat to this game that i can state in order to get the full experience warhammer 1 is basically required unfortunately the tomfoolery with dlc does not end there in order to experience blood effects in your total war game you must purchase the blood dlc pack this is a strange decision on the part of the publisher for sure past these two the dlc is basically a la carte if you see a faction that you would enjoy playing or want additional units for existing factions check out the dlc in short this isn t paradox dlc none of the paid packs lock you out of game changing updates to factions or battles if there s a fix or new system introduced with a dlc patch that part of the patch is usually free summarythis game is the pinnacle of modern total war if you want an engaging immersive rts and strategy experience look no further highly reccomended
