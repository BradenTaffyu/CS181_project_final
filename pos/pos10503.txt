2019 this game is ok it is fun you get a few free things early on which is nice you could pay much if desired so far i have not spent anything as i a very broke overall and must choose wisely what to spend real money on the game is fun but a not realistic at all or b not historical at all it is fun and the real world ships are in it but most thingsin the game are so abstracted that they are not historical or realistic for example a ship down to 10 health has full functionality anyway i usually fight bot battles with as many players on my side as join battles are 8 v 8 i am not very good at the game but sometimes i do well as of right now fun game i noticed many of my older reviews are dated and not as accurate as when i made them years ago ah well
