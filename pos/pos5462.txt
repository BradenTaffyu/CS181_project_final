2022 early access review this game is the best of a cross between videogames and books it has all the positives of both and non of its negatives imagine a book where everytime you open it up to start reading again you dont rly know what will be in it all you know is a vague idea or direction but you do know that whatever it is its definitly fun fun as in brutaly hard and very entertaining uunlike a book where if you are about in the middle of its pagecount you can not assume that you are in the middle of anything the next page could be your aprubt death the remaining pages are indeed empty you put the book away the story is over and you come back to it another time ready for a new expiriance but this game should have an additional requirment listed imagination much like a real book if you are unable to turn writen word into colorful pictures in your head it is propably not for you to get the fullest expiriance out of this masterpiece gem of a game avoid the wiki at all cost i can not stress this egnouth wiki n your basic attributes might be fine but its too easy to spoil yourself there if you encounter an enemy or situation that seems immune to you or impossible at all try a different approch qoc gives you all the tools and allowes you to discover for yourself unknow weapon in hands just try it following this approch the game feels vibrantly alive and the joy of exploring is irreplacable
