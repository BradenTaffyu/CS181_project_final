2016 as the slayer king my first battle was against some green skins that were in the lands around my home and mountain stronghold of karaz a karak victory came for me but at a hefty cost as i lost almost as many warriors as my enemy they retreated back to the shack made of rotten wood and rusted metal that they called a town while i stayed in my territory licking my wounds replenising my crippled army i reviewed the dwarvern emo diary aka the book of grudges to see what i could do to rally the hordes of crybaby dwarf citizens at my command i readied myself to take the orc settlement just a few more turns to gather my strength the next turn a goblin army from a neighbouring region charged at my army s flank ruining my plans why didn t i go back to safety of my stronghold i said chastising myself i was now being attacked by a healthy rested and eager goblin army baying for my blood meanwhile the orc army that i had defeated also joined the fray outnumbered almost 3 to 1 i started the battle positioning my troops at the crest of a hill having plenty of time to maneuver as the sheepish goblin army moved to join their wounded orc allies i waited a line of thunderers and another of quarrellers stood in line ready to shoot victory was unlikely but maybe i could pull off a miracle it was then that the miracle presented itself i noticed the orc warchief at the front of their lines severely wounded from our last encounter if i could just take him out the low morale of the orcs and goblins might shift in my favour the warchief entered my range and my quarrellers unleashed their crossbow bolts as he came even closer my thunderers opened up it was then that the warchief dropped dead his body riddled with crossbowbolts and shot it was as if the ancestors themselves smiled upon the bravery of my men and smote my enemies down for their hubris the remains of the orc army instantly routed charging from the field i turned the eagerness of my ranged infantry to the more pressing matter of the goblins goblin spearmen charged at my wounded men enveloping them in a sea of green slimey flesh and primitive spears they fought hard standing their ground and finally got the edge again when the slayer king himself jumped into the tide immediately flinging half a dozen tiny goblin bodies down the hill still i was heavily outnumbered desperate times call for desperate measures as my longbeards and slayers kept the goblins occupied i marched my ranged units down the hill towards their goblin shaman who sat toward the back of their ranks i opened fire with all the fury my men could muster wounding the fragile leader being on the outskirts of the mob the slayer king met with the shaman leader to leader as it turns out a goblin shaman is no match for the king of the slayers and soon he fell to his axe with their leaders gone the goblins began to fall in droves they soon realised that it was hopeless as the thunderers and quarrellers joined the fight supplementing their arsenal for the shield on their backs the rest of the goblins fled my men cut some of them down but alas it was a luxury that dwarves being much slower than goblins would not be able to take advantage of it didn t matter against the odds we had won with two of their leaders dead i felt satisfied that we had done enough damage for one day and i easily occupied their settlement replacing wood and rusted iron with stone and steel i nestled in my new settlement my men gaining much needed respite and reinforcements i crossed another whiney errand read grudge from my emo book of dark poetry assured in the knowledge that the dwarves wouldn t drown me in their tears at least not for another turn or two i love this game
