2021 a step down compared to f3 and new vegas f4 is still an enjoyable experience as long as you fully accept that from the beginning the story is lackluster to say the least with several factions wanting to waste your time with the most idiotic choices your companions are maybe the best story the game can offer alongside one of the dlcs far harbor that feels closer to a fallout game than the maingame sadly the other dlcs are mostly time wasters from automatron to nuka world although there s one thing to note and that s the gunplay which is improved over vanilla fnv then again who plays beth games without mods lmaoget it cheap and it will be worth it
