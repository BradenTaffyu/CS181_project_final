2023 playing hogwarts legacy be like 50 of time completing main and side quests30 of time selling extra gear opening locked doors gathering collectibles 20 of the game taking screenshots of each step because the world is magnificent dbut if you have this bittersweet feeling after completing the game it means that was a good one you can do basically everything come up with your own combat style explore the world which is pretty big put the coolest or dumbest costume on your character d grow plants brew potions breed animals decorate the room of requirements if you re into design you can spend many extra hours in the game learn unforgivable curses d i must say that i also liked the story and the characters the only drawback for me was too much similar grinding this is mostly about merlin trials and i also think it would be great if each new level of alohomora allowed unlocking the doors faster as for bugs i haven t faced any major ones but only small things that didn t really affect my experience my final word is i do recommend this game i enjoyed the time spent inside and outside hogwarts moreover it would be very nice to get more hl content in the future 3 a screenshot of hogwarts legacy by nastie summer
