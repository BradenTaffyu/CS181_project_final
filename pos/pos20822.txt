after the update i lag a lot which is crazy considering my specs and the fact i have a 5k build hogwarts legacy has been fun i completed the full game before the update in 111 hours achievements were easy to achieve throughout the game currently i m working on getting the house achievements for the other 3 houses speaking of the houses hogwarts legacy did a great job creating all of them and only allowing access if you re of that house when i was playing i decided to explore and grab all the floo flames do the little things and all of the merlin trials so i could focus on the main story the story line is good it s like a side quest of harry potter i was never a super huge fan of hp but have seen the movies all of hogwarts was done very well and i was surprised when i first played there was quite a lot of details and little things graphics are good i m glad they added a camera mode because it was needed some of the scenery is really pretty gameplay was a lot of fun i did download a mod for flying control this made it a lot easier and more intuitive fighting was super easy as well and a beginner could definitely pick this game up there is a lot to do from exploring fighting merlin trials making potions decorating taking care of animals etc all these little things made the game nice and allowed me to take breaks from quests and whatever else tldr overall i d say this game is good if you like stories with more immersive interaction it s definitely a good cosy game to curl up and play side note i understand why the author who wrote the hp books picked weird names given the target audience but i was questioning why hogwarts during the game that sounds disgusting
