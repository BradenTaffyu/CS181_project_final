2019 okay after playing this game for a long time i think i experienced the game enough to write a review on it from the point i saw this game to the moment i started writing this review this game never ceased and still does not ceases to amaze me there are many space simulators out there like masters of orion sins of solar empire and the one i last played endless space 2 i know it came out like 2 years ago but i only got the chance to play it last month sshhh but this is the one that i like the most and i m going to try to explain why customisation first thing i absolutely love about this game is a feature it shares with ck2 and eu4 customisation i am a huge geek when it comes to things like this and i like to add my touch to the games i even go as far as to write actual history about the custom nations i create so before everything else i wanted to mention this little thing here game let s you customise your nation from the scratch from the species to the ethics and culture of it giant galaxy galaxy size can be set when starting a game but it can be up to 1000 star systems containing an endless array of interesting stuff and events and oh speaking of events events as every other grand strategy game from paradox stellaris too contains numerous events that is going to make you enjoy the every second of the game they add so much to the game and they are saving it from being just a bland strategy game and turning it into something else the sheer curiosity of sending a ship to this unknown system and wondering what is waiting you there is quite good exploration i talked about this a bit before but there are much more to exploration than looking at the map technologies to discover anomalies that leads to interesting events paradox grand strategy games are 80 events tbh and much more diplomacy when there are a lot of space faring nations around diplomacy with them is inevitable going full exterminatus is still a diplomatic stance okay while the game is not that great on this topic i guess it isn t completely bad i imagine they are going to work on this in some future patch that ll 100 come with some overpriced dlc war war is mostly space warfare that leads to ground invasions of enemy planets while ground battles are painfully straightforward and can be described as i have big number they have small number me win ggwp space combat is the complete opposite you design your ships yourself decide what weapons and components they ll have etc certain components counter others so you have to know your enemy to win battles for example your enemy have tons of carriers that spawn hordes of fighters by fitting your ships with good defensive weapons you can eliminate their offensive capabilities and win the battle even though they seemed a lot stronger there are a lot more to it but i got bored of writing so here is a tldr version pros one of the best space simulators you can find my opinion graphics are pretty good well flushed out government and species unlimited potential every game is different from one another full customisation create your own species and watch as their story gets written stellaris has an active modding community and that is always good for any game cons diplomacy needs to be worked on people you fought for years are not going to forget about what happened just because now you have a common enemy ai usually has the intelligence equal to a fetus even if you have a good computer during mid to late game game will start to slow down to a crawl because everyone is going to s out ships like a fat guy with diarrhoea and trying the process all that will inevitably slow your game down i didn t wanted to put this on cons take this as a warning and not con paradox grand strategy games are hard to get used to don t buy this game expecting it to be something like a total war game which is mostly recruit units and go to war i like tw but come on we all know that is true there are many things to think about in this game if you even hope to survive to the end of the early game i d probably get shanked in some back alley if i didn t say this so here it goes dlc tldr s tldr i d say buy the game but don t come back crying when you fail because your whole population died because of starvation
