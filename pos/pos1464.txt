2020 early access review rating 9 10 quick review best description of this game is topdown 3d ultra realistic zombie survival rpg simulator game w multiplayer included requires quite a refined taste but definitely recommend getting for an unique zombie survival experience playing the iwbums community beta testing version and its very worth your money even without discount things to take note multiplayer for iwbums version is not out yet thats why 9 10 classic version does have multiplayer local online but lacks abit of the polish and immersion that the iwbums has so if you want a co op experience you may want to hold out but i highly recommend getting this to support the game as the game is in healthy development singleplayer is a great experience and the classic version is still good fun these guy s videos explains it quite well youtube video project zomboid is the best zombie survival game ever made views 38 177 project zomboid has consumed many nights for me personally and it s quickly became the best zombie survival game i ve ever had the pleasure of playing that s not an opinion that s a fact youtube video project zomboid build 41 iwbums animations update survival is back 1 views 94 808 project zomboid build 41 experimental iwbums has been released with the new animations here s a link to the post in case you want to give it a try pros cons pros single player scenarios different challenges plain old survival mode good variety multiplayer local 4p splitscreen w controller or online multiplayer unique player customization perks excellent perk balancing making things punishing realistic realistic survival very difficult crafting system quite interesting interaction very expansive but not overly complicated unique health system emotions illness temperature all limbs interaction base building nothing new or special but done very very well constant updates love from developers from when the game released 2011 til now steam workshop tons of mods to suit your playstyle unique graphical game low pc requirements cons tutorial needs more information doesn t teach the crafting user interface needs refining tho managing inventory is abit hard needs gettin use to i m confident it will be upgraded in future early access tho a very good game already still has a very long steady road to make it an ultimate game needs to implement crossbow bow slingshot maybe throwing spear needs to implement more vehicles bikes bicycles main review i bought this game back in 2012 before it was on steam as it had boast a unique multiplayer zombie survival game back then i thought it was pretty cool but played only abit every few years recently i saw a screenshot online and thought is that project zomboid booted up the game with the beta test and i m hooked til this day i think many games have tried to simulate this experience but all fallshort except for multiplayer the below information will be of iwbums version which is opt in via game steam settings gameplay before you start every game you have to create a custom character that survivor is link to that savefile and is not transferable to other games customization is basic but has enough features to your liking like gender skin hair facial hair then clothing from head to bottom while selections are limited during the game you find a more expansive selection of clothes and you can style shave your hair after you pimp your looks you pimp your character traits a very unique system you can choose from a wide range of occupations that give unique perks like easy lockpicking weapon handling experience in navigating forest many more or you can be unemployed t t which gives you some points to pick your own perks perks range from getting more exp increase stealth increase strength running to reading faster being able to see well in dark eat or drink less and many more these take up a no of points depending on how useful they are and when you lack points you can choose to take negative perks to gain more points things like being obese being deaf things that balance your character forcing you to choose wisely after that strait of the bat the game reminds you you will die which you find out the hard way is true gamemodes are limited to survival with 3 different difficulties or various challenges like last stand or starting in a burning building multiplayer while not released for the iwbums test version yet the classic version does have multiplayer available now this is great fun as 4 player local co op is available with controllers although abit harder to enjoy the true multiplayer experience is to be played via mouse keyboard so do aim for the 4pack controls user interfacecontrols are few wasd to move shift to jog c to sneak alt to sprint e to basic interact r to basic reload and 1 5 to cycle thru holstered equipment almost everything else is done interacted via mouse click right click brings up a list of interactions you can do on the object you moused over all very easy to understand in a survival game you always start in your personal house and then thats it you fight for survival play the way you want scavage houses run for your life live in the forest barracade your home make your own home or just keep travelling no matter what they come for you the combat is very punishing firearm aiming is based on ingame skill zombies only die when their heads are caved in and when they swarm they swarm every item has realistic weights and backpacks fannypacks storage all is a crucial part of the game if you cant find a bag to equip chuck food or items into a plastic bag that you have to use one hand to hold or if you are macho you can use both hands to carry bags but then you cannot hold weapons you can quick slot 2 melee weapons equipment to your belt or carry 1 large weapon on your back all accessible via 1 3 on keyboard if you find a holster then you can quick holster a small firearm there are vehicles ingame which are realistic in interaction you can sleep in them lock them load stuff in the glove box or boot you have to gas them have a key or hotwire them provided you are trained drive your friends repair all individual parts tires engines and all the stuff thats inside a car im not a mechanic irl help the survival system i mentioned is very indepth interesting while not being overly complex getting panic reduces accuracy getting overheated makes you thirsty getting cold gives you hypothermia insomnia makes you weaker hunger thirst is required at a realistic time illnesses make life harder depending on your calories you get gain or lose weight big actions are based on whether you are exhausted or not now this part i love injuries will occur if you are not careful you can protect yourself depending on the clothing you wear denim thick clothing protects you depending whether they cover that part of the body realistically wear shorts and your knees are exposed for example i always start with sneakers as it allows quicker running but when i was sprinting from a horde of zs i ran thru trees and tripped depending of how many or what clothing you equip you also get sweaty wet clothing early access while that might scare you it does seem that the game is still being updated as it is a small indie team so expect slow progress toward completion but you can tell this is a passion project so not to worry just support them conclusion i would love to purchase more copies for my friends to support the developers but i have to wait until they release the multiplayer for the latest update which i m sure is quite soon once they ve done all the critical patches still don t let that deter you from buying this game during sales or even now it is definitely a unique cheap game worth your money and time i really hope they implement crossbow bow slingshot maybe throwing spear and more vehicles like bikes bicycles purchase and support the game
