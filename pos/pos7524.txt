2023 the game itself is amazing but the ubisoft connect application is quite annoying once in a while you have to click through like 4 times allowing ubisoft to make changes to your hard drive kinda sketchy edit the game doesn t properly save on the cloud for me so i lost many hours worth of progress when i played at a different address for a couple days so annoying given you get a saving game to the cloud message when you close the game wtf ubisoft changing to a downvote if this problem happens again
