2016 my impression i never played any type of harvest moon game but i love rpgs of any kind i was skeptical about the price at first and figured if i didn t like it i would refund it well 52 hours of gameplay later i m writing this review this game has the same addictive quality as one of my favorite other games civilization 5 the graphics look so simple but there is so much to stardew valley that you haven t tapped into yet it s an amazing game that surprisingly was only made by one guy positive relaxing game story that s simple but turns into so much more detailed character creation endless amount of stuff to do much more than just farming dating sim added into the game quests to keep the addiction real entertaining events and seasons with different items to collect make for a lot of stuff to do very large map music music is surprisingly good it s atmospheric and relaxing steam trading cards developer is very active in the community developer seems to still be adding new features to the game including coopnegatives people say bugs but with the developer so active in the community he s fixed everything the day they were posted save feature could be improved but i honestly do not have any complaints about the gamevery very good game 10 10i was skeptical about the price but looking at my playtime i can say it was justified not finished yet the developer is also planning on adding more features this is a must buy for any gamer in my opinion after seeing the different types of streamers that have played this game i would say they cover large categories of different genre s of games they play all had extremely positive feelings about this you would be surprised at how you feel about this game if you gave it a shot
