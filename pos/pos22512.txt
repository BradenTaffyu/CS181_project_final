2022 every night we close our eyes and leave for the kingdom of morpheus our road there can be bright or dark but one thing we know for sure when the sun rises we will open our eyes and wake up or will we never see the sun again the uniqueness of this game most of the survival games are very simple and they are created only for the sake of killing your time behind the endless process of survival in the virtual world at the same time in most games for survival sandboxes there is no even a plot when you start the next survival game you understand that it was created for people with problems and after 1 2 hours it becomes boring and having turned off such a game i never want to start it again but when you go to don t starve you feel that it was as if plunging into the world of morpheus and after night or day you will want to go into his kingdom again to survive in the world of nightmares plot we all live in a world that is real for us but when we fall into the world of dreams we understand that everything that happens to us is unreal and this is only a dream or the world of our dreams is real and the world that surrounds us is only a long dream under the rays of the sun by the will of fate or demons our hero falls into the world of dreams without blinking and an eye if you were waiting for pink clouds and a rainbow behind them you can say goodbye to the world of illusions and plunge into the world of nightmares where you should not only be afraid of every rustle in the bushes in the night or your own shadow but also survive day after day passing along the long way of life in this world of nightmares you will learn more and more answers to those questions that the plot of the game leaves in the surrounding world as in real life we will not be able to understand or find out something if we do not go a long way to our goal it should be noted here that most of the disclosure of plot intrigues occurs in the don starve together where you can go to the terrible world of dreams more than one not alone rpg system and mechanics engage in collecting or hunting build your own house or find a stranger s one and capture it this is not a choice that the game gives us but the ability to combine many of the possibilities of this world which is generated when creating a map a large culinary book is at your disposal which will be filled with your experiments with the preparation of everything and everything after all a person is a predator and it can eat everything or almost everything since food can be incorrectly cooked or damaged and lowering your characteristics but if you are an excellent cook you will always be full if you are a good builder and hunter then you will have a warm and cozy house that you will update every time of the year yes yes in this game a harsh cold winter will come after the beautiful golden autumn of your last hopes the most difficult system in the game is your mind after all it can not only grow but also degrade your mind near your computer will be safe from this drying process because when it will fall you will see more and more terrible creatures your secret consciousness or demons of this world of morpheus virtual world of course we are in the terrible world of nightmares but when you abandon your fears and doubts you will firmly step towards tomorrow then you will suddenly see the beauty of this world there will be charming forests from which you want to build your small cozy house and the beautiful swamps where among the water lilies we want to make their cozy fortress on the island and somewhere in the vast and free steppe in empty lands you will want to build your oasis of luxury of green colors of life with waterfalls of love all this can not only be seen on the other side of the monitor but try to create your beautiful world of nightmares graphic arts it is difficult to say about it as a bad or good level because the whole world is so subtly sewn with threads of care and love of the developers for us that despite surrealism in detail we feel the warmth of grandmother s terrible stories when we look at this virtual world i can only say one thing that when the talent is suppressed with love for work then we will see that graphics that will not obsolete even after 10 years music there are no shock heavy sounds after which your gray brain cells will be destroyed or quick meaningless words that are so insignificant that our brain cannot understand the meaning of the spiritual message of the author of music poems to us in this game it s only subtle music which will cross the notes of the world and nature in it and when we invade it it will change under us like n paganini caprice no 24 where we listen to the world to the last string if you want to take the music of this terrible world with you on the road then this album is for you instead of the final and errors don t starve was released on april 23 2013 and each of us plunged into the world of nightmares in a lonely room with a mug of tea in a gloomy darkness outside the window but on april 21 2016 the don starve together came out and it is no longer important or light around you and what is happening outside your window because now your friends will always be in this world of nightmares which will become better and bright with the warmth of their hearts perhaps devs thought in the same way but releasing the next part of the game they practically killed the first part of the game after all even lonely people without friends and loved ones will in their larger quantities create closed servers in the donat starve together and build their world of nightmares rather than return to the first part but no matter how this game develops in the future for me forever don starve remains like a step into the world of beautiful nightmare dreams 10 10 beautiful nightmares
