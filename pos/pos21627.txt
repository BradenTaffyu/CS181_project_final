2022 forza horizon has very real visual graphics and also good handling in each car an introduction to the story of the car and also very good mexico and also i was very spoiled by the mexican scenery in fh5 fh5 also has a lot of cars and even continues to be added every event update as well fh5 has very good car customization also what i m most looking forward to is the hotwheels dlc from fh5 but unfortunately fh5 can t transfer save games because i previously played fh5 on xbox gamepasss and i wanted to continue the hotwheels dlc on steam but that couldn t happen and i had to start over from the beginning even so i still enjoy fh5 for some reason racing games always make me very relaxed and make it a healing game you should try this because fh5 has a unique story introduction and provides a more realistic and less arcade driving experience
