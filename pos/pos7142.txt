2020 the sun was going down as i reached the top of a hill in oakland ca at that summit i saw a beautiful sunset acompanied by the golden gate bridge after 100 hours in the game that was when i finally decided to write a review the detail in this game is simply amazing the amount of detail scs software puts into the base game is simply amazing each state has its own unique feel and of course its famous landmarks all of which were very enjoyable to pass for the first time the game also has paid dlc i know you might not think it s worth the price but just trust me the dlc states add so much more contrast to the world of ats and in my opinion offers much more detail than the base game s environments driving from a desert highway to the dense wooded areas of oregon to the beautifully modeled areas in washington is a very nice change of scenery as a college student i find this game to be extremely relaxing and a great stress reliever the game also has great mod support that will only get better over time this game contains some of the most beautiful scenery i ve ever seen and is an absolute joy to chill out and drive in after a long day scs software are the best developers i ve ever purchased a product from please play this amazing game and support them you won t regret it
