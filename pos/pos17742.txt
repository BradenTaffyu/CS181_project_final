first off i want to preface the review that i am aware of the drama that surrounded the release of this game and that i am posting this review after the price change i was very hesitant to buy the game because of the bad news surrounding it in its full price release i bought it after the price was changed to 40 and i must say that i am pleasantly surprised this game at its current price is a solid small scale addition to the total war collection it is not as grand scale as full instalments of the historical series but rather a very well improved version of total war troy in a different area and cultural setting the gameplay improvements compared with previous total war game are mostly on the campaign map the outpost system is meaningful when used in an intelligent way for the buffs it provides to settlements and armies the different gods you can choose to worship likewise provides interesting boosts to your faction and the various unique cultural centers on the map interact with the gods you choose to worship geographical features are also meaningful on the map making the nile a highway of sorts for your troops and for invaders and deserts are difficult obstacles you need to plan ahead to traverse the resource system from troy is back which gives interesting incentives as to where to expand next on the map and who to be friendly with for trade the diplomacy is also very similar to troy the court system is somewhat limited as is often the case in total war games see attila it can be used for real advantages to your faction but is uninspiring in the variety of decisions you can make the idea of having unit rosters that are native to the recruitment region is in my opinion very interesting and ads flavour to the campaign by providing new units as you expand roving bands on nomads and seapeoples are present and add complexity to the campaign in a way that isn t as abusive as the attila hunnic hordes the battles are also improved from troy the fighting animations in the warhammer or troy style are better and fighting animations between individual units are back a big drawback is that there are no kill animations only fights that end with both fighters still alive the sound design of the battles is great and i personally like the music as well gameplay wise the battle ai doesn t seem to show much improvement on previous titles but was pleased to see that when the besieged ai had reinforcements coming from outside they would sally out to help if the reinforcements were intercepted on their way into the town rather than stay put and allow themselves to be defeated piecemeal i think this is an improvement it is a very rigorous game with no bugs that i could find and runs very smoothly even on my old potato i do not think this game s scope would have allowed it to be fairly priced as it was intended at the 80 full historical game mark but for 40 and an unofficial saga title i think this is a solid game and can confidently give it a 8 10 grade i am enjoying my current campaign as nubia amenmesse and plan to play irsu next as soon as i finish good job and thank you to the creative assembly sofia team
