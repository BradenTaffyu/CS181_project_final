2020 genre simulatorgraphics are okage i would say from 10 years old it depends on what is played story has no storydifficulty control is fairly simple the level of difficulty fluctuates only in the various games that are played such as chess or uno game time playtime is endlessbugs no bugs so farmulti singleplayer for example you can do jigsaw puzzles alone or play along with up to seven or even twelve other games from the workshop price the price is okay in my opinion you should still wait until the sale then it s worth more negative positive the positive thing is that this simulator does not have to be used to buy games such as uno or any other people annoying games if you only play with friends anyway negatives so far nothing known follow me on for your support
