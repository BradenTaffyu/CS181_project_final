2021 my account says 19 hours played i have over 500 hours on this game on ios sts is a video game it has monsters that you have to kill cool moves you can do levels that you need to go through you know video gamey stuff it even has potions still i decided to look at it as something a bit more than just a video game i started off playing sts with zero deckbuilder experience i struggled up till i finally managed to win a run i eventually made it to the real final boss of the game and i was like yeah this is stupid difficult do people actually win against this fast forward a year later and yeah people win against it not only that but they win against it with handicaps it starts off with one handicap then you get another and another it s like you already have the odds against you but you stack them against you even more and more up to 20 different disadvantages to start off with yet people still win consistently at the game how is that as i learned more about the cards how they synergize how to anticipate my opponents and make arrangements for the possibility of my meeting them i started to understand in this game you re given a deck of cards you can t control what cards you will find nor what elites or bosses you will encounter never the less through your own decision making you can turn squalid conditions to your advantage and come out on top despite the odds in this way i decided to view this as more than just a game it s a simulation that demonstrates the power of making decisions that have thought behind them decisions that weigh pros and cons that consider consequences i learned that a bad situation even if it is bad and will certainly end bad does not have to be as bad as it gets by carefully considering options studying the situation one can mitigate whatever negative aspects exist in any given situation if they are also lucky or particularly gifted they may even reverse it into a good situation to me sts served as a reminder of that and as a good demonstration of how powerful this concept is i was able to go from a situation i really was convinced was hopeless to being able to regularly and casually beat that same boss that i thought was impossible a year back with at least 10 12 different handicaps on top of that all because i changed how i think and how i made decisions i recommend this game to anyone even if you don t choose to learn life lessons from it you still have an exceptional game to play
