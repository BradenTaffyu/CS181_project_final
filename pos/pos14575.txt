2017 i ve been a devout fan of the civilization series ever since i was introduced to civilization 2 a couple of decades ago while i obviously liked some aspects of each game more than others the bottom line was always the same i really loved all the main installments of the series ever since and the spinoffs colonizations beyond earth a bit less although my opinions of them were generally on the positive side as well not surprisingly after playing over 60 hours i feel pretty much the same way about civilization 6 sure it has some problems the ai for one well i agree it sucks also beyond the tedious amount of time the game takes to load even on decent machines i7 quad core 16gb ram and geforce gtx465 here it also tends to lag and stutter from time to time after changing governments for example in some cases the game wouldn t close on its own forcing me to restart my system just to get rid of it the thing is despite all those problems i m still having way too much fun with this game to dismiss it and put it aside even with the crappy ai the lags and the stutters the game is fun to play just like the previous games in the series civilization 6 offers the same gameplay mechanics we re used to with a new interesting twist to make the mix familiar and intuitive on one hand but refreshing and interesting on the other one of my favorite additions is the eureka inspiration boosts to scientific and cultural advancements all sorts of things can stir you in the right direction for finding something out founding a city on the coast for example gives you a boost for researching sailing killing enough barbarians and clearing one of their outposts gives you boosts for a couple of military related advancements and so on this adds another layer to the way you might want to play as the more such boosts you get the faster you advance in general but since you obviously can t get all of them you might choose to focus on a specific direction or to change the order of the topics you research accordingly another interesting new concept is the districts within the cities if in previous civilization games you just spammed buildings all over now you have to plan ahead each district allows building certain types of buildings a holy site for example lets you build religious buildings an encampment lets you build military buildings and so on while each city can have more than one district the space is limited so you have to choose not only between districts but also between districts and tile improvements as each tile can support either an improvement or a district or a world wonder btw just like the science culture boosts this makes you think and plan carefully my bottom line is this if you liked the previous civilization games i bet you d like this one as well
