2018 do you want something like a more grown up version of civilization that s more realistic do you want your games to mostly represent plausable alternatie histories well this is the game for you it is not simply a wargame but a grand strategy game that attempts to cover everything it s like the photoshop of grand strategy games you can learn a certain amount about the complexity of real world political systems from playing this game for example attack that small country when you don t know what you re doing and suddenly you re in a massive war that destroies you because you didn t pay any attention to who their allies were if only it had occured to you that you might be able to lure them away from their allies through other means and vassalize then possibly even diplomaticly annex them you might have done much better wondering what would have happened if the netherlands had colonized cuba well start out in 1440 and you don t even have the netherlands yet holland will have to invade other netherlandish kingdoms like delft to form the netherlands first once you ve done that you might eventually have a chance to colonize cuba but start out too late in time and spain will have already done it the game attempts to follow history as closely as possible without forcing you to do exactly what every country historically did unlike civilization which seems childish in comparison nations are not simply cosmetic with a few balanced out differences some countries are at a major disadvantage especially with technological development some like the ottomans have some technological disadvantage but a major advantage in size meaning they could have conquered parts of europe if they had focused their efforts differently and acted in time some are unlikely to conquer anything and have no chance at anything but colonization and trade maybe not even that for some total victory would simply be maintaining their independence until 1820 while some mods let you play past 1820 certain historical events like industrialization were literally game changing enough to require a completely different game so the game mechanics don t cover anything past the beginning of the industrial era that is how specific and detailed the mechanics are they can t simply be generalized to all historical periods like civilization attempts to do get this game on sale it s one of those games where almost all new features are released as dlcs the core mechanics updates are covered by the empire founder s bundle of dlcs so if you want to start out with the important stuff that s the thing to buy the others usually add features that aren t as significant or are specific to particular regions or they just add cosmetic or musical content but in any case expect to take some time to learn this game it s not casual and learning it seems like trying to learn photoshop sometimes because like photoshop it s difficult to stuff all of the necessary options into the user interface
