2022 i don t usually play online games i usually enjoy doing my own thing however this game does not force you into situations with other players and any events you do choose to participate in are fun player interactions in this game are really quite lovable whether someone is buying stuff from your camp shop or running after you just to drop you a gift in my case a way higher level player gifting me the best gun that i still always use pvp stuff can be frustrating but you re not forced into that the fact that the game is live and there is no saving and other real people are playing around the map gives this game a feeling of life that you don t realize is missing from the other fallout games no matter how many mods you have installed on them until you ve experienced this one for a bit and the map btw is great even after so many hours and total exploration there is the comfort of familiarity but some things always feel new and the game is updated often if you loved building settlements in fallout 4 the camp building feature here is great even in its vanilla state and they re always adding new things to build if you like fallout i highly recommend this
