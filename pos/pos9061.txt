2019 gameplay 9 10story 9 10graphics 8 10performance 5 10overall 8 10there is a reason stellaris is the only space strategy game i ve had a reasonable amount of invested time in it is the space everything strategy game forewarning though stellaris is less of a 4x strategy game and more of a space empire simulator you can be doing everything right with your empire and still lose simply because you were locked in total war with your opponent and suddenly invaded by extra dimensional beings intent on colonizing the known galaxy hence why stellaris allows you to make victory conditions optional if you re looking for something that s more game y or closer to the civilization series then you may be better off with something like galactic civilizations or endless space but you may be asking yourself why play stellaris what does stellaris have that galactic civilizations or endless space doesn t stellaris has scale and not in the sense that you can have thousands of planets and stars generated because gal civ and es have this too but scale in the sense that you control and command everything from the lowliest group of slaves to the emperor of your empire or president or shadow council if you choose but it doesn t just end with deciding what your citizens or leader does you can decide what entire planets do want to have a planet dedicated entirely to housing your empire s prison population as a sort of space australia you can do that want to have a planet dedicated to building robots because your citizens are too lazy to work you can also do that or how about a planet so beautiful that you want it to be a resort world yep you can do that too diplomacy also has a sense of scale that other space strategy games never come close to achieving and this is without the future diplomacy dlc stellaris takes the notion of diplomacy is war by other means to heart allies in stellaris can be genuinely helpful and more than just buffers against potential invaders with allies you can form federations and combine fleets or unite to fend off a mutual invader the ai isn t prone to ganging up on the player like other space strategy games speaking of war combat in stellaris is simplistic but also possesses a sense of scale with stellaris being a real time grand strategy game you won t be waiting several turns for a single battleship instead you can start producing very small fleets from the very start of the game visuals and sound in stellaris are also adequate for a strategy game not as good as endless space but superior to the dated engine of galactic civilizations planets and anomalies look beautiful ships look relatively detailed if you can get a good look at them and alien races are animated i recommend stellaris if you are looking for a space strategy game that does everything it s difficult to get into if you ve never played a paradox strategy game before but with a few walkthroughs and some patience you ll be purging xenos in no time
