2022 early access review probably one of the best games about the body that exists qud is a world in which the only way to survive against its body horror and utterly disorienting subjectivity is to assert your own bodily autonomy to shape yourself in extremely particular ways from adopting a diet that allows you to shoot bursts of flame every time you eat a snack to growing waxen fungi on every tip of your skin to augmenting yourselves with gun racks and magnetic cores to wield 7 laser pistols three of which are magnetized and wielded by you from afar recently they added a lot of stuff about dissociation mechanics explicitly giving you bonuses when you are not within your own body as much as it is subtly motivated by philosophical questions of what a body is of what agency is it s also fun as hell and the mastery of the combat of this system about bodies and rules of existence and the ruthless dismantling of every single law about the flesh is what makes this game s world so compelling and dripping with flavor qud is a real good time i recommend you don t play with permadeath on this world is too big and compelling and late game mechanics too mind boggling to have to run through the same beginning locations and quests over and over only to die to a bunch of mf crabs in a gooey trash pit
