2023 oxygen not included oni seems like a cutesy colony sim on the surface but this presentation is a big fat lie beneath the cartoonish visuals lie a very complex and scientifically demanding system of checks and balances that will challenge players to think smarter and adapt on the fly truly oni is a wild ride of mixed emotions i d feel incredibly smart and self satisfied when i d puzzle out and successfully build a renewable water treatment system only to feel like a total moron when i realized i ve neglected to build out similar sustainability in my oxygen production or food acquisition systems your characters are presented as duplicants i e relatively cheap clones but that didn t assuage my guilt whenever one might get sick injured or die because of my recklessness or a costly workplace accident of my own making the common expression the devil is in the details seems aptly applied to oni as it s always the small seemingly minor stuff adding up over time that sank my various short lived settlements hitting a wall and having to start over wasn t a particularly devastating feeling though as i d always have learned something new and lasted a little longer with each attempted colony considering my own cost vs play time assessment i d consider oxygen not included to be a fantastic game whether at full price or on sale often seen for 10 usd that being said this is not a game that will be enjoyable for everyone i d argue that this game is best suited for folks with an active interest in stem fields strong planners well organized individuals and folks who are patient with a high tolerance for initial failures the point i m really dancing around is don t buy this game for your dumber friends or for yourself if admittedly dumb then again take my elitist shade as a challenge and prove me wrong if you dare to try
