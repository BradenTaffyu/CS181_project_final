2020 this game is amazing in the stories and memorable experiences it creates my colonists was doing well until they were hopelessly outmatched by a raid the bandits captured everyone and began to leave with their prisoners my colony was over or it would have been if the man in black hadn t appeared as a messiah he gunned down the already injured bandits and single handedly saved everyone later my colony was massacred by a horde of wolves it is important to remember a sentiment i learned from dwarf fortress losing is fun
