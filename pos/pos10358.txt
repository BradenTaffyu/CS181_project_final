2018 early access review coming from iracing assetto corsa r3e and having some reallife race car track experience i am very impressed of course limited functionality so far but that was clearly communicated by kunos people who complain about this should better start to learn reading regarding this first pre release what stands out incredibly good believable physics tyre modeling by far the best of every sim i played so far no need for finetuning ffb settings it works out of the box had only to limit the gain to around 95 with the csw 2 5 to avoid some minor clipping very very demanding complex yet believable driving behaviour to keep the car on the track and doing fast laps sound is the best out of every sim so far fast down shifts in the lambo put a grin on your face every time much more styled ui especially compared to ac usability of ui could be better control configuration is not very usable e g if i klick on some buttons i want to see that on the ui to check if it is already allocated fov settings limited should be able to be done on the fly like in pcars2 including viewing angle btw it is important more than in any other sims to set the fov right here otherwise you have a hard time to handle the car and getting faster laps needs very strong system to run high fps with 8700k 2x1080 sli sytem it runs around 50 60 fps i need 120 for my monitor i expected a bit more graphics wise it is on par with pcars2 but not significantly better could not use the raytracing feature obviously i guess most of these points probably will be adressed and are still in development until the official release for sim racers this is the must have title without any doubts too bad it only has gt3 class cars i crave for a title that uses this kind of physics with an title offering different car classes
