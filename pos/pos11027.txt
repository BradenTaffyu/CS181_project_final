patch 2 0 made a huge performance and stability gain currently running a city of 440k and it s fully enjoyable and responsive i retain the positive review of before and encourage you to return if you have purchased it if you re reading other reviews then you ll think it s a dumpster fire but it s not not in a long way played the first one forever and it was awesome this has the same name it has the same concept but under the hood it s very very different in what they are trying to do played it till i got the largest city milestone unlocked and loved what they did with the algorithms that they ve changed up for pop production mail electric etc it requires a different way to play and finding seeing how they changed things up was highly enjoyable is it fun yes can you think of it as a 60 hour game if you do it s awesome it plays way way better than the reviews would give it credit is it the 400 hour game at the moment not at the time of writing but they ve committed to moving it that way if you like city builder games yes purchase it and give it a go it s a great build it to a the largest city milestone game fantastic no loss in enjoyment or time quite wonderful the hopeful bonus it will meta morph into a varied rich and in depth builder like cs1 but is it worthwhile to purchase now for a solid 60 hours game play yes just change up the framing of what game it is and it s wonderful give it a go
