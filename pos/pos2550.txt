this may be not the most polished game out there but holy singularity if it s not one of the best stories i ve ever experienced and devs really try their best to improve experience with each update and it s f2p friendly you can farm identities you like with no rng and don t get me started on music all you need to know they got collaboration from mili and myth roid for the opening overall this game may not be everyone s cup of tea but i truly love it maybe not as much as devs though
