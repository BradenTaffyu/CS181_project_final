2017 163 hours later i ve finally beaten this thing it s a beast a sprawling grand strategy game full of nuance lore and emotionally engaging content the ai is much smarter now i had about a 100 hour learning curve bouncing between different factions and trying different tactics until i really figured out how to play the game this thing is amazing i have to put it down for awhile so i can go get the million things done that i ve been neglecting but here are some pointers 1 gain as much control of your continent as possible as soon as possible make sure you can recruit some sort of troops anywhere in your empire so you can quickly sprout new armies in the late game 2 grab as many towns that produce your strategic game winning resource scrolls tablets etc as early as possible garrison these towns and defend them 3 station armies in your ritual sites before you start the ritual bad guys show up fast and have an additional army right outside the gate for reinforcements 4 don t march armies of less than 20 units don t garrison armies of less than 20 units as soon as you stretch yourself thin this game devours you it s better to march three armies from town to town than to try to take three towns with three armies in the same turn 5 what i did in provinces minor settlements garrison building economy building growth provincial capitals specialty and military buildings 6 have a plan your plan may vary but here s a good plan reinforce the crap out of your starting continent once it s nice and fortified go forth and conquer it will cost a lot to invade another continent don t give in to the temptation to build a bunch of economy buildings in your newly conquered territories you ll need to build new armies on these new continents or you ll quickly get kicked back into the ocean so build some recruitment buildings when you get there and start up your economic expansion as soon as possible 7 buying interventions to attack your enemies is expensive and not very effective especially late in the game what s more effective is to grab up as many strategic resource sites as possible garrison them keep armies there and outpace the enemy to the end that said if the opportunity presents itself to take the other guy s capital city it s very satisfying 8 it should go without saying but skill up your generals to buff certain types of troops and keep those types of troops in his or her army 9 old total war tricks don t work for example lay seige retreat when the army inside sallies army follows you and attacks out of range of reinforcements you kill that army yeah that doesn t work anymore 10 squishy troops stay squishy abandon all hopes of buffing up your weakest troops to someday be amazing build the highest level troops you can afford to build and maintain and skill up your generals to buff them further 11 it s better to fight them over there then to fight them over here keep your homeland heavily fortified 2 4 armies at your capital city 2 for early game 4 for late game maintain a robust economy so that you can quickly field strong armies and keep strong armies stationed around your continent once you ve established the twwh2 equivalent of fortress america send your armies to kill the bad guys on their own continents late in the game i played a continuous game of take three colonies lose one colony it sucked losing colonies and generals but it distracted the bad guys from attacking my homeland which they could ve conquered if i hadn t have divided their focus 12 don t forget to trade trade is awesome 13 get rid of all troops and generals you don t need use the gold you save to build and deploy armies that are needed elsewhere 14 the game is very well balanced so doomstacks 19 dragons etc can lose to their tactical counterparts spearmen for example 15 fighting skaven sucks because they constantly ambush constantly and pick off your armies one at a time you will love life a lot more late in the game if you just murder them all early in the game early on they re pretty weak if you let them take substantial territory and get a solid economic base they ll become a huge pain in the butt if you can kill them all early without fighting a war on two fronts again don t stretch yourself too thin do it they get truly awful later in the game and that s all i ve got good luck it s a lot of fun i highly recommend it
