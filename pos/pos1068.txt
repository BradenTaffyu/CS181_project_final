2022 early access review this game is pure bliss every ounce of dopamine in my body gets released when i fire a shotgun and i become a shell of my former self for 4 6 days whenever i lose my month long character no other game has made me feel like both a badass and a useless sack of at the same time this game has it all and i mean it has it all feed your buddy a friendship stirfry that s spiked with bleach desperately try to break into an armory while your partner is shooting a horde behind you become a used car salesman who has control of every single car in the city forcing players to give you everything they own in exchange for the worst car you have this game will replace your life each and every day you will look forward to controlling a set of pixels on a screen when you re not doing that your brain will enter a serotonin deficit until you eventually keel over and die
