2015 because of age and health issues i was stopped from driving unless i drove a hand adapted vehicle which i declined this game puts me again behind the wheel of a vehicle and i have spent in excess of 230 hours playing this simulator i love this game and hope further expansion dlcs are soon forthcoming the mods take this game even further i have included american trucks military mods and more paint jobs than i thought possible immersed in the game you actually do feel as though you are on the road the detail in trucks cities and countryside and yes the a holes that should never be allowed a license to drive are in the game i let the ai know that if you do things to me i will do unto you and i did costing me 100s of pounds in repair bills and fines but the satisfaction you get when you shove that car or truck into a river if one is close by is to much to resist this game is for all ages and i think it teaches all how to drive correctly the young once familiar with driving a simulator like this will have no trouble obtaining a license and keeping it clean take your frustrations out on the traffic ai and drive squeaky clean in the real world i highly recommend this game
