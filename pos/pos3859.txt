2020 perhaps it just doesn t click for some people although i can t really relate but it puzzles me that game ain t getting much spotlight so it s a tactical focused game which has urban fantasy setting if you can call it that with a rather unique progression beat up enemies to learn their skills and then learn set bonuses through trial and error somewhat grindy towards the latter half somewhat repetitive if you want those boss rush violent cases and you kind do want those believe me missions can drag on for quite a long time but you can leave at any time 80 of things are built around one shots story pace is kinda dragged out it covers quite a lengthy period of time not typical for rpgs buuuut it s all fine no really the amount of customization of your party is giant once you recruit some more people in your party the gameplay loop is cool if you know what you are doing rng is almost non existant aside from crit and hit chances but you get the tools to improve those and it ain t even expensive so from a value point this is almost free real estate
