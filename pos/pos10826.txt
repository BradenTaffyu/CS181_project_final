2020 a near perfect blend of game mechanics that allows you to meaningfully fiddle with a very cleverly designed excel spreadsheet nothing in this game is too hard to grasp but for some reason it makes you feel like a genius as if military organization and global politics are big jigsaw puzzles that only you can solve the presentation lets you feel deeply connected to the country you re playing as and the struggles of its soldiers even if you know that deep down you re just turning numbers into other numbers in a big excel spreadsheet i give this game credit for straddling the line between simulation and alt history if you truly want you can take any minor nation to the big leagues and have fun but there are key elements in military organization that uncannily reflect the changing doctrines of the time the integration of close air support carrier cruiser dominance proper classification of armor it s all reflected in how the numbers work out these choices end up being the optimal and most efficient choices but the game never prevents you from disregarding air and stacking artillery or disregarding carriers and building 50 gun super heavy battleships or disregarding medium tanks and building literal cavalry battalions with horses and heavy tanks for some countries they even encourage it and to me that s very interesting you can spend a lot of time educating yourself on the best choices to make to get the highest numbers on the spreadsheet with the least cost only to deliberately ignore it all to roleplay as polish hussars defending their homeland that s pretty cool
