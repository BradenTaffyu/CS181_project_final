2023 the game got a lot of hate when it was initially released but honestly this is a pretty good entry point for the fallout series and a pretty good game the rpg elements have been dumbed down so that you can shoot more with your gun without thinking but that s not so bad the overall game feel world and story are gripping enough to make you want to explore and know more about the world it s pretty fun it s modern fallout and that s not such a bad thing if you want to get more of an rpg experience you can always go back and play new vegas fallout 3 or the og fallout s back when i was trying to get into those games more specifically 3 and new vegas my issue was that i didn t really understand much of the systems or how the game was supposed to be played for the most part fallout 4 made a lot of those things i had issues with more player friendly and allowed me to enjoy its world far more easily it even makes me want to play the previous entries in the series more than before now that i have more knowledge of how the fallout world operates fallout 4 is good even though it might not be the best fallout game in the series if you are new to fallout or are looking for a good gaming experience i highly recommend it however if you are looking for rpg greatness this might scratch your itch but will leave you wanting more it s more of an action rpg shooter instead of an rpg shooter you can still have fun role playing with it but just have the proper expectations
