2021 beautiful beautiful beautiful i have been playing since it launched and will continue to play for as long as the developers support it the game is great and the atmosphere and sound alone makes this game worth its price they truly mastered what it feels like to walk around in a forest which is almost the most important part since you will spend 95 of your time in this game either walking around or lie in a bush waiting for prey to get close enough don t get scared by the large amount of dlc you do not need any of dlc s to enjoy this game and i would probably recommend any new players to play without dlc at first imo the best maps in the game are in the base game and same goes for the weapons
