2022 product received for free early access review this is a really fun and relaxing conversation starter i love firing this up with a friend and just having a long talk while we blast mud and grime off old cars and cottages free play is hilarious and chaotic but i wish career mode allowed you to invite more people and let your assistants equip soap nozzles other than that it s a great group activity it s like having a campfire and each of us get to share stories definitely not for everyone but if you re curious maybe give it a shot i only recommend it if you have at least one other friend to play it with
