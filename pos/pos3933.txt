2020 i picked up troubleshooter to bridge over the wait for xcom chimera squad i bought it like a year ago in ea but was waiting for the full release but i am having such a great time with it that i will finish it first before even touching xccs interestingly many of the changes xccs made have been present in troubleshooter since years of early access interleaved turns individual characters loot choices where to enter a map and unlike xccs the characters have a real story it also has a huge number almost 300 of passive skills that you can select and combine within the framework of your class there are 2 mastery classes by character to create your own individual build and when you are done with the great story no grinding needed to do that you can choose to go on and grind to find the best legendary items and challage yourself on a higher difficulty level if you like turn based battles complex character systems and jrpgs you will love troubleshooter tide gameplay and a beautiful art design it is amazing what this 6 person team managed to put together especially the in game graphics are good considering how small the team is running at smooth 4k60 with my 2080 without a single crash
