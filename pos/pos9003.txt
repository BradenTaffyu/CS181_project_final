2018 there s a lot of mixed reviews for the path the developers have taken this game down i get it some people don t like their game being changed some people like games to stay the way they always were i get that too but here s the thing the game had flaws and i mean serious flaws the amount of people who regulary played stellaris was about the same as one of the other grand strategy titles from paradox that is 4 years stellaris s senior the game had issues there was no depth and i mean none every game was a chore to play between 2250 and 2350 building the same buildings in the same pattern praying you don t provoke the wrath of a fallen empire expanding with the same methodology the same events goals tech progression etc i get why people are mad about the ftl changes too it s fun to have diversity in the mode of travel it makes sense even that multiple options would be available i played almost exclusively with hyperlanes but i still don t support the change because that used to just be a setting you could alter to your liking what ftl methods were available there was no need for developer intervention but at the same time the second you went up against a nation that had the ftl method that countered yours the game became a frantic game of tag where you could feel a constant looming aneurysm in the back of your head but that was the player s choice to play like that and that s one of the things that made stellaris special i ve played a fair bit of stellaris i bought the game at release and played until i literally couldn t anymore i ve dabbled a little bit with every patch but nothing like release i have genuinely enjoyed the game since the moment of launch was the game perfect at launch far from it was it fun yes same for utopia and the synthetic dawn patches perfect unlikely but it was still fun and then comes the dreaded 2 0 that everyone and their grandma is complaining about we get it you have opinions the thing is though opinions are like buttholes everyone on earth has an opinion but none of them are worth anything and no one wants anyone else s but their spouse s 2 0 is still fun as were the previous patches and i assume the future patches will be it s a good game still it functions differently sure the entire first half of the game is different than it used to be i don t like some things about it and i ve touched on those things above but what they have done to this game is a solid and over all improvement over what it used to be despite the flaws that wiz will undoubtedly iron out within the week most of the people here complaining are complaining that a previously featured arbitrary mechanic that they liked was replaced with another arbitrary mechanic so now they re going to sue paradox for a refund it s nonsense most people on the review section of the steam store lack the holistic logic to look at what they re saying and think wow that s dumb maybe i should sit down and think about the options or maybe how i can try a new approach and try to enjoy the new game or maybe go back to an old patch instead of whinging like a toddler the game has a lot more depth than it used to is it perfect no is it still fun yeah it really is you just need to give it a chance tl dr the most vocal people online are often the dumbest read only reviews that focus on the merits of gameplay and minimize fanboy whinging the game is still fun buy it if you want it s not up to me whether you buy it or not because i m not you
