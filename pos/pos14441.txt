early access review unlike other construction focused games that failed to keep my interest dyson sphere program dsp managed to captivate me in an unexpected way what sets dsp apart is the sense of progression and the feeling that i m building something truly monumental starting out as a small bot i began by chopping down trees and breaking rocks to create my first few machines initially it was easy to keep everything neat and organized however 200 hours later my meticulously planned factory turned into a chaotic web of spaghetti like connections despite the mess i was hooked on the process of turning small smelters and constructors into a massive industrial empire transforming my green planet into a machine covered landscape the true magic of dsp unfolded when i ventured beyond my home planet building a new industrial zone on another planet just to fire dyson swarm hexes was a significant milestone watching the tiny zaps firing at the sun filled me with a profound sense of accomplishment the ultimate triumph came when i encased the sun in a solid shell of swarm hexes a feat that felt as monumental as humanity s first steps on the moon creating a star sized structure all by myself was an extraordinary experience returning to dsp after a two year break i was amazed to find my interstellar industry still running smoothly even though i had forgotten how most of the game worked my little machines continued to operate performing countless tasks without my supervision this self sustaining system felt like a living breathing civilization that i had created and it was extraordinary dsp offers a unique and magical experience where the joy of building and progressing is unparalleled it s a game that turns construction into an art form making the universe feel just a little bit more within our reach
