2020 early access review bannerlord 8 10edit features suggested by a lot of players including myself are being implemented into this game like diplomacy rebellions and much more huge respect to the devs for actually listening to the community it s a good time to get it past review8 long years and this is what we get it s not really a huge leap when compared to its predecessor in terms of graphical fidelity sure but veteran warband players will still experience more of the same thing and much of the dialogue is a copypaste from the previous title speaking of voice acting there is hardly any while the architecture is now more grand and detailed players will still have no reason to explore different parts of a city and fast travelling can be done via tab menu there are tons of things that are completely incoherent to the setting the villages as described by the game to be rich and flourishing are empty in fact it doesn t matter how prosperous it is you will still see the same farmers working the fields they should add more villagers each with their own things to say to make the environment believable castles have few guards without any noble residing in it in character customization you can t select presets you can t sculpt your character s face according to race faction the quests from the previous title are petty chores and they re imported into this game as well new merchant quests in particular are non sensical and pointless i m sure a lot of players would appreciate if the devs could create a more story driven campaign with voice acting in addition to its already solid sandbox foundation court advisors and viziers should be the intermediary during dialogue to show that a king isn t simply some peasant you can talk to an audience granted by a king or sultan must be sought earned and being in their presence should be an honour being knighted and swearing allegiance to them a prestigious moment to elevate a sense of purpose for the player even more so to imagine what it would be like for the player to be sitting on that very throne medieval nobility here are puppets to be exploited instead why not give them their own unique personalities with their actions and yours affecting political climate and change of attitude among them npcs are just programmed to war with each other with no proper implementation of diplomacy if the player eventually rules a faction why can t the ruler send an emissary to a neighboring kingdom to open up favorable diplomatic options why would there be a feature to dress casually if it didn t affect your status or charm there should be different and interesting dialogue options when speaking to npcs female players should be able to curtsy and dance in accordance to the faction s culture what s a medieval age without upheavals there should be demagogue usurpers from a starving populace hellbent on overthrowing a crazy monarch these are examples of how you add depth to a sandbox game despite all this i can still recommend it to players who have never played mount and blade this is simply an upgraded version of the previous title with a simple economic system political system based on influence tournaments and the new blacksmithing feature the battles are still epic as ever with a plethora of medieval weapons armor accessories and horses for yourself and your companions as for me i m going to wait for for the devs to actually make use of the financial support they re getting and release a major update worth playing
