2014 early access review should you pick this up 3 reasons for 3 different types of peopleonline boardgame players love to play your games but want a little bit more flexiblity as if you really were there browser games of chess and other ips are great but lack the player control to do what you want tabletop roleplayers whether it be d d gurps or some other rule system these games are hard to put to put into the digital world and if so the software is generally only for you to watch and let the dm move everything and you can actually build 3d dungeons social players its great to be able to chat over a game specially when you really dont care about the outcome of the game in normal games you are forced to make moves till the game is over in this if you just want to sit with your coffee using the voice chat while you throw marbles and the rpg kit pieces you are free to while at the same time laughing at how bad of an aim you have overall this is a great tool if you want to just play in a sandbox and do what you want there is a single player mode that you can spawn anything in or take it to the online side for fun with friends this actually bridges the gap for some of my friends some that like shooting games some that dont but everyone can sit around a boardgame and have some fun
