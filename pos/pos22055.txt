2018 this is a great souls game and in my opinion a great game overall i really enjoy the combat audio and if you are able to stomach the fact that the mouse and keyboard controls aren t great it plays well with a controller the world design is pretty good but seems a bit linear there are connections and shortcuts throughout the game but the path is still one and you gotta follow it to progress through the game the ability to teleport from each bonfire is also a proof of the linearity since it would take ages to move from an area to the other just by running the story is told in a great way for those who take their time to analyze and actually study the game environment storytelling is done throughout the game by environments enemy placements items description drops so on and so forth basically every element of this game is telling a story this game is great would recommend it definitely
