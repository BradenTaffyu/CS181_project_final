2022 the sims 4 is actually an extremely addicting and fun game ruined by its dlc being a combined total of over 1000 dollars aud i caught this game and its main expansion packs on the steam winter sale for 2021 where it was all 50 off and it was still close to 400 aud and that s before all the smaller dlc that being said i ve had alot of fun playing this game and would still recommend the game itself screw ea
