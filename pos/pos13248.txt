2015 this game oh this game i had a review that i posted back in october 2014 that i deleted in order to post this one for more accuracy the game reached full release yesterday so i deleted my early access review for the sake of accuracy when i posted this one first of all i want to make this absolutely clear that this game is not easy i put this here due to a thread i saw a day ago of a man demanding his 30 back because the game was too hard and he had no interest in 3d oval orbits etc while this was a gross lack of research on his part and mostly his fault i still thought i d put this here especially with the new aerodynamics model this game is the closest thing we have to an accurate spaceflight simulator this game is about launching small disproportionate green men into space in theory that s how it works if you re good at the game like me humblebrag if you re bad at the game like most newbies it ends up being more like launching small disproportionate green men a few thousand metres into the air then atmospheric drag pulls you back to the ground and kills said disproportionate green men unless you believe they re plants like i do then they just probably regrow somewhere your first step will be learning to orbit then going to the mun then minmus then basically wherever you please the game allows you to construct rockets or planes then fly them there s tens of parts to choose from and lots to do in the game if you have a bit of patience the game has numerous tutorials and scenarios to help you out with the basics i don t want this review to drag too long since everything i would tell you here is better explained by people like scott manley check out his channel on youtube if you re interested in this game he has a few tutorials there also tl dr this game is great and if you have an interest in space you should get it wait for a sale if you don t want to shell out 30 on it also do not forget the fact the game has a demo that you should most certainly get if you re interested in the game last i checked the demo is way outdated though so don t see it as a complete representation of the game update i should stress that you need persistence if you fail try and try again don t give up
