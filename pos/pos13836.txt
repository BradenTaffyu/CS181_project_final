2020 this game where to start i know i don t have near the high hours that some players have but you can still get so much experience with so little time i ve played in pvp koth invade and annex altis life wasteland tried and am learning in game photography and many operations filled with a loving community and you know what the funny thing is i don t think i m going to stop playing this game any time soon there is so many possibilities on what you can do most of my now 250 hours have been in the air or on the ground with an mg i love playing the supportive role and just making everyone in the unit team or four person squad feel relaxed knowing that when the firefight starts i ll be spitting 10x the metal that the enemy is flying in this game is extremely rewarding every time i jump into an mig 29 i know what it s capable of i ve been in that seat so many times and know the quirks of the aircraft the best thing is is that your experience in each plane transfers to the next as you continue with your hours you tend to find habits techniques and strategies that help you same with helicopters i use to rush myself in koth to get the players to where they needed to go and usually got myself or the entire group killed after a while i started playing on this massive invade and annex server i met a few pilots that told me to slowly try out the big helis before going to the lighter and faster birds this tip alone helped me so much making tiny movements instead of huge over correction led me to find the sweet spots and how the aircraft could be handled on the ground it s an entirely different ball game you don t have the advantage of countermeasures and being able to see your target miles away you have to work on such a high level of teamwork that it astonishes me how unit s can have over 100 players for an operation like i said i m usually posted up with a pkm or an m249 with hundreds of rounds ready to open up at a moments notice i have played rifleman and recon m110 and enjoyed it but nothing beats seeing the enemy flee to cover as i rip them to shreds with my 7 62 650 rpm yes there are a few bugs issues the whole sha bang but you ll find thousands of tutorials to help you out maybe your game files are broken or it s simply you forgot to put in a keybind there s always someone out there to help even for the simple things this game is absolutely wonderful from the scenarios players make to the silly dogfights with a 10 s or the serious operations where you re actually breaking a sweat this game has something for everyone bohemia you did one hell of a job and i hope the next arma is just as legendary as this is oorah thank you to these units and servers that have made a mark on my playing experience and the wonderful people i ve met task force disaster cyclone company united gaming network 55th delta squad code4gaming and special thanks to the 107th air wing for teaching me all that i know now i love you guys
