2016 don t buy this game i know that s weird to read from a review that recommends the game hear me out you re probably like me and have hundreds of titles in your backlog games you ve never beaten heck games you ve probably not even installed yet if you buy stardew valley they are going to stay there for a long time this game is charming in a way that is honestly hard to describe on the surface it looks like a game that could only be described as work starting from nothing you toil away on your newly inherited farm and try to make an honest living the feeling when you clear your first plot of land and start a tiny farm with 9 potatoes that you have to manually water each day when you first get up feels oddly satisfying you start to get into a routine each day you wake up you pet your cat dog and you dilligently go out to your potatoes and make sure they get the love and care they need to grow up and become big and strong eagerly awaiting the pay off of your labor days go by you meet the people of the town one by one and learn all of their stories and quirks after a few days you realize all of these other characters have their own lives they are going about too you start to develop relationships with them and they start to feel like a community that is fun to interact with and slowly become a part of it s another part of each in game day you start to look forward to but we haven t forgotten about our lowly potato plot the day has finally arrived you pluck those nine potatoes out of the ground and proudly walk them into town to sell to the local merchant he happily buys them from you and you notice that you now have a little more money than you originally started out with this time you buy 9 more potatoes and 9 melon seeds you run back to your farm clear another plot of land and plunk your hard earned seeds into the ground this is how the game gets you the slow trickle of progress the thought of wonder about what waits around each next discovery and the slowly growing farm you personally develop in any way you see fit if ever there was a game about farming that had the one more turn mentality instilled this is it pretty soon you notice hours are going by and you ve stopped playing all your other games here on steam counter strike fall out 4 grand theft auto v they all fall to the wayside so that you can spend more time on your ever growing farm in stardew valley this game will leave an indelible mark on you and your gaming time that you will remember long after you achieve and see everything there is to offer inside of it so in closing as i started by saying don t buy this game unless you want to really have an amazing experience taking part in a world that you won t forget any time soon it s truly a remarkable game that will take up as much of your free time as you will allow and i personally guarantee that you will enjoy every hour of it
