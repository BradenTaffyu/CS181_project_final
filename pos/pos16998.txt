2020 honestly i started out as a historical total war player and was extremely reluctant to play either of these two titles i finally bit the bullet on one of the recent sales and i found these games to be extremely enjoyable the diversity between units and factions is an enormous boon to this series and i m not sure i can play the historical games for nearly as long as i play warhammer
