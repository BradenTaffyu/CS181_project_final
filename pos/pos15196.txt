2022 the game depicts drift almost lifelike the car can be completely customized in the car everything can be modified according to my own taste the game is beginner friendly as it gives you a lot of tips at the beginning and by adjusting the steering angle you can help the beginner to drift at what angle the game contains very nice elements driving on the tracks is enjoyable the soundtrack is perfect for corners as it boosts adrenaline levels but even if we don t like music we can put it on ourselves as the game is not very machine intensive and almost any program runs behind it if your pc is not like a potato it s multiplayer compatible and even controller friendly if you don t want to go with huge throttle and angles you can safely dispense things with a controller the game in my opinion is an 8 10 i deduct a small point because the tracks are monotonous after a while but are spiked with very good turns and even shortcuts
