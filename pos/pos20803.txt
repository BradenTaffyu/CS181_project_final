2023 hogwarts legacy has been a wildly entertaining experience so far i haven t touched anything related to the game since i finished all the og books but diving into this game brought back some fond memories from my childhood i think the biggest part of this game that i loved is how it captured the vivid scenery of hogsmeade as described in the books the game also managed to deliver that first day of classes type excitement from year to year albeit in a condensed late bloomer 5th year package so far this game has been the best depiction of the wizarding world in game format you honestly feel it the moment you get sorted and even more so when you first exit the school to travel to hogsmeade this game s open world is vast and beautiful and i haven t been so happy to fully explore a game like this since skyrim in the blink of an eye i noticed that 70h had gone by without me even thinking about it if it wasn t obvious enough i really enjoyed my time at hogwarts as far as performance goes i recognize others with stronger gpus had issues personally i did not experience any major issues on my end with my rtx 2080 i maybe experienced stuttering for about 1 2 minutes total out of 70h of play but relative to my peers i basically had a stress free experience the combat is beautiful and definitely has flashy moves but i do think some of the cooler spells come a little bit too late into the story to fully enjoy in that same breath the ability to fly with your broom also feels like it comes quite late as well or maybe it just felt that way because i was taking in the beautiful sights when it comes to exploration the huge amount of collectibles may be intimidating but they don t feel like a chore because majority of the collectibles serve a greater purpose than just non essential pick ups most of the collectible categories come with a good bit of lore to really enhance your understanding of that world and the rest are polished cosmetics for either your character or base building it was actually fun collecting them all my only gripe about this game which i m sure will be fixed soon is that i am currently locked out of 100 because the biscuit side quest s lock is bugged i opened it prematurely and won t spawn i m not too bothered about it though as every other element in the game was fun to play out through and through i know this game is very controversial but even a bad parent author can raise an excellent child story that can outgrow them if given the right environment and attention this game has grown bigger than its creator and the developers designers that worked on hogwarts legacy really put their love into it it s really hard to create anything this beautiful if you come at it with a hateful heart give the game a fair look if you can be a partial person screw the author but seriously the rest of the team did a great job
