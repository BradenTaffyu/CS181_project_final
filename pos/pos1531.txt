2016 early access review this is project zomboid an isometric sandbox zombie survival simulator this game in my opinion will give you the most authentic simulation of an actual zombie apocalypse that you will ever find you ll worry about your food supply how long the power water will be on disease shelter finding a car fuel building etc all the things you see groups worrying about in the zombie movies you ll put in hours gathering the essentials making a safehouse and reaching a point where you feel like you might actually survive and then you get bored make a risky trip and get torn apart this game has had a long development but very consistent content drop rate there are many more features to come including npc s that have personality and will form factions try to survive the multiplayer for this game is top notch there s hundreds of variables you can tweak to make the world deteriorate slower or faster for example we rented a dedicated server and calculated out the days so that with our server running 24 7 we will have a week of irl time playing after work in our gaming sessions to brace for the power and water shutting off in game this is also when the zombie hordes will reach their peak as we play we feel the world get worse looting trips get more dangerous and fools die off and or stop playing vines grow up the walls of houses cracks appear roads get overgrown and nature takes over we try to spread out the work building gathering scavenging cooking killing so that the soft skills of our characters are diverse hoping that we are able to survive the next coming winter with the only power coming from salvaged generators and looted fuel it feels very authentic give this game a chance the ui is difficult to learn but once you learn it the game tells the most amazing stories very fun with friends
