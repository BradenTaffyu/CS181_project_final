2019 as a long time strategy and simulations game fan i bought this edition to see how far my decision making and moral would reach i consider myself a kind and helpful person but what would extreme conditions and moral dilemmas do with my kind nature the first game of new home was a disaster not due to my organisational skills but due to my conscious so another try was required and another third time s a charm they say and yes success but you aren t reading this to know my trials and tribulations but what i experienced and if you should buy this game right so here s my intake game interface is easy to use ui in game is efficient i encountered no game slowdowns or bugs and it has run smooth on my windows 10 the mood is gloomy which is normal as you are in the freezing cold trying to survive graphics are nice you can zoom in and out easily and i found myself very much immersed into the environment meaning i felt cold when the outer temperatures dropped and felt for the people living in it depending on the difficulty set you get tougher challenges to manage and the reaction towards your decision becomes more pronounced challenges during the progress coming from your people can but not necessarily must be acted upon sometimes no reaction is better then a rushed decision trust me i ve been there the requirements per mission vary and as such planning and foresight of what needs to be done in sequence is key to ensuring a victory at the end of the road the speed with which you walk through your journey can be managed meaning you don t have to sit and wait till something is build or resources are being mined while you wait on the reports of your scouting parties using sound strategy on resource gathering and keeping people content is a real balance feat requiring your attention every minute you play this game as resources are scarce you must optimise where you can and ensure proper supplies based on the mission s needs it s a builders gatherer manage type of game with consequences based on your decision making so if you re not into building planning etc but rather the smasher hit things on the head this isn t the game for you this game is all about thinking ahead taking in account environmental issues together with the discontent of your people and the strength of your vision leadership the only limits in this game are those created by your mind you can be hard you can be soft or you can mix and match what future will you bring to your people
