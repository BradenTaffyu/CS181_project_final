2019 to be honest it s really hard to write a review for fallout 4 while i agree that it s full of flaws and problems one can t simply rule it out as a bad game as a part of the fallout series it s really lacking role playing aspects have been butchered the dialogue system is straight up disastrous and the main story is really clunky at times as you can t solve issues in several ways like in previous games it also has some lore inconsistencies such as the ability of any character to hop into a suit of power armor without having received any previous training t 60 power armor in general and some lore breaking quests yes i m looking at you and your fridge billy in spite of all of this i really can t bring myself to dislike it fallout 4 has a certain charm that is realling appealing and certain charcters that shine and drastically improve the experience and while some may argue that having a voiced character hindered the experience i disagree i felt that it really put me into the story and made me feel like my character was a bit more believable the new companion system was a welcome change from prevous fallout games as you can bond with them and learn more about their backstory and personalilty as your affinity with them and their approval of you progresses additionally another key aspect that really made fallout 4 stand out from previous was the gameplay the gunplay and the huge variety of weapon customization that was aviable which allows us to adapt nearly all weapons to our preferred style also the survival mode is amazing and i think it s the true way to enjoy the game however the best thing about fallout 4 and the thing that made me play it for more than 500 hours is the mod community where bethesda might get lazy and overlook some details in comes the mod community to save the day and make the game more enjoyable bug fixes fixed and new mechanics custom quests and companions even little tweaks new weapons better visuals if you have thought about it there s probablly a mod that does that already it s reallly amazing overall even with its flaws it s truly a great experience and i d recommend you to give it a shot if it s on sale
