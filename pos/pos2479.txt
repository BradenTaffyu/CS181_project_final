2020 product received for free product was received for free on steam but was purchased on bethesda net they had a program that anyone that bought the game there before the update received the steam version at no cost despite bethesda s mismanagement on features like private servers or the lack of mods for this game i would say that this game is better then fallout 4 as of the wastelanders update now to some that isn t saying a whole lot as fallout 4 left a bad taste in people s mouth and what was arguably the start of the bethesda downfall but it was still an alright fun game just not the game we expected after new vegas which set a really high bar for western rpgs in general fallout 76 wastelanders update really takes a lot of the complaints people had with fallout 4 and 76 and fixed them things like adding npcs and dialogue that are interesting and with a lot more to say then just a bunch of flavors of yes and with a return of skill checks so many skill checks that would make even new vegas blush a decent main quest that doesn t thrust you into the hero role and feel cliche and instead lets you focus on what you wanna do without much urgency and quests that are more fleshed out and seemed like they took time to make instead of just a shooting gallery where you re playing an action hero bugs also got ironed out for the most part especially compared to the disastrous launch but as with pretty much all bethesda games there are still a ton but i would put it somewhere near fallout 4 levels not bad but still present here and there but rarely game breaking anymore fallout 76 feels like an actual game now and not some rushed alpha early access game is this the best fallout game no and you should never expect it to be ever is this a good game at least as of this new update its a very decent game with fun to be had this isn t new vegas 2 but its a better version of fallout 4 now in my opinion if you can scoop it up on sale then i would recommend it 7 10 as of the wastelanders update new main quest is decent now npcs breath a new life into the game really big and varied map with a lot to see tons of enemy types that go from fallout classics to new rad versions of west virginia folklore monsters best display of the ol fallout charm since new vegas still uses the creation engine and in a way it was never meant for graphics are okay but really dated now gameplay is still jank and could be a complete turn off
