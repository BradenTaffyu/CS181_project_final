early access review i bought caves of qud because i was tired of waiting for a proper dwarf fortress adventure mode with graphics i could understand that s finally arrived but caves of qud has set the gold standard for how a modern roguelike interface should look i play the game entirely on my steam deck and the experience of not having a mouse has not been diminished one bit absolutely stellar experience and the game i played most in 2023
