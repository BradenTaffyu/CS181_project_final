2021 the best way to succinctly describe this game is to say that it s a diamond in the rough a shiny gleaning diamond at that if you re looking for a tl dr skip to the verdict at the bottom june 2022 update a massive patch with a new finland dlc is out along with many qol general fixes including a weapon wheel revamped waterfowl mechanics a new map with a total of 19 species vs the previous highest of 10 in vurhonga a new great one bug fixes and more this has breathed much needed life into the game once more it s a huge step forward and one to be applauded pros extremely immersive graphics sound atmosphere all are on point and practically flawless in terms of optimization it s pretty decent not the greatest but not shoddy by any means either there s room for improvement but it can run well on almost everything just don t buy it if you have a subpar laptop there s so much variety in terms of maps and animals you can hunt from africa to siberia and everywhere in between there is a truracs system what this basically means is that racks horns are dynamically and randomly generated so for the most part you won t see 100 identical racks this feature is implemented with all the animals in releases post cuatro colinas but old animals are slowly being revised and having this added beware lions buffalo and wolves all kinds of weapons so you can hunt the way you like bows crossbows rifles handguns shotguns want to get up close and personal with some bowhunting go for it are you too impatient like me and would rather take shots up to 400m with rifles you can no pressure to do anything you set your own pace very laid back and i d even say therapeutic infinite playability it s a sandbox where you never know what s waiting for you out there you might hunt for days and find nothing remarkable only to find an extremely high scoring rare fur type combination of both animal out of nowhere some fur variations are extremely rare so you can sink in thousands of hours trying to find them or maybe a great one each map has a storyline missions you can do but you don t have to do them some give you one of a kind unique animals some unlock a special skin for a gun and it s a good way to get quick money when you start out you can taxidermize your best kills and display them in your trophy lodges there are a lot of plaques and there are many multimounts one quick example is three wolves taking down a mouflon it is immensely satisfying filling up your lodge over time putting the fruition of your labor on display you can invite your friends over and show them dlc maps can be played for free in multiplayer as long as the host owns the map if the host leaves there needs to be at least one person present in the session who owns the map this way you can test out what maps you like the most before purchasing them frequent updates and new content maps animals weapons mechanics being released fun difficult to find easter eggs planted somewhere in some map giving hints for upcoming new content this results in a really fun and engaging hunt for clues within the community check out the official discord mixed virtually no competition in the hunting genre this is the hunting game barring thehunter classic which is a completely different beast if you re not a really hardcore hunter willing to spend a lot of money on a game with mtx and very dated graphics then don t even bother unfortunately the lack of competition indirectly contributes to some of the cons listed further below cons bugs this is a big one new updates and dlc always invariably tend to introduce bugs some of which may be gamebreaking these can range from minor annoyances such as some guns not working properly to some outposts being broken to crashes to animals being unharvestable invisible or animals in your lodge disappearing or getting messed up for this reason i highly recommend turning steam cloud sync off and frequently backing up your saves folder especially before big updates drop so you don t lose anything in your trophy lodge until the issue is fixed mp can be unstable but for the most part has been good recently cost of entry some of the dlc are essential and should be included in the base game imo such as trophy lodges tents and tripods and the quad bike also some of the best weapons are in the weapon packs including the night vision equipment or come with the map dlcs simply put buy it on sale and make sure to grab the aforementioned essentials at the very least as for the maps they are all good in their own ways my recommendation is to grab a couple i would highly suggest yukon valley for the 300 arguably the best big game rifle in addition to the map being stunningly beautiful and vurhonga savannah for its incredible diversity and uniqueness for starters animal ai can be derpy at times definitely room for some work on this final verdict it s not the kind of game for everyone if you re looking for fast paced cod style gameplay this won t satisfy you there will be moments where not much is going on if you re happy with a slower placed game chilling with no pressure being immersed in the wilderness this game will suck up a lot of your time and may consume your life this will satisfy both grinders collectors and casual players because no matter how much you ve played there s always something very rare out there that you haven t caught yet with frequent content updates even further augmenting this the worst thing is the bugs at any one moment the game can be in a playable semi playable or stay the hell away until this get patched state still there s something very special about this game there s nothing else remotely like it and it holds a very special place in my heart i ve tried to be as unbiased as possible with my assessment but i ll just say if you think it sounds appealing i can almost guarantee you will love it especially once you get past the initial learning curve
