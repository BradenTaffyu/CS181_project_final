2016 so this is a fantasy farming town life sim in the ilk of harvest moon so rather then beat around the bush how does it compare farming on par with harvest moon hm some extra details need for scarecrows fencing etc but it s also missing features like the ability to selectively breed superior levels of crops over multiple generations there are some balance concerns but being a pc game those can actually be patched livestock lacks variety and some complexity but is more realistic in some respects for example there s no animal taming just purchasing breeding is in but you don t breed better livestock it just replenishes numbers and is gender blind grooming is more detailed but less hands on the one noteworthy improvement is conceptually allowing and rewarding field rotation relationships superior to hm and it s a fantasy life fl but inferior to rune factory rf i say superior to hm but really it s about on par in terms of the mechanics but with more romance options including same sex it falls behind in terms of character variety depth and interaction compared to the rf series but updates could easily catch up note rf improved on the hm formula is pretty much every way so will be comparing primarily to it now mining on par with rf behind fl one area it is behind in both respects is variety of ores divided by regions stardew valley has 2 locations you can really go mining they have a lot of levels which are divided into different biomes and there s some rng in ore availability on any given trip into the mines but it s still overall more simplistic terms of layout and progression where it really lags behind is the actual mining interaction it s just click on the rock it breaks rng loot lumberjacking this ones complicated as it s been mixed with the concept of foraging lumberjacking by itself it close but still behind rf and way behind fl foraging also adds features such as getting tree seeds off trees for immediate replanting finding seasonal wild plants which you can in turn get seeds for and farm eliminating the wild foraging once you ve completed that seasons set and at certain times of the year collecting berries the other titles has these features coloured grasses and fruit trees etc but they weren t tied to a skill you could improve much room to improve here especially in terms of the mechanics fishing ahead of rf close but still behind fl something that must immediately be pointed out is fishing difficulty isn t staggered so there s an easy progression curve where as in the other games the seasonal fish in the locations you have access to at the start are easy to catch get harder as you unlock more areas and progress to later seasons stardew will throw you in the deep end right at the start before you have any skill plus the rng will throw top level fish at you to kick your butt again again practising the skill and improving equipment alleviates this over time but a lot of people think fishing is impossible starting out as although there are easy fish to catch to start you aren t directed to them and rng can still screw you the mechanics themselves work well once you are on top of them but still more depth that could be added to compare to fl but otherwise quite good combat behind rf and fl there s no real depth to the combat 3 noteworthy weapon types and you ll mostly just use swords plus bombs which you wont use in combat no spells no special moves right click does do an alternate thing like block or ground slam but it s not effective and you will never do it no companions no real footwork just move close and spam attack over and over until enemy dies the only tactical considerations are more frustration with the controls then strategy enemy variety is lacking compared to the others first 80 levels there s only 3 varieties of enemies those who passively stand there ones that charge you grounded or flying and ones that charge you but occasionally block one that burrows to do so for all the above the strategy is pretty much the same maybe dodge hit them before they hit you keep hitting then they add enemies that shoot at you same deal much room for improvement that said the rng nature of the dungeons leaves a lot or potential open for this to be developed further if the dev decided to so crafting way behind rf and fl no weapon armour crafting at all equipment upgrades handled by a shop cooking and deco pieces are just click to create super simplistic and uninteractive that said there is one area of it where it is ahead of both rf and fl decoration in addition to the ability to lay fences paths etc you get to prepare and place the foundation for additional farm buildings rather then the usual fixed locations when you unlock them except your house greenhouse you are free to place a large amount of functional and decorative furniture both craftable collectable largely anywhere you want on the farm to some extent all over the town as well doesn t compare with say ultima or a minecraft terraria clone omission intentional but it s a big step up within this genre festivals far behind rf once you ve seen them once most the time you want to skip festivals in stardew they are mostly just low interaction cut scenes that waste your entire day even when the festival says it will end at 2pm you ll get home at 10pm day over you can t give gifts go shopping or otherwise really interact with the townsfolk in any meaningful way on most festival days and very few of the festivals will attending offer any kind of benefit the townsfolk don t really acknowledge your prowess or even if you attended at all or not story behind rf fl the story is very simple and very lightly applied the one interesting aspect of it is it seems to make a social commentary on small town independents vs corporate growth culture but it s doesn t seem to penalise or judge the player regardless of which they favour it just complements two different playstyles respectively the plot really boils down to if your characters presence improves the lives of the other townsfolk in any noteworthy fashion over the course of 2 years or not the hands off approach is great if you don t want the game jamming plot events down your throat while you want to focus on the farming sim but it means when you are looking for context it is relying entire on the depth of it s character interactions where it is sadly lacking compared to it s rivals these aren t shallow characters but the arcs are short and arbitrary and there is very little individual interaction throughout some scripted events are cool but like the festivals the characters have no real self awareness of how they went down after the fact collection on par or better then rf fl behind animal crossing pgood potential here museum collection will be expanded in updates too art music subjective but good quality regardless overall if you are looking for a story based game with more interactive gameplay mechanics it s a fantasy life is a better choice as far as farming sim specifically goes rune factory has more depth and still stands as personal best in genre i haven t mentioned polish until now as although stardew is behind all competitors this is day 4 since release and there have been no less then 4 patches fixing most major issues and many smaller ones when you consider this game was made by one person with no production studio to cover exhaustive qa it s unsurprising launch has been a little shaky but regular patching will fix this edit largely has an advantage of a pc release do i recommend it absolutely it might not be best in genre but it s a solid entry has the potential to improve and is definitely already the best on the pc platform and by extension steam if the genre appeals to you get it easily worth the money
