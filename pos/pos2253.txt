2021 if you re a fan of the fallout series this map of appalachia is excellent and provides hundreds of hours of gameplay i put 88 hrs into this and have barely started the main story there s just so much to do if like me you want to be a solo player that is entirely possible as i am now at level 34 and have never needed help to complete any missions the game is very forgiving and honestly is an explorer s dream the latest price drop makes this the right time to dive in you won t regret it
