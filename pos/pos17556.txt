2017 bad performance still suffers from the same core issues previous total war games already had support with patches game balancing overall game polishing multiplayer feature ui latency wise sends you back to the year 2003 way too expensive outside of a sale despicable mass dlc marketing still does not have the option to fully skip or properly speed up enemy agent actions as it is still bugged sometimes maps with a lot of forest foliage as well as other specific effects like some spells view angles especially in sieges when looking in the city kill your fps due to engine limitations i can t see any improvements on the ai it is still rather dull falls for the same tricks and oftentimes builds questionable army s even when playing on highest difficulty and hence giving the ai enormous cheat advantages the game still becomes rather easy and boring after surviving the first 75 100 turns river combat got removed there is a mod for it though fortification army encampment fights got removed city combat for cities settlements without walls got removed it now takes place on a battlefield outside of the city sea ship combat got removed in custom mp games and in campaign it got tuned down to auto resolve when combat does happen on sea though there is not much water in the world but still demounting has been removed can t order troops to climb off their horse vehicle monster and walk on foot anymore should have kept it for horse units at least neutral some will like it others will hate it some won t really care rng lots of rng basically everything is a dice roll and you can loose while doing everything correctly just because the dice was in the favor of your opponent addition of god like lords commanders heroes agents basically a single humanoid guy runs into 120 soldiers on foot alone and kills them all or just 2 3 of them cus rng addition of magic spells which also often times is really rng depending in terms of whether the spell hits or not achievements stay enabled if you use mods which can lead to some interesting looking progress lots of status effects from spells or lords heroes like constant charge defence or just additional damage or armour some faction have support units like a banner carrier type that is useless apart of motivation or even giving bonus stats or regeneration to nearby friendly units good finally multi cpu support though it does not make any difference when it comes to core engine problems but it adds a noticeable fps boost overall every race faction is truly unique best campaign so far graphics are really beautiful better than in tw attila and barly require any addition gpu power over it mods workshop though that is more of a community accomplishment overall there is no more onager scorpio with explosive ammunition anymore which recks of a infantry unit with each shot or in other words artillery got nerfed overall and is not the overall best answer against ai addition of flying units from bats harpys up to dragons monster sized ground units like trolls centaurs and giants heroes lords can be customised adding mounts like walk on foot horse flying horse or gryphon dragon and adding removing spells or skills both in campaign and multiplayer i d rate tw warhammer 6 5 10 worth it on a sale with all dlc s the best in its genre so far but the genre is being held back simply because sega is going for quantity over quality like always if they would have actually sat down and fixed as well as polished the game instead of just taking rome attila and re skinning it with some more features tw warhammer could have been the somewhat e sports like title they so desperately wanted warhammer 40k dawn of war 3 to be instead tw warhammer is just a good singleplayer experience with the option to do multiplayer games of which you will grow tired rather quickle due to two major flaws 1 searching loading a mp game takes almost as long as actually playing it 2 you will almost always end up with 1 2 seconds delay
