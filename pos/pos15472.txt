2022 i ve been playing this game for a minute and one thing they should add is gaskets water pump gaskets valve cover gaskets head gaskets etc etc not to mention brake lines sensors like oxygen sensors wouldn t be too hard to add just my opinion i feel like a car mechanic simulator should have a hard mode and easy mode but this is stuck on easy could be better but it s fine
