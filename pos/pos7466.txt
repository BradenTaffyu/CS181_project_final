2021 early access review reading about the negative reviews talking about mundane repetitiveness are you serious nearly every game on this planet has some mundane repetitive tasks to do most game concepts are completey based on it and you start whining about that look at games like fortnite or other boring af games they have updates yes but except shooting or killing the other player you do nothing else or when did you ever start growing watermelons in fortnite when did you dive down into deeper waters to find parts for your zipline when did you start building your own raft and tried to fend of animals from the very thing that keeps you alive f the f off with that bs arguement nearly every game is based on repetitiveness it s called the gameplay loop you can say the gameplay loop would be bad but you can t complain that it has one if that is really that much of an issue to you that the game has one you might wanna stop gaming all together and go outside more jfcthe game is absolutely fine it gave me hours and hours of fun and it has a lot to explore by now but i can absolutely agree that the devs need to speed up development a bit with it 3 years later and we just got the next chapter that is really meager still come from a time where the game ended at the whiteboard so i can say that i waited a long time myself to see some more content
