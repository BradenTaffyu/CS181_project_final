2021 early access review imo this is the pinnacle of zombie games you can create so many interesting scenarios that you will find yourself asking in them oh how do i not die right now the game has a very healthy modding community on steam that you can use to fine tune the zombie expierience that you want hell even vanilla has so many custimization settings change anything from zombie type to loot rarity to horde density do you want classic ghouls like night of the living dead no problem you want sprinting zombies that mimic dawn of the dead you got it bud you want a mix of sprinting and shambling zeds do you even need to ask what about super zombies that are harder and stronger than superman but their isnt alot of zombies or how about thousands upon thousands upon thousands that go down easier than a kid with terberculosis i think you get the picture im painting this is hands down the best zombie sim game ever released that will satisfy your loot cravings open world cravings and your masochistic cravings if you want a hard game cant praise this game enough still amazing and continued updates from the devs
