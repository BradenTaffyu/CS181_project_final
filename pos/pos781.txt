2017 i absolutely love this game i will start off by listing some reasons to why i am obsessed with this great game 1 the graphics are in a style that are sort of modern retro pixel art 2 the gameplay is amazing even though you are just farming and walking around it never feel repetitive except for winter before the greenhouse 3 for the cheap price you are getting quite the full game here 4 the music is spot on and makes you feel relaxed 5 you can play the game at your own pace making it more of a luxury to play than the attention hogging games of today 6 there is so much to do from farming to making your own family all within this fairly small gameworld 7 the writing in this game is pretty good honestly there are moments where you really feel connections with the npc s in the game at one point i felt bad for one of them where it got to the point that i would talk to them more than my love interest all in all this game is a pretty good time passer when i played this time flew no matter what i did besides fishing it isn t a bad part of the game i just couldn t get use to the mechanic i would rate this game a 10 10 even with the bothersome winters and the weird fishing mechanic but this game is definitely worth the 15 00 an even better deal would be to get it on sale
