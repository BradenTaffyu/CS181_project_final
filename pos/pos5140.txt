2016 phylosophical partthis review won t be about lagging dialogs neverending minutemen quests or missing npcs i m sure you ve seen enough of such reviews i ve seen it all but i don t care this game is a sort of food for brain after i finished it for the second time i started to wish to learn more about physics robotics biology and radiation i had to think much about what if we could live in such world killed by never changing war this game every part of the series i have to say should be looked at from different sides it s not just about the gameplay or about love in a separated family not just about another one journey this one is really about the war about the world about the responsibility about the fact how happy we are here staying alive safe and sound meeting rads just once a year when taking a fluoroscopy procedure this is a game that questions us who are we seriously what are we supposed to be where does the future lead us and do we truly believe we can handle all the world humankind destroys itself painfully with the atomic annihilation why did someone ever decide he can write a scenario for every single human under the atomic rocket we try to create we play gods every day development and improvement of technology and ammunition makes us feel stronger but in all this masquerade aren t we a development of something bigger can t we be called machines as well why do we judge our creations when we ourselves are no better than what we made to this world the biological systems bodies made of blood and bones have organics given us our souls and why can t a metal heart beat in a rhythm of an average man s one what is love and what part of a body exactly makes a human brain feel what we call love if a synthetic body can feel hurt without a knife cut who are we to decide whether they can feel or not we believe in something being told to us we choose our paths from existing ones but shouldn t we just look wider can t we move side by side with those we ve given lives to can t we bring a new peace to this damn world this world that suffered so much from the war war never changes so maybe it s time for us to change
