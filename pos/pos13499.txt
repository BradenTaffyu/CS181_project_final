2016 kerbal space program is truly something unique how do you market a game about rocket science the default analogy for something extremely complicated to an audience big enough to justify your budget well there s a lot of little things that make it playable to many people first of all it s a make your own experience sandbox just like minecraft before there was an end there s no final goal no objective arrow it s just you an bunch of spaceship parts a few kerbals a custom solar system the infinite expanse of space and explosions lots and lots of explosions second of all this game about rocket science isn t about all of rocket science there s quite a lot of liberty taken with the laws of physics all in the name of simplicity you don t have to worry about fuel flow or life support or the speed of light delay all of that is benched in favor of less subtle things like orbital mechanics atmospheric shock heating and look this up it s practically ksp 101 delta v and tsiolkovsky rocket equation but here s the best part all of these ignored facets of space travel can be added into the game ksp has a very robust and active modding community and i m sure enough mods exist to make the game as realistic as you could possibly demand life support there s a mod for that several actually in varying degrees of difficulty fuel flow part of realism overhaul speed of light delay check out remotetech there are even mods that replace the stock solar system with our very own real system and even mods that add entirely new dreamed up systems i highly recommend starting out with no mods then adding them as you become comfortable with what you already have really kerbal space program is great for the same reason minecraft is great it expects nothing in particular of you it just wants you to do whatever comes to mind if that means strapping a hundred boosters together as randomly as possible and watching the fireworks that s fine if that means methodically landing on every planet and moon one by one that s fine if that means brutally murdering your kerbals well heck they re just as surprised to be alive as you are so go for it
