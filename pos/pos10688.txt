2021 world war ii a creepy but very meaningful episode in our modern history the war went as it went but what if things had gone differently everyone interested in war has their own theories that are really a bit difficult to test but in video games oh boy the games at the swedish paradox interactive have always had reputation deservedly so as so often at other times reputation is not unambiguous on the one hand games have always been considered fascinating comprehensive and downright excellent strategy games on the other hand they have a reputation as games that require at least a bachelor s level of dedication to learn hearts of iron 4 is an epic strategy game where the player takes over one of the countries of the world on the eve of world war ii the big lines are set in stone whatever happened nazi germany and the free world take one way or another together but everything a little smaller varies greatly from game to game the stories are the reason why hearts of iron 4 is such a great game although it does not contain similar procedural story events stories must always be created when playing sometimes the stories are great sometimes the humor is caused by the small and larger weirdness of the game in general however they are fascinating interesting but in order to enjoy them you have to do quite a lot of work hearts of iron 4 is a very comprehensive heavy and versatile strategy game even before the first shots are fired and of course it is not desirable because as important as the actions taken after the outbreak of war at least as important is how to prepare for war if the country is not ready for war in structure and attitude the experience will be harsh one of the most interesting ideas is the national focus that is in practice the individual talent tree for each country it relies on historical events and ideas but also on fictitious what if scenarios for example the british ruler may focus on strengthening the empire and colonial activity or on securing the home island and preparing the people for defense equally one can invest in modern naval strategies the development of armored forces or secret and experimental weapons projects i think the balance is great it gives the player the freedom to try out the ideas and alternative strategies they want but still forces you to live according to the situation and layout of the game the same thinking extends to those technologies as well as attractive as it could be even to start a german nuclear weapons project as early as 1936 and to puppet the whole world the basic unit of hearts of iron is a division which can be of several types they can be designed quite freely and also trained freely the player s responsibility for warfare is related to the big lines you assemble armies navies and squadrons from your division assigning them commanders and areas of operation missions and battle plans after that you then cross your arms and sit in excitement about how the fight is going the backbone of the ground forces is the combat plans which allow the player to define army specific front lines attack directions and targets retreat routes defensive fronts and other details the ai commanders will then use their best endeavors to carry out the plans using the equipment in use and the military doctrine of the country basically the battlefield is the whole world sometimes of course you see surprising stuff like the french village apparently sipping asterix s magic potion defending the last man in his province against a superior german army pros momentum a ton of playability attachment to history lots of decisions to make cons a very steep learning curve with hearts of iron 4 it really gets to you it s downright fantastic game it is exciting entertaining varied and profound it challenges and it hooks a very steep learning curve is likely to cram many potential players away from the very first meters and frustrate the rest often and properly however this does not change the fact that hearts of iron iv is a must see play for anyone interested in history and world war ii 9 2 10
