2021 early access review obviously the game is primarily focused on rebuilding an old beat up 4 cylinder car the satsuma based on the datsun 100a there s hundreds of parts to assemble several sections of the engine are simplified such as the gearbox which is one giant piece and is ready to go as soon as you install it other parts have more detail such as the camshaft cam sprocket timing chain crankshaft pistons spark plugs and many more all being individual parts you can potentially install in an incorrect order making you think hard about your decisions honestly it s probably the most immersive game i ve ever played it s both overly frustrating and relaxing at the same time it s not often you play a game that is so immersive that you find yourself thoroughly enjoying one of many mundane tasks such as grocery shopping and neatly stacking your supplies on shelves or not if you prefer to leave things in disarray d there s so much bs in the game but the core loop of making money ordering parts and building tuning your car is so rewarding it makes you fall in love with the inane parts of the game as well with all that said i don t recommend any new players to play the game without the msceditor mod it s just an editor tool that in short preserves your sanity so you keep discovering the beauty this game has i only recommend to use the editor as a failsafe when things are beyond something you re willing to do like wait in jail for literal real life hours or reimbursing yourself money for a ticket because you didn t understand how to comply with the police lol or teleporting an item back to you that fell through the map overall if you are a car enthusiast fan of the datsun a masochist or are really into life simulators i highly recommend this game i was none of these things when i bought the game but now maybe i m all of these things after playing
