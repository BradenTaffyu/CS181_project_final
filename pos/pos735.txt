2017 i remember buying my very own copy of harvest moon for the gameboy color at a second hand shop back in 1999 the music story mechanics and just overall features of the game made me feel warm and fuzzy inside as if i was in my own little universe with nothing to care about other than watering my crops and feeding my chickens stardew valley takes me back to that very own headspace only better while still maintaining the crucial elements of classic roleplay games to spike your nostalgia nothing i can say about this title hasn t been featured over and over again somewhere else just trying to add to the general consensus that stardew valley is an absolute delight even at its original price 13 99 as of today it is 100 worth the investment if you re not sure whether it s your cup of tea try getting it on sale prices go down often and well into their 50 s
