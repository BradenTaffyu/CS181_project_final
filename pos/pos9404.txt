2016 assetto corsa is to me the shell of a perfect racing game and with more time and money i can see it being a truly incredible product the physics handling track quality and as such general racing immersion of ac is a level above other racing titles like forza gran turismo or project cars rfactor may offer better physics i haven t tried it ac may be behind some of the above on graphics and ai and is definitely behind forza and gt on car and track selection and the depth of the career mode so you have to figure out what you want in a game due you want fidelity to real life with accurate simulation of each car precise aerodynamic and drivetrain calculations and laser scanned tracks or do you want to be able to drift around corners without sacrificing lap times do you want a false sensation of speed or an accurate introduction to cornering and car weight distribution do you want top level ai and reward intensive career progression or are you happy endlessly lapping empty tracks looking for slight improvements in your cornering technique i much prefer the later but i don t mean to disparage those who enjoy the former i ve spent my last 30hrs in game lapping one track zandvoort in the netherlands with one car the mclaren 650s gt3 and the experience has been hugely enjoyable as i try to approach race car driver speeds which i m sure i m far off currently only the 5th fastest on rsr for that combination the feel of laser scanned track through the force feedback is incredible the handling dynamics superb and the complexity and precision of high speed racing is endlessly fascinating to me if you want to genuinely feel the sensation of racing a well modelled 458 or a mclaren p1 or a gt3 or f1 car through spa or the nurnburgring this is a near perfect way to do it short of somehow renting one if you re a fan of driving buy ac and invest in developing technique if you re a fan of arcade style multiplayer or the quick fun of frantic drifting buy something else highly recommended from someone looking forward to the new car releases in may and june if they can add some american and japanese tracks expand the list of road cars continue to tinker with the ai and maybe eventually develop a solid career mode then this will be a perfect racing game
