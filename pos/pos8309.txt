2019 highly recommended but with a small flaw after 80ish hours of gameplay by that point though you ll definitely have gotten your money s worth good stuff first it s a fantastic city builder and it includes survival mechanics so you feel like you re playing tug of war with the arctic weather racing to complete one more milestone before things get colder so you can survive another day the atmosphere apocalyptic steampunk is wonderful and the game s mechanics work incredibly well the building system even manages to soothe my city building perfectionism because it will slightly adjust building sizes to make sure you re using every available inch with no ugly gaps between buildings the scenarios are challenging the stories are compelling there s lots of replay value and you can easily put a hundred hours into this game wonderful devs too who have released a ton of free content and updates since the game released a year ago the one minor flaw to this game is that after you complete it on normal difficulty you move to the hard and extreme difficulty levels those difficulties are completely unbalanced and you wind up needing to follow an ironclad beginning build order that takes advantage of how the game is coded to prevent your city from going into a death spiral for instance in the first 30 seconds of the winterhome scenario you might need to sign a law and then build a medical tent but if you place the med tent first and then sign the law 20 people will die this wouldn t be so bad but from what i ve seen online these build orders are checklists for the first 1 2 hours of a city the game stops being fun for me when you have to spend that long with a razor thin margin where you re not even making your own decisions of what to do next the good news is that the normal difficulty level is perfectly balanced and you ll get 80ish hours of gameplay out of it also with how responsive the devs have been it s possible they may tweak the difficulty levels to make the harder difficulties more playable tl dr you ll love this game and should buy it normal difficulty is perfect and will last you 80 hours but the harder difficulties are almost broken
