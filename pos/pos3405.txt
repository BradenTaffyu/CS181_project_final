2017 product received for free before i get into the game i ll start off by saying that my friends played it almost as soon as it came out one of them maybe even helped kickstart it i don t know for sure i thought they were cringy as hell they bought it for me but i refused to play it for like a year and a half or something like that i thought it was gonna be so overrated and that it was going to bore me to sleep hell i really only played it because i wanted some of the trading cards that would come with it so i could get cs go cases i honestly thought i d just play it and be done but i have never been more wrong in my entire lifethis game literally changed my outlook on life in general the story is amazing so long as you keep an open mind the soundtrack was phenomenal the songs perfectly portrayed what was going on in the story especially when big story events happened my only recommendation for playing this game would be to spare every monster before you try any of the other ways to play if you re anything like me it will change you over all undertale has become one of my favorite story driven games ever i haven t felt this attached to a fictional story in years undertale s fanbase is cringy hell you probably think i m cringy just by reading this however if you are in any way curious about this game just try it go into it keeping an open mind and maybe you ll love it as much as i did tl dr i thought this game was gonna be trash but it was actually really good and i loved it
