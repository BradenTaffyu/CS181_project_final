2021 one of the best strategy games i ever played it s hard to learn at first but when you spend some time playing it it s worth it graphics amazing gameplay crazy good down sides are only that you cant play characters from total war warhammer 1 on vortex and its not that nice looking like first game 9 10 for vermintide yes yes
