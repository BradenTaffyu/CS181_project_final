2021 early access review i played a lot of factorio and other similar games in the past and so far dyson sphere program has been a nice refreshing game for this genre wonderful graphics smooth gameplay and all in all a great experience especially for an early access games kudos the the small developer team would recommend in my opinion dyson sphere program is a lot more friendly towards new players coming to the factory automation genre for the first hours it can look a bit overwhelming but the further you progress the easier and more enjoyable it gets just seeing as everything comes together have completed 2 dyson spheres on my first save while also running the classic 30 white science sec setup starting over new with some mods this time
