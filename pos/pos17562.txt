2017 after playing this game for the amount of time i have i feel the compelling urge to add my voice to the conflicted screaming masses that compose the steam reviewing section yes creative assembly is a company yes the dlc is overpriced yes they have not at this time added in tomb kings game breaking i know but that s the thing beastmen wood elves even chaos none of these races are necessary to enjoy the game the base four races are easily superior the empire is easily the most fun you will have with this game vampire counts as a close second people gripe endlessly about the 70 price range when you re not forced by any means to buy any of the dlc total war warhammer is a fresh take on the total war series adding a welcome fantasy twist to a usually historical setting the game itself is extremely polished with each faction equipped with their own unique strengths and weaknesses graphically the game is beautiful gameplay wise the unit roster is cut down to only necessary units augmented with heroes and monstrous creatures the excessive tedium of endless siege battles that blighted past titles have been removed thank god almost rpg esque elements of skill points and loot grab have been added into the formerly dull commander system extensive mod support is featured adding a welcome aspect of replayability overall this is absolutely the best game that the total war series has cranked out so far the mixed rating you see on the store page this purchase is totally worth it
