2023 ok after 68 hours in this game it s time to weigh in tldr the game is genuinely fun and needs tweaks and balancing in its simulation the good amazing road tools a great step forward with transit lines and outside connections zoning improvements and building upgrades make scaling your city feel more satisfying and realistic the bad high density zoning needs re scaling hard to understand the real impacts of the goods production system and buildings complaining of rent and input costs building upgrades are cool but lock you in too tightly final thoughts this game fixed the structural limitations of cs1 and most of what it needs now is in balancing and optimization i m looking forward to years of innovative building i have my own hopes for improvement that i will save for the end of this post at this stage i m still invested in learning all the mechanics and exploring the intricacies of scaling my city before i get to what i like and dislike do not fall prey to comparisons of this game to your dlc and mod stuffed cs1 people have amnesia as to just how limited cs1 was and still is it was basically a decent traffic simulator with flexible road creation cities skylines 2 is so much more right from the start and here s why 1 the new road tools are amazing you are only limited by your imagination most of the mod tools are present straight slope seems to work by default if you manipulate the elevation step the more i started customizing my own junctions the more utilized the various snap toggles i honestly can t envision how mods can improve this much 2 transit lines are excellent the new depot system adds a whole new challenge and element of realism drawing a line for all routes both cargo and transportation seems like an obvious step forward and removes the ambiguity around how the game generates vehicles and routes it s true that if you create a route without equivalent demand you will get a lot of empty vehicles this isn t a game breaking bug vehicles will simply go through their paces until you manually reduce the number or demand fills them up this is working fine for me 3 zoning and demand are vastly improved the ability to overwrite zones enables you to grow your city much more naturally by increasing density when and where it is needed also the new zone types and rci demand stratification gives you much more granularity in how the city develops the separation of office from industrial demand is a no brainier the three residential densities are also separate but interrelated allowing you to focus on density or sprawl or to get the advantages of both 4 building upgrades and operational districts enable you to manage growth without having to construct new service buildings or arbitrarily move them this also allows you to scale effectively and customize the uniformity or urban village style development these are just a few of the good things i ve found with cs2 what i enjoy the most is the universally improved way that you grow and scale your city being able to replace zones expand roads upgrade buildings and adjust transit efficiency all work so seamlessly together to turn your city core from a hamlet to a metropolis in cs1 you had to start every new neighborhood from scratch this was always my biggest frustration which has been addressed in cs2 from the start now on to things i don t like so much 1 bad high density scaling true even with larger maps we still won t get anywhere near 1 1 scale with an actual city but the number of workers per office is absurdly low a 40 story building will have barely 100 workers in it in real life it could be in the hundreds or thousands in terms of its practical impact on my city i m currently building out the neighborhoods and suburbs 60k pop with a lot more room to grow and i ve already effectively maxed out the workplace availability in my downtown office district when i expand my city i ll have to focus on industry or multiple high density office cores just to generate enough workplaces this big leap to skyscrapers seems more oriented to aesthetic goals but i want to see my city transform through different stages here s what needs to happen co needs to create a lot more models for mid size office buildings vastly though not 100 realistically increase the number of workers and tweak the demand calculations to emphasize the construction of shorter high density buildings when there is more available spread therefore increasing pressure to build up when there are fewer areas left to upzone this could also be simulated by adding a medium density office zone type but i would like to see this influenced directly by demand and availability of workers 2 let them fail i ve seen a lot of posts about the lack of integration in the goods and production system this is all very concerning though i can t directly verify the problem industry and commercial certainly seem to run as intended for the most part but my guess is that the handicap that developers built into the base of the game allowing industry and commercial to function basically without inputs remember in the developer diaries when they said you could play the simulation as intensely as you wanted in effect allows buildings to become perpetually distressed without failing i ve still not seen any building vacate or business fail because of high rent low customers or high cost of raw materials so when should i start caring about distressed businesses here s what needs to happen co needs to fix the goods vacuum problem but should also introduce a proper hard mode that makes businesses more tightly dependent on transportation and pricing factors for raw materials and goods show us the real impacts of failing businesses supply chain bottlenecks and unemployment this may make starting a city a lot more challenging but i say bring it on 3 building upgrades are great but pretty please liberate us from adjacency requirements for extensions and let us demolish them without tearing down the whole building this is a pretty dumb move one of the best things about cs1 dlcs was the freedom of building campuses for airports universities and parks i sort of understand reintroducing cs1 vanilla plop ability but for bigger buildings and projects it gets quite boring and limits the player from properly building neighborhoods around big assets like the university you want to challenge us with extra large lot sizes fine but for extension buildings at least let us place rotate demolish and adjust them more freely here s what needs to happen simply let players snap extensions either to the parent building or to another road within a certain radius you are already limiting us to a radius for resource extractor buildings that way when the developers or modders add more extension options you can still get some of the enjoyment of customizing your own campus areas while obeying the developer s original vision for the upgrade extension system as it stands upgrades and extensions work much better for smaller service buildings like police stations and clinics than for larger heavier assets like the university 4 little things citizens are too happy crime is too low it s so easy to make money i couldn t spend it all if i tried traffic ai can be derpy and needs a tune up need to stock up on more building models to diversify designs and vary density can we have workers commute from out of town not just tourists final thoughts i m not going to review bomb this game i genuinely enjoy it and it is utterly superior to its predecessor in every way i can think of what exactly is it about cs1 that we idealize so much that it was stable in terms of where cs1 started this game is on a different planet
