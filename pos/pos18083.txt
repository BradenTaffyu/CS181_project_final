2018 a solid entry in the total war franchise despite its super buggy and lackluster launch r2 has evolved into one of the best tw games i ve played going back as far as shogun 1 the factions are wonderfully varied and the map is huge it s also fantastic to see that creative assembly are still supporting this game with recent and upcoming patches the recent politics update created a greater depth than previous and made the game far more challenging definitely grab this if you enjoy tw games and have even a remote interest in the roman era
