2022 this is truly a phenomenal game community is by far one of the friendliest and helpful i have found a buddy and i have sunk 100 s of hours into this game when we were both extremely skeptical the world is beautiful and i have never cared for photography system in any game but this is the exception with a truly ingenious idea of making your snapshots as a loading screen so you can remember all the awesome things you have seen and done i ve also never been very passionate about base building but fo76 again has caused me to spend so much more time creating and crafting a cool home that i can share with other players there is so much to this game and so many secret easter eggs that you will just stumble upon by chance regardless of its rocky launch this will stay as one of my fondest gaming memories for 10 this game is an absolute steal and the subscription only adds some quality of life aspects you could spend 100 s of hours happily playing all the quests and story lines without spending anymore than your initial purchase
