2019 after really enjoying the first game my co op partner and i immediately jumped into the sequel at first i had some trouble adjusting to the changes i very much missed the more colorful fairytale atmosphere and kirill pokrovsky s catchy soundtrack eventually it grew on me and i started liking it just as much as the first one despite a more streamlined skill system and a completely new armor mechanic it is much more complex mostly because they balanced the game around always having a fixed number of action points though seriously take one point in scoundrel and then take the pawn talent you ll thank me later the fights are overall more interesting though of course they still often go hilariously sideways in typical d os fashion but the fun is working around the chaos you are creating for yourself this time the characters are much more developed the narrative stuff was apparently a complaint for the first game while i disagree i see why people thought that way but yeah if d os1 was more of a fairytale this sequel is a bit more gritty though it still retains much of the charm there are six written characters with predetermined origin stories which you can either play yourself or recruit as companions they re all very developed but it seems like if you want to get the most narrative out of them you ll want them as a companion my party is the red prince me a custom elf my partner lohse and fane i can only speak for their stories but wow they are really good especially lohse s anyway to more or less write what i already wrote about the first game this game feels like playing a really good dungeons dragon campaign if i didn t know better i would have thought it was an official d d game in fact there is a separate game master mode which you can do very d d things with it s really advanced while the mechanics still work extremely well allow for a lot of experimentation and interesting level design i felt like the game this time did not do as much of a good job guiding us towards a good party composition however it turns out you can re spec at almost any time for free again we chose the easier difficulty explorer mode there s normal mode and easiest story mode as well as a hard setting tactician mode despite the easier difficulty we still had trouble with some fights but on the other hand we didn t have to constantly think is this the 100 right 100 optimal decision and go for fun stuff even more roleplay ish decisions games are more interesting when they allow you to exist within failure states without it instantly feeling like you ve just ruined your own fun play this game all the way through with your significant other or your best friend or even three of your best friends you will not regret it
