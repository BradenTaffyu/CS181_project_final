2015 recovering from the initial bout of disappointment and lack of excitement i can confidently reassure you that fallout 4 is in fact a good game and improves on previous bethesda games while taking some steps back in other areas from the much improved models and graphics compared to fallout 3 and new vegas to the smoother gunplay with firearms and the extensive crafting system this game is in terms of mechanics a welcoming leap forward for the fallout series the beautifully crafted world which thankfully doesn t look brown for the majority of it is packed with details and it will compel you to spend quite some time in it whenever you stumble upon a deserted town or exterminate an entire raider camp you ll either be left wondering how everything was like before the bombs fell or read small stories of the woes and struggles of others before you or both point in case is the world is just as rich as you d expect from a bethesda game and you ll be sinking in a lot of time trying to discover every nook and cranny of it there are other pros to this game but i d like to let you discover and experience them on your own however i think it d be important to get the cons out of the way right now the dialogue tree is by far the worst offender limited to 4 options at a time and no clear sentences or subtitles displaying what your character will actually say when choosing a dialogue branch feels oversimplified and really takes away from the fallout experience the dialogue camera while better no lock on mode like it used to be in skyrim still has some issues when switching to cinematic mode which would usually be a minor nuisance but it does break the flow npcs are a lot duller too and i found that talking to them again after the initial first time will get you stuck in the same dialogue over and over not an issue only bethesda suffers from but their games suffer from it the most while the crafting system is a welcoming addition especially for people who aren t comfortable with modding their games and y know console players after sinking 2 3 days straight into the crafting system building an outpost in sanctuary take a look at my screenshots to see the result it ultimately did fall short on a number of occasions there are a lot of assets missing that are almost a basic necessity for buildings no windows inner walls and doorways and no bathroom sinks the controls are okay but for someone who has used skyrim s creation kit it did feel extremely basic and limited there s also a building limit so don t expect to turn sanctuary into a metropolis when playing a vanilla game i had to change the maximum building limit with console commands in order to get my sanctuary to look like the way it looks now nevertheless if you re willing to dive into the crafting system you ll be pleasantly surprised and it ll be a good window for anyone interested to make their own mods until the g e c k comes out that is but not without overcoming certain hurdles as a conclusion i d say that if you enjoy bethesda games then you ll enjoy fallout 4 if you enjoyed fallout 1 and 2 but also enjoyed fallout 3 and new vegas you ll enjoy fallout 4 even if you only enjoyed skyrim you ll enjoy fallout 4 if you only enjoyed fallout 1 and 2 and think bethesda is ruining the fallout franchise because ermagerd bethesda are sucking on casuals and console plebs then though luck bethesda owns the franchise and does what it wants with it and it certainly doesn t look like they have any intention of going back to isometric fallout 1 and 2 gameplay my point is don t let the die hard fallout fanboys coerce you into not buying this game unless you re a die hard fan yourself lol the game is bethesda s latest and greatest and aside from some issues and the dialogue wheel you ll be thoroughly enjoying the latest installment to the fallout franchise
