2016 lemme help u buddy a screenshot of dark souls iii by astral rage prepare to die wait i mean sipif dark souls 2 wasnt fast enough for you maybe dark souls 3 is its like baby between bloodborne ds2 cutting itself out of the womb with a greatsword enchanted with dark magic essentially it has fixed lot of the issues i had with dark souls 2 such as lack of shops to sell items to better hub zone faster combat better graphics and better multiplayer system without stupid soul memory system dark souls 3 is actually still rather hard game but i slightly feel there is more casual elements or perhaps the word is convenient to it like making the game more linear rather than this giant hub where you try to decide where you start like in ds2 playing in multiplayer will drop the difficulty quite much and make it easier for you if you can t do it on your own also i have to praise the things that they improved on the character creator great darkness lot of cool different weapons with different playstyles game offers atleast 40h of gameplay along with newgame you probably are bound to get around 100h bunch of sidebosses and secrets to unveil unforgiving game and offers real challenge multiplayer aspect is great and fun level design is rather great and you can see the castles and places from highground and the world is connected well in geographical levelthe bad stuff the game doesn t really tell you how to complete the side quests and what decisions to do at certain stages which forces you to look wiki or google for answers and guides you still cant compare the gear you buy from merchants to ones you are wearing right now its not that hard to do guys story exists but its rather hidden on item descriptions the game does little to nothing to tell you about it and even bosses dont really give any dialogue with exception of two however the game really isn t about the story atleast not for me some internet issues exist on the pc side of the servers
