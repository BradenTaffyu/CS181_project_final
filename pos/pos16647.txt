2021 early access review liked it for its ultimate tediousness also dislike it for its horrendous tediousness you need to get rid of some ocd tendencies to play this game or you are going to be like me stuck just arranging groceries for 2 hours of irl time a lot of preparations needed before even getting to start building the car just massive details some are unnecessary some are very welcome in getting to build the car itself also you can only hold one thing at a time its like the character only has one hand that contributes to the tediousness a heck of a lot i also wish there was some kind of on screen tutorial for certain things like the coffee brewing for example i spent a real half hour of life figuring out how to get the coffee to the mug
