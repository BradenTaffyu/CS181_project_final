numbers go up dopamine triggers repeat balatro has great overall design which rewards the player for experimenting with every joker and deck type i found this to be a great game to play in short bursts at times when my personal life was very busy i would recommend this to anyone that enjoys deck building roguelikes such as slay the spire or monster train
