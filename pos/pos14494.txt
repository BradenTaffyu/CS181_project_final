2021 early game 10 10 every decision matters a lot in early game and the exploration is fun mid game 7 10 it s starting to drag here and you can start ot see where the game will go late game 4 10 the game is almost always decided at this point and each round is too long i often don t bother with late game the load times is poorly optimized as well
