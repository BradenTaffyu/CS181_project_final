2020 at first glance it might look likse some anime xcom mixed with finalfantasy tactics without a failstate the latter is what i absolutely enjoy xcom made me so anxious to know i could loose the entire game if i failed certain missions resulting in me playing in easy mode which was underwhelming this game you can fail but you can try again you can freely adjust the difficulty at any time recover from a loss and try out new things switch stuff around while the game takes some time to unlock characters and the story so far isn t blowing minds especially for the price it s entertaining enough and it s supposed to be only the first arc meaning the story can go lot s of places later an plus it has quite a roster of quirky and fun characters all with their unique abilities on top of the seemingly absurd amount of masteries to play with
