2021 preordered tricentennial edition review as of 17 8 2021 dd mm yyyy server not responding issue is fixedstuck on workbench issue is fixed basically fallout 4 but online would recommend those who quit the game on launch to give it another try as it is way better now compared to launch has a battleroyal called nuclear winter which i heard its quiet dead now personally don t care about pvp character creation is the same as fallout 4 combat gameplay first person third person shooter whacker hit detection hit lag is present you can shoot the enemy and the hp will pop back to full back the hp it has for sm reason that is not cool at all but its way better on launch where melee is almost useless back then because melee attacks arent connected detected turn on pacifist mode default on to prevent accidentally damaging random players first you deal decreased damage to players and if they shoot back full pvp is engaged killing players will put a bounty on your head which any players can kill you to earn caps random events occur from time to time where you can earn general to specific rewards currently 2 endgame bosses scorchbeast and earl williams that spawns when players nuke specific locations on the map game can be completed solo but best to join a team as it provides intelligence bonus for more xp when you kill or complete quests teammates dont need to be nearby for this bonus main quest progression is not shared with others as the team leader can enter a specific location and teammates can opt to help the team leader complete the quest solo bunch of side quest to do by exploring reading posters listen to holotapes in game perk system is the same as fallout 4 but introduces the legendary perk system each level till level 50 gives you a perk point to assign into your s p e c i a l strength perception endurance charisma intelligence agility luck with a cap of 15 for each of it assign perk cards and also share them if your charisma level is high enough after level 50 you can get more perk cards to either use them for your different build or scrap them for perk coins to level legendary perk cards slot up to 6 legendary perk cards as you hit specific levels 50 100 150 200 300 level legendary cards up to 3 times with perk points 50 100 150 build your own base with the c a m p put down a vendor and you can sell your items gear plans to other players store your stuff in the stash in game with a whooping 1200 space obviously not enough for hoarders stash is not shared with other characters you create so you can use them as pack mules if u so desire more storage gear wise early game you dont have to worry about crafting and just equip whatever you loot as you level max level cap for gear is level 45 50 after that you will need to roll for legendary effects ranging from 1 3 star legendary enemies drop legendary gear for you or you can craft your own legendary with legendary modules and legendary cores legendary cores can be earn by completing quests while modules are earned by selling scrip weapons to a special vendor any train stations for scrips to buy legendary modules from the purveyor at the rusty pick online game related mechanics systems or wtv u call it present in game battlepass called the scoreboard is present which you complete daily and weekly quest to gain xp to level it up earn special skins currency

access to scrapbox unlimited junk storage survival tent can be placed anywhere for free in addition to the c a m p you have placed in the world private world host your own server for your friends to play around progression is shared with adventure mode special ranger armor attire new vegas baby 2 special emotes subscription imo is only worth when you can no life grind for junk overall mainly because of the hp hit lag thingy game aint worth the full money its an mmo and even after years of updates and patches they still cant fix that hp crap community in game is really nice with the exception that there is no ingame chat if you have no microphone you can only emote gesture your way with other players if you like looting rare items and trash whacking shooting pew pew lazers blow stuff up and currently praying to rngeesus for various reasons this game is for you thank you for reading till the end of this really disorganized review hope you have a good day ad victoriam
