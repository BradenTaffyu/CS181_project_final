2023 i am definitely late to the party this game has been out for a while now but i ll be damned if it doesn t hold up in every way possible as a long time fan of the franchise i ve been waiting to see how things have changed and they have changed a lot compared to gow i ii iii this game moves gow from the classic idk i m stronk hack n slash everyone to more of a wait hang on i need to take some time here contemplative challenge the challenges presented are the right level of difficulty to be truly rewarding when completed i just have to say as a final note go w has always captured my heart in terms of the story telling aspect and this instalment has given me the strongest emotional reaction that i ve had playing through this franchise to date somehow you santa monica studios have made me fall in love all over again mad props to literally every single soul on the production team love it
