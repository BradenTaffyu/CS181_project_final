2014 being an avid arma 2 wasteland dayz player back in the day about 1 5 years ago i relished the thought of a new arma coming out arma 2 was practically uknown until it s popularity was increased by dayz i found it interesting to jump into a bi bohemia interactive title that already had a steady fan base behind it having been about a year since i purchased this game launch and over 100 hours of solid gameplay i feel that i can finally write a review that encompasses many of the aspects i have experienced within this game now i know what you re thinking 59 99 this isn t even considered a triple a title that s like that s like the price of cod ghosts now don t be intimidated by this price for i can say that off the bat this game is worth a lot more than 59 99 from a value perspective i found the price to be very reasonable based on the game s content nowadays basically arma is a series of hardcore military simulation constantly reflecting real world conditions into a video game in arma 2 i feel that this was it s drawback for there were certain scenarios where it was realistic to a point of frustration breaking your leg on a 2 foot fall it s a game guys relax arma 3 has found a good balance between an fps 3rd person shooter game and realism making it extremely enjoyable as both a simulator and a game i also found that arma 3 has very good support for newbies to the series and is able to really engage players into the fun i imagine it is much easier to get into arma 3 than i did arma 2 i can t judge i m not new to it the engine is decently optimized and is far less clunkier than the arma 2 engine however rocks are still and i guess forever will be broken perhaps the game is having difficulty conforming such free player movement with an un even surface pro tip never walk on rocks unless you absolutely have to the game also has a variety of content although players coming over from 2 will notice that there are a lot less guns this is partly due to the customization of guns instead of having a separate gun for each gun variation m4a1 holo m4a1 cco m4a1 you have a base gun and you are able to add sights lasers silencers flashlights what have you however this is not a full excuse i feel that there are still a lesser amount of overall guns to shoot perhaps bohemia interactive is trying to fine tune each gun into the patches as opposed to adding a ton of mediocre weapons simply for variety s sake what s also very surprisingly good in this game is the nvidia physx that was incorporated seeing my transport truck s wheels constantly bumping up and down according to the land under me while i drive troops through the night is oh so satisfying as well as well realistic the physics engine has been extremely improved and i quite like it i d like to finally talk about how the guns shoot and how they sound for this is after all a big part of the game once again i will compare it to arma 2 in saying clearly that arma 2 featured a more high pitched tappy sound when you shot with vertical recoil while 3 brings a much more deeper louder shot as well as echo to accompany it as the gun travels backwards into your viewmodel as opposed to upwards the guns definitely feel better for me but in the end i d like to classify this judgment as personal preference lastly the gamemodes of arma 3 are diverse and excellent my favourite being wasteland script i won t go into detail here there is also king of hill dayz of course but it s meh and of course standard operations altis life is also a really sweet one check those out if you end up buying so yeah i really like this game and i think that there is so much potential for a growing community grab some buddies hop into stratis and keep overwatch with some snipers and riflers as you and your team move in through the bushes to grab an objective for more supplies for your squad really great game i d definitely recommend to any fps milsim fan d
