2017 i guess there were some serious issues at launch but rome ii ee is a pretty great tw game there are issues with the game becoming a major slog mid late game once you ve pretty much dominated your neighbors but the combat is fun and the graphics look good some people don t like how resources are now managed at the province level and you can no longer build every little town into a rival of roma but really it s a non issue once you get the hang of managing food and learning what to build and where also worth noting that the workshop has tons of mods from minor music enhancements to complete overhauls this certainly extends the replayability of the game once you get done with the included scenarios which are good especially teutoburg forest
