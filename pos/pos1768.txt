2017 nier automata is still to this day one of the best games i have ever played it is not flawless by any stretch of the imagination but it does come very close and at the end of the ride i walked away from it with fond memories and an overall surprising amount of love for the franchice and its characters personally this is the game that have single handedly influenced me the most in recent years possibly even in decades when i attempt to consolidate all of my feelings about nier automata in a few sentences i often fail to do so with words of my own instead i fall back to janine hawkins opening paragraph of her review of the game www polygon com originally posted by janine hawkins the night that i first finished nier automata i slept soundly the night that i actually finished nier automata i hardly slept at all there is not a lot one can say about the game without spoiling it but if you love a story driven adventure with fluid hack n slash combat multiple playthroughs as well as endings all wrapped up with a gorgeous soundtrack then this game is worth trying out hopefully you will find it as immersive emotional and all around fun as i did a standing recommendation for anyone picking the game up is to try the game out and see how the port performs if you need help the far mod my tweak guide or the steam discussions boards should hopefully be of use you can find my tweak far guide here tweaks special k far a guide for nier automata by aemony includes quick links to special k far and other relevant mods
