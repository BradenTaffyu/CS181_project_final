at the time of this review i have dumped roughly a thousand usd on this game in the rough 477 hours i ve put in this game i own all the current ids e g o and have most if not close to all of them upgraded to the highest level lvl 40 uptie 4 this is also set a few days before the release of canto 6 man this game is fun not gonna say it s an amazing game because well that s just my opinion and most that i know have quickly dropped out of the game but that is to say i do like playing this game it s been a bumpy ride but if i was gonna quit playing games by project moon i d have quit many insanities and brick walls ago after all i m a stubborn who almost beat lob co deathless getting to day 49 and currently running my ass through library of ruina almost done the story has been great and is only getting better with every new update and i love watching the limbus gang grow as they used to be strangers and now dante is finding his groove i like trying to theorize what s going on because we re just at the beginning of this and there are so many sets of strings the authors can weave into this story i can t wait to see what they make every season is always unique with the mirror dungeons luxcavations and refraction railways honestly if there was no story refraction railway would be my favorite part of this game i ve had to learn quickly to be able to get all the rewards before the railway closes glad i like learning through pain because that made the ricardo fight not as bad as i had thought but then again shoveling money into the game to collect every id and ego like their funko pops and i m a heavily starved funko pop fan helps i did kind of worry that the game would almost require funds to play but you don t really need to as long as you keep up with the game and have the mindset of collecting everything and not missing a thing the grind is real and those sinners must suffer for my greed
