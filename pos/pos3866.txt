2019 early access review i ll preface this by saying that the game isn t perfect far from it however the developers are incredibly communicative and open they re engaged with the community and accepting feedback about every aspect of the game the game itself is solid it could use some polish it is still in early access after all and i find some mechanics frustrating mostly things that affect you across battles like drone damage but it has a super interesting character build systems that allows you to customize your team s playstyle in really cool ways you want to go for a standard xcom team that will work great you want to build your entire team around buffs debuffs sure want to build a team of tanks that can wade into battle without fear go for it do you want a team of glass cannons that devastate the enemy before they have a chance to retaliate sure why not the world is your oyster here it does take a bit of effort to reach this point the early game drags a little longer than would be ideal the sheer variety of viable builds is one of the game s main attractions and it s complemented by a very robust battle system putting your painstakingly planned party into action is just plain fun and you ll face a number of different enemy types in varying terrains and scenarios one area that i would like to see improvement in is in the difficulty most enemies are basically pushovers whereas a small few are brutally difficult reducing that variance and having some enemies in between would go a long way to making battles less of sweep up the trash and then whale on the boss with 40000 hp that s not to say battles aren t interesting but they do become somewhat same y after a while of course up until you get ambushed and surrounded troubleshooter is still in very active development in fact as i m writing this review the next update is already scheduled for tomorrow so dandylion is releasing new mechanics and missions all the time if you re interested in a game with extensive character customization a solid storyline and amazing developers then give it a shot
