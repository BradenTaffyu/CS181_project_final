2019 slay the spire is a rogue lite where the player must climb a massive tower while building a deck of cards to perform attacks and other actions during turn based combat against dozens of strange monsters at the start of your turn you ll see what action each enemy intends to do on their next turn attack block buff themselves debuff you and you ll randomly draw a few cards from your deck you then decide which cards to play and which order to play them in sometimes you can t play them all because each card has an energy cost and your character has a per turn energy limit one of the main strengths of the game is the massive variety of more than 250 unique cards and their special abilities some cards are useless on their own but combine with other cards to create advanced tactics you start with basic attacks and blocks but you ll find cards which let you gain more energy draw extra cards increase your strength poison or weaken the enemy upgrade other cards to more powerful versions reduce the energy cost of another card deal damage back to enemies every time they attack you restore health equal to damage done and more my favourite tactic so far is to build up as much block as possible if your health reaches zero its game over and there aren t many opportunities to heal so it feels important to not take damage and then use body slam to deal damage equivalent to my block number preferably having used double tap first so the attack counts twice but i m sure more experienced players will have found even more insane combos your cards will also gain passive bonuses from relics for example pen nib makes every 10th attack deal double damage other relics give you extra block if you ended a turn with no block or if you played 3 attacks during the turn some give you extra energy at the start of every turn or after playing a certain number of cards others will allow you to always have a card of your choice in your hand on the first turn of combat some powerful cards can only be played once per combat which then makes them exhaust removing them from your deck for the duration of that combat and there are relics which deal bonus damage or let you draw another card every time a card exhausts the lizard tail which restores 50 of your health the first time you would die essentially giving you an extra life has saved me more than once as you progress up the spire you ll pass through a few different types of rooms normal enemy fights which reward you with an extra card and some gold elite enemy fights which are more dangerous but will also drop relics treasure chambers containing relics shops where you can spend gold to buy new cards relics potions or remove weak cards from your deck you aren t allowed to sell anything though which is my biggest complaint about the game campfires where you can rest to regain some health or upgrade a card to a more powerful version random encounters where you ll find yourself in a strange situation sometimes involving a friendly creature and you ll usually get to choose what to do your choice can have positive and negative effects usually gaining or losing cards relics gold or health each room is linked by a path so you need to plan ahead to decide which direction you want to go all paths eventually end in a boss fight the layout of the spire is different every time you start a new run there is some element of randomness but i never felt like i died because of it the player has many choices that allow you to control your fate which cards or relics to acquire which rooms to visit what to buy which cards to upgrade the fact that you see what the enemy intends to do next gives you a chance to limit the damage similar to into the breach failure is normally a result of poor decision making and deck planning or taking a risky gamble that didn t work out a successful run should take around 90 minutes but you probably won t beat act 3 on your first attempt it will likely take a few runs to figure out your tactics there are three characters to play as who have access to different cards and have very different playing styles beating act 3 with one character unlocks ascension mode for that character which is a series of modifiers to make the game more difficult and beating act 3 with all three characters unlocks a 4th act there are also daily challenges that add unique modifiers slay the spire is a fantastic game and i d recommend it to everybody even if you don t play a lot of card games i think slay the spire is easy to understand but challenging to master and there s plenty of content to justify a full price purchase
