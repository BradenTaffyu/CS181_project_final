2021 treat it as a singleplayer with co op options the storylines and dialogues are amazing and there is ton of people willing to help you after all most of us dont want to see such amazing game die edit if you think the game base is awesome wait for the expansions the story gets even better and you get access to a lot of new companions from other classes and factions you are now even more important also yes the economy is somewhat broken if you only do story this should not matter but if you plan on going for the high rating equipment then yes the credit situation is kinda crazy
