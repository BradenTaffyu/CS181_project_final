2020 multiplayer stardew is the most beautiful thing i ve ever witnessed it is an endless serotonin fountain of watering crops together fighting together doing stupid stuff together collectively squealing over our collective cat cooperative mining and one person with 10 fishing skill and nothing else i m tearing up writing this review single player stardew is nearly as good except without all my best friends continually stealing the fireplace out of my house and sleeping in my bed i love this game so much that i bought it for switch too at full price
