normally i would be tempted to negatively review a game that makes you pay for it and also puts in money mechanics meant to get you to pay to win however this game does it in way that is alright you really don t need to buy anything you can enjoy the game as is if you never buy any money you can still unlock everything the game isn t trying to squeeze money out of you because of that and the fact that bloons td is the tower defense game i recommend it you have a large variety of maps and they regularly add more for no extra cost plenty of viable strategies great multiplayer and lots of challenges and game modes it really gives you plenty of variety a great game to have going on while you watch listen to something else too
