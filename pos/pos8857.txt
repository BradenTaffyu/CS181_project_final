2018 a friend bought this for me saying it was the best thing since sliced bread i was hesitant due to know being a rts kind of guy when i first loaded in and my friend helped me walk through creating a species i had no idea what any of the policies meant so i clicked what i thought sounded good load into the game now what there s a tutorial robot that tells you what to do but you still don t know what the buttons do or anything you just kinda sit there survey plantets build mining stations but you don t know what any of the numbers mean there s so many options it s almost overwhelming then you learn and learn you die and die then come back and try it again you get defeated you dream about what you can do better think of all the upgrades which are rng based and you try again this time you understand a little bit more then you watch some youtube beginner guides and it all starts to make sense now you can maintain a governement with positive resouces instead of going negative you understand what closing your boarders mean you figure out how to invade and declare war you don t accept peace treates from huge nations this game is awesome you want to be a military dictator check democratic nation check spiritual hugger for all races check play as nazi germany in space you can do that the options of what you want to do is up to you but the game is hard even on normal you got to keep your resources in the positive manage your fleets and your population if they get mad they will revolt you can pretty much do anything trade deals with they got you covered invade them and make them your slave they got you overall a must play even if you don t like rts you don t control what your ships do in battle but you do control what they have for armament this game is freaking awesome i suck at it but i love starting new games with new government types and seeing how far i get which is a little farther everytime get this game edit they changed the game completely i don t know how to play it anymore and all the time i spent trying to learn it is completely out the window but if you just bought it for the first time then you won t know what they changed and you re just going to play it for what it is still a good game but if they keepy changing everything then all you know is going to go out the window
