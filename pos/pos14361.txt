2021 early access review i have only played this game for 3 hours and i already know i am going to play it to death basically you start with nothing having to make everything manually eventually you build machines to do it for you which then need more power which then requires more machines to make materials and so on and so forth its all about exponential growth but you re never overwhelmed if you don t know what to do just look at the next thing on the skill tree figure out how to fulfill the research requirements and boom several hours have gone by this game also has a pretty great amount of room to make mistakes if the production line you set up at the beginning is becoming over complicated and messy you can just pick everything up and redesign it with little to no consequence it allows you to learn on your own you don t need to look up the most efficient setups because you can find one on your own with just a little patience and trial and errorlastly this game runs really well and i only had to deal with very minor bugs anyway if you like infrastructure strategy games like factorio or cities skylines or got really into tekkit back when the yogscast were still making fun minecraft videos i think this is a must buy
