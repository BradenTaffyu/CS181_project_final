2017 early access review when i first got this game i was immediately assaulted by an array of limiting areas tough enemies and hard fights to the point where it felt like i wasn t allowed to do anything except a very strict railroad of easier enemies in order to progress it made me start to lose faith in the game because it seemed like there was only an illusion of freedom but then i got good after floundering around in my first save file for a good few hours i sat down and made a new character applying everything i had learned i made a focused character i scrounged for every piece of armor clawed at every possible avenue and advantage and i applied the very tactics that destroyed me in the first playthough it didn t take long to learn that if done right the game is just as impossible for your enemies as it could be for you what i was rewarded with was knowing that there are for example several different ways to complete the first area it s not a railroad i just to put it blunt sucked in fact after discovering my first way though that beginning area i went back in and starting clearing out enemies starting in order from most managable it became an arms race of beating the lowest enemies i could find surviving the encounter and assimilating any loot i could find up to and including the paintings on the walls then i come up to what i ll call midway through the first act suddenly things are falling into place with the plot and i m gaining hints of what appears to be a really neat story in the making the varied things you can encounter kept my interest once i had the skill to progress managing gear was interesting due to the magic armor and physical armor differences and limited resources forced me to make interesting decisions every time i came across a nice piece of gear in a shop i began to learn of the various advantages and disadvantages inherent to different styles spreading your points can mean you have access to a ton of powerful toolbox abilities but don t deal much damage you can focus all your points into one aspect and that character will be a high damage monster but will lack in utility in comparison pair two such characters together and your high damage will punch through the defenses of your victim then the utility monster will knock them down for a turn only to be put in the ground for good by your high damage character s second round essentially what i m saying is if you find yourself overwhelmed by this game like i was at first i suggest you attempt to absorb what the game is beating into you then try to use that to beat it back into the game if you can manage that the varied builds and playstyles as well as the interactive battle system may just capture your attention overall this game is already something that i would consider great and they re only in early access they re still working on the game and the story accepting feedback from the forums and they re doing it well worth the full price now can only get better from here would recommend
