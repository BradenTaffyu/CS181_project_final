2021 early access review if you do not enjoy doing your laundry taking care of garden regularly check your car decorating your house and repairing your broken stuff this game is not for you but if you do enjoy play this game after doing them in real life this game reminds me so much of the sims with how slice of life it is how friendly the neighbors are how they all want you dead how you want them all dead how you steal from them completely stripping their house stealing their cars taking their food not to mention they happily join you for paintball games tho as for the early access the paint gun is only shooting red and the neighbors don t wake up after the game s finished dunno why10 10cons it s been 3 weeks since the paintball party and they still playing deadsince my review was a serious one let me add a joke to lighten it up helicopters are here to rescue you
