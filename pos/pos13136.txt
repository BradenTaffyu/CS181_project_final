2016 i bought this game after trying the demo and having a lot of fun with it i ve played ksp off an on for a few years the game has a very active mod making fan base and this opens up a lot of new avenues for play my best review of this game is anecdotal i sent this to a friend when i was only a few hours into play i had no mods installed and was still very much learning the basics anyone who plays ksp might find this story relatable one of my test flights put 3 kerbals into orbit they were low on fuel so i did a retrograde burn to bring them home except that i didn t do a retrograde burn i did a prograde burn by the time i realized it i had burned too much fuel to get them home i reduced their orbit as much as possible even using all available monopropellant from the thrusters they were stuck in an elliptical orbit over 100km from the surface at their lowest point with no way to return to the surface under their own power i had one option a rescue mission i built a new ship one with sufficient fuel to achieve orbit and maneuver to intercept the lost ship which i dubbed lost eagle lost eagle had been fitted with docking collar and i guess that was just fate because it was now my goal to use that in the rescue effort the rescue craft went through several iterations and multiple aborted attempts at rescue the final design of the craft contained a single seat cockpit and a 4 seat hitchhiker pod which was used for it s relatively low weight this would end up being the ultimate design flaw it was my goal to grab the 3 stranded crew members and transfer the rescue pilot to the pod before re entry docking is hard i would say impossible but i ve seen videos of people doing it and i know it can be done but despite many hours and multiple misses i had got rescue 1 and lost eagle lined up next to each other about 200 meters away i closed enough distance that i felt it would be close enough to jump the first crew member from lost eagle jumped from his old ship to the new one it went pretty smoothly but in the process the ships drifted further apart i did a corrective burn on rescue 1 to get them closer together and jumped the second crew member success again 1 left he jumped this time from the furthest gap he too arrived successfully i felt a rush of success a feeling of accomplishment frequently lost in today s video games plenty of fuel for the retro burn they were coming home this process had taken hours and this was the payoff that would make it worth while the design of the re entry craft was basically a can that held 4 crew with 4 radial parachutes coupled to a single seat inline cockpit with a shielded docking collar on the tip she wasn t pretty but she was light and efficient the plan was to transfer the pilot to the reentry craft before they hit atmosphere but i had discovered that i couldn t deploy the parachutes from the re entry craft it was a problem i had known about since earlier iterations of the craft but i was willing to work around the problem by deploying the chutes without decoupling the cockpit the whole thing still landed successfully in my tests at 5000m above the surface having survived re entry i pressed the spacebar to activate the chutes i don t know if i double tapped it or if i had just had my staging backwards but when i hit the space bar the cockpit split off from the hitchhiker can knowing full well that there was nothing i could do to save the pilot of rescue 1 i watched in horror for a second as it hurtled to the ground with no possibility of survival i quickly switched to the other part of the ship i tried manually clicking on the parachutes to deploy them the hitchhiker module contains nothing but chairs no controls that could be used to deploy the chutes again i watched in horror as the 3 rescued kerbals hurtled towards their doom the exile in orbit seeming to be safe alternative to the instantaneous death that awaited them at hundreds of meters per second the game would have let me revert to the launch of the mission or even the assembly area where i could have redesigned the rescue craft that had doomed these 4 brave kerbals i chose not to i was angry at myself for the mistake i had invested so much time into this and laziness had prevented me from fixing what i knew was a flawed design the empty ship lost eagle remains in its orbit a floating monument and constant reminder to any kerbal that looks up that taking the easy path or acting haphazardly can have terrible results i will be reminded of this every time i play the game
