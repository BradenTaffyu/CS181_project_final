2016 this is pretty much a classic harvest moon that i used to love back in n64 and ps1 but in cute pixel style so bright and colorful if you were a fan a harvest moon you re definitely going to like this i hope you find this review useful so many things to do there are so many many many many many many things to keep you occupied and unlocks to make things more convenient for you as well as tasks on bullet board that don t punish you if you fail to fulfill think of it as some extra cash fetch if you happen to have the items they need lying around the whole farm is also yours to decorate they provides hundreds of furniture floors wallpaper decorations statues trees and etc for you to decorate your house your farm area and 3 tier of upgrades on each structures some you can buy off the npc stores on different occasion some you have to unlock through quest and as collectives clean and completed i added this later on this review and 90 hours into this game i ve never encounter a single bug or crash in this game also had a session of this game near 20 hours nonstop and still runs very smoothly the controls might take a bit getting used to when played with mouse and keyboard make sure that when you use your tools your character is facing the right way and clicking on the right target on right distance rushing would only make you hit or gather or interact with wrong target sometime it becomes really bad like accidentally chop off your crops instead of a piece of wood next to it same goes with combat some mobs might require a bit of timing but it s still very casually fun mining is fun and rewarding mining is also less frustrating as it gives you milestones every 5 floors so you don t have to always climb from 1st floor to get to the bottom all over again it also randomizes every time you re enter and make it easy to farm resources but no it doesn t end there there s also another dungeon waiting for you if you want more challenge fishing minigame fishing also has more depth about it it s a mini game in itself you either hate it or love it i find it extremely frustrating but i also can see why people would enjoy this more than just click and take you have to keep the bar on the fish thing turn out to be more complicated than i thought sometime you miss the beat and the fish got off the meter so much it s hard to get it back on the meter and if you can t keep it on the fish you fail however ever as you gain more level you ll be given more option to use on catching fishes such as better rods baits and crab pot which you can just simply set and forget mods mods yes you can mod this game the assets in this game use simple xnb so like minecraft you can re texture everything and convert them back to xnb there are also more complicated mods already available for download this game is so open for modding potential get to know them better lore and story there are some npcs stories and events unlocked on certain times and season if you don t want to miss any of that wikis for this game is up and available however don t expect anything super stunning or any plot full of feels it s farming mining dungeon crawling redneck simulator not a hardcore rpg there are only bits and pieces you will find out more about each character when you become more and more close to them personally i find none of the male romance options is attractive however the female npcs are pretty cute there are also loads of secrets you have to find as they are very rewarding edit add more info about fishing and mods grammar checked
