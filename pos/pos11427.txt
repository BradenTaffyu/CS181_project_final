2020 early access review building base mechanics is rated moderate to hard depending on the experience of the player physics here is quite intense a shallow foundation could cause your whole building to collapse with a little to none salvage mats its kinda cool how you could slowly improve upgrade your base through passage of time depending on the mats gathered processed from prehistoric torches to a really automated base with power saver solar panels cells not to mention the awesome vehicles that could really speed things up game mechanics is like a mixture of left 4 dead tower defense with scavenging mining exploration oddly the zombies somewhat has the blueprint of your base embedded on their brains and knows exactly the weakest spot and fastest route to you and yes they could dig in or jump through your walls if its too weak shallow you have been warned though they are undead their brains are still intact game progression depends on the game stage of the server character levels of players and their survival skills hunger could make you weak and eventually kill you off but this depends on the server settings i love how the game is so versatile in terms of game settings and usage of mods which could really bring more life to the game and yes because of them i got inspired to study modding a decade had already passed since its first release and the game is still on its early access phase i guess the developer didn t anticipate the overwhelming possibility this game could become till then the community is still alive as ever releasing new patches every now and then overall if you re an avid fan of survival games this one will definitely give you a worthwhile zombie apocalyptic experience
