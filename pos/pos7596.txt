2023 this is a game where you can spend hours on it s building a city and give the people the consumables they need by building process lines from fish to scooters depend on which dlc you have of course and how far you are in the game for me its the organizing and the problem solving that keeps me playing the game this is a game where time flies and before you realize you played 2 4 6 8 or more hours
