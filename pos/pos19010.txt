2021 one of the very first steam games i bought when it first released i was in my first year of high school and as a result i torrented it instead of buying it because i didn t have the money on me to legitimately get it i had to have played it for a solid 100 or 200 more hours than what steam says i have as a result by the time the honest hearts dlc had released for it i d fallen in love with it so much i decided it was time to hang up my pirate hat and eye patch and stop sailing the seas and save my money and outright buy it i ve come to find that the older i get the more this game brings me back to my childhood as a result and every time i happen to hear a song that played on mojave music radio or radio new vegas i m hit with a massive amount of nostalgia not just for this game but also back to the good ol days before i had to worry about things that only adults have to this game has truly made an impression on me that will probably last for the rest of my life
