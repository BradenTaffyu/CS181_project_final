it s kinda hard to give recommendation for this one the game was launched in a bad state similiar to age of empires iv heck i could say this one launched with even less feature and worse than aoe iv but i believe they can turn things around too with the recent 1 4 update the game is now in far more better state but still need more polish imo which i will talk about in a moment as for me a single player enjoyer i have fun times with the italian campaign albeit there s been a three instance where the mission bugged and i can t finish it forced to restart the whole mission again and after it will get repetitive later down the line so my opinion on the italian campaign is pretty mixed while its fun the bugs can get really irritating the african operation is your standard 8 mission linear campaign where as the deutsches afrikakorps i played a couple of the mission its fun and i like it more than the italian campaign because its way less repetitive for the skirmishes you have 4 faction right out of the gate this time around unlike the previous entry which is only 2 and the rest come as a dlc you have the standard us forces the returning british forces wehrmacht and the new deutsches afrikakorps which plays kinda similiar to okw from coh 2 while all factions are really fun and felt unique to one or another the commander system from coh 2 is now replaced with battlegroups which function like a hybrid of the commander and the company from coh 1 complete with the points tree to choose from as for the bad british forces plays kinda weak to me or maybe i m just suck at the game lmao and there s still very few maps to play on relic promises to bring more maps in the future update so finger crossed on that overall despite of few annoyance with the bugs i like it and as for someone who can t get into coh 2 but love coh 1 coh 3 is really felt like a mix of both feel like coh 1 but with nice quality of life changes from 2 and more oh and as it right now when this review published there s very minimal microtransaction only few skins and you can buy 2 additional battlegroup with earnable merits which has far better grind than coh2 lootbox system tl dr i like it even tho it needs more polish just buy it during sale or something don t buy it at full price at this state
