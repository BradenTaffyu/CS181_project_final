2020 my errand boy who was incapable of violence had a mental breakdown after his wife died not helped by the mechs next door pumping a bad vibes psychic drone in our direction he decided to slit the throat of a sheep in the middle of the night so we locked him up for the safety of all our other colonists and animals he then planned a prison break with two other prisoners who he immediately left for dead while he ran for the hills where was this calculating mind and this disregard for life when we were being raided fugly thanks for nothing
