2015 early access review this game is incredible to say the least in the whole zombie sandbox survival genre this definitely sticks out as the one that got it right 15 year old me had entire paragraphs written out in this review about everything they loved so much about this game all the way back just after build 27 was released but now after the game has come so far there was simply too much to praise without adding a hundred more paragraphs so i thought i d keep it simple indie stone well done and thank you for a decade of dedication
