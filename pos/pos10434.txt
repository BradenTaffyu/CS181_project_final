it took me a long time to really sink my teeth into this game it s a bit intimidating at first especially with how much setups matter in the game and the sheer amount of things you can tweak at first the cars and the handling are a big adjustment but now that i ve gotten used to it it s become one of my favorite racing games sims i ve ever played the ffb sounds and visuals are great but just be prepared to really invest some time into getting the most out of the game if you feel frustrated at the start of it keep at it it s really rewarding and you will get better
