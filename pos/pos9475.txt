2022 one of the greatest racing games ever created it s not the top contender in any aspect aside modability but it still has the best overall package and it s so fun to drive without mods there s a big number of cars divided in a good number of categories a good number of laserscanned real tracks some of the most famous from formula 1 other 2 fictional locations with varied configurations 7 in total offering something different to race in a simulator tracks with the classic need for speed vibe real classic the old ones not underground a huge number of challenges if you like to race against the clock if you like to mess with mods then the numbers get ridiculous there probably thousands of cars to download also a huge number of tracks there are even some open world maps lol and some mods that transform the game into something that even the creators from kunos didn t expect it was possible in this game suposedely it was impossible to recreate night in this engine because of a limitation of light sources and it was also impossible to have rain in this game yet the modders did their magic however it s not a friendly game for someone that doesn t already like cars or is expecting a campaign to keep up its motivation to play thing is almost a sandbox it s just about selecting a car and track and there you are having fun just for the drive you can even create some dumb races like you in a race car like a f1 against 21 slow road cars f e d c b a aa aaa s ss sss
