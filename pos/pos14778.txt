2019 i m not a gamer to be honest but when i played civ 5 it blew me away when civ 6 came my mind blew twice in civ 6 the introduction to districts really cleared the mess in tiles management if i say what is civilization game i will say simulation of the world civ 6 does it better by adding foreign trade the latest two dlc which includes natural disaster governors added some reality flavours every time i play feels like i m playing for the first time cause every time i face new challenges it s true the ai becomes harder harder in level choosing difficulty but playing with a friend feels to another level even though the art style is not much appealing to the mass but i m in the minority i love it i can do so much more stuff in civ 6 than civ 5 overall i will say civ 6 is now more polished than civ 5 after the dlcs
