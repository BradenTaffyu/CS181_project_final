2023 this game offers you a beautiful progression experience start as a no one and you might become a king truly a medieval dream however when you become the king you will have a hard time managing the garrison army and diplomacy because the kingdom management feature is suck despite that i still recommend you to play this game because the gameplay is fun and engaging and it always satisfies you whenever you win outnumbered fights mod can enhance your gaming experience to the next level imagine leading an elf army or demon army better kingdom management and even better lore and story however the modding experience sucks at least for me it often crashes at the start of the game i occasionally reinstall this game to play with mod only to uninstall it again because the mod i want to play make the game crash
