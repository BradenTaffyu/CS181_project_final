war thunder is for me atleast a collection of games while you mainly choose from either tanks or planes almost every tier in this game will feel different from ww2 planes that heavily rely on climbing and dogfighting skills to modern jets that focus on speed manuveuers and technological advancements this game has it all while i do recommend this game this game is not free there will be a point in time where the grind in this game gets unbearable and the game will start to make premium time and premium vehicles really tasty to the point where some players get very frustrated with the grind honestly if you can get atleast premium time for cheap there are sales here and there you should definitely play this game as there is nothing else that comes close to it and one final advice play for fun don t play for the grind
