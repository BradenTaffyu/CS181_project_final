2016 this is no in depth review by any means given i ve only played it for 13 hours now but i must say what a beautiful refreshing game we got here don t get me wrong it has its cons but nothing compared to all the goodness potential it brings runs smooth launch looks amazing factions with truly unique gameplay styles abilitities characters perks traits etc epic maps dlc coming soon dlc coming soon characters can be too much as in op only 5 playable factions loading times ssd would i recommend it yes would i do it all over again given what i know now absolutely initial review right after launch update 100 hours later i m still in love with this game there has been a lot more content released since this review was posted some free and some paid dlc some good some not so good but thankfully its optional really depends on you and your playstyle go check out videos if you need more info help it has been a great experience
