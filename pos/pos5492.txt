2021 early access review this one is the best thing that has happened to the roguelike genre in the last decade along with cogmind perhaps ignore all the stupid childish hate from people about the devs the game oozes atmosphere it brings you into a post apocalyptic age with mutants robots weird beasts and lots of background lore where water is so precious it is the main means of exchange you ll need some hardcore survival skills to manage there s crafting artifacts mutations cybernetic augmentations books psychic abilities and a very nice cooking interface with recipes that give temporary traits the controls are easy to use and well polished for a roguelike and you ll constantly find something new to explore scavenge kill eat the world is open and consistent you can literally travel overground from one edge of the map to the other and return underground the interface is not as underwhelming as for example dwarf fortress and it comes with a nice tileset as well for the more amateur players permadeath can be disabled from the settings and you can save reload just like in other games the game still has a way to go before it gets finished and the main quest stops abruptly at some point but even now it offers a fairly complete roguelike experience much more than other complete roguelikes impressive writing very atmospheric sound track state of the art procedural generation and a mystic post apocalyptic world setting that someone should write books for make this a game that no roguelike fan should miss
