when the game first launched it was quite the disaster pm not being ready for the number of players and many aspects of the game besides story not implemented making a number of players worried about the state of the game now after 1 year and a half of limbus i can say it is my daily ritual and seasonal blessing project moon has continued to improve to listen to the community and keep up with their schedule there have been issues both internal and external regarding pm but they ve proven themselves and learned from their mistakes what does limbus have well as any gacha it has daily content that can be done to gather resources for improving your characters do you have to play daily not really of course if you want to build and use as many id s then grinding will slowly get you there but honestly just like any project moon game there are many ways of going about with this game and you can either find it on your own or look at what the community of the game has to offer regarding any team making or powerful id s this is a very story driven game and going through the story at a fast but enjoyable pace is most recommended you don t have to fear losing out on events since they are integrated in the main story and are required to progress currency for the gacha is obtained through the story weekly fixes and mirror dungeon from which weekly you can get 750 lunacy from combined with the 300 lunacy from the mail that s about 8 gacha rolls per week limbus is a very friendly gacha as in you can acquire any id s or ego from getting the required amount of shards for that respective character duplicates of an id you get are converted into shards and through the limbus pass you get shard crates which can be applied to any character by unlocking the paid battlepass not only do you get more egos but also quadruple the amount of shard crates you get from each level if you like the gameplay of limbus want to receive a good pack of resources and desire to play often then i recommend buying the limbus pass as it rewards you tremendously for playing currently there are over 100 id s and egos in the game meaning that by starting to play now there is a wide variety to choose from whether you choose to spend your gacha rolls now or to save up for an upcoming event walpurgis night where you can not shard the currently displayed id s and can only acquire them from the gacha its your choice you can get through most of the game with the base sinners and ego and when there in an event going on as i am writting this murder on the warp express you will receive event currency from the story stages and mirror dungeon with this you can get more resources to improve your team and also rolls making it easier to progress throught the early story overall if you are interested in the story and world of project moon and aren t distraught by the rng combat and badly explained mechanics then i am sure limbus will win your heart there are content creators on youtube who have well done videos on the combat aspects of the game and guides on end game content please watch them thank you project moon i will forever bus on my lim till i distort for this company
