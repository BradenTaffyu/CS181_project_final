2020 this is one of those games which shouldn t be so relaxing and addictive to play but is for some reason it s just so much fun to go back to this in the downtime between some other more intense games you have on the go or if you simply want something chill to play while maybe watching something in the background also it s amazing how the developers have stuck with this for so long keep supporting it and keep bringing out new content for it stark contrast to other devs who feel the need to bring out a new sequel every year or two when it s not necessary that said it would be nice if we do get a ets3 at some point since the graphics could use a bit of an overhaul
