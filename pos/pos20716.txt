2023 not a perfect game but i really enjoyed my time with it 8 10 highly recommended a quick preface i haven t thought about harry potter since like 2008 it s been a while pros excellent visuals hogwarts and hogsmeade are an absolute joy to explore i spent way longer than the game expected me to just exploring and finding all the collectible field guide pages i could transmog is available right away and at no cost you don t have to go into battle looking like a clown just because the stats are good you can change them on the fly anytime you want the combat system is great took me a minute to get into the groove but once it clicked it absolutely clicked the spells are fun to play around with experimenting to see what spells combo well against a given enemy was really enjoyable respectable difficulty it s not too hard to push me to frustration and not so easy it puts me to sleep in the opening hours i found myself healing a lot later on i barely took damage i d say it veers on the easier difficulty side but fine none the less no harm in rewarding player skill some of the bosses were visually impressive and fun to fight story was fine there were moments it felt needlessly dragged out however i was distracted with other things flying around on a broom felt good the controls were odd but i got used to them quickly i encountered very few glitches and bugs far less than i was expecting minus the occasional hiccup towards the end of the game hogwarts legacy ran smoothly minimal performance issues this game doesn t require you to know anything about harry potter to enjoy it there are loads of easter eggs for fans of the series to enjoy however not recognizing the easter egg doesn t take away from the experience i had forgotten so much over this last decade and even then a lot came rushing back was never punished for forgetting stuff though some great characters and side quests representing 3 of the 4 houses natsi and sebastian are clear standouts i was giggling silly during the polyjuice potion section that was exactly what i wanted from hogwarts school mischief taking place a good hundred years before the events of the harry potter series was a good idea helps keep the stories out of each others way cons enemy variety is low lot of quantity over quality in the later battles puzzles variety is good but not quite good enough it reminded me of the korok puzzles in zelda there s just so many of them so despite a decent lineup on paper it feels like they are repeated over and over again same issue here gear limits why why does there need to be a limit on gear like that do you have any idea how sick i am of dropping everything fast traveling to a shop and dumping my entire inventory every 5 10 minutes i can shove a monster 3 times my size into a handbag i think i can carry one more hat even with the merlin trials this was annoying i did not enjoy the stealth mechanics in this game total snooze fest house points didn t really matter like they did in the books movies that was disappointing and makes some of my actions feel like they had no consequence no house specific quests total missed opportunity there no quidditch there is an in universe reason for this but every time a characters mentions it and they do often that feeling that there s something missing wells up in me again the magical beasts were cute yet i barely even touched the upgrade system simply because i didn t have to every few minutes i d find better gear than i was wearing and just swapped it out as a result i feel like i wasted my time in the vivariums the room of requirement was neat but i mostly ignored it i never got to invite anybody into the room so it was just there to grow plants and brew potions really the hamlets scattered around the world are uninteresting could ve used a bit more love to make them memorable where s the whomping willow i wanted to get punched by a tree in conclusion i think i can say this is the best harry potter game ever made the world is a joy to explore the combat system is engaging and the story has good presentation the game is mostly held back by its own rpg systems and those couple of things it s missing
