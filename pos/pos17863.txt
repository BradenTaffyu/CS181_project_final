company of heroes 3 while not quite living up to the legendary status of its predecessor still manages to deliver an engaging and enjoyable experience especially in its multiplayer mode in fact it s way better than expected the new battlegroup system is a notable addition that adds depth and variety to the gameplay the graphics are decent for an rts game with environments that are adequately detailed to immerse you in the intensity of world war ii battles however the sound design is a step down from the predecessor lacking the impactful audio effects that made the predecessor so immersive one of the highlights is the battlegroup system which allows for greater customization and strategic options making each match feel unique and dynamic although there are only four battlegroups per faction it s a case of quality over quantity each battlegroup is well crafted offering distinct playstyles and strategies since its release the game has seen significant improvements addressing many of the initial issues and making the overall experience much better despite this the single player campaign isn t particularly enjoyable lacking the compelling narrative and memorable moments that made the original company of heroes a classic some gameplay mechanics feel slightly unpolished and there are occasional bugs that can detract from the experience despite these shortcomings company of heroes 3 remains a fun and engaging game particularly for fans of the series and those who enjoy competitive online play it may not reach the heights of its predecessor but it still offers a worthwhile experience for strategy enthusiasts if you re a fan of the franchise or enjoy real time strategy games company of heroes 3 is definitely worth a try
