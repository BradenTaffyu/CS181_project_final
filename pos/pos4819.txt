2021 i recommend it but not because the game is good this game has like 3 redeeming qualities its atmosphere its gameplay and the modability other than this its pretty mediocre to bad like you know that i m not talking because i have almost 500 hours and all the achievements the story is pretty meh the factions are one sided and suck the quests are pretty meh to average the reason i still recommend it is because gameplay wise its the most fun fallout this of course is not because badthesda is such a good game company no no no its because they got id software the creators of doom to make the shooting for them so lets see here for a second you have an rpg game that sucks as an rpg but excels as an fps game the only thing i give to bethesda is that they do know how to create worlds morrowind oblivion fallout 3 skyrim fallout 4 all have a really good atmosphere new vegas not included because don t you dare associate the master piece that is nv with bethesda ok so should you buy if you are interested in an rpg game with good quests a good story and maybe a really neat political conflict don t you will find non of these things here the story is 5 10 at best and is literally just fallout 3 but in reverse the quests aren t all bad but they re still pretty mediocre with mostly just being go there and get that or go there and kill that or go there kill stuff and then find stuff there and for a political conflict there is one but its incredibly one sided and ugh you have 4 factions the brotherhood of steel the institute the minutemen and the railroad ok i said do not associate nv with bethesda but i just have to here for a second in nv you had 3 major factions each one was the right choice with it only coming down to your personal believes and yes even the legion was a valid choice but here in fo4 you just have objectively the worst choice and objectively the best choice there isn t anything along the lines of oh the institute may save the wasteland with their technology but they have a lot of evil intentions or something like that its just yeah the institute is just kind of the best faction and all the other ones are either too small to make a difference or are just straight up the third reich like the brotherhood its just so meh if you want a good shooter yeah buy it its pretty good its also extremely modable with a lot of mod weapons with a lot of them even having their own handmade reload animations that look smoother than the actual animations in the game your bullets feel like they have an actual impact and nothing is so overly tanky that you re like bruh what is this a gun or a toy overall i give the game 7 5 10 but that 7 5 is only a 7 5 because the game is so modable if you couldn t customize your game like that i d probably only give the game a 5 5 6
