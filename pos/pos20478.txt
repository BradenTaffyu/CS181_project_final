2020 the year is 20xx humanity has fallen the apocalypse destroyed what was left of the resistance and you became the last surviving man left on earth your weakened sanity begins to picture a man wearing a pot head selling you plants in the back of his car dave was it it didn t matter as the last line of your defences are broken by these mindless husks your left arm grasps onto a singular pea your final thought was if this is how i m going down might as well within your final moment you throw the pea towards the unflinching dead the pea flew across the room or what remained of it the speed of the pea was somehow deafening threatening almost as if it was a bullet as the pea pierced the rotten flesh a violent crushing of bones were heard the dead have fallen awestruck you shudder in confusion and fear you take a deep breath with a sinister grin you mumble this is where the fun begins
