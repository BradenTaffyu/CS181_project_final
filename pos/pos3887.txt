2022 have you ever wanted to see what a korean game voiced by japanse vas set in basically la with new xcom mechanics would be like no well too bad it s good the best way to actually describe it is xcom chimera squad with jrpg equip skills plus most of the qol ui improvements from xcom2 mods where it differs is that combat is more focus on melee and closer engagements and the game uses an action timer similar to many jrpgs cover exists for you to close the distance to targets not necessarily to take pot shots from to compensate there s both block or dodge mechanics just don t get too cocky with that dodge tanking you can get punish quite heavily out of cover and most of your characters are melee oriented so positioning matters a lot more when you might need to survive several enemy actions all at once ah right the story ever wondered what would happen if the government decided to privatize law enforcement like in my hero academia because it didn t have the resources to actually enforce the law yeah it s that but you re taking on swat team type missions it s messed up and the game is well aware it s all fun and games until you play your first violent case and you realize you re sending students with the swat team to kill 50 gangers or pull trapped officers out of a firefight 10 10 gimmie weeb xcom urban firefight simulator again it s also about the same cost as the actual xcom chimera squad too
