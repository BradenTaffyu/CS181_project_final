i wanted to post this review because i wanted to stack up some playtime first and see how the devs would react to the rocky launch of the game and i was more than happy with the outcome the devs reacted quickly releasing two very welcomed balancing patches already so long story short i genuinely think this game has the potential to be the best arcade racer on the market given the devs dedication to the project and their engagement with the community i have no doubt that it will become just that don t let the mixed review score fool you sure the launch was a bit rough but i never understood people s problems with this game for the laughably low price you are getting a way more fun game than any of the recent nfs games and a much more interesting and engaging title than forza horizon that being said there are still some balancing issues that need addressing and the game needs to be much more optimized if you have the recommended hardware it s definitely not unplayable far from it but it should run much better than it does i m going to start with the bad stuff first the economy has mostly been fixed and most of my issues with it are gone the only thing left that i have an issue with is the gold special currency it is still hard to stack up and the parts that require it are pretty expensive honestly i don t really see the point or the need for a special currency in a pay to play game with no microtransactions i would love for this currency to be completely removed or at least used only for special options like engine transmission swaps even then i think the amount needed for a swap should be at least 30 lower the racer ai has mostly been fixed in the last update but they still seem to be using higher class cars in class locked races you can still catch and pass them in the corners but in longer races with long straight stretches it is unnecessarily hard to keep up with them i m split on this because i want the races to be challenging but it still feels unfair i would love to see an opponent difficulty skill slider which would in my mind pretty much fix this problem the game is poorly optimized no sugar coating it i have better hardware than recommended and my game still runs at about 30fps but frequently drops below 25 even to 20 on max settings for reference i get a steady 30 to 40fps on forza horizon 5 max settings which is a much more graphically demanding game now for the good stuff the handling is some of the best arcade handling i ve experienced it s much superior to carx drift handling which is only good for drifting and nfs can only dream of having such engaging and fun car handling the map is the best open world racing game map i ve played it s an awesome mix between a western urban city and japanese rural mountain roads with lots of nice toge drift roads it is generally very beautiful too customization is also the best in any racing game i ve played if you ve played any carx game before you know what i m talking about if not you re in for a very pleasant surprise the car list although not licensed is filled with beloved tuner cars it s an awesome mix of old and new cars i don t think anyone will have trouble finding something to be excited about the community aspect of the game has a lot of potential the game is still finding its audience but the versus online modes like pink slip races with other players and just the basic cruising around with friends or other players are awesome as someone who has played a lot of racing games and prefers simcade games and is a genuine car guy i can t recommend this game enough sure there are some issues but pretty much all new games have them at launch and if anyone should get a pass it should be a smaller dedicated game studio like carx i played a lot of carx drift on the ps4 and i can tell you that the game changed substantially for the better over the years so as i said at the beginning i have no doubt that this game will too there are still some cars and features missing from the game like the livery editor which is by the way also the best one i ve used in any racing game but i am sure it is coming very soon i know this has been a long one but i wanted to be really thorough objective and honest so without further ado see you in sunset city
