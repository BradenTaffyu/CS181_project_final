2022 early access review this is one of the few times i ve ever reviewed a game and definitely the first for an early access title this game scratched an itch that satisfactory and factorio couldn t satisfactory was too much walking factorio was not my jam art style wise this fits perfectly this game is hard and surprisingly deep was rushing to an end game but then paused and happily spent 20 30 hours fixing early game mistakes things i would love to see added 1 a better way to offload excess inventory this litter system is annoying when cleaning up full lines of ore 2 autopilot to planets the flying through space is pretty but i ve got belts to lay dammit3 route management i know this game is built by a very small team and am amazed at what s already been achieved but if a boy could have a wish it would be this a way to visualize what goods are moving where are moving on a planetary and galactic scale 4 waysigns signposts maps i love the game but trying to find out where you put that spare gear factory 30 hours later is a real pain in the butt a few years later wow the devs have really come through would still like some waysigns but this game is somehow even better now the combat mechanics are a nice new add and the new transport panel is a chef s kiss
