2021 if you are familiar with mullins work i would definitely pick this game up he has again mashed together several genres of video games in an intriguing way just like his previous works the story again completely demolishes the 4th wall not only by reaching out to you the player but by creating an entire world outside of the game itself the game currently has an arg going on and i think the conclusion of the arg might add more content but we ll have to find out now if you re not familiar with mullins style or previous works know that the focus of his works usually seem to be focused on the blending of genres rather than any specific genre itself the deck building roguelike and escape room genres are there yes but none of those areas are perfect or revolutionary in any way i will say that i did really like a lot of the card mechanics that were implemented and enjoyed making different decks focused on the different mechanics if you re in it for the just for the cards you might actually find some unique and interesting additions to the genre just know that the main focus in the game isn t just the deck building so you might end up disappointed with the progression later on tl dr mullins makes genre blending games with 4th wall narrative breaks you might be disappointed with the progression of the game because it doesn t entirely focus on the cards
