2022 inscryption is an eclectic game drawing from many sources and building a uniquely enthralling experience at its most core game play level inscryption is a rougue like deck building game where the cards in question are for the in universe game of the same name inscryption the card game while this is the heart of the game experience it is by no means the sole aspect and the plethora of other elements that drive the player through all three acts of the main game are expertly blended with the main card game horror mystery puzzle solving and a sort of meta story telling are central to the overall concoction of inscryption with so many differing aspects and game mechanics changes over the course of three acts one might think inscryption would struggle to find itself but proves itself expertly by blending them into a single game experience which feels fluid and fun and an atmosphere which is at once soothing and un nerving inscryption was originally made as part of a game jam event inspired by the theme sacrifices must be made a phrase whose ominous conotations are principle in both the story and core gameplay of inscryption the game itself is presented as a game within a game in the 1st act the player takes the role of a kidnapped victim trapped in a wood cabin and forced to play a deadly version of the physical card game inscryption at the same time this is also the digital game the un lucky player having been drawn into the terrible cabin after starting the video game now forced to play for their life against their shadowy kidnapper and card dealer adversary the main focus of the card game is in two main parts traversing the map and engaging in card battles the dark figure acts as a sort of game master presenting multiple forking routes each which bend split and rejoin at each step the player moves there token and engages with the events laid out on the map as one would a boardgame each turn progressing one step as they make their way towards a final boss fight at the end of each map each event offers either a card battle or a unique choice for the player to make which will influence their deck its cards or their items choices feel weighty as each card chosen increases the size of your deck offering more options but lowering your chances of finding an one particular card items can sway entire battles offering extra resources invalidating enemy tactics protecting the player or shifting aspects of the board and cards the card game itself centers around the core theme of sacrifice each card requires a supply of blood or bone which can only be fulfilled by the cards you have set of the field or disposed of each card has a health score a power score and can have additional abilities or properties like being worth more as a sacrifice dealing damage when struck or attacking in multiple directions each card when summoned is placed on one of four positions and attacks whenever able at the end of your turn card placement is vital with cards being used to block or attack against the opponent s cards during the course of each hand you ll not only see the cards your opponent has already summoned but those which will be added on the next turn and canny players will learn to anticipate the chain of events that will occur at the end of each hand the base cards are versitle each with a morbid ink and paper design and can be altered over the course of the game to create unique and powerful combinations the cards you choose to keep sacrifice and play are critical and choices feel pertinent and real the map portion of the game is equally dark and feels like you are trapped in a sort of grim fairy tale meeting woodland creatures alongside monstrous and enigmatic characters who dot the path at the end of each map the dark figure takes on a new sinister role his regular narration replaced with a mask and a manic performance as though he is taking on a new persona each boss has a unique mechanic to challenge and canny players will begin planning in advance of each one building deck synergies to combat the specific nature of each opponent interspersed with this main loop are various puzzles the player is free to get up from the table solving various puzzles in order to acquire special cards and eventually discovering how to defeat your opponent you re unlikely to win on your first run and the penalty for loss is hefty the dark figure will capture your esscence as a new card to find or face in subsequent runs before your life is cut short in the cabin s back room persist solve the puzzles uncover the method of defeating the dark figure once and for all and you ll make it through act i of the game as an end to this main review i will say that act i is incredible at drawing in the player the dark forboding feelings that permeate the cabin as well as the calm yet sinister demeanour of the dark figure are an addicting blend that many horror games would struggle to manifest the card game itself is strong with each loop providing an unique and challenging experience the next two acts are equally unique though they seem to be shorter in comparison to the first for those fond of roguelikes card games puzzles or simply dark forboding atmosphere inscryption will offer you a unique and entertaining experience whcih will quickly hook you and have you coming back again again review of acts ii and iii a spoiler by any other name each subsquent act begins with a number of live action videos revealling the game s mysterious history and events leading up to the players entrappment in the game like wise the game s rules are changed and added on to in act ii it is revealed that the woodland theme you have been thus far playing with is only one of a total of four unique sets taking on the style of an early 8 bit game act ii vastly expands the player s card choices with the player now familiar with the base rules the expanded cards tactics and synergies invite the player to be inventive as they battle through 4 distinct arenas headed by 4 boss scybes players will face down a number of opponents each using one of the four deck factions these battles are bright and brief and this is the shortest of the three acts with only a few secret elements act iii sees a return to the format of act i this time with an expanded escape room and a replacement for you green thumbed game master here the theme is robtic and industrial your new game master has obviously different feelings about inscryption and how it should be played the shadowy figure always centered the game and maps around his morbid story telling the robotic game master considers such flowery prose an after thought what matters is the games mechanics cards powers and synergies with a sneering self importance he becomes the games final challenge navigating a new persistant map this time with 5 card slots new cards and a fusion of old and new card abilities map events and challenges act iii has a fantastic new spin which feels fresh while not robbing players of the skills they hae acquire in acts i and ii it even has a phenominal though frightening new mechanic where by inscryption allows the player to design a new card whose strength is determined by the size of a chosen file on the player s own harddrive a meta game element i never suspected in the games finale the meta story comes to a grisely end before the player unlocks free play and add challenge modes even after beating the main game these modes are incredibly fun and inscyption as a card game is enthralling what is more i ended up coming back simply to sample the dark calm atmosphere of act i which serves as the main game mode in the post game free play section
