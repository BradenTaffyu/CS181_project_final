2017 i first purchased this game for 5 during a summer sale years ago at the urging of a friend he had put 200 hours into this alone and wanted to induct me into the cult of paradox games coming from a background of civ and total war i was completely overwhelmed i played as castile and tried finishing la reconquista with 8k troops after failing horribly i asked him his advice while fully and admittedly raging i quote give it 40 hours and you ll be hooked it gets easier what the hell 40 hours who are these snooty elitist developers who make such an inaccessible game they don t even have real time battles like total war so why do they need it to be so complicated this is i didn t pick it up again until this summer i m now at 100 hours played i eat my words give it time and you will love it p s you will see a lot of reviews of people rightfully complaining about the dlc policy paradox does create dlcs which are overpriced but if you put in the 100s upon 100s of hours that the majority of the playerbase does then it is still worth it do i still think its greedy and manipulative yes am i going to be a hypocrite and still play this game also yes take that as you will
