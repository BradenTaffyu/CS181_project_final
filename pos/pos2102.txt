2023 i teared up when dallas said you see i need my payday 3 and then proceeded to payday all over the gold sharke bank lobby truly a payday game of all times payday 3 is definitely a diamond in a rough after a decade of payday 2 3 feels incredibly fresh and yet at the same time it feels like it s missing something i felt so mixed about it that considered getting a refund for now but ultimately decided not to despite it s roughness i still have a lot of fun the good combat and movement feel fresh you can feel an impact weapons make movement is great you are no longer sliding along the floor sliding actually has practical use and i never realized how much i needed proper vaulting in a payday game you are no longer humping edges and not being able to hop over this or that object because of misaligned collision stealth improvements much less punishing and way more rewarding if you are skilled enough you ll be able to beat certain heists even without putting a mask on casing mode is no longer just well casing mode you can do plenty of objectives in it including hacking picking up and searching through key items lockpicking distracting a guard hacking cameras to assist your team carry bags without raising extra suspicions from security even if you are out of pagers you are given another chance in form of search mode in this mode guards derail from their usual patrol routes and will actively look for you all over the place crutch perk decks borderline stupid skills incredibly overpowered weapons like akimbo auto shotguns are gone payday 3 is as grounded as payday the heist if you loved payday 2 for it s arcadish nature and are looking for more payday 3 is not for you you are no longer a one man army if you re looking to succeed on overkill teamplay is required the soundtrack is chef s kiss gustavo proves yet again that he is worthy to walk in simon s shoes difficulty scaling assaults getting increasingly hard first responders aka blue cops get replaced by swat units later on swat units get replaced by heavy swat units and after that assault becomes endless all units have same health pool across all difficulties which is a great improvement special units had a fair overhaul and gained plenty of new and interesting abilities some of them will catch you off guard starting eight maps are great all but under the surphaze art gallery that is made with stealth in mind play well in both loud and stealth all eight payday 3 s maps have something unique going on about them and all are replayable penthouse heist feels a bit too small in scale but it s fine it s great to see some interesting familiar faces to return shayu from city of gold butcher keegan from texas campaign and also everyone sfavorite vlad still played by ilia volok i love shade too actress did a great job no doubt i miss locke but i have a feeling that we ll see him soon enough no way they are killing him off in general it feels like everyone took acting more seriously this time around radio replies no longer feel like they are being read from the paper crew members are actually trying to come up with random nonsense thanks to dedicated servers nasty desync that is still plaguing payday 2 is no more connection across the board is excellent not even once i came across a network related issue so far i sure hope that i simply wasn t lucky the bad consider this one a mixed section painfull lack of secondary content barely any weapons masks gloves and outfits most of the outfits and gloves available are recolors of one another 17 guns total plus two overkill weapons i remember that payday 2 had 9 assault rifles alone on launch i don t see a lot of cosmetic items that were leaked during beta in a release build either guess they are already sorted and packaged into pending dlc drops new leveling system definitely raises some eyebrows it s a challenge system taken from payday the heist only in that game completing challenges granted you additional experience towards your normal progression but in payday 3 the entire leveling is bound to challenges alone it feels incredibly unrewarding when you barely finished a loud heist on overkill and gained zero progression towards your level similar deal is with the weapons and unlockable skills all modifications and skill lines are locked behind experience only this time thankfully it s tied to usual experience that you get after finishing a heist you ll be spending a lot of time unlocking all mods for your favorite weapon skills on the other hand unlock rather quickly new rush grit edge mechanic is questionable fullfilling certain conditions and having a specific perk on grants you one of these three temporary buffs a lot of new skills are tied to these and sometimes it s quite tricky to proc these conditions rush gives you 10 extra speed grit 10 damage reduction and edge 10 extra damage not stackable drills are mostly gone but payday 3 has introduced another obnoxious repetivite objective two in fact looking around for bloody qr codes and the worst one standing in wifi circle hotspots to boost the signal and progress the hack qr codes are one time use and some maps have tons of doors locked with these i got tired of this rather quickly the ugly no control over lobby you play in no kick option at all people can be all kinds of nasty and there s literally nothing you can do about it what were they thinking get a group of friends or pray for people to not be mean just because they can the ui is ugly i m still trying to figure how to paint different weapon parts in different colors menu ing is terrible in game you are not able to tell who has what deployable or gadget only in lobby microtransactions not present in the game yet but thankfully premium currency that is planned was leaked even before release trailer it s the usual thing they ll wait out a review period like activision does and then will shove them in on top of selling dlc packs not a fan but as long as it s cosmetic only and not another battlepass fomo i m fine with this bot ai is terrible they were good in beta but it feels like they were nerfed in release version it was fine when they couldn t face tank two dozers but now they are as fragile as wet toilet paper and on top of that they just love to ignore you on the ground and not revive you no preplanning and confusing asset allocation some players straight up don t know that these exist and how to actually get these because how much they are hidden of a vendor page some maps have unique assets that you can use but i still have no idea how these things work and how they appear this one is imo and very arguable but i strongly dislike fixed rng seeds whenever you restart the heist via voting all objectives items and codes remain the same meaning if you learned a code on your run a restart and you can skip all the objectives you have to do to actually learn the code rng only reset properly on re queuing takes all the fun and surprise element out and this is what i can recall as of now as you can see payday 3 is a mixed bag it has it s fair share of problems right now but it looks like starbreeze are confident in what they are doing they have a plan for it roadmap says that apart from normal dlc content we are going to receive free updates and content as well so i ll put my faith in them for this one despite it s issues i still like payday 3 a lot i would love to suggest you to try out payday 3 on gamepass before buying a full game
