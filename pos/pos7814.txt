2018 early access review i absolutely love this game just to drive around freely i may add no invisible walls everything you see you can crash into its worth the price and it will help the developers to make the game better with it being on version 0 12 at time of writing they have made a lot of progess with the simulation of body physics and the detail and well just about everything i ensure that if you buy this game and with a good enough pc you will find endless enjoyment with this game also one thing to add i do not reccomend playing with a slow hdd as ui can be slow but it is still playable i plan to get an ssd which should sort the issue runs fine at high on a gtx1050ti 4gb and with future updates optimisation should be improved
