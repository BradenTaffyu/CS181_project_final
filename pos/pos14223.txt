2021 early access review oh lord let me just start out by saying that as soon as i got this game i played for 6 days straight until it was finished for an average of 12 hours a day i abandoned responsibilities slept like 4 hours a night and my room is a mess at the moment but it was a fun ride this game is a treat i graduated in manufacturing engineering and realized that career path was too much work so i got in to a programming career and this game hits both of those aspects of me in just the right way progression is fun and rewarding the game gives you very little in the way of explanations of things there s an advisor like in stellaris that gives you tips on how to play the game even a very minimal tidbit of lore about who you are the state of humanity and what you re doing it s interesting it s just all in very poorly translated engrish it sounds like they hired a fluent english speaker to voice the advisor but it also sounds like they paid him to read a script straight from google translate and he just said hey so long as you pay me i ll say whatever you want so now you ve just got this fluently english dude reading a half unintelligible line and while many would see this as a detriment i found it very amusing and endearing the funny thing is you really don t even need more than the half unintelligible tips to figure out how the game works the game has a very low learning curve and is very intuitive they made a system that s really fun to just mess with until you start to get a feel for how it works and you continually expand and compound on what you learn the upgrade tree is very simple yet engaging as well i like that the later tiers even have infinitely repeatable upgrades so if you just want to keep going after the end game you could just become ridiculously decked out this game literally just released in early access and it s already fleshed out enough to give me 70 hours of sheer enjoyment well worth the price it still needs a bit of polish but really already has a level of content that exceeds many comparable fully released games they re very actively updating it and have added very many quality of life features just in the short few sleep deprived days i ve played it it still has its flaws for instance information matrices one of the core items you have to produce to win the game was the bane of my existence there are 5 main matrices you progressively create manufacturing lines for plus a 6th final matrix made from the previous 5 combined and these are then used for researching new technologies and personal upgrades information matrices are the 4th tier of those 5 and feels like it requires half the silicon in the known universe to make as many as you need that being said i did find myself wishing that the game had more incentive to explore and expand into the universe once you develop warp technology i set up mining stations on a nearby neutron star and a nearby m class star and those are the only two other star systems i visited or had reason to visit all the way through the end game they simply covered all the resources i needed through to the end i imagine new and more diverse mineable resources are things that will come with time once more features are introduced it s a just released early access after all it s a shame really i went to a black hole for shiggles once and the way they rendered it was absolutely gorgeous i just had no reason to go there this game really is just beautiful sometimes i would just sit in awe amongst the array of lights from my many conveyor belts watching the sunset as it was surrounded by a ring of dyson sphere nodes and the glimmering ring of the dyson swarm surrounding that hats off to the modeling team they really outdid themselves with the beautiful and scientific aesthetic of it all and hats off to the coding team i was really struck by how you could just fly into the air and you were in space seamlessly the entire universe was at your fingertips to fly to at any time with zero loading screens it s not just an open world it s an open universe and every logistically complex mining manufacturing plant you create on every planet keeps going even when you re not there without overly bogging down your computer color me impressed i will say don t be too hyped for getting a big crazy ending i won t spoil anything but it s very brief though there is some lore and it s really only there to mark an end point to tell you you ve done just about all there is to do the beauty of this game is truly in the journey and you can continue playing even after you ve finished everything pros intuitive and engaging gameplay and progression you feel like you re a genius when you figure things out seamless transitions to an entire universe at your fingertips beautifully rendered world and well optimized performance considering the sheer amount of things that you create cons poorly translated engrish very little reason yet to explore more than a couple other star systems i m positive this will change with time though all in all i very highly recommend this game but only if you can spare a good 70 hours becoming utterly addicted to it i can t recall a game i was as compelled to binge as this one in years for fellow technically minded sci fi nerds like me this game is absolutely worth it gameplay tips if you want any i ll mark as spoiler if you don t whenever you first find silicon make infrastructure to gather as make as many silicon plates as you think you need and then quadruple that infrastructure silicon is going to be your most used resource by far late game mostly for those dang information matrices the only unintuitive things i found were ray receivers and the dyson sphere planning screen as best as i could tell ray receivers even once they ve reached max efficiency have a cap of how much power they can draw or how many critical photons they can produce once the power your dyson sphere generates exceed the cap the ray receiver can draw only then do you need to make another one i didn t realize this til super late game and thought i only needed one ray receiver and was like wow my dyson sphere does jack diddly for power demands also put ray receivers at the poles light hits your poles all day and so they never lose efficiency there are other options besides nodes in your dyson sphere planning screen you can select other options that let you make latices between the nodes or shells and such i didn t realize this until late game too and was like oooohhhh that would ve been helpful to know a lot sooner play around with the shift key you can hold shift while using the upgrade tool or delete tool to perform that action on an entire line of conveyor belts you can also hold shift while laying conveyor belts to stop it from automatically trying to snap connect to other conveyor belts this is especially helpful when trying to run belts slightly above other belts
