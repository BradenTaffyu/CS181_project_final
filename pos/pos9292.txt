2016 got this game because friend has told me its ck2 in space never played ck2 but heard many fantastic stories and opinions about that game well and its definitely not ck2 in space its just a base framework for future addons dlc s a bit shallow game early game is really nice with exploration and early colonization and management mid game where alliances federation happens and colony micromanaging and later game which is boring as heck this game severly lacks proper mid late game content and crisis is not proper end game content kinda expected too see my neighbour to ally with me to fight againt extraterrestrial alien swarm but nop he was still angry at me it would be nice if we could cease fire for the sake of saving the galaxy while other empire are collapsing to them every ai behaved the same and any pacicift ai was hating me too becasue i was warmongering with my neighbour too much diplomacy is unpolished and shallow beyond agreements there is nothing else to do why i can t marry some pretty alien girl or set a no man land by comprosis if war takes too long combat system visuals are terrible and in the late game you just stack those fleets and let the disco lights happen there is no real tactical depth into it also ai allies vassals tend to follow your main fleet everywhere ai is not really fleshed out and it was the easiest cheapest way to make them usefull in the war instead of taking a time and planning your tactics with various generals from alliances on the galaxy map setting up objectives and everyone would know what to do you have this think how fantastic it would be but nah not even military junta government have anything similar to this yeah goverments are just bunch of raw stat boosts and ai behaviour alterations all alien races feel way too humanoid to mee this game could use more varied gameplay styles like devouring worlds instead of colonizing planets also where are robot races cyborg races its all the same gameplay only some ais will colonize more some less planets i won t mention how the game punishes you for having a big population and influence really limits your gameplay or several annoyanced like sectors or not so good ai this game also runs on 1 cpu come one its 2016 you can dream about generating 10k galaxies with 500 ais in the future with mods game also has some solid problem in the late game with the performance and how warscore is not so good idea what if i just want to glass every planet what if i don t really care about warscores and i want to quickly conquer their empire i don t really think every race would behave the same always respecting some kind of universal galaxy law about the warscore klingonds didn t they fought for the sake of combat and honours and some should fight for the same of domination afraidness using the weak sides right now it looks like this you conquer 3 planets 10year peace period and repeat its called a artifical time extender same goes for surveying systems with your science ship and clicking on every debris manually by shift click i can understand in the early mid but in the late there could be some kind of automatization there are bigger concerns than clicking on small x all around the galaxy less micromanaging in late game please no trade routes it would be nice to see small cargo ships travelling between your systems it would add a lot the the gameplay mechanics like cut the supply lines also no pirates really they only happen in 1 event and disappear forever no espionage no sabotages no family tree really no marriages no sabotagesgood game had fun but it just feels unfinished i really dig the random event and reading lore but there needs to be more of it especially in the mid late game its just average game at this moment kinda gets boring after a while maybe after year or two with some decent dlc updates this game will get better well for sure it will get
