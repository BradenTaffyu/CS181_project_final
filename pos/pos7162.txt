2020 to start let me say i am a massive fan of euro truck simulator 2 i played a lot of that game for many years now and one of my all time favourite games so let me explain what are the differences similarities bvetween ats and ets also i used to try the ats demo but didnt like it on my old computer but now on my new pc i decided to give it a try and here are my impressionssimilarities pretty much the whole menu with settings and stuff are similar to ets so was easy to find things i knew the process of how to drive collect xp etc everything else to be honest d differences base map feels small after 11 hours i discovered like 20 of it of course looking to buy dlc s just like with ets soon miles per hour being used in my truck elsewhere i could change it to the metric system yes european here d different and few unknown trucks to me funny if an american is reading this landscape so different in europe everything is much closer you drive a bit and you went through 2 countries meanwhile in ats driving along desert desrert still nothing ok finally a city in the same state xd btw this could be same in australia russia or whatever big country weather it s so hot ingame xd and barely rains with the same rain probability i would get rain all the time in ets here still rare dok this is almost not even about the game it s true for real life too d additional impressions i found out ats has a lot of easter eggs hidden compared to ets i found a lot more which i will explore and it includes ufo s ingame d i find this interesting and cool that here even if there is red light you can turn right as there is a right turning lane all the time and you can go through there and no fines i know it s a thing in america and since the ai did it i became sure of iti thought this will be a serious review but it ended up being different but yeah overall i would recommend the game ps when is aussie truck sim coming dd kappaps 1 year later im more used to the game i m less cultureshocked about it i would say the game is underrated but overall would say ets is better
