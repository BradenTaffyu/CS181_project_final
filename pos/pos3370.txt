2018 i would compare this game to the show death note where the first half is absolutley amazing but the second half is lackluster the first half of the game in driftwood there are so many quests and things to do each quest just as interesting as the last with an immersive city that feels like its lived in but then in the second half when your re on the 3rd island idk what happened it lost its magic with an island where all you do is pray infront of stones and there are no other quests than the one main storyline when you reach arx after that very dissapointing island it gets a bit better there are some quests to do other than the main story and they are interesting as well the combat through the entire game is great good progression to feel like your character is truly ready to become divine and if you play this game with a friend it is a great experience that for me kept me wanting to play this game till the end this game is definitly worth the first 40 hours to immerse yourself in the world however the 3rd and 4th island of the game falls short to the rest
