2020 when i first started playing fallout 76 i got more and more immensely disappointed with the state of the game especially with the introduction of fallout 1st i stopped playing however with wastelanders and my free steam copy i decided to give it another go i was kinda surprised to find myself actually enjoying the new update with the new story and npc s the characters are very well voice acted and the new quests are quite fun i feel like the update was a good step in trying to rescue the game the game is still buggy as expected which is something that really still needs to be addressed i m actually pretty keen for future free updates and events beyond wastelanders i still refuse to support the game however via fallout 1st
