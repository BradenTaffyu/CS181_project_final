2022 this game definitely has many flaws and issues but despite that i find myself having a fairly enjoyable time when playing this game is a great way to pass time in my opinion and if you play genuinely without using a ton of cheats it can even feel quite rewarding there are a lot of interesting and at times slightly questionable features that you can discover by playing various times and experimenting with the game and there are of ton of things to do there are some fun built in cheats that are fun to mess around with and there s a fairly good amount of customization so you can make some pretty interesting characters for your game although i enjoy this game it s just like any other game and of course it has flaws i m going to list down some of these flaws and try providing some tips on how to fix them or just make them easier to ignore starting off one of the main flaws of the game is that if you want to own everything it offers you have to pay a very large amount of money a lot of exciting features are only available if you pay for an expansion pack or something of the sorts and a lot of the things that the game offers in exchange for money are considered not worth the price a commonly used way to fix this is by downloading mods online that add new game mechanics furniture etc i have never myself tried this since i find the base game with the very few expansions i have good enough but i ve seen many people doing it and i m sure that there are a lot of places online that state which mods they think are the best and most exciting ones another flaw that i ve myself gotten upset over is the fact that character customization can be pretty limited for example i couldn t find anything close to my hairstyle in the game and had to settle for a slightly wavy hair for context i have short curly hair the main problem with this is that many people can t make themselves accurately in the game for reasons such as the game not having their hairstyle their facial features etc the most popular way to solve this is using cc custom content when making sims cc is custom content made by players that you can use in game and for some people it makes a huge difference i wouldn t necessarily consider this a flaw of the game but people often find themselves getting bored and running out of ideas for what to do since this game doesn t directly give you a goal or objective an easy way to solve this is to try setting a crazy goal for your sim and making rules to how you will achieve that goal or trying to successfully follow a storyline those were just examples but there are very easy ways to prevent boredom in the sims 4 this game has many more flaws than that but those are the main ones i ve encountered overall i just find this game enjoyable and think it s chaotic and rather funny so i would recommend it
