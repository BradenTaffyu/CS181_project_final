2020 game is great physics and graphics are amazing big lobbies too have had races with up to 70 other cars in multiplayer on one track however the ui needs some work especially with explanations and other aspects such as the ecu mapping you have to look on forums though game is great but not friendly towards new players at all regarding explaining how things work
