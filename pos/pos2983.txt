2022 incredible in depth tactical rpg with brilliant characters insane amount of freedom and multiple paths how to solve a problem especially fun with friends in coop the class system is great the tactical fights are engaging the story is somewhat complicated yet interesting and the world is open to explore and still gives you enough time and hints to learn some riddles and quests are really hard tho spoiler example i had to kill a stranded shark thingy somewhere at a beach miles away to loot some random foot or head of a dead person eat that as an elf so i can have a vision of that persons death just to know that the kid who tried to swim across the ocean to save its mother died especially if you try them after a break and the clue doesn t appear in your journal some quests are unnecessarily difficult cos you can sell quest related items so it can happen that after a long break you have no idea why you can t finish a specific quest rather annoying you cannot sprint i am really glad i installed the sprint mod the slow pace outside of combat doesn t add anything of value my 3 vanilla gameplay improvement mods are sprint let there be tooltips and infinite spirit vision i usually enjoy playing the vanilla experience but without these mods it can get ponderous you cant find a specific item cos its not marked you forgot to activate spirit vision to talk to a ghost etc it s just so much more convenient and doesn t take anything from the gameplay these are the only things which were negative my overall experience with this game is very good so i highly recommend this one
