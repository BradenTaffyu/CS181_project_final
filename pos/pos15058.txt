2019 the amount of support this game has been getting is something unheard of in the gaming world honestly the developers level of dedication to churning out new content for free almost every other month is astounding especially considering the game has been out since 2016 now to gameplay itself you will die a lot and you ll enjoy it this game has enough depth to keep you interested for months and depending on the amount of people you re surviving with this dynamic will also be different each time different character combinations will shift your survival focus to different things also it s not just a sandbox where you survive to explore a procedurally generated world there are certain events to complete bosses to beat and set pieces to make function and take advantage of all of them require planning and numerous attempts again you will die a lot but preparing for that is a challenge in itself building a self sustaining base with your friends is fun figuring out ways to beat bosses and survive seasons is fun i advise you to hold off youtube and wikis for a while and take pleasure in figuring out the game mechanics on your own all in all this game is a gift that keeps on giving i strongly recommend the game to all seeking either a casual experience with your friends or a challenging survival sandbox that has both style and depth to keep you entertained for months bar 2 out of 15 characters one of which you get for free if you own the hamlet dlc for the original game oh and cosmetics that you can get for free if you beat challenges during events
