early access review games getting review bombed by people that feel a game isn t f2p when you get access to everything the game has to offer except trading high roller extra character slots and the stash tab for buying the game they don t let f2p players come into hr or trade to keep people from making fresh accounts and using cheating software to ruin the experience of other players that have valuable gear the cheater then can sell for real money hence why f2p can also not trade in the hub to prevent that as well
