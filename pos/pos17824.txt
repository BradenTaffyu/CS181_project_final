2023 this is the game that started it all the first collectible card game all the others yu gi oh hearthstone pokemon they all ultimately diverged from this and after 30 years it remains kinda unsurpassed after thirty years there are innumerable cards mechanics sets and modes magic arena has a lot of them but not even remotely close to all magic arena s collection only stretches back till around late 2016 in full though it has quite a few older cards in various sets this is still more cards than you ll ever be able to memorize and certainly more than you can afford for any sane person what this gives you is incomparable amounts of freedom when crafting your deck you can spend years wracking your brain for all the different possible combinations it s an endless sandbox in that way most will result in a loss streak but that feeling when you make a deck that is fully yours and you can see your opponent has absolutely no idea what you re playing it makes it all worth it so let s talk about the details playerbase the playerbase is huge there are thousands of people in every mode no matter how niche and a queue taking longer than 20 seconds is always an oddity this game should probably be around for a long time pricing free player economy this game isn t particularly generous but it isn t brutally expensive either every day you can earn enough gold to buy 1 pack and enough experience to maybe get a pack in the free version of the battlepass every 2 days this will get you pretty much all individually every time you open a pack you progress to getting a wildcard which you can use to make any card of a given rarity eventually you can build up to making an op metadeck all for free there are also various free events which give you free decks overall the game is less generous than hearthstone but you can have fun as a free player remember you can go look up magic arena codes and find all the playx codes which will get you 48 free packs in total last i checked gameplay the most important part the gameplay you might have heard at some point that this game is very skill intensive and that having no rng on the cards means less rng in game well forget that this game has more rng than many other card games and is usually played best of three because of how hard you can get shutdown by rng in magic you have to draw your mana your starting hand will want to have mana in it and you will want to draw mana multiple times meaning in general you will be playing less cards than other games and have less options each turn you can become completely unable to play the match if you simply draw no mana or draw just mana there is still a lot of skill involved of course but even the dumbest most clueless player can easily beat a pro if the pro simply draws no mana expect to get frustrated and simply have to concede some of your best of one games otherwise it s great fun 60 card decks with as many as 4 of any card give you insane potential of deck building and longer matches will ultimately still have skill be the deciding factor aesthetics magic really reigns supreme here there is no one setting here there are endless planes each with their own unique themes and creatures what this means is that the game literally never runs out of things to put on their cards and that it can be as creative as it wants many cards are just gorgeous real works of art in comparison hearthstone looks like it was made for toddlers and yu gi oh for pedophilic weebs it s true in conclusion this is pretty much the best tcg there is but it may shorten your lifespan a little bit through frustration increased blood pressure and lower personal wealth
