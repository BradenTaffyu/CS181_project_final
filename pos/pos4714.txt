2023 fallout 4 is the first fallout game i ever finished and what a rough journey it was to get to that finish line so let me start with the fact that i got the goty version since i had such high hope for the game i also did not like the vanilla character creator and one thing led to another i found myself with like 30 mods ranging from unofficial bug fixes to fan made story expansions but as you ll learn later even mods could not make fallout 4 the game i hoped it was and i also was getting frequent crashes at the very start even before i modded the game so that didn t bode well i first assumed it was because i maxed out graphics since the game seemed like it was on the brink of breaking down this was before installing any mods mind you so i tried lowering them but the crashes persisted still so i cranked up the graphics again modded the game made my custom character and tried to push through and see if stability crashes would get any better and they did i had less crashes in the later game than i did in he first 15 20h or so so i started doing quests and i have to admit the game was just too overwhelming for me at the start i did not know what stuff to loot if i was supposed to loot everything or not and i was bombarded with side quests that are not marked as such i hate how quests in this game aren t separated to categories for you to know which is which even if they may appear to be obvious for some people even the repeatable radiant quests aren t marked as such i also missed the hint you get about v a t s system at the start so i did not know what button i had to press until i passed the 20h mark yup that s probably on me for not looking it up sooner oh before i forget it s also possible to get radiant quests at the very start of the game that require you to go to dlc locations you haven t even unlocked and even if you did the distance is just not worth it in the slightest what the duck bethesda i also lost my ssd a while back sadly so i had to play this on a hdd and boy oh boy what a mistake that was you see i m not used to having a loading screen every 5 minutes and this game is full of them every building you enter you get a loading screen sometimes you get a loading screen inside the building itself when you need to fast travel to somewhere you get slapped with double loading screens the fast travel one and another to enter the location and you can t fast travel out of a location until you exit it this coupled with the loading times majorly hindered my enjoyment of the game and since every building is filled with trash to loot and stupid me wanting to fully experience everything and not wanting to miss any collectibles terminals or stuff that would trigger side quests i felt the need to check everything or else i would ve probably missed something and let me tell you this is no way to enjoy the game it ll have the opposite effect i believe now that the correct way to play this was to just follow markers and get things done as soon as i could without having to waste hours looking through all the pointless lockers desks etc don t loot just do the objective graphics aren t everything but fallout 4 doesn t look that great even on the highest settings which is a shame i also faced countless bugs including some game breaking stuff like objectives not triggering npcs not doing what they were supposed to do animations getting stuck my pitboy disappearing altogether the esc tab buttons would stop working randomly until i restart the game npcs glitching through geometry and many other bugs cmon bethesda you can do better than this the story itself isn t that great and the endings or shall i say the ending the ending never changes it s sad to say but i actually had more fun playing some of the user created stuff than a lot of the vanilla stuff i also found it annoying how companions kept nagging you unless you play the way they like and had to get a mod to remove the messages you get every time you do something they don t like it s not something too major but i thought it was worth a mention oh yeah about the game being too overwhelming so when i first played this i kept having the feeling that maybe it s just not for me i should drop it and move on but i kept telling myself it d get better if i just force myself to push a bit further and i had to justify getting the goty edition somehow and many many hours later i got used to most systems and i was finally able to shake that feeling and enjoy the game after that i did a lot of exploring and tons of side quest and it was all alright not great but not bad either and that probably sums up how i feel about fallout 4 it s an alright game and it has the content to justify the price point it s just that said content is just okay at best with a ton of filler on the side nothing too exciting nothing that will wow you just a bunch of busywork for you to kill time i feel like bethesda was focused more on the quantity rather than the quality and it clearly shows and i personally have no use for filler and would rather play something 10 times shorter but actually memorable and full of quality content something that respects my time doesn t have the need to have me do pointless stuff because content about settlements i got a mod for that a mod that added an actual decent storyline sim settlements 2 which was pretty good and i highly recommend said mod also allowed me to make my settlers build their own instead of relying on me so i don t have much to complain about that but from what i read the vanilla systems are pretty tedious and bad so after 100h or so after finishing the super underwhelming main quest feeling robbed of a satisfying conclusion and after having to deal with all the slow loading screens all the bugs minor to game breaking and having those bugs extend to even the user created quests i just reached my limit i could not justify spending any more time on it even though i was looking forward to try the 2 major dlcs included in the goty game i just could not keep going any further i was just done with it all so in conclusion after all this you might think i hate this game i don t and i don t even consider it to be bad i certainly wouldn t call it good either it s with games like this that i wish steam offered a 3rd in between option for reviews if you have countless hours you want to waste on average to below average busywork if you re looking for an infinitely moddable game or if you just want a game where you can loot anything not nailed to the ground even if that loot is nothing to talk about and if you re fine with the famous bethesda jank and don t mind the frequent bugs than this game is perfect for you seriously the content is there if this is what you re looking for it is worth the price but if what you re looking for is a good engaging story a bug free game something memorable than you should totally look elsewhere 6 10
