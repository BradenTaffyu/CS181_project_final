2020 there will be a tldr at the bottom but i d recommend reading through if you re seriously considering this game first off the number of hours here is exclusively actual driving as i use a different launcher which doesn t track the huge number of hours modding or setting up in short assetto corsa is in my opinion the best overall racing simulator on pc right now it s worth waiting for a sale and getting the version with all of the dlc however it is nowhere near its full potential right out of the box assetto corsa as it is from kunos the developers is a good simulator with a decent selection of cars and arguably limited number of tracks it doesn t have night and it doesn t have weather and the graphics are pretty good but nothing amazing its greatest strengths are the force feedback for steering wheels and the very realistic physics of the cars especially the tyres however boy oh boy can it get so much better like we re talking a 7 10 to a 9 or 9 5 10 kind of a difference see to truly get the most out of assetto corsa you will need to mod it a bit i promise even if you re not that technical or good with computers it is one of the easiest games to mod i have ever encountered here s what you ll need to do 1 most important google assetto corsa content manager and download it this is a replacement launcher that adds an amazing amount of new content to the game all for free 2 within content manager install the custom shaders patch under settings this adds a whole stack of stuff to the game including dynamic lighting 24 hr days so it literally adds night driving to a game that was never intended to have it and more physics features all configurable3 google race department and search for sol within the website racedepartment has an enormous number of mods for assetto corsa that add literally thousands of new tracks and cars to the game but sol is a mod that adds weather to the game as well as a bunch of visual improvements 4 go to racedepartment and download whatever cars and tracks you want there are thousands if you ever need help look at the r asssettocorsa subreddit or go on the racedepartment forums it s pretty amazing that just with mods the community has greatly improved graphics added night driving and added a detailed weather system as well as a stack of cars and tracks the vr support is also 10 10 so immersive you will definitely need a wheel to play this game controller support is terrible to the point where i can t recommend it for keyboard or controller i use a logitech g920 wheel tldr wait for a sale then buy the version with all the dlc you need a wheel controller support is rubbish vr support is great the game is massively improved with mods specifically content manager with custom shaders patch and sol they add night weather better physics and better graphics great game my favourite racing simulator
