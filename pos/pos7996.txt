2019 early access review very solid simulator with a lot of attention to detail that gets constantly updated be it for driving seriously to test out the limits of the cars to simply cruise around to enjoy the landscape or to simply crash your car in a spectacular manner this sim has it all there are also many high quality community made mods to expand the car park and add more maps only bad points are the mediocre ai that might be improved on who knows and the lack of a multiplayer which apparently is not easy to do because of synchronising the complex damage models definitely recommended
