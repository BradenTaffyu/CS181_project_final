product received for free this is a very fun and entertaining game once you get used to it i just got my gaming pc a month ago and my son sent me a gift of this game and glad he did it definitely takes some getting used to as far as controls go but once you get used to it it is nice i would recommend starting off with the smaller and easier jobs first and start saving your credits and buy your tools like the car was station dyno station etc get all of the tools and start taking on the big jobs a whole lot easier all in all if you get it you won t regret it just be patient and learn the controls
