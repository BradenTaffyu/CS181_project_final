2017 here the night before the total war warhammer 2 release i am finally writing my review for the first total war warhammer i love this game for its diverse factions and playstyles i find something i like in each faction and each campaign is radically different i have invested more time in this game than most other games i own because i can get lost for hours storming the dawi karaks with my endless greenskin hordes raising the dead as the vampire counts and razing the empire defending sigmar s empire with karl franz or trying to conquer all the old world as the wood elves yes total domination as the knife ears who hug trees and are totally in tune with nature dude does the game have flaws of course but the things it does right totally overwrites most flaws the dlc policy was shaky and corporate at the beginning of the game s life cycle but it improved with sheer quality and plenty of free content over the following months i highly recommend this game to anyone interested even with the next installment literally 24 hours away see you in total war warhammer 2
