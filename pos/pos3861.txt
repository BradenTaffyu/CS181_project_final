2019 early access review a pretty cool x com type of strategy game well with the exception that a 95 chance to hit actually hits 9 out of 10 times lolalso there isn t any squad or base building as of yet new characters will join the company as the story progresses it s got a nice story about what s basically a sort of licensed vigilantes fighting crime haven t reached the end yet but so far it s good a few gang wars to jump in between the odd cultists and even some dangerous wildlife that needs culling i rather enjoy the mastery system this game has even if i had albus dying a million times over before finally having a decent setup you can add certain masteries to boost stats also sets of masteries that give an extra boost and there s quite a bit of choice there maybe seems a little overwhelming at first characters can also change into different classes with their class specific masteries giving even more choice in how to deploy them for instance the main character can become full on swordsman or focus more on magic as magic knight of course there s also yer basic equipment and equipment crafting you can do later on although it s a bit of a grind to get all the stuff for it another nice thing is the enviromental effects the game already hints at the first mission to use flashbangs in the dark which adds some extra confusion there s also added knockback when standing on ice or stunning lightning effects when on the water it s a nice touch also chill music imo it s still early access but so far it s a nice game already
