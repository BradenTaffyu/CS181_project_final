2015 i have been playing pc games since i first got my hands on wolfenstein on a 3 5 floppy disk this game is easily the best game i have ever played and in all the experiences i have had playing them nothing compares to that first time i reached orbit and returned to the ocean safely this game is brutal and merciless but that only makes the accomplishments so much more precious
