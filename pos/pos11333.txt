2017 early access review youtube video 7 days to die 02 06 2017 00 06 50 01 views 405 base built in survival mode our first real home within the game about 76 hours of play on this map this base can survive a hoard of zombies on very high settings without us firing off a shot the above is my base video amateur but lots of work well what can i say this game is dominating my life when i first began to play i wasnt sure i have a monster rig play in 4k the graphics are maybe a couple of years behind i had to turn my mouse down in sensitivty worrying start crafting oh dear is this a game where its impossible to move forward without searching for hours and hours i get bored well i should not have worried i have not experienced such a tense and great atmosphere since stalker for me the balance is just right each 7th night a bigger and bigger horde come that wait for the red sky is awesome you spend a good amount of time making your home and it does become your home not just a base and learn how to do things better and better this is a fantastic game sense of achievment at getting your first cement mixer forge etc etc just great took me about 14 days to realise i could disasemble things with my wrench this was a game changer suddenly i was getting engines from cars and able to get forges from abandonded houses etc i didnt realise i could do this when i am mining collecting wood etc you are constantly on edge pausing to look around making sure you are not being stalked not all zombies are loud so this game does provide genuine jump scares i play on a private self made game with my daughter and have had no connection problems granted its a lan but we meet up work together and fight the horde having a great time really dont hesistate to get this game its superb if the first hour of play you are feeling unsure stick it out you become good but the game keeps pushing you the first zombie i encountered was a frozen lumberjack and i just felt the zombies were bullet proof dont worry as you get better and craft weapons it all changes good luck do yourself a favour and get the game i find myself working out amendments to my base whilst at work sometimes in the board room which i think is funny but a testament to how this game grabs you enjoy
