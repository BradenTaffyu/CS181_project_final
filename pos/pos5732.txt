2021 early access review we were dangerously low on gold and were down to the last of our supplies knowing that we stood the best chance of profiting during wartime we ceased our retreat over hill and glen and turned to confront the pursuing enemy though at a disadvantage we met for a parley with their commander we greatly outnumber you he said urging us to surrender disagreeing with his offer we prepared for the battle archers to the rear atop a hill for elevation and as a vantage point infantry to the front form a line cavalry to me we stared down the wooded hillside and watched the enemy approach in mass every now and then we would see their armor gleaming in the sunlight shieldwall my hero cried the front line closed the gaps between them and stood shoulder to shoulder a rain of arrows pelted them killing those that were to slow to raise their shields in time our archers returned fire with a volley of our own the sound of bowstrings thrumming and the whistling of arrows flew overhead spotting the enemy commander as the army emerged from the treeline my hero led our cavalry though small in number back around the hill and along the right flank of the enemy they had no idea we were there the sound of crashing steel and splintering wood echoed through the trees we could not see the two armies as they crashed but we heard the cries long before we saw them there they were the red uniforms of the vladians were unmistakable against the verdant green of our battanian horde their backs were turned to us as their archers fired up the hill that we had chosen as our refuge charge my hero cried our mounted units quickly advanced into the line of attacking archers and cut many down in our first pass looking up the hill i saw that the enemy had foolishly advanced into the waiting spears of our scorpion formation their numbers had immensely dwindled my hero gave the order at them he shouted our battanian infantry broke their formation and charged down the hillside using their momentum to run down the now retreating imperials among them was the enemy commander urging his routed army to turn back and attack rallying the cavalry once more we charged toward our prize
