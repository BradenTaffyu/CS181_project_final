2022 played during the free weekend decided to toss in the 10 for when it was on sale to continue playing and i ll say this i ve warmed up to this game quite a lot however i think there s two very big caveats to fallout 76 if you hated the stuff that fallout 4 added changed removed or shoved into fallout you probably won t enjoy 76 basebuilding the armor system modular weapons etc it s a live service game through and through this means premium currency battlepasses thankfully it s mostly free and even a subscription service i ll get to fallout 1st on its respective page one day aside from that the game has made leaps and bounds to fix what was wrong on release obviously so it s nice to see bethesda fixing a game post release instead of their usual mo of making modders fix their stuff just be aware that as with most bethesda games there s some glitchy jank goin on some that we know and love and some that s honestly a little worrying at times
