game is in a pretty good state in 2024 considering it s age there s a ton of content in the game and most of it is fully voice acted which is a huge benefit it s just simply enjoyable to listen to the conversations in the game with the npc s and during those moments it feels like a movie or a classic bioware crpg like the original knights of the old republic the game is also a star wars fans dream and the mmo to play as one as there are so many places and things in found in the star wars universe albeit much of it is build from the same pieces of graphical elements but the game engine and it s age has to be considered nevertheless later expansion areas starting from shadow of revan almost look pretty the planet rishi is the most stunning place i ve seen in the game and the mix of space pirates with booty bay from wow it just works what doesn t work is the game engine itself hero engine has it s issues currently it s impossible to switch between full screen and windowed modes without the game getting stuck indefinitely additionally there is no proper ultra wide monitor support then again the game likes to lag at times and feels somewhat unresponsive luckily it s quite slow paced as a game especially when leveling up and during cutscenes that variable performance isn t a huge issue i have no experience of high end raiding and don t know how it works or is it even playable at that level but for experiencing the story and playing casually the game is very playable and enjoyable especially if you haven t played previously i ve heard you shouldn t subcribe to the game via steam and use the swtor website instead just a disclaimer
