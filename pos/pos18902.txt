2014 update for this review this game is ridiculously expensive and only under extreme circumstances i would buy it with all of the dlc s which contain several core gameplay mechanics these extreme circumstances would probably be the summer sale or christmas sale if all content for this game is 75 off or more otherwise stay away tl dr this a great game but only with all the variety of features that the dlc unlock unfortunately these all cost quite the fortune stay away old review this game this game is the grandest of all the grand strategy games existing today this review could easily be considered as a comparison between the two games civilization v and europa universalis iv to compare it to the game civilization v europa universalis iv focuses on more complexity with expansion and conquest as well as more resources to limit your aggression the strategy in europa universalis iv is much deeper the historical connection is stronger the ai is better civ 5 however lets you play over a very long time period it lets you take over the entire world and stomp on the ai it is easier to learn and master so requires less patience and persistence the dlc pricesin europa universalis iv the dlc is not mandatory but is fun to play with i don t recommend buying it unless you have money to throw around whereas in civilization v major dlc is mandatory for gameplay and is considered an essential for any hardcore civ player to summarize this with math discluding sales europa universalis iv gives more content for its price and more gameplay as well 39 99 game 9 99 14 99 4 99 optional non mandatory dlcs 70 00 total civilization v alone isn t much fun to play and is also pricy however it has fairly pricy dlcs to add to the game 29 99 game 29 99 bnw 19 99 g k 4 99x5 per other civilization 80 min 100 00 totali also often see the two games on sale so i recommend snagging them up for cheap i got europa universalis iv for 14 99 and dlc for 19 99 only spending about 35 dollars in summary i like them both euiv as a historical grand strategy game and civ 5 as a build expand and conquer arcade strategy game now many people will usually choose one and stick to one game those differences determine whether you prefer favor either of the two games but in my opinion if you have the money you re better off buying europa universalis iv
