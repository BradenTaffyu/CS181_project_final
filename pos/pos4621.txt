2015 pros gameplay itself it is a unique medieval rpg with stategical elements world map that represents sandbox gameplay do whatever you want combat system is simple but hard to master ai is smart on high difficulty levels multiplayer is fun a lot of good modscons lack of unique and interesting quests quests are all the same visuals are outdated mods can help sometimes world of the game feels too empty you just cant believe in this wooden npcs gameplay can become very repetitivei recommend this game of course there are a lot of issues but there is a great mod community most of the mods will change your game experience in a good way
