2016 how do i describe it it s at the same level shogun 2 was when it came out a step up from its predecessors and a step behind what we had hoped for this game needs to be good and needs to be well received i believe for the total war franchise to continue on proconnerus i m happy the ai doesn t derp it s way into sieges but the cities are simpler so it feels like a bit of a trade off especially with auto ladders though its realistically the only solution to the ai s general sad panda face at the prospect of going up walls the ai seems to be able to competently handle its new unit types i was particularly impressed with chaos s use of marauder cav and tundra wolves for skirmishing however the ai also seems to favour the if we engaged in a line today we re certainly going to engage in a line tomorrow there s quite alot of love thats gone into the character models from what i ve seen the art work is certainly on point though who ever thought thorgrims angrylazyboychair3000 was a going solution is a bit well daft i haven t seemed to inherit many of the technical issues people are going on about right now the con part of it is that theres a huge over the technical soudness and optimisation of this game business as usual for tw pcon connerus dont touch multiplayer in early days right now its broken af though i suspect server load and glorious comrade australian internet is to blame no rpg style shogun 2 general avatar for multiplayer game was basically made for that style of multiplayer and would have shined with it all in all this game is worth the dollars my hip pocket regret hasn t burned through my trousers so thats a good thing but if you want to hold off then i heard theres a nice steam sale something something something
