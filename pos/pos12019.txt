early access review first factory game i ve played always been daunted by factorio and have been waiting for satisfactory to hit 1 0 before i jump in but this game is incredible extremely polished banging soundtrack tons of things to mess with and learn and all with lots of difficulty options to give new players a no stress environment to learn in nearly 40 hours in and i can tell i ve got a long way to go came back for the supporter edition because this is the kind of quality we should be supporting
