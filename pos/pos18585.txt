2019 if you have ever played any bloons game ever play this one i cannot even explain how much fun this game can be hop on by yourself or with a few buddies and just mess around seeing how ridiculous of a round number you can get to a bunch of heroes full of personality the most expansive upgrade tree in the series you can melt away countless hours coming up with different combinations of monkeys on different maps so much else i could explain but the game is still being updated at the time of this review thanks ninja kiwi for another amazing game
