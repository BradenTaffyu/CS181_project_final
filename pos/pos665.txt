2017 stardew valley is an amazing game i haven t even played much and you can simply see by playing 4 or so hours of the game how much the game has to offer when looking at any gameplay of the game it looks like it might just be a glorified mainstream farming simulator but i will tell you it has so much more to offer some of these things that the game includes are relationships with people a hack and slash mining experience economic selling and buying and even a little bit of story now i ll go ahead and go over some personal pros and cons for stardew valley pros allows an insane amount of playtime and it d take a while to feel like you ve fully completed the game the game looks absolutely stunning for it s pixel look it s playable on potato computers the game has an upcoming co op mode that is supposed to come out sometime during the summer of 2017 the characters and residents in game are pretty well thought out and have good characteristics and personalities cons updates are slow coming granted the team for this game is quite small the game can feel a bit slow at the start sometimes the game can feel like you re in an endless loop of doing the same exact thing everyday co op keeps getting delayed overall i d have to recommend this game and i love it i ve pushed people to get the game as well as i have bought it for people i d say buy this game
