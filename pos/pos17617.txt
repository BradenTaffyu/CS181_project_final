2017 i bought this game and spent a full work week ca 40 h on it the first week i had it and managed to complete one map on the human campaign it was extremely addictive and i had a lot of fun even though i cursed quite a lot but who doesn t when you are immersed in the game this game probably won t appeal to everyone but if you like great battles and slow paced more strategic combat mixed with heroes of the might and magic styled map browsing walking with your commanders around the map you re in for a treat the graphics details and animations are amazing considering the scale of the battles i ran this game on 2xgtx970 with sli and it worked really well
