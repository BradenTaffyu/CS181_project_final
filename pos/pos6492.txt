2018 never in a million years would i have thought that i would purchase a driving simulator i gave this game a try and it is one of the best games i own that overwhelmingly positive is no lie scs is one of the best developers out there just think of the trash developers littering steam with their garbage scs is a developer that is constantly improving ets2 most importantly though this game actually has utility for real life if you treat it like the simulator it is it can improve your driving which is always a positive use your mirrors properly stay in your lane watch your speed learn how to turn with a large vehicle make you aware of your large blind spots as a trucker would have to be etc the rest of the games you own and play are mostly just for fun and have no usefulness for the real world in fact they are in all honestly wasting your time not this game though if it improves your awareness on the road as it has mine then it is worth more than all the other games on steam give it a try you will not be disappointed
