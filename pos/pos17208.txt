2020 i m not a huge fan of the historical total war games but i love the warhammer variety and this game just clicked for me in a way the others have not orcs and elves are more interesting to me than any of the stuff based in reality i would say the only big negative is that if you like the game at all you probably are going to want the majority of the dlc including the stuff for the first total war warhammer this makes it the most expensive game i own counting all the dlc there is a fairly steep learning curve and i had to watch some youtube videos to figure out how to properly direct my troops but after the first few hours it has become one of my favorite games it combines aspects of something like civilization on the overworld with same pretty great epic battle
