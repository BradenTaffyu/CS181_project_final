2020 i am not quite sure how to write this review i feel like i have to write something about this masterpiece but i don t know how so these will be my rambling thoughts i guess just to get this out of the way i 1000 recommend this game to everyone go into it blind do not look anything up until you have played the game atleast 3 times plz just trust me i will try to keep this as spoiler free as possible so someone who wants to play this game blind can read this without getting spoiled i will put spoilers in the spoiler form thing if i put some in here i don t remember when or why i bought this game i think i d heard about this game i thought the combat looked cool i think i m remembering now when i think about it i thought this was going to be a full blown arpg heavily focused on the combat i read about the game and thought the story seemed kinda cool seemed like an awesome game right deep fast paced combat with a cool story attached well what i found after my 78 hours at this time was a masterpiece in this media i ve never seen a game play out like this and i m not just talking about the story itself i m talking about how the game presents itself i had almost no expectations from this game except a few people messaging me from my friends list when they saw i was playing this game they were curious about my progress and my impressions and this and that that is always a good sign for a game now i will dive into some of the things that makes this game stand out and what makes it such an enchanting magical and phenomenal experience story storytelling and presentation let s begin with the story nier automata is a unique game in how it tells you its story most games tells you everything except branching paths etc in your first playthrough you play the game once you complete the main quest and sidequests explore the world and now you ve probably experienced most of what that game has to offer nier automata is not like this you beat this game once and you ve only scratched the surface the game makes this very clear aswell i m not going to say anything about the story or how it plays out but i will say that you should play this game atleast 3 times completely blind the story and all characters are masterfully written and presented there were a few points in the game that blew me away for one reason or another trust me you will not truly experience the game after your first playthrough whatever you think about the game and story at that point will change by the time you finish your third playthrough music holy in my ass the music in this game there are no words to truly describe how phenomenal it is i can t say much about it other than the fact that it has so much depth the music changes the songs change forms each song has light and heavier versions to fit whatever is happening in the story game whatever i will not say much more other than this is the best soundtrack to any game i have ever played or seen masterful enchanting phenomenal incredible amazing powerful sad deep cheerful the list goes on personality and detail this game has so much personality and love poured into it i find myself laughing and smiling all throughout the game the dialogue and your dialogue options especially they are perfect hilarious adorable cute sad deep powerful voice acting is on the same level i found myself crying multiple times throughout this game i cry very easily so maybe that s not saying much but anyway this game oozes personality and it is a pure joy to play it for the most part you can feel the love that was put into it you can see how thought out it is you can hear it see it and feel it when i say that this game is detailed i don t just mean in the graphics or in any one part of the game everything has so much thought put in it every single little thing you see cutscene or hear read dialouge every little sound everything you see and the quests and characters everything has a meaning and everything comes together to blow your mind in the very end when everything gets shown to you you will think about to all the small things you heard and saw and you will say i understand you will feel ill to your stomach your heart will break in a million pieces i m tearing up just writing this it s an absolutely incredible experience masterfully told and presented graphics i had to edit this in cuz i forgot to mention it the way this game uses colour to tell a narrative is incredible and so clever i will not say what i mean with this i will keep it very vauge and let you figure it out on your own the game itself is beautiful beautiful enviroments are beautiful colour is beautiful the map is souls like in the sense that it s interconnected it is a way smaller map but you revisit the same areas over and over and eventually some areas change in both small and big ways you get to know the world and you fall in love with it animations are so good there is so much detail in the animations i can t believe it it is a joy to watch the characters do anything wether it s fighting walking running transitioning from running to walking whatever it is it s all so smooth and fluid the game is pure eye candy in every sense i could go on and on and on but i think i am nearing the character limit so i will try to sum it up somehow there is a meme that people want to erase their memory so that they could relive a show or a movie or a game or whatever well this game is the game that actually makes me wish that it was a real thing that i could do i ve said that to a few games and movies but i never really meant it but for this game i do i wish i could forget all about this and relive it all over do not miss out on this game you might look at it and think it s some japanese hack n slash with weird 8 bit crap and overly exposed anime girls sexualized or whatever do not miss this game this game is not that this is one of the absolute best games i have ever played it is so unique in how it presents itself the detail and thought love and personality put into it will blow you away do not be fooled from your first playthrough you will merely scratch the surface at that point whatever you think the game is going for will probably be wrong i can not say enough good things about this game there are some issues with the game i guess i do not feel the need to mention them at all they are not issues just annoyances but they do not affect the experience hell it s even meant to be annoying sometimes which is made clear by the characters once again buy this game play this game laugh and learn about the world and characters then cry think about every little small detail you saw and heard that seemed super weird and out of place and cry some more think back and your eyes will open and then you will cry some more your heart will break but for some reason you will do it all over again you will play this game again to relive all the good moments the bad moments the details in between to see everything with the knowledge about what is actually going on and who the characters are and the whole game will turn from a cheerful and happy tone atleast in the start to a dark grim cloud this game is a masterpiece everything about this game is amazing please buy this game and play this game please
