2018 update 3 i m gonna post my original review back at the top a lot of modders have been super helpful and made it so you can still find their 1 9 1 mods and play with them this is the part of the review that garnered a lot of attention because i explained to a lot of people how to play 1 9 if they still wanted to do so here is how to enjoy this game right now look over to the left where it says stellaris right click choose propertiesclick on betasclick 1 9 1play with full mods and fun do not use 2 0 wait a very long time for that i have logged a lot of hours in stellaris i ve played hundreds upon hundreds under 1 9 and 2 0 and i am sorry to say that i find 2 0 to be dreadfully boring stellaris was a solid game made pretty decent with mods at v 1 9 but v 2 0 did not incrementally change the game it dramtatically changed space travel and intergalactic war in the game most annoyingly they took away features of the game warp travel is all but removed war is broken badly with lots of illogical rules on whether you can go to war with someone and skirmishes or renegade actions by an admiral are impossible it takes an already somewhat lifeless game and makes it even duller and blander what should have been fixed in 2 0 is the incredible lifelessness of the ai races you play against for instance i often go to war against a race just so i can get to a research project in their system for example i need the irritating inixiri to finish of my xeno collection and wrap up my quest in the situation log there is no way to get the race who happens to own the system i need access to open their borders to me so the only way to get to that system is to go to war with them even though we have ambassadors we can t communicate i know it is ai and this is hard to do but it isn t that hard to realize that if there is a list of things i need to do and one of them is in their system and they have their borders closed then i will need access also i will be playing and realize an alien race has their borders closed to me or they will announce that they are closing their borders so i open the screen to communicate with them and tell them that i am closing my borders to them every time they seem befuddled as to why i would close my borders to them as if they just closed borders to me but they have no idea why i am retaliating by closing my borders to them it takes any feeling of reality away from the whole thing and that wouldn t be hard to fix a simple flag that checks to see if they have closed their borders could cause a response to be different and they could respond this will just make things even worse between us or we realize you are doing this in retaliation for our closing borders to you but this is not the answer or anything that shows they aren t just a lousy version of a bot making ai feel more alive would have been a far better use of the 2 0 update than ripping warp travel out of the game and making war a confusing mess of illogical garbage 1st update well that didn t last long you can still play 1 9 1 the way i describe below but most of the mods have been updated to 2 0 and while there are supposedly ways to use old mods i haven t had any luck i even have all the old mods saved but i can t seem to make the game see them here s my new updated review i see a lot of people who like the new version saying that those of us who don t like this version are stupidheads and we just don t know how to play computer games basically if we don t play it like they do then we are wrong and they talk about wars and chokepoints and doom fleets and so on i m here to tell you why they are wrong i have logged an absurd amount of time playing this game wrong apparently and i ll tell you why it is broken now i played this game to explore the universe i wanted to find new planets to settle with interesting features unusual archeaolgy and neat existing buildings or underground caverns or aliens i enjoyed expanding my empire i didn t fight many wars when i did i wanted to win them quickly and get back to expanding and exploring now i m bored i am trapped in my home system and nowhere to go at the beginning of the game i can t go anywhere fast and unless i am very lucky and surrounded with interesting systems and no advanced ai s my game is boring boring boring bor ing i m bored now someone correct me if i am wrong but isn t the purpose of games to make me not bored 1 9 1 made me not bored 2 0 makes me bored that is a massive fail and they could have let us choose which drive we wanted but nope we were wrong and we were playing the game wrong and we are going to be forced to play it right it isn t enough to tell us we are unsophisticated losers who weren t playing the game properly our noses apparently need to be rubbed in the wrongness of how we were playing the game did i mention that i m bored how and why did they make this game boring smhoriginal post below here is how to enjoy this game right now look over to the left where it says stellaris right click choose propertiesclick on betasclick 1 9 1play with full mods and fun do not use 2 0 wait a very long time for that
