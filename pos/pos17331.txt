2019 in short words this might be one of the best total war games to date it connects good battles with many deep campaign mechanics that tw warhammer games are lacking i m not fan of the setting and i was very sceptical about this title but since i bought it it grew on me there are two game modes which differ a bit romance mod is the main with powerful single entity heroes with abilities that can change the tide of battles records mode nerf heroes a bit they come with plenty of cavalry bodyguards more experienced your hero is larger bodyguards he have also you can equip all your heroes with weapons armors mounts ancilliaries and followers which will make them appear different on the battlefield and grant them unique bonuses and abilities battle ai is probably the best in the entire series maybe not extremely intelligent but ai does decent job trying to use their missile units flank with cavalry protect archers with infantry rarely i see them doing something illogical or dumb battle ai is much more improved from warhammer where it was very passive so you could easily use all your ammunition to kill it now it moves away from the walls inside the city when you have advantage in range units when it notices that you have no ammo left ai comes back trying to defend the gates blocking any breakthroughs with units making it difficult to get inside even if you break the first line usually there is second line of troops trying to block the streets if ai garrison has an army inside it is much more difficult to assault even when attacking from few directions they spread more units to block other ways inside my onli gripe was that town garrisons are pretty small smaller than minor towns garrisons so you need to build special bulding for more units but i think its a small issue because mods for bigger garrisons or maybe official patch should make this right there is plenty of units there are militia one available for every faction and general there are few faction units each faction have usually 2 of them there are special units unlocked by tech tree reforms which are called dragons there are dragons with axes swords cavalry archers each call differently most interesting are azure dragons glaive infantry with bows they have special formation where two first lines form up against cavalry charge and rest is sitting behind and shooting from safe it should be mentioned that each general can recruit to 6 units and you have 5 different types of generals higher general rank better special units he can recruit for example strategist on level 3 can recruit medium crossbowmen and on level 6 heavy crossbowmen and sentinel can recruit special medium sword infantry you can have maximum three generals in one army campaign is much more interesting than in other tw games diplomacy for the first time works got that guy which you wanted to trade with but he said no everytime not anymore now you know exactly why they want peace or agreements game shows you how much points you need to make deal done for example if there is 5 0 when you are proposing peace it means you need to soften the deal with some cash if you crushed them in few battles the score might be 15 that means you can order them to give you additional money or even force them into being your vassal there is also a great option with quick deal you click it and choose trade agreement and you see all guys who may want to trade with you it even says maybe or yes that means you need to offer those guys that are not convinced few things in return moving on there is a food mechanic which affects you in many different ways you need food to replenish troops and make your towns growing but if you have food surplus you might sell it to other lords for money or agreements if you have plenty of farms but not many high income regions you can get a lot of gold just from food distribution population is coming back bigger the town is the more people it can sustain and it gives bonuses to income and replenishment you need to upgrade your town to get more building slots and higher population cap not everything is perfect and the worst part of the game is that there are many unique lords and generals but there is only few dozen of them when you play and recruit more they almost always look very simillar with same bad weapons and armor so in the lategame when some of your heroes die of old age the game is a bit less interesting but it helps that when you reach king rank three kingdoms are formed leaders became emperors and you need the other 2 of them to abdicate or conquer their emperor seat which is in their capital its pretty interesting mechanic because emperors still can make peace and trade agreements but cant ally with each other if you have a slower start it might happen that ai trigger the event and you wont even be one of the emperors then you need to capture one of the seats for you to become a pretender there are few bugs and maybe few mechanics that dont work as intended but nothing game breaking or annoying enough to make me stop playing satisfaction mechanic and relations between characters should be more impactful spy system is interesting and you can do amazing things with it but your spies need a bit of luck to get hired by other factions to make it worthwhile music is great in this game there are many tracks i think and each of them different that i dont hear them repeat too often even when playing long sessions for many hours music in battle is more tense and during campaign its more calm pleasant for ears there are also cool options to choose from like changing colour palettes you can use romance palette while playing in records mode etc there are unit cards and alternative unit cards english or chinese voiceovers with english subtitles not everyone might like it but characters do a bit trashtalking during battles some lines are a bit cringe but i mostly like them tldr as long tw fan my first game was medieval 1 i can really recommend this game it isn t flawless but it is probably the best release of ca game in the studio history battles are good campaign is great and character focus is making this game a bit more interesting few small patches and mods should make this a masterpiece 9 10
