it s amazing to thing a game from the 90 s with minor graphical upgrades and a few quality of life features thrown in is this good but age of empires ii definitive edition is still great over 30 nations to choose from plenty of updates a steady player base and new content with rebalancing keeps this game something replayable and enjoyable only two very minor gripes don t call an edition definitive when new content is still to drop and fix pathing for melee units
