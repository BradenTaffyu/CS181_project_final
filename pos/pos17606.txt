2017 total war warhammer isn t the most in depth of the total war games i ll admit it i also own attila and i ll say attila is far more in depth and complex than warhammer that being said it does not mean that warhammer is a bad game far from it warhammer is absolutely amazing what you get instead of very in depth politics diplomacy and city management is a highly fun and addictive battle system the visuals on the campaign map and the battlefields alike are gorgeous ready to be littered with the bodies of the men of your armies and the armies of your foes alike instead of the traditional light heavy units in previous games you get specific unit types each with their own weaknesses great weapon infantry will easily be able to crush regular often shielded infantry however they won t be able to advance on missile troops without being riddled with arrows or bullets so there is still a great deal of thinking that has to go into composing your army especially with the monstrous units which can range from trolls to giants to undead dragons to daemonic manticores speaking of which let s go into how unique each faction feels as they are all incredibly distinct the empire is the most basic familiar faction to total war so it s recommended that you start out as them they play essentially as you would expect with no real special tricks added to them though their unit roster is interesting with demigryph cavalry that wreak havoc on infantry and steam tanks that can devestate opponents from afar there are the dwarfs who are also a good starting point though they lack cavalry and due to a certain height disadvantage are often slow but they have qutie a few flying units gyrocopters that can bomb enemies and swoop down to deal some major damage and soften up units they also have a feature called the book of grudges which requires you to get revenge on enemies quickly as the more grudges that pile up the more penalties you will face ex one of your armies is attacked and defeated you will get a grudge that orders you to defeat that lord s army the longer it remains the worse relations you ll have with other dwarf factions and public order will gradually lower there s the greenskins who are incredibly savage in both a lore sense and a gameplay sense if greenskin armies do not fight for a while their fightiness meter will go down if it reaches a certain low level they will start suffering attrition as soldiers will begin fighting each other with more veteran armies it s easier to manage but fresh armies cannot simply sit around they have to go out and fight they ve got quite a few monsters at their disposal trolls giants and even giant spiders vampire counts are one of the more unique ones in the sense that they cannot simply march through enemy territory they have to make sure the province their in has enough vampiric corruption or else they will suffer attrition this can be done by sending agents into the province or by attacking a nearby unguarded town and capturing it likewise units of other non vampire armies will suffer attrition in lands that have a certain level of vampiric corruption lords also have unique ability called raise the dead which allows them to instantly recruit units often after a battle and some units have fallen is this a good idea they ve got all the kind of units you d expect from an undead army flying monstrous bat creatures zombies skeletal knights and those previously mentioned undead dragons that lords and heroes can ride upon bretonnia a free lc faction that is essentially france with arthurian legend they have a chivalry system which will provide them benefits for chivalrous acts like burning down the settlement of non humans such as greenskins however chivalry can be lost by doing things such as sacking settlements or setting armies into raiding positions as expected with a faction that has arthurian influences they are reliant on a lot of knights very cavalry heavy faction the downside of this is that their infantry is incredibly weak very low leadership and easily broken though their archers can do a good bit of damage from afar early game they are challenging but getting cavalry later game makes things a good bit easier the warriors of chaos an actual dlc faction that i did get for free because i bought the game during the first week personally my favorite but that s because i like the aesthetic and being evil the only dlc faction that i ll include here because i do not own the others they are a horde faction they are unable to conquer any settlements they can either sack them or raze them to the ground they are also able to awaken certain norscan tribes think vikings but instead of worshipping oden and the aesir they worship daemons hellbent on destroying the world to act as their military allies after defeating certain settlements near their starting position they are quite a challenge initially as armies cannot be too close to each other or they ll suffer attrition as they ll fight each other they can also spread chaos corruption in provinces like vampiric corruption that will cause non chaos armies to suffer attrition unlike vampire armies however they can walk on non corrupted lands though they are also affected by vampiric corruption their units range from vikings to armor clad warriors with skulls adorning their helms to daemonic manticores to chaos corrupted dwarfs operating artillery that fires eldritch bolts tl dr it s fun reccomend for any total war fan any warhammer fan who enjoys the end times when this takes place and grand strategy games unique factions slightly simplified overall great graphics terrific sound fun
