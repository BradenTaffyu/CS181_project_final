2016 i already made an in depth review of this game on my youtube channel however the pc version is the version to get take note that most flag ship gpu s of this writing still can t push this game maxed settings at 60 fps constant you need to disable a few things both on amd and nvidia s side but you can get a steady 60 fps if you do adjust some things this is fallout 3 without karma and less rpg elements but more streamlined combat and more action if that sounds good to you buy it hours of entertainment await you see you in the future from vault tech
