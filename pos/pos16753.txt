2018 first off 10 10 game in my opinion would play and start over to fix these damagaed houses again this game is very fun to pass the time funny to say if you want a decent amount of money or certain achievements then its somewhat of a strategy game very fun if you enjoy designing tearing down and rebuilding houses i am more of a simulation gaming person so i d recommend this to anyone who enjoys the same genre downside only bad thing i can say about this game is that they should add more to it as in decorating the outisde with lighting creating porches different paints fixing roofs and even basic lawn work i would love to create a beautiful front yard and a back yard with a pool hot tub i d suggest they can add more in home decorations as well along with even more houses maybe update you got me up with that halloween house i m not gonna spoil it but it was trippy good job 3
