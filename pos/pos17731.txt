2016 one of the most enjoyable total war games so far it s unfortunate so many would review negatively based on a common company business strategy regarding dlc that is required to make it profitable these days for such a large scale game pro s the factions are unique with different strategies being a thing for each diplomacy makes sense with the various factions reacting differently to you depending who you are each faction has their own thing such as the orcs and their fightiness and waaagh or the vampires and their raise dead each campaign run so far has been different for me it s not the case that generally the same things happen each run one time a certain faction may rise to power the other time it s completely different the battles have been improved over previous total war games the charges into units and the collision are quite fun to watch modding is a thing and quite active with lots of mods to tailor the experience to ones personal tastes great campaign map quite possibly a total war game with the biggest potential seeing as two expansions shall add and expand to the game map and bring us yet more factions to play around with ending up with each playable faction from the tabletop in the end meaning this will pretty much become the warhammer fantasy game to play for your warhammer fantasy needs with one of the biggest world maps to play around in for total war games free lc due to all the complaints no doubt about their dlc policy from the usual steam reviewers and the like they do try to squeeze in free extras when they can far more than other companies would do this however rarely gets mentioned by the ones complaining so i thought i d mention it cons the ai uses the enemy agents a little bit too aggressively making them quite an annoyance this could however be nerfed with the use of a mod forced march can get abused by the ai a touch too much as they ll know just how much to use it to be out of your range after attacking something i recommend the full cost march stance mod highly to prevent this a few units missing here and there from faction rosters not enough to be a big deal but enough to be noticed ai cheats being a bit ridiculous on higher difficulties in particular for battle i do not recommend going above hard for battle difficulty as you ll find the ai to be quite unfair in buffs then ai recruitment being wrong at times once again i would recommend the use of a mod to help prevent seeing strange things now and then like a full missile cavalry armyall in all this is a great game with even greater potential unfortunately it gets a mixed rating because people can t look past the dlc thing and actually review the game itself properly
