2018 if you re interested in dark souls i recommend playing the first game first even though the remaster of the first game has it detractors it runs wonderfully on both console and pc so please do not let it hold you back ds3 has many callbacks to the first game which made it much more enjoyable this game does not need another positive review but i m going to throw my 2 cents in anyways even almost 3 years after release boss design is much improved over the first game the bosses are hard colorful and much more flashy on screen each boss really feels unique with no reskins like the first game which had 3 demon bosses i am not that good at these types of games so i had plenty of time to appreciate each boss the art and environment are stunning and even the normal mobs have great detail the only place that from seemed to have regressed since the first game is level design it is so much better in the first game this game although more visually beautiful has a much more linear design and the worlds do not feel as connected great game and a great time to play it with sekiro coming out this march
