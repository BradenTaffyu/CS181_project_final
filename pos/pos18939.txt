2018 i adore this game i ve had several long satisfying playthroughs as different nations in different parts of the world doing different things and while they always had their moments of frustration they were always memorable and otherwise full of great fun it s a fantastic game when you want to sink a few days into something it s very crunchy vast challenging i won t go into too much detail about what i like about it since i want to be concise it s not perfect or anything but it effectively scratches that free form grand strategy itch it is likely the best sandbox grand strategy game on the market as long as you re willing to spend some time learning how to play well most paradox games are punishing to players who don t know what they are doing however despite my adoration of the game and my healthy amount of time spent in it i find that recently i have fallen out of love of it i wasn t sure why and i just assumed it was because i had played it enough over the years that i had burned out on it but when i got myself to sit down and spend a good few hours in a new game i figured it out the patches and dlc have over time greatly bloated and confused the mechanics for example institutions was a big change to how research penalties and westernization works yet the entire system is almost completely passive and hands off the changes to the fort sieging system which i was pretty optimistic about really were also odd and affected the flow and progression of wars and the new fort maintenance costs didn t totally line up with how weak and slow growing the economy of most nations tends to be from the start in this vein most of the mechanics that were present before have been changed tweaked or twisted and i really don t feel that the game is as functional or cohesive as it once was i won t even get into the decline in business quality that paradox had undergone with many shabby overpriced dlc s being put out i can only hope that at some point as they work on more dlc the game will continue to evolve and end up in a much better state despite my concerns i give a positive recommendation mostly out of respect for the fun i ve had playing the game in the past
