this is the first review i have written on steam so please bare with me first and foremost i genuinely love this game and to any fans that are interested in deeply customizable trpgs then please give this one a chance it has it s flaws and not everything is perfect but it is clear that dandylion is deeply passionate for game development the troubleshooter systems masteries stroke of genius the genre and the story that they clearly feel deserve their time and attention with that out of the way i have noticed that the developers respond and read every single review which is great honestly so i sort of want to use this review as not only a way to highlight all the pros and cons of t ac but also to hopefully give constructive criticism for the future especially with a sequel currently in the works pros the mastery system is one of the deepest and well thought out systems i have ever seen in a game the sheer amount of customization for every unit the fact that they made a kit for every single unit in the game every animal every enemy every drone etc was tailor made with this system in mind it is absolutely wonderful and i hope they continue to refine it in their future titles and adjust it as needed i really like the characters and their personalities especially with how well drawn all the cutscenes are made how expressive the art makes a lot of characters stand out and how vibrant they can really be also love how deep some of the characters stories and revelations about them can end up being i really liked the overall narrative and mystery to the story the way the pieces come together and eventually unravels very similar to sometimes soap opera level drama which really works for some of the anime ish tropes i really like the way every map is crafted and not procedurally generated even with some of them looking a little samey due to the textures many times being the same really shows an attention to detail and wanting to create and organic experience for every map there always feels like something new is coming right around the corner for this game every character in a new set of tools to be utilized a new way to engage with the system even sometimes introducing completely new systems with some of the characters i love this and the learning curve for the game overall being able to make any character an absolute juggernaut if you give the time and investment to truly understand their playstlye spoilers going forward now with all that praise done there is much more like taming the elemental system the different difficulties modes that makes them actually engaging etc but i also don t want to start spoiling too much in the review and i still highly recommend the title to anyone the rest of the review will be talking about the cons and suggestions feedback for the game and dandylion as a whole as it goes forward cons biggest negative for me so far in the game that i am begging to be addressed is please shape up the character writing do not be afraid to develop your characters make them change their ways of thinking have them actually talk to each other i understand writing characters in a well thought out way making them align with their characteristics and their beliefs but characters should grow throughout their adventure i appreciate albus becoming a better leader as the story continues this is great what i don t appreciate is that him and sion barely know anything about each other they almost never actually deepen their relationship even though they are essentially best friends to each other they almost feel like nothing more than good work associates i have had deeper conversations with random people i meet at the bus stop than 90 of the interactions between seemingly great friends in this game these characteristics are excusable early on since they are relatively essentially strangers but after a year of constant life and death fights please explore character relationships and start deepening these characters instead of making them characitures of what can be deeper and better fleshed out characters also for the love of god stop overusing the text i have never hated three dots more in my life than i have by the end of dlc 1 for lesser critiques but still valid in my opinion work on some of area textures making them a bit more distinct especially in hilly forests locations which makes it a nightmare to traverse because everything looks the same i do know the next game is being developed on unreal engine 4 so very much looking forward to the graphical upgrade in the next title not really a issue with urban city areas but still wanted to point it out don t be afraid to answer a few questions it feels like a lot of the mysteries in the game are almost artificially created because characters just refuse to elaborate on anything they are sometimes stubborn and weird about things they shouldn t really be about so instead of some of the story elements hitting hard when they are officially revealed they just feel dragged out for drama points here and there and becomes genuinely a chore to care for because of how long it was dragged out i am a 100 talking about the fortress of suffering and heixing not saying reveal everything all at once but you have to still keep the overall plot progressing and actually feeling like it has a point at times i do think you guys do a good job of this overall just some things can be a little frustrating rework the friendship system with vendors it is absolutely insane just how much friendship points you need to even get a 15 discount on things for any vendors and i shouldn t have to buy a single vendor s entire stock fifty times over just to get a raise in their friendship level once jurisdictions need a bit of balancing try making them a little bit more engaging throughout the play through implementing them with maybe some obvious early mid late game ones instead of having them really start opening up by late game when they have the least amount of necessity because you are just loaded with gear and money by then with all of that said i really hope you see this as constructive criticism for the game and use this for the coming titles i truly did love this game and i am so happy that i bought it feels like a steal for the price and the amount i played and i have recommended it to many of my friends thank you dandylion
