2017 early access review it s gloriously akin to a fantasy rpg version of ftl but purely turn based both combat and character progression are also far more strategic sounds like a dream dreamy it is despite being early access it comes with none of the flaws it s totally polished doesn t feel unfinished has loads of content and it s super replayable thanks to the devs for making a really amazing game and moreover doing it right looking forward to the updates
