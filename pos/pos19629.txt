2022 ring a ding ding finally i managed to 100 this janky outdated technical mess of a game yet it is without a doubt a real journey a deep rpg experience that not many games of its size scope and age come close to a memorable masterpiece that was very dear to me growing up i have played fallout 3 along with new vegas quite a lot back in the xbox 360 days but i never bothered to play them on pc despite knowing they have modding communities almost as passionate as the elder scrolls games such as oblivion and skyrim so i decided to dive in this october as a way to join in fallout s 25th anniversary and reminisce about the good old days but mainly because i wanted to revisit some bethesda classics before the release of starfield it s been over a decade since i last played this game revisiting it on pc with a few mods first of all because mods are cool secondly because they re f cking necessary to even get the game running on modern hardware it s almost impossible to play the game without it crashing at various points due to various reasons so nexus mods is your best friend to find all the necessary stability and bug fixes but we can excuse it because of its age has been a real treat i d almost forgotten how deep the rpg systems go as you re patrolling the mojave wasteland you will come across hundreds of characters unique locations packed with lore side quests whose choices and consequences can bite you in the ass much later in the story when you least expect it there are many factions each with their own agendas own problems that you can choose to ignore or get involved with new vegas is a true rpg an old school classic hardcore rpg in a massive open world setting that is just asking to be explored inch by inch even though fallout 4 has the best looking open world and best gameplay and fallout 3 is my favourite fallout game overall due to atmosphere setting and possibly due to nostalgia since it was my first fallout game new vegas is hands down the better rpg almost every npc involved in any side quest has the option to be reasoned persuaded or bartered with constant speech checks some influenced by unique perks and your s p e c i a l attributes are present in almost every conversation that is simply incredible and exactly what a true rpg needs rewarding you for your playstyle and ensuring no playthrough is the same the game has a nice reputation system with all the factions fame and infamy with the potential to lock you out of entire quest lines if you ve been too naughty all this combined with multiple endings makes new vegas the best rpg in the series the game is unforgiving you will have to learn to live with your choices and push on like the badass courier you are i was able to unlock all achievements in one playthrough due to saving and reloading at certain intervals in the story and its dlcs one thing i was never a fan of even back in the day were the gun runners arsenal gra challenges it just felt out of place for a fallout game as there is no way to complete them all in a conventional playthrough but for the sake of achievement hunting save scumming is king in bethesda games lol anyway it took me just over 150 hours to 100 this game it was larger than i remember for sure and that s not a bad thing because new vegas knows how to keep you engaged for long periods of time and rewards you in many ways depending on what you choose to do the more you put in it the more you get out of it it is without a doubt a game that deserves many many playthroughs in order to experience everything it has to offer
