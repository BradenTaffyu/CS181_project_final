2022 pretty good game like the hearts of iron series but much more focused on the world timeline with unique historical civilizations an addicting game that wants you to just have that one more turn until you played for 6 hours and now need to go do something else but your just about to defeat that barbarian village you have been struggling with for hours its a hard enough game if you never played anything like it however some time could get you the true enjoyment youv been looking for
