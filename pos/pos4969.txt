2019 if you ve by chance read my previous fallout reviews you will clearly tell i m a fan of the franchise with my grievances largely being with 3 not being a quality fallout experience then we get fallout 4 and i m conflicted in as a fallout fan i think this is one of the worst things to affect the fallout brand excluding 76 but on the other hand i love to explore this world and hunt down various creatures build up settlements etc first things first the story is it good bad inbetween honestly this is the worst fallout story to date it s just horrible in previous fallout games you were largely a character of your own making with your own values and ideals even 3 which set you up looking for your father allowed you to be whoever you want this game doesnt have this i m always gonna end up nate the father looking for his son in a desolate wasteland who helps others unlike new vegas in which i could be a slaver mass murderer or next game be a lone gunman hunting criminals and providing justice to the wastes bethesdas decision to make your character for you completely ruins the story as nates goal is his son but me as the player wants to build settlements or do random sidequests it s a complete disconnect and i feel distant from nate as a character because of it generally the first 1 3 of hunting your son is then the middle section of the game is more so learning about each faction which for me is the strongest section meeting the brotherhood of steel institute minutemen and railroad except holy god no faction makes sense let s take the institute their whole goal in the game is to replace humans with synthetic humans but why it s never explained and with 70 hours ingame i still have no idea other than the betterment of mankind whatever the that means the institute has a million and one issues but if their main goal isnt obvious to the player then wtf why should we care furthermore the big twist is the director of the institute is your son you were refrozen after he was stolen except this opens up new plotholes i e going into the memories of the kidnapper refers to the old mans plan but the old man is your son but in that flashback your son is 10 so we have a plothole in the form of this just ripping the story open the brotherhood of steel for once are semi decent they re actually having some moral questions and we get this amazing twist in this storyline which is amazing as you get to argue the morality of life and to make a genuine argument for an individuals life it s actually great until it ends the exact same way of fallout 3 of following liberty prime through the streets which is boring interactive and just tedious the other two railroad and minutemen are so boring its not even worth mentioning and are basically just either stupid or just uninteresting with railroad for example having a password to their base literally set to railroad and despite having been raided recently and losing dozens of members use a lantern trail to their base despite wanting to hide i should also mention this game retcons huge aspects of the lore i e with powerarmour fusion cores jet the drug ghouls apparently not needed food or water forced evolutionary virus and many more aspects that are too numerous but as a lore fan it s so much to overlook as previously mentioned there s a settlement building feature in which you can construct settlements and homes for people which is genuinely kinda fun but beyond that i have nothing really to comment except of course it seems bethesda sacrificed interesting locations in favour of more settlements which is a tremendous shame as diamond city feels like the only major settlement worth visiting honestly it s just a shame unlike 3 where i got passionately angry at this game just inspired a sense of drained energy the whole experience is generally a huge sap of willpower and strength but for some reason i keep coming back honestly theres moments of brilliance in this game like the glowing sea where a nuclear bomb landed and you explore it and see the remains of play parks etc or the power armour revamp making it intimidating and seemingly unstoppable but that s what i feel summarises this game all visuals and presentation but no substance but would i recommend i will recommend just for the gameplay if you can ignore lore inconsistencies or a pretty lackluster story the modding scene also just makes this game so much better and is the best modding community for any fallout game
