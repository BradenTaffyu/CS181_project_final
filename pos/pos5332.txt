2018 early access review here is a very small sampling of things you can do in caves of qud sever your evil twin s face and wear it as a mask over your own face seduce a horse god perform a ritual with a robot with saw hands trade with a sentient cucumber vine contract a fungal infection causing you to sprout hundreds of mouths on your back which whisper secrets to you proselytize a shotgun toting goat man into your cult phase in and out of space time creating multiple copies of yourself one of which kills you in retaliation for catching it in a crossfire while battling an extradimensional being this is actually how my latest character died and oh so much more the scope of this game is staggering and it isn t even finished yet but don t let the early access scare you away there is more to do in it than the vast majority of other games there is a near infinite number of procedurally generated dungeons caves along with a bunch of towns cities and ruins to explore there are a dozen unique ecosystems with their own endemic creatures all of those creatures are bound to a very unique faction system every single type of being in the world has a level of reputation with every other faction that defines how they interact this includes you as you travel through qud you ll meet friendly neutral and hostile creatures the genius of this system is that it is not dependent on you this is not a typical ally enemy system you will find two creatures battling to the death that are both friendly to you but not to each other this makes the world feel incredibly real that it exists whether you are playing the game or not and the world is the best thing about this game it is incredibly rich and interesting set in a time after a long forgotten apocalypse where mutants abound and remnants of technology remain but are poorly understood and a source of mysticism per the developers influences for the game were books such as dune canticle for leibowitz and the book of the new sun series along with pen and paper rpg gamma world though the gameplay is brilliant it s this rich world that keeps me coming back it is enhanced by a great tileset and perfect atmospheric music if you like roguelikes this is a must buy as i think this is the best yet made if you like original compeling science fantasy worldbuilding this is a must buy if you like open world games with tons of crazy stuff to do this is a must buy
