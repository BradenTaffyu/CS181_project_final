2022 it is not a bad game i have bought this game stopped because of the horrible translation and by now it vastly improved so far i have found one error so they improved hugely on that side the gameplayloop per se is good but this game has a sickness many anime eastern inspired games have needlessly complicated many systems you can craft several hundred skills passives but only when you can research them and you can craft them when you use the ones enemies drop regulary at least some you can craft others not i didnt excactly get when i can craft a skill and when not you obviously have to identify items you can upgrade them craft them you get mats by taking your items apart and even the mats you get you can take apart to get even smaller parts but obviously you can only craft items when a character you have reaches a certain level in crafting that specific kind of item your characters have individual passives hunger and food meters arcane zodiac motivation meter bonds almost every item has randomly generated stats you can mine you have certain meters for each area of the city the city parts give passives too when you buy certain food deals you get certain buffs but you shouldnt overeat overdrink you need to pay your people and the place you stay at and it increases the friendship when you do and drops it if you cant pay etc etc you get the vibe however the basic actual game you know moving your units and shooting at enemies is okay i am not too far actually start of act 2 but i really like certain aspects of the story i dont want to spoiler so i will keep playing i personally will ignore 90 of the mechanics and just play some missions twice or thrice to get the exp item boost crafting would usually give
