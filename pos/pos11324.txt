2015 early access review day 1 got attacked and almost killed on my first night then i went rambo fought my way out and ran to a house hid in the attic until the sun came up day 2 found a few weapons and some rudimentary armor in the house next door and the upper half of the owner gotta stay mobile until i find a place to settle in and make it defensible day 5 snuck around and scavenged houses for food and potable water no sign of people am i the last one alive day 10 found an abandoned military outpost made a door and barricaded myself inside of the largest tent for now will scavenge the surrounding area during daylight only night of the 10th day they re everywhere oh god they walk right by my tent i m cowering in a corner behind a desk with a pistol and a wooden club that i wrapped in some scrap iron only 15 rounds of 9mm for the pistol i hope that they don t decide to tear the tent down around me day 11 began collecting resources i think that i ll try sleeping tonight day 12 they woke me up 2 times but never took notice of me i m glad that i don t snore day 25 have been fortifying my position dug a trench to trap the undead only the spider zombies can get out i need to contain them somehow day 50 currently i have a fortress surrounded by metal tipped log spike traps 3 deep so they can t escape then i just stand on my roof and snipe the spider zombies collect loot and smile i think that i ll be ok day 79 been farming food is plentiful now weapons and ammo are easy to make i built my fortress on top of a deposit of iron lead and potassium nitrate with coal deposits poking out of the ground all around me what luck day 1 there s no end to them i heard a scream the other night not one of them it sounded human female close by the time i made it outside at first light all i found was a pool of blood and entrails a half mile from my fortress next to the carnage i found a purse with some pictures of a pretty young blonde lady with a cheerleading outfit on in one picture in another she was in an expensive looking dress cuddled up to who was probably the star quarterback at her high school the last picture was her with what must have been her family on vacation at an expensive looking beach house they looked so happy her driver s license said that her name was cindy batross and she was 17 years old there was a notepad with illegible scribbles and crude drawings of people eating each other i cried as i realized that she saw my lights and was desperately trying to make it to the safety of my home what may have been my only hope for companionship was now in the rotting stomach of the undead stardate 4 20 delta v venison stew is good it s lonely here i found pictures in houses and i talk to the nice people in them you want to be my friend jimmy ok i promise that i won t chew on your bones day whatever what was that noise they scratch inside my skull sometimes i saw the cheerleader she doesn t have a stomach anymore but she walks around with a little smile on her face and coos sometimes then she screams when i try to talk to her from my roof maybe i should let her in maybe she just wants to be friends night time now she didn t want to be friends only my iron helmet kept her from chewing my face off i cut her head off with my hunting knife she didn t have any manners at all hump day i sewed her head back on and sat her in a chair we talked for hours while i cooked some vension stew for us she s nice but a little cold i hope that she s on the pill year of the rat i caught that cindy looking at one of the other guys in the photos today she denied it but i know there s something going on while i m out risking my life for us ungrateful judgement day cindy had to go i had no choice i had told her too much about mrs doubtfire and she was plotting a coup to reap the benefits of our trade agreement with the rabbits i loved her but now her bones are scattered in the ashes the day i die spent the last 30 winters here i lost my mind a long time ago though i regained some of my faculties after much reflection i can no longer keep up with my home it s only a matter of time before they break through i never did find anyone else no one came the supply drops stopped long ago i can only assume that the rest of the world succumbed to this hellish plague the undead continue to march in all directions i have stockpiled a large amount of explosive devices guns and ammo tonight i will open the bridge to my door for them and when they are clamoring to peel my flesh from my bones i ll let them in the world will see the last survivor not dying peacefully in my sleep but raging against the darkness in one last epic battle but i won t let them kill me when it s finally hopeless i m going out on my own terms let them eat what is left of this shell after my spirit departs those damned fools won t make me one of them my life is over i can hear them now there must be close to a hundred it s time to face my fate here i come cindy i m sorry for everything note this is a dramatization of in game events and doesn t represent actual game play don t get me wrong the game is amazing and i can t wait to see where they take it for the end game but this little story was entirely made up in my head based on my experiences in the game and a fateful first encounter with a cheerleader zombie that seriously freaked me out and based on the positive comments so far i may turn this into a short story update 7 21 15 i ve managed a plot that i can mold as more content is released and have been working on a solid beginning to explain just appearing as if from nowhere in navezgane amidst the carnage it should please quite a few fans of the survival horror genre i m not looking to invest a lot of time into a project that won t yield any revenue so a very short story will set the bar and sway my decision to pursue a published work with tfp s blessing of course in the future i ll see how well it is received here and on some fanfic sites first but rest assured it s in the works as you read this text stay safe survivors and happy hunting update 9 19 23 i ve been made aware that the review at is plagiarizing my review and thus my intellectual property in the form of this dramatized short story in order to farm awards please help me by reporting said review and player so that i can find some justice thank you
