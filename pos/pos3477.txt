2016 undertale s fandom is the most toxic thing on the internet i ll never play this game because its fans are so terribly annoying well i can t say i disagree i felt that way too but considering i have played this game in every way you can possibly play it i took each path multiple times and that i ve logged 156 hours into it at this moment i suppose i should get around to reviewing it after all one of my close friends also shared the opinion stated above and after playing it he claims that he loves it undertale is a great game without any doubt is it the best game ever no the pixelated graphics may be off putting at first but it has a story a soundtrack and a cast of characters that make this game incredibly memorable and worth the 10 price tag you play as a human child who has fallen into an underground world of monsters you re given the freedom to decide whether every creature in this world deserves to live or die by your hands this creates a game with many possible endings and even a few different middles depending on who you choose to kill if any the story changes as a result to get the best possible ending it s pretty obvious that you shouldn t kill anyone at all but it s completely up to you at this point over a year after undertale s release and well past its explosion in popularity you may have already been spoiled a few things about the game s plot or characters but even if you have and especially if you haven t i greatly encourage you to play this game as far as you can go then play it again it s worth playing twice trust me because experiencing this game firsthand is a much better way to enjoy the story than to be told by a friend so this is what happens at the end the soundtrack is a combination of chiptune music from the days of the nes a collection of simplistic mario paint midi sounding tracks and kickass boss battle tunes if you do decide to kill everything do it for the final boss and their theme song that s all i will say plus it s a tiny 100 mb game maker game so you could probably run this thing on a potato overall the battle system is very innovative for a turn based rpg the characters and dialogue are delightful the music will be stuck in your head for weeks and the price is only ten bucks therefore if you have doubts about this game due to its fandom i recommend you give undertale a try anyway don t go into it thinking that it s the best game ever but instead that it was made by just one guy with a love for earthbound and anime and that i managed to get 156 hours of enjoyable gameplay out of this ten dollar game
