2021 this game is everything that i ve been looking for maybe years a truly worth masterpiece took me 82 hours to finish the game and there still a lot to do lovely characters well written story stunning graphics and totally replayable not only for the multiple endings but as you choose your companions there are still variant quests with multiple outcomes i bought the game when it was 75 off but the game is worth full price i got nothing else to say unless 10 10
