2018 to begin i was able to play this game in it s entirety i actually 100 the game without the use of the far patch and never once ran into any issues i have a relatively high end machine and i know that the game has issues for lots of setups but your mileage will vary depending on your computer this isn t any excuse for the unfortunate state of the game this far into it s life but i felt it was necessary to share since this game is too good to pass up due to potential technical difficulties for reference i have a 1080ti 32gb ram asus strix z370 i7 8700k win10that said if you haven t played this game yet do yourself a favor and get it and do what you need to do to play it it s absolutely fantastic and well worth any potential headache upfront to get it going easily my favorite game of the last few years great if you just want to play through it and get the final ending excellent if you want to invest further and explore for every collectible and secret the soundtrack is masterful and flows beautifully throughout every corner of the game the characters have excellent voice acting and emotion and the story is essentially as complex as you want it to be make no mistake this is a sequel to the original neir game however players do not need any experience with it to enjoy this game fully it just adds a bit of context and there are some neat little references throughout nier automata overall i highly recommend this game and thankfully the community members behind the far mod have opened up the game to be enjoyed as widely as possible i got lucky with my experience and didn t need the mod but knowing what i know now about the game would have gone through any inconvenience in installing the far mod to get to play this game
