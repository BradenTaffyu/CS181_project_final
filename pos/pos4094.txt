2018 early access review i picked this up out of boredom expecting to fill a few lonely after work hours in the evening one day i wasn t expecting much more than 10h total playtime so after over 150 hours i thought it would be fair to the devs to leave a review this game for me was an unexpected love affair so many things here that just feel right the art design the involvement the devs seek with their community the weekly patches the constant fine tuning the sense of humor that shows in events and game art the catchy themes i bet any new player even at this point where developement is mostly finished could tell this is a labour of love without looking at all the continuous work that s been put in and it s not even everything i said above that makes me come back to the game it s the satisfying game mechanics inherent replayability and progression although it s no real rpg persistent progression nothing much changes except for difficulty modifiers that s enough to greatly change the way you play between low and high ascension the game s way of progression through 20 difficulty levels the game is really easy to just pick up and get into with zero prior cardgame experience at the same time it demands a lot of trial and error to get your tactics and synergies right to achieve the higher ascension levels sure it s the same monsters the same cards the same rooms every run with a very overseeable number of enemy boss types but your route to victory or death will be different every time the game is about thinking ahead and making risk reward decisions with every card pickup relic and room choice gamble picks in the hope of setting up a specific type of deck synergy can end up being very rewarding or downright soul crushing if you didn t pay attention to for example what will be your next elite fight it s much more about overall strategy than being good or bad in a specific room fight every class can be played in several general ways i hate using the word archetypes even if your deck core is let s say strengh stacking that archetype can play very differently depending on the supplemental relic and card choices even if my winning strategy for defect is simple cold orb stacking most of the time the deck often still won t feel very close to my last runs it just stays fresh more features keeping the game fresh are the daily challenges use of seeds and the custom mode with many fun modifiers and an endless mode so if you re frustrated with the wall you re hitting in your ascension runs just throw in a few challenges or stupid modifiers until you re fit for more self punishment tl dr a labour of love easy to get into challenging to master endless replayability that rewards thinking ahead and creative deck building
