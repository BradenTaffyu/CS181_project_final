2020 oh well i can already imagine your faces especially because this is a positive review fallout 76 is known as one of the worst videogame ever created especially because the devs who created this title is the creator of some of the most played games ever the game completely destroyed any expectation of a decent fallout sequel after fallout 4 coming out full of bugs lack of features terrible gameplay and not on steam at launch it was only available on the bethesda launcher on metacritic the game is currently rated 2 7 10 by users so you maybe are wondering why i left a positive review well let s say it took 50 hours of gameplay before writing this review and the reason i decided to recommend this game instead to confirm is still one of the worst game ever like i was thinking at the day1 and even before it during the closed beta is that the last free update called wastelanders really changed the game in positive be careful i m not saying the game is now worth your money or it s actually something you should buy and try it still got tons of bugs weird gameplay and other annoying things it s just that now it feels more similar to fallout 4 the fact that bethesda is now putting more effort to improve the game that was initially destroyed by the fan base meant something to me and they are doing this mostly for free you may say this needed to happen after everything that happened in the first days but why you would think that exactly nothing is granted in this industry it s very easy to abandon a failed project or remain with a few fanboys that actually likes to pay for skins supporting the game series no matter what but they didn t do that they granted us a steam key for free something that almost no one ever did before and they published a full roadmap promising us tons of features and new content always for free i understand that most people just cannot forget what happened and it s absolutely right they completely disappointed me too since i am a huge fan of the fallout series and i had to avoid to buy the title for years but when the new free update wastelanders was released i felt something new in the air and i started to feel optimistic i made 50 hours of gameplay with more to come i think there are a lot of other videogames worse then this so after hours and hours i couldn t decide if to rate this game in a positive or negative way here s finally the reason why i decided to actually recommend this game to and only the fallout fans out there if you loved fallout 4 give this game a try and it may be worth your time instead if you never loved much the game maybe it s better to continue to stay away from this one too
