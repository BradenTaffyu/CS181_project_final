2018 early access review by far the best game in its genre this is still in ea and it took me 80 hours to run out of things to do and i loved every minute of it i guess this game shows what happens when a group of smart people have both a great idea and the talent to execute it the only reason i can possibly see for someone giving this game a thumbs down is if they expected it to be a walk in the park it s not and that s a good part of what makes it awesome in oxygen not included you gotta think before you act building anything requires careful planning and later on often multiple attempts to make things work out the way you want if you suddenly realize your base is about to run out of oxygen you may not have time or algaes or water left to fix it if you don t notice your base is warming up cause and effect will most likely lead your duplicants to starvation and death if you don t generate enough power everything starts falling apart if you don t find a way to efficiently gather recycle water several things may happen and they all end in chaos and death if stress levels get too high your duplicants will become little nightmares more like gremlims than freddy kruegers but still a holes for a while if you re not careful while dealing with gases all of the above could end up happening at once but don t be afraid the game auto saves after every cycle in game day and you can manually save and load as you please so it s all good unless you realize you had already messed up too hard in your oldest remaining save then well you know also the resource return rate of anything you deconstruct is 100 if you spend 400 copper ore to build a gas pump and destroy it later you ll get the 400 copper ore back so you can freely rebuild your entire base anytime if you want which you won t because that would take a lot of work a guy claimed in his very helpful just pointing out the votes not being sarcastic negative review that you can never get stable in oxygen not included that you re always under pressure that resources are always running out that you can t get a moment s respite that s not really true although for a long while you get the feeling it s not possible you can get a self sufficient base going on by the end of my game i had everything stabilized oxygen power food water temperature etc and a good stock of raw resources left to be used plus an enormous amount left to grab if i wanted while being able to produce late game refined resources without problem as long as i flip some switches every now and then i m confident i can keep my base running forever as it is i may run out of sand and or coal in several hundreds or thousands of hours but neither is strictly neccessary finally i got only very few and minor bugs in 80 hours playing the game runs smoothly even in a so so computer or a potato clock in usa eu standards and updates seem to be consistent and to always bring relevant content i hope klei decides to push oni to its limits this game may be one of my all time favorites if you re anything into base building resource managing survival genres used to be easier to define games and not afraid of thinking a little just buy this even in ea it s totally worth full price and then after 2 or 3 updates which means 3 to 4 and a half months given how much content they add in each one of them you can just come back and play oni all over again at least that s what i intend to do
