2016 early access review this game is best described as either a casual version of dwarf fortress or a hardcore version of the sims the style of the game is very similar to dwarf fortress like in df losing is fun it s how you learn while it s not nearly as deep i e convoluted as df there are certainly a lot of things to learn but unlike df the gui does a good job of communication and everything is pretty much self explanatory my favorite resident so far was a 81 year old bounty hunter who was the best sniper i ve ever seen we rescued her from a band of pirates she eventually went deaf but never really minded it my least favorite was a belligerent pyromaniac who hated everyone i don t allow pyros in my colonies anymore
