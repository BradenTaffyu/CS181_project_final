2017 early access review i had 5 tribesmen building a colony one day they all died of heatstroke i spent days fast forwarding and watching them decay their corpses vomit and blood scattered around the buildings they created finally a girl came accross the ghost town there was hope unfortunately she did not have the required skills to clean up the blood and vomit nor move or bury the bodies she spent a week living amongst the stench of death slowly driving herself into insanity eventually another girl came along but she also could not clean or bury bodies they both did what they could to survive living off the food stockpile left by the creators of their new home a week later a third wanderer came accross the settlement he buried the dead and cleaned up the blood a year on we are now thriving with ten colonists and many more to come probably should have researched air conditioning sooner though
