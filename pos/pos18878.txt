2019 i swear this game has cost me about 1 000 by now and that kinda pisses me off when i think about it for too long but it s great fun to play even if some of the mechanics feel a little 2d if you like the civ games and want to use your brain a wee bit more then cop eu4 when it s on sale google the best dlc to cop and get them too some are unfortunately essential if you like history and have a lot of time on your hands then this can be really good value for money
