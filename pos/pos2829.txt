2022 finally finished the full playthrough and it s time to write a review throws confetti i was very hesitant to start playing this game but someone encouraged me to try it out turned out to be an amazing decision it s a choice matter type of game different choices different outcomes gearing is pretty important but may be a bit tedious in the early game gets easier later on if you put an effort into it best played with keyboard mouse though why because map viewing is way easier and you can look really far away whereas on controller the buttons are a bit tricky that being said i played the whole game with xbox controller lol what s not awesome about it time investment it s not a short game and it s too addictive lol rest assured 100 hours required for a complete playthrough i spent about 200 hours for a single full playthrough but taking my own sweet time 100 achievement yes but may not be the easiest if you re buying this game for achievement sake it will take many hours to complete and i believe you ll need to play through various difficulties too i didn t aim for achievements this time so i couldn t comment much on this mods amazing mods available in steam workshop as well as on nexus mods link below there is the omega pack for better graphics do check that out replayability definitely there are various difficulty modes as well as you can create your own campaign you can choose to solo the game or choose up to 3 other companions to join you in your journey children friendly there are some romance dialogues options lots of blood spill but nothing gory horrifying dead bodies do not vanish fyi stealing is somewhat encouraged in this game the easiest way to get money items tips for starters 1 if you re looking to enjoy the game without really giving too much attention to the achievements consider enabling gift bags at the start of the game they are essentially popular mods you can activate them in the menu section makes life way easier 2 there is no right wrong path and you re free to venture around the maps however there s a optimal sequence for smooth gameplay check these walkthroughs if you don t like to guess around it helps to get max xp too 3 try the origin characters for your first playthrough rather than customizing your own character they have pretty good story line 4 you can respec your character attributes in act 2 without gift bag activation or in act 1 if you opt for gift bag mod fort joy mirror so don t keep restarting the game because you made a wrong build choice in the beginning this will really ruin your game experience for convenience i even used portable respec mirror mod so i can respec anytime 5 save game save game save game especially before you leave the game it doesn t auto save progress before you exit auto save is only triggered before big fights usually you can increase decrease your max saves stored in option menu here are some useful links for you respec mirror portable respec mirror fort joy definitive a workshop item for divinity original sin 2 by daniel7400 this is for the definitive edition only classic edition version out looting need lucky charm in town selling need bartering omega pack graphic upgrade origins a screenshot of divinity original sin 2 by burn
