this is the most relaxing game ever slowly systematically remove gunk from stuff using high pressure water this soothes my autism anxiety and ocd so much that hours pass and i don t even notice this is my peaceful happy place since most of the negative reviews mention the high price of the game and dlc i ll comment on that as well the game is not cheap and the dlc are not cheap however i believe that you pay for quality in this case making games costs money and devs deserve to be paid the hours per dollar spent here are well worth it plus there are some free content updates on the game roadmap although priorities shift and nothing is set in stone
