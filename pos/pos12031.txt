early access review it s great ish so my first thoughts are really good after playing survival evolved and amounting about 10k hours possibly even more on ps4 it s really interesting to see the small updated animations building system etc and if your system is capable the graphics are really enjoyable as well especially when it comes to the water noooww i think the obvious issue with the game is lag even with a 4070 and a 13th gen intel i can t run singleplayer without tanking under 30 fps on medium graphics with hdr on though granted and with all on low it s still very very low but that s only on native resolution which is 3840 x 2160 dropping down to 2560 x 1440 it still looks fine to me at least lol and i am able to run all at epic with my view distance slightly lower and i can consistently run over 30 which i would say is pretty good considering you don t really need to run epic graphics to enjoy the game which brings me to the next thing while i have by no means done extensive comparisons running everything on lowest graphics still results in the game looking basically the same as how ark survival evolved used to look as on my old play station and certainly still enjoyable especially once you tweak the settings a little increasing specific settings to medium or high if possible in other words it s certainly not well optimized which is certainly a problem but it s not necessarily something that ruins the game as long as you have a relatively high end computer i m not personally sure what could run this but a 2070 could likely only run it on medium res or with lowest graphics or high res lowest graphics so to summarize in my opinion this version of the game seems to be a great work in progress that has great potential that hopefully won t be impaired by it s issues with hardware demands i would recommend you purchase it if you are interested in it and have a good computer
