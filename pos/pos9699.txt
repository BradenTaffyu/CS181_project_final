2017 early access review i play this game like it s a full time job 26 hours in my first 3 days and loving almost evey minute of it it s purpose is to tell a story whether of joy or sorrow and it accomplishes this well let me share with you my favorite story so far which lasted about 10 15 hours in real life i finally made a colony that lasted longer than a year before the narrorator decided that this story was ready for a twist 3 years in population is up to 7 8 people at the same time work was getting done solid defense multiple blocks deep surrounding the entire base enough food to last for 2 years raiders don t stand a chance randy decides he s been too easy on me first wave of raiders equiped with heavy artillery arrives after hours they blast a crack in my wall and flood in my colonists have been waiting firing commences bullets fly blood spills and bodies drop the raiders grab 3 of my people before they retreat i save one of them but the others are gone for good time to rescue and restore hours after the first attack the next raid begins the crack hasn t been repaired because most of my colony is in the hospital a few good soldiers answer the call for justice and defend the homeland they quickly dispense of the second wave but sustain minor injuries time to visit the hospital hours later the third strike falls upon us this battle will be a last stand i send those able to walk out to the battlefield likely to take thier last breaths they meet the aggressors at the door and unleash their weapons this desperate attempt to save the colony ends like many wars neither side claims victory as we all strive to hang on they capture two of mine but we take down 3 of theirs only three reamain wounded and unconcious luckily my doctor is still alive and well making her rounds amongst the two soldiers we survived the war or so we thought the siren wails again as a final wave of raiders enters the arena these lone stragglers are equipped with shoddy wooden melee weapons but the odds are five to one my doctor greets them at the door with an lmg and fights to her last breath the wounded hear her screams and answer the call using their guns as crutches they hobble to the entrance and face certain demise their only thought we re taking them with us they fight their way through the flames and rubble that they once called home stabbing and shotting anything that moved the raiders retreat but we won t allow them to get far not today they chase the raiders to the gates cornering them against the wall the grim reaper is amongst us they fire as long as thier strength can hold the gun before falling to the ground due to blood loss one soldier dies while the last man finishes the assult with every raider dead the lone soldier returns to his room passing his fallen comrades along the way he eats his last meal and grab some flake to unwind he locks himself in the rec room and lights up to ease the pain he thinks back to the story that was told within these walls the crash landing and the first walls the famines and the feasts the wars won and the people lost he finishes his first pipe full and decides to light another dose of flake his blood is draining as he slips in to an overdosed coma of ecstasy and joins his friends in the light with him dies the legacy of this grand colony perhaps some day another weary traveler will stumble upon its walls and take shelter maybe they will wonder of the epic tale that transpired looking upon the works that his hands created or maybe the dust of the mountain will consume this town and its insignificant story after all in the end we re all just dust in the wind i love this game and highly reccomend it to anyone that enjoys games like banished prison architect and don t starve don t play to win play to live enjoy the stories as they happen 10 10
