as someone who had zero prior harry potter knowledge this game was amazing the world is breathtaking the combat is pretty well thought out and there is tons of content for you to do during or after finishing the main story the room of requirement was a nice feature that allowed for extensive customization alongside all the vivariums they also give you access to theres a whopping amount of side challenges quests and collectibles was 95 merlin trials needed absolutely not did i still do all of them and everything else the game had to offer yeah though some aspects like those trials do get repetitive it genuinely didn t matter in the end and turned me into a fan of the series
