2018 two point hospital review a nostalgic cure for what ails youattempts to revive the 90s management genre have met with mixed success planet coaster and cities skylines have been well received where atari s and maxis own on brand efforts to bring back rollercoaster tycoon and simcity have not two point hospital a resuscitation of theme hospital for the modern age is joyously one of the former this is a masterclass in how to remake a classic in a succession of scenarios that escalate in scope and complexity there is no open sandbox mode the game puts you in charge of running a hospital tasked with diagnosing and curing patients of delightfully wacky ailments such as verbal diarrhea that has patients vomiting their words into the nearest trash can or onto the floor if you neglected to place any or being 8 bitten which reduces the patient to a pixellated blob and of course you get to profit off of all these humorous humerus injuries the core gameplay loop is simple enough you ll start with an empty hospital and then lay out furnish and decorate rooms hire staff doctors and specialists and purchase ever fancier machines to diagnose and subsequently treat your patients this is terribly addictive there is always just one more room to add or objective to check off that is only a few moments of gameplay away making it very easy to lose hours more to the game than you intended the more patients you successfully treat the more your hospital s reputation will increase and the faster the patients will come through the doors forcing you to expand your facilities while trying to keep every part of the operation running smoothly as you progress you get more and more plates to keep spinning some of the secondary systems are well implemented such as needing to assign doctors to a research department to discover the cures for ever more esoteric diseases some feel more fiddly and tacked on however such as hot or cold levels that require little more than remembering to make a couple of extra clicks when furnishing every room to place a radiator or ac unit and to hire an extra janitor or two to repair the machines when they break if the level also happens to suffer from earthquakes the game uses some of these other systems to provide variety in the scenario objectives with mixed success the game s best level is probably mid way through the campaign when you are tasked with running a non profit hospital that can t charge a penny for any diagnosis treatment or retail operation in the hospital wonderfully this completely upends everything you ve learned to that point about how to play most of the time money can be a little tight early in a level but soon becomes a non issue in this level completing the tasks the game gives you is essential to earning the funds to keep your hospital going unfortunately some of those tasks are more interesting than others being asked to cure x number of people makes sense being asked multiple times in the level to unblock eight toilets does not even when the objectives are pedestrian or the core gameplay gets repetitive a promised free update is soon to add a copy and paste function for room design alleviating the tedium of designing a dozen or more identical gp s offices for every level the game is nonetheless a lighthearted joy to play the graphics are bright the music cheery without being obtrusive and the humour is spot on we re sorry for the litter that you dropped on our floor pipes up your receptionist over the hospital intercom periodically and a radio ad for the local mayoral election encourages you to vote for the candidate who is wrong but stable you can progress through the game relatively quickly if you like in probably 20 30 hours but there s much more content available if you want to take your time the game uses a 3 star system for each scenario that unlocks the next level after you obtain your first star on the current one but allows you earn more rewards or achievements by persisting with progressively more difficult objectives to achieve the second or third stars earning all three stars on all 15 levels will probably take you 50 80 hours depending on how liberally you make use of the pause function while designing your hospitals the diagnosis then two point hospital is a management game par excellence bright and cheerful even when its levels get big with multiple buildings dozens of staff and over a hundred simultaneous patients it is never overwhelming in the moments where your tasks feel repetitive or your objectives mundane the game pulls you through with its addictive momentum and chuckle worthy wit the recommended treatment more please
