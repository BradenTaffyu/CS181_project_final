2022 early access review decided to take the van out and steal one of those slot machines from the bar it was all going well until the property owner shown up on his bike cycling to his place of work only to disappear under my wheels i had to get him in the van and hide his bike so that nobody could find him or at least give me some freedom before the cops caught up to me so i get into my van and head down the road but there s a police checkpoint coming up now this wouldn t be so bad if my van wasn t filled to the brim with untaxed red diesel it also wouldn t have been as bad if the brakes didn t slow me down in time to stop i must ve been going about 120km h down that road or something and keep in mind my van is a hunk of trash so i knocked the cop out i m worried i might have killed him but decided to take his body and his partner to the back of my van i knocked his partner out with one punch but he s not breathing well anyways i decided to head down the road back to my house as if things weren t stressed enough i didn t have enough money to fix my car another hunk of trash in my life and plus my parents are away for a while and i don t know when they ll be back i m worried the cops might find me oh yeah and i played my summer car it s pretty good
