2019 early access review engineering never was so fun fixing one issue begats another its like each world is a puzzle for you to solve finding the most efficient way to do it and when your colony fails its not due to some unfair mechanic its because you were inefficient or failed to plan properly i love this game and klei needs to be applauded in this day and age of devs being pushed to make trash they make projects that you can feel the passion behind them and oxygen not included is no different tldr if you like strategy and puzzle solving this game is the absolute best
