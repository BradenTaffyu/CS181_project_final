2022 early access review in dave the diver you play as dave who is not just a diver but also a manager server at a restaurant and a farmer of both plants and fish the core game play loop is dave diving to collect fish and managing your restaurants menu within the game you ll also explore the depths of the as of current two ocean maps complete various quests given to you by a host of unique and fun characters manage your restaurant by hiring training staff and overseeing your fish rice farm the game starts you exploring a small portion of a what it calls a constant changing pocket of the ocean again only two maps as of now wherein after learning the controls you ll become a server in the restaurant slowly opening up more game play as you progress things done well in my opinion the core game play loop is enjoyable there s a lot to do in the game the nps are silly entertaining and the dialog is fairly well written animations are over the top and a joy to watch skippable after repeated viewings the oxygen as health bar mechanic adds a nice level of tension to the gamewhat needs work in my opinion there s a delay in trying to rapid fire your speargun that s annoying and makes fighting fast moving fish annoying it has the mario mechanic where simply touching an enemy damages you when fighting larger fish this can be very annoying as the tail or fins will destroy you in close combat fish can get inside your hit box wherein you re unable to repel them if you re heavy this can outright kill you as you re unable to escape it would be nice to be able to change the music around and set it to different locations as it is now you can listen to any of the music you unlocked in the game on your phone but that s all you can do with it overall dave the diver is quite a fun game and i would recommend it to others
