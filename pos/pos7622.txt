2023 i m writing this review after completing every achievement for the base game and three dlcs and getting every campus to 3 stars first off i appreciate that this game runs natively on a mac as i mostly game on console but this is one genre i don t like to play on a game pad i felt that the game did a great job of remaining engaging and having genuinely new challenges for each campus the early game was always a lot of fun trying to get your campus in working order with so many things to think about and plan around it s really like a game of the sims where you have 100 sims at once each student and staff member operates entirely on their own agendas to meet their needs and act out on their unique traits and you have to set things up to help them succeed rather than micromanage i m especially impressed with how the game schedules classes and staff tasks for you so you never have to worry about monotonous details you just need to provide the facilities it will simply let you know when you need to build another room to keep the proper schedule but you never need to even understand why you need the rooms if you don t care to look deeper into it janitors will always find work to do without you needing to touch them you can manually assign them to something but you could easily complete the game without having to direct them you may be thinking that if the game is too automated surely you won t have enough to do but that s not true at all i rarely got to stop providing rooms and items for my students arranging my rooms expanding tweaking positions of things adding new things when students were having problems there are so many avenues you could experience problems in with your campus just on a basic level that all of those finer automated details feel really good rather than taking anything away from the experience i had read that the game wasn t challenging enough but it can be if you want to engage with the challenge modes or you get deeper into the campaign or dlcs the final campus of the medical school dlc is extremely tough still even as the game may be a little below average in difficulty it always feels utterly engaging and satisfying to get your campus running smoothly there are some things that get excessively tedious if you wish to 3 star campuses if it asks you to raise your attractiveness rating prepare to place hundreds of posters rugs and endless other things to meet that requirement i understand why this is a thing they give you all those kinds of things to make your campus look nice so you should use them right i just wish there were some way to automate some of that i don t personally care about decorating my campus to the degree that it wants so why not a button to just automatically slap posters and stuff on the walls of a room for me maybe it s something they can do in another version not a game breaking issue and for this genre of game it s really not worse than what the competition has you do at times
