2016 this game is the best of all the total war sets the game plays very well with armies that are asymetrical it allows for a lot of differing gameplay between races the magic system is cleaverly done it isn t overpowered which is surprising not a huge fan of the warhammer universe but this adaptation works well the dlc is an issue that has been brought up by many i don t think judging the game itself for the dlc sales strategy is all that appropriate if you have a problem with the dlc rate it in the appropriate area overall great game fun dynamic refreshing
