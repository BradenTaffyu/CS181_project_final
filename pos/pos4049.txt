2021 factor rating description gameplay loop 9 the gameplay loop with this is pretty much perfect the 4 different characters are so different to play the different cards the relics the potions etc synergize with each other in an ungodly amount of ways so that no two runs are the same the fact that removing cards from your deck is just as important as adding cards onto your deck adds another layer of decision making overall one of the most fun 1 hour gameplay loops i ve seen in a game narrative visuals 6 the visuals are pretty simple and do what they need to while there is nothing fancy every card does what it needs to and everything has a charm of its own mechanics challenge 8 while there s a bit of an initial phase where you re unlocking a couple of cards with every new character it standardizes after that point where every run totally depends upon your skill that round instead of getting more and more permanent upgrades which is something i prefer that does end up making the game pretty easy tbh like i am able to reach the spire almost every game and beat him more than half the times even if i haven t played in a long while but that s the thing right i do come back and beating the act iv is a which is the main challenge i would have rated it even higher than 8 here if not for the sloppy implementation of the ascension system idk if it even needed to be there tbh variety 9 the variety of different runs that can go down in this game is insane i ve had some crazy runs with it which is definitely a part of it being a roguelike the different characters play out so differently that they almost feel like different games with completely different approaches you end up taking with each one of them the relics are everything the cards are pretty important and the potions can make for some interesting out of nowhere plays there s good variety of bosses and elite fights as well which keeps things fresh mapping 6 the mapping is fairly simple it definitely has some decision making involved over which room you want to be choose to tackle but it s not very huge tbh or that complex but still a very essential part of the game sound 6 the sound design and music does what it needs to do but yeah there s nothing here that will stand out interface 8 the interface is well done everything is made clear the icons and pictures for everything are distinct every effect every power every action that happens on screen is made very visible to the player pricing performance 10 5 and 5 replay value 10 this has endless replay value lmaooo literally no complaints here score 8 0 10 full list of rated games docs google com not gonna regret checking this out
