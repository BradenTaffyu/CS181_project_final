2020 let s face it you re not reading reviews for age of empires ii because you ve never heard of it before you want to know how the definitive edition adds or takes away from experiencing one of the most popular rts games of all time coming from someone who has played age of empires ii regularly since its release in 1999 i own the disks supported the hd version and now this i m so happy with this my review will focus on updates and changes good and bad for players already well versed with the older versions of the game first of all this game looks gorgeous without sacrificing the original aesthetic this is important i m not a huge graphics gal if it looks pretty great but how does it play i worried that all the updates would turn one of my favorite games of all time into one that barely resembled what i know and that isn t the case though everything is updated from the tiniest fishing boat to each tree and forage bush it all resembles its original aesthetic snow glistens fish swim in schools beneath crystal clear waves clicking on the ground to approve the construction of a building puts its blueprint outline down in a satisfying burst of dust not only are the graphics updated but some choices were made that while unnecessary are only appealing for example while foraging a bush it loses its robustness over time before becoming sparse just before it depletes the same happens with ore mines and oh my goodness destroying buildings is so supremely satisfying rather than just gain flames before instantly turning into rubble the building collapses in spectacular fashion each brick and shattered piece of glass tumbling to the ground under a cloud of dust different architecture leads to matching piles of rubble to say i m impressed by this is an extreme understatement what about gameplay the hd version released in 2013 and i found myself so frustrated with the updated ai it ruined the game allies would build one army and then once killed would literally stop playing like the hd version the definitive edition allows you to choose from cd ai and even the hd ai if you choose but they have their updated version as well i have yet to play with the updated ai so i can t speak as to its nature but once you choose the cd ai the option sticks unlike the hd version where you had to choose it every time all the commands work and have been updated with new voiceover however i couldn t find the taunts edit nevermind i simply couldn t find them in the longer list of chat commands woololo to your heart s content the definitive edition adds 3 new campaigns and 4 new civilizations it also has updated music while it sounds beautiful there are certain memorable beats to the old tunes that are dulled in the updated version on one hand the music gets less repetitive by taming these memorable parts but on the other hand the old soundtrack is the best and i want to hear it overall the game runs well on its highest settings for me every once in a while it ll lag a bit i think that coincides with autosaves but not often enough to be an issue i play on ludicrous size maps with 8 players so there are always tons of armies and chaos on screen speaking of maps the selection here is wonderful all the original types of random maps are here and there are added types including migration maps that are low on initial resources and cause you to battle it out while trying to grow your empire additionally you gain additional options when it comes to the kind of random map you want to play selecting water based for one example will select all water heavy types of maps and choose randomly you can also literally choose each individual type of map you re open to and apply the settings other last minute pros and cons the maps are overrun with relics which is awesome if you like collecting relics to grow your gold reserves i haven t run low on gold yet and i ve played around a dozen maps thus far mills and docks now give you the option to reseed farms and fish traps automatically as long as you have the resources infinitely the days of crazily clicking to fill your reseed queue are gratefully over there are tons of mini map options here but they ve taken away the combat economic options edit my mistake they simply moved it to a new toggle button sometimes the game suffers from odd glitches where someone will resign and the game won t notify you you ll just notice their name crossed out in the corner if you select the scores to show up above the mini map every once in a while units will slide across the map and i ve witnessed monks moon walking more than once i find both these glitches hilarious and would rather them not be fixed to be honest it only happens once every few hours of playtime so it s more of a pleasant surprise than an immersive breaking experience finally the achievements are more completionist based and don t require millions of hours of playtime like the hd version play 1000 games as all empires thank the gods i m very protective of age of empires ii it s a game i will regularly play until i die so i want it treated right the definitive edition does it justice and the helpful updates add so much value to those of you who love this game already support this version for as much money as you can spare to anyone who hasn t played age of empires ii and is looking to start this is a great opportunity to do so take notice developers this is how you update an old beloved classic
