2022 the game is awesome started it in 2017 but never finished now just completed the full game on the highest difficulty with permanent death that happens to be my first completion i though that an impossible feat when i started every battle is deadly every enemy far superior however once you learn to think in a certain way it becomes real fun the game inspires you to think outside the box and carefully prepare using all available tools there are plenty of nasty surprises so never let your guard down the story is exciting and the characters interesting and inspiring definitely recommended and yes 70 of my playtime was spent failing in fort joy
