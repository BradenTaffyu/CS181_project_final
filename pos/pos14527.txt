2020 do i recommend this game is a tricky question because it has two answers yes i do recommend civilization 6 with the latest expansions and updates as of june 2020 it s a pretty deep game with overall balanced choices and interesting cast of characters it s fairly easy if you are a veteran but playing online with friends is an absolute blast no i do not recommend civilization 6 without any expansions civilizations v will stay forever my favourite in the civ family and with all its expansions it is more worth than the base game of civ 6 i recently played the base game with some friends who got it for free on the epicstore and i realized just how much the game gets deeper and just overall more fun with all the new civs units and mechanics does it have exploits yes is it buggy at times yes but as a great webcomic once said the joy you feel when it works outbalances the sadness you feel when it doesn t therefore increasing the total happiness in the world so whatever
