2021 tl dr overall i would recommend this game for people who are casually interested in the basic mechanical and aesthetic aspects of vehicles if you already own cms18 or want a deep detailed dive into the nuts and bolts of a mechanic s experience i would not suggest this game reasons i would recommend for those who are mildly interested in auto mechanics or are younger this is a great introductory game you can learn many vehicle parts and their general location in the vehicle you can experience a simplified start to finish process of buying and restoring an old vehicle this is an entry level game that s good for a casual gaming experience can be played in small increments of time with very little investment you won t get frustrated by this game or rage quit there is decent variability with a wide assortment of vehicles multiple ways to obtain them and multiple ways to play tweaking vehicles with tuning parts and a significantly improved parts quality process adds an additional layer of interest and varietyreasons i would not recommend this game if you re interested in the nuts and bolts details of auto mechanics want a realistic experience or you already own cms18 this game may be a disappointment it was for me oversimplified processes minigames and repairs most processes are still a single click with an animation the game is a more polished slightly expanded version of cms18 the graphics user interface and usability got overhauled but the gameplay is virtually identical imho the so called expert mode is still too easy with too much hand holding and virtually no punishment for making mistakes i should be able to return an incomplete car to an owner and get penalized for it like i would in real life if the expert mode stays the same then i want a hardcore mode where there aren t any parts silhouettes for assembly i m penalized for botched orders parts are damaged for starting an engine without oil body parts are damaged by crashing while driving the shopping list is removed etc we were promised a new damage type dents but it turned out to be just cosmetic like rust i was fully expecting a new process step such as using a dent puller before repairing the body panel on the workbench but it was another missed opportunity it is now even easier to get xp and money which shortens the rpg experience there was a missed opportunity by not expanding vehicle sale options to include auctioning off my newly restored vehicles or running my own salon dealership i m missing the ability to reset a fully restored vehicle s mileage to increase it s value if the vehicle has all 100 parts shouldn t it effectively have 0km no wear and tear on it to take this game to the next level for me would require enhancing its processes from single click experiences to an interactive one for example welding could have a minigame for clicking on damaged points of the frame to weld them and the carwash could require a scrubbing motion minigame to spray buff the car if you re adding minigames to some of the processes why not do it to all of them and make the games actually relevant to the task like we got with the alignment tools i wish i had a mixed review button because i m really torn on this one i had high expectations after the huge improvement cms18 was over cms15 but i ended up being disappointed with nearly identical gameplay to cms18 in a shiny new 2021 wrapper i m recommending this game because it is well developed and will suit many people s interests but it will not provide the experience more invested players enthusiasts like myself are looking for i would love to see a non casual version of this game that multiplies its depth note i am aware of other more in depth games however i don t wish to mention them in this review out of respect for this developer and publisher they made a really good game that is fun it s just not meeting my personal expectations or desires
