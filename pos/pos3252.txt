2021 if you re a fan of dragon age origins then scoop this baby up asap an incredibly immersive fun game where you can easily roleplay as whatever character you choose using a multitude of diverse dialogue options that actually have rewards and consequences i ve played this about 2 times through and found a lot of things i didn t find in my first playthrough and approached fights situations differently than i did in the first playthrough so this definitely has great replay value the first playthrough was also excruciatingly hard even on normal but once i got the mechanics down it was fun albeit still challenging you cannot grind in this game so there s a limit to how much xp you can get to level up which is why act i is so tough i would also recommend choosing one of the default characters because their backstories have more depth than creating your own also enjoyed the online co op lots of secrets to find and stories to unfold would definitely recommend buying
