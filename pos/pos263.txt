2019 most of the hours i have in this game have been spent playing with my girlfriend its some of the best bonding time we have we legit spent at least 3 hours straight designing the interior of our home and we still giggle when we get into the same bed together shes a completionist and has totally showed me aspects of the game i never knew existed cause i will literally just farm the entire time i play i love this game the multiplayer was a huge boost to it and im so glad to have a game i can play with my girl shes very picky about games she plays luckily we are both huge fans of harvest moon so naturally i had to tell her about this game and its just awesome if you got a significant other and you like to get seriously grossly cute with eachother and enjoy games like harvest moon play stardew valley together you wont regret it edit hadn t touched this game in quite some time then my girlfriend comes at me all excited cause there was a huge update so we played again had more fun arranging our new home on that new island not finished yet though but yay for more bonding time again if you and your significant other like harvest moon type games get this game and play together
