2020 i like the game a lot of people seemed to not so much because it s called fallout but it has different stuff than other fallout games so you might have to pretend the game has a different title if you re one of those people if you re like me you don t care what video games are called because franchising is a business thing and really doesn t effect my direct experiences so you can just keep calling it fallout i liked the game
