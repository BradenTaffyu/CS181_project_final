2017 i hate driving games and i hate driving even more in irl i saw someone playing it and i couldn t understand for the life of me why anyone would want to play something that sounded so boring then i tried it for myself it seemed nice watching the beautiful scenery roll by while you re driving and listening to music is very relaxing 19 hours in 1 5 days later i think i m addicted to it and can t stop playing i m not even sure why i have already thought about quitting my day job and just be a full time virtual truck driver
