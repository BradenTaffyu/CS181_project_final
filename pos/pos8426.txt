2018 amazing game i didn t knew too much about the game before i launched it and i expected average economy strategy for a few hours but the game greatly exceeded my expectation atmosphere of this game is outstanding art style is amazing and everything is extremely polished graphics interface music basically one from the best game about style of steampunk and survival in cold winter and also management of industrial society also there is some focus on story and role play no need to describe its features and details it will just spoil an experience if you like economic strategies survival winter or steampunk just buy it you will not be disappointed the only downside it seems a bit short i completed the game in approximately 12 hours during slow gameplay without much usage of x3 speed and it is still interesting to replay it a 1 2 more times unfortunately it is not anno like game where you can spent hundreds or thousand of hours but still it provides amazing experience so it not a big deal highly recommend update once i completed the game and won i feel that i need to update my review just want to add single word masterpiece
