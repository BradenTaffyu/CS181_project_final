2015 edit original review found after the jump this article sinisterdesign net makes several smart points about the definition of rpg as we use it now it concludes that an rpg is a game that features player driven development of a persistent character or characters via the making of consequential choices i know people gripe about not being able to make meaningful choices in fallout 4 in comparison to previous fallout games or other crpg s and in a lot of ways i agree but the reviews i was responding to don t say fallout 4 is not a crpg they say fallout 4 is not an rpg it s an fps the game limits the kind of choices you can make in order to streamline the experience and focus on a bigger market they didn t remove choice completely as what you choose to do still absolutely affects both subplots and the main storyline but they did limit it pretty significantly i want to re state that just because it doesn t have as much choice as previous fallout games it doesn t mean it doesn t have choice at all there is a difference between not being able to do as much of something and not being able to do that thing at all the rpg world isn t cut and dry and for people making the distinction that jrpg s are different no they re not they are still rpg s it s just a sub genre of a much broader category just like action rpg s which is honestly what i would consider fallout 4 but as such it is still fully an rpg it s just not as much of a crpg as it once was but it is most certainly not an fps the shooting mechanics are way sub par in comparison to the current fps market and it is definitely not an action adventure title definitions change with time gaming and gaming categorizations are not a science i understand people are upset that the game doesn t fit their expectation of what they thought it would be there are things i miss from previous fallout games too did that curve my enjoyment maybe a little not enough to dismiss the game as a failure or to label it a non rpg it just means i needed to adjust my expectations expectations set by the audience not the developer we were told we d be delivered an expansive rpg with better graphics better fighting mechanics an overhauled weapons modding system new building mechanics and a streamlined narrative interface that s what we got the people who are complaining that this isn t an rpg because your character comes with a backstory are forgetting the final fantasy games the kingdom hearts series every zelda game ever are those not rpg s then because there are few choices to make in those games and all of the characters we play have set backstories but it s still an rpg rpg doesn t mean you literally get to role play every part of your character yes i understand that that s what we re used to from fallout but to be honest bethesda s fallout games have never been true fallout games to begin with they began by essentially scrapping the feel of the fallout games that came before and are simply evolving their take on the world once more to say that this game isn t worth it simply because it isn t the same game we ve gotten twice before is ironic it isn t an fps not by a long shot a game having passable shooting mechanics does not make it an fps it is fully an rpg but with a stronger focus on story than we ve gotten before does this mean you don t get to still explore the world no there is still tons to do in fallout 4 and just because your choices don t affect the main storyline as much as in other games doesn t mean the subplots aren t heavily affected by who you choose to be what you choose to say and who you choose to align yourself with fallout 4 is a different game than fallout 3 and fallout new vegas were just like those titles were completely different from fallout 1 and fallout 2 that doesn t mean that they weren t fallout games and it doesn t mean that this isn t a fallout game too
