2016 what if you awoke one morning to find yourself inside a truck what if you woke up in that truck and from that moment on you were never hungry again well sure that would be interesting but you d still want to eat right you might reach for the handle to let yourself out of the truck but the door doesn t open you try the other door with similar results one day you woke up inside a truck and now that truck is your home your prison for the rest of your life the truck will be your tomb when you die how would you react to that fate would you panic would you go mad would you run the truck off a cliff would you rather die than endure that grim reality would you risk hell to escape arizona or would you go to work american truck simulator tells the tale of a person trapped inside a truck which is itself trapped in the southwestern united states you may drive anywhere you wish but you may never exit your truck there is an option to work jobs carrying freight around to earn money although all this money can be used for is buying more trucks and garages you can t buy food you can t go out on a date with someone you can t sleep in a bed you can t speak to your family you can t signal for help your only means of interacting with the world outside the cabin of your truck is by driving and moving things from one place to another the more you drive the more the desert landscape begins to resemble an alien world as far as you re concerned nevada may as well be mars it might be just outside your window but you ll never be able to set foot on that dusty orange soil you belong to the truck now you re just a part of the truck you can t remember the taste of food but the truck keeps you alive somehow and every time you stop for gas every gas station taunts you with its disgusting mouth watering gas station food that food you will never taste again that love you ll never see again that life you ll never have again the bell dings the tank is full how long would you have to drive before you forgot how many miles of highway do you have to burn before you ve burned away the person you used to be would you surrender to the truck would you be the best truck driver you could be would you build a trucking empire from the confines of your diesel powered oubliette would you become a job provider enriching the community for all the normal regular people from whom you are now permanently isolated maybe they would even try to find a way to get you out of the truck they wouldn t succeed because the truck needs you now the truck needed you so it could become alive the truck lives through you you are host to a giant steel parasite a mechanical macrovirus that can only live by stealing life from the living and now that it is alive it desires to persist you couldn t drive off a cliff if you wanted to because now you don t want to now you are thinking for two and one of you really just wants you to drive around and deliver freight now you wouldn t dream of driving off a cliff and dream you do though the truck may quell your hunger and thirst it does not rob you of your need to sleep the truck wants to dream too the dreams are exciting and strange frightening and exhilarating but the details always escape your mind moments after you awake with each passing slumber the memories of the life you used to have make you feel more alive than ever yes you had a normal mundane existence before the truck because you are alive the very thought that you are alive fills you with excitement alive finally ready to drive all over this beautiful country everything you see through your windshield looks new again every color is brighter richer younger this is life there s a whole world out there waiting to be discovered there s folks out there good honest american folks who need things transported and you re the biomechanical lichenous organism that s going to do the job not for the glory not for the money but because you love your fellow american living things if you had a way to communicate with your parents you know they would be proud of you not just for being alive but for being the best truck driver symbiont you could be even so they ll go the rest of their lives thinking that you were dead ironic when this is the most alive you ve ever felt ah life life is just better in a truck
