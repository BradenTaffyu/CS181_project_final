2023 it saddens me a lot to see all the hate this game is getting i think it is absolutely fantastic i can t remember the last time i was ending turn after turn and going late into the night so invested i am in my fiefdom my culture and my plans to become pharaoh it feels very different to troy it feels different to other tw games it feels more complex more strategic and more rewarding yes it needs greece and mesopotamia they got that wrong and yes i am biased as i have a masters in egyptology haha so i find this period of history insanely interesting if you have the money give it a go i am having a blast
