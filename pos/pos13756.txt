2018 endless replayability both offline and online in my personal opinion the singleplayer campaign at any difficulty can fill you with hours of exploration trying new tactics exploring the story and just dying over and over again the multiplayer is where arma 3 really shines with it s one of a kind class aaa community playing every game mode you can think of and adding more every day via the steam workshop modding community you and your friends if you enjoy military sims willl have a blast for hours days and even weeks you ll make new friends along the way and if you re a realism buff most everything you find in this game exists in real life and will satisfy all your interests i highly recommend you get this during a sale as the costs of the dlc bundles can be hefty without it and if you can t wait for a steam sale get a buddy to help you out or go mow more lawns for your neighbors it s worth it
