2020 this game is one of the biggest mixed bag games i think i ve ever player so i ll list the pros and then the two glaring cons pros you get to live out your dreams of being a space emperor did you think there was going to be anything else that s awesome but for real great graphics that scale well with bigger fights amazing sound track that you ll probably turn off in the first thirty minutes fun mini stories that add spice as you get into the early late game the new patches also basically fix the vanilla versions though your still going to want the three best expansisions if you ever though i wish i could be a space admiral and dictator this is that and more cons the ai this game has some of the worst a i ever of all time during galaxtic senate votes it never votes with any purpose often just randomly they will propose votes and then propose repeals for the same ones right after they pass sometimes from the same empire i finally made myself stick through a game to the end the end game is stupid boring w o expanshions and the a i 100 ruined it for me without ruining anything for you as if that matters here a 700k strong fleet bugged out and didn t want to fight my 80k strong station so i had enough time to compleatly rebuild a fleet refit that fleet because if forgot to build towards their weaknesses and i was going to kill them half of them started moving towards a wormhole popped in right next to my fleet and i just killed them this was on the second to hardest difficulty and if the a i had just moved forward it would have won but it didn t and i wiped it without a second thought yes the whole games like this if you wanted to actually play this you re going to need friends because while the early and mid game a pretty solid with a i their going to make that 60 hours feel pretty wasted in the late game lastly this isn t a game of rock paper scissors it s a game of rocks vs bigger rock there are five ways to win an fight 1 have more ships this is legit how 80 of the fight go down and it s stupid how little strategy goes into this 2 know your going to fight like 2 hours before you do so you can build your ships to take advantages of their weakness this takes a lot of effort but can be rewarding or you can mess it up and just die 3 out maneuver your foe it sounds cool but you d probably have better luck swimming threw mayo 4 crush their economy so they can t fight this is honestly to big brain for me and dosn t even seem like a thing with a i since they never really build economies anyways 5 don t get in a fight shrugs this loops get s really boring really fast like this review and all fight are basically is my number bigger well i guess i win then you attack and die half of the time because some invisable number your opponent has like a defence buff i obviouslly have a lot more to say about this but honestly only the psychopaths are still reading at this point so in summary get this game have fun but don t be surprised when all your hard work kind of falls flat
