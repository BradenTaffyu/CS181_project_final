2016 early access review oh god this this game is an addiction it has consumed every free hour hell i even snuck away to play it for an hour at work on lunch i ve stayed up till 4am playing it three times in the last two weeks i m 34 i can t do that anymore no regrets the game is amazing ludeon keep developing this and make it better and better that said i have to step away from it for the sake of my free time edit though no one will see it or cares i felt the need to update this for the wanderlust update the game was addictive before but this update cranks the addition up to 17 with the ability to expand to multiple settlements the game is just downright amazing
