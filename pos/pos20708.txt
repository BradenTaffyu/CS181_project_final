2023 hogwarts legacy is a great game very polished by today s standards in my opinion but it is lacking in some small areas below i have listed the pros and cons of the game i also listed what i want to see in the future as well as what i don t want to see in the future keep in mind i am not a massive harry potter fan and only have seen the movies a long time ago this list was made over the course of my playthrough during the 72 hour early access for deluxe editon owners hopefully there is a day 1 patch out by now enjoy pros good performance could be better but it is very good at least for me great immersion graphics and art style changing seasons fancy animation with spells puzzles doors and all that great music sound design broom class kinda popped off with that music engaging story narrative fun late game combat ancient magic is sick just use your spells and mix it up it s pretty fun exploration rewards you heavily for it detailed big world you can go into any building find many secrets solve fun puzzles pet cats and much more interesting characters there are lots the voice acting is sometimes bad great transmog once you get the item you keep its appearance for use whenever you want great quests there are a ton fun skins outfits great outfit pieces mount skins wand skins and all that almost no bugs visual bugs only most are funny no crashes accessibility ui options there are lots graphic options also lots npc quest speed wow npcs that actually move your speed on quests more games should do this room of requirement fun to customize can be daunting at times cons no quidditch cramped camera sometimes it can be at weird angles maybe add customizable positions character customization i m referring to the customization at the start of the game it s a bit iffy voice pitch in the character customization menu at the start every voice pitch besides the default one sounds robotic voice acting sometimes repetitive early game combat not a lot of spells to use but it s understandable limited gear slots can be increased by doing merlin trials confusing menu at first it was hard for me to get used to it all at once i couldn t find transmog or my twitch drops useless houses from what i have played your house doesn t mean much useless wands when choosing your wand the attributes don t do anything from what i have seen from a game standpoint it makes sense small enemy boss variety all 4 trials are the same etc graphical stuttering in cutscenes mostly sometimes happens when entering newly rendered areas lighting transitions flickering sometimes the lighting can be blinding or just straight up weird looking door loading when traversing the castle sometimes the game will show a loading icon on doors robot background npcs they pretty much don t do anything but walk and talk with no reactions to spells or anything npc ai animations sometimes it s a bit janky what i want to see multiplayer at least quidditch multiplayer mod support would be awesome especially steam workshop quidditch they have the golden snitch and the arena in game already camera control positioning maybe increased fov slider photo mode please better character customization more skin colors hair face shapes and more improved voice pitch better pitch shifter improved voice acting most likely will not happen bug fixes lighting transition fixes better performance door loading improvements more accessibility options arachnophobia switch community engagement free in game events to win cosmetics community updates and more ex dying light 2 is a game that does this very well what i don t want to see micro transactions overpriced dlc radio silence no more updates no communication and all that would be a bummer to conclude most of the cons can be fixed easily don t let the cons bring you down i believe most of the cons will be fixed addressed anyways here are my pc specs and i ran the game at 1440p with consistent 120 fps at almost all times no rtx on cpu intel core i9 12900k cpu 5 20ghzgpu nvidia geforce rtx 3090ram 32 gb ddr4 ramstorage installed on my 250 gb ssdmonitor samsung odyssey g7 1440p 240hz 27 inch
