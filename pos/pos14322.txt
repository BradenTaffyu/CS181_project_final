2022 early access review dyson sphere is a fun and relaxing factory building game the story is present but mostly there to guide you on the options within the game i have spent a lot of hours enjoying de stressing and trying different avenues of logic to building a balanced and functional planetary factory the graphics and effects are well done exploring the worlds throughout the star cluster can get repetitive but it looks fantastic just the same the developers are active and introducing new additions to the game frequently as well giving the experience refreshing renewal for multiple play sessions dyson sphere is recommended for those that enjoy logical building and factory games there is room for the game to grow and the developer team is actively adding to the game giving more value to the future of the game as well my planet has changed quite a bit a screenshot of dyson sphere program by old man gamer omg
