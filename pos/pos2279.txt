2022 t s so buggy lol but sometimes u forget about it even tho you d see a bugged out feral dog also i just keep killing those bos near the first overseer camp u get to see great way to farm armor and ammo no consequences i like hanging outside the vault and giving new players stim packs and a complete heavy armor set please do the same when u are at a higher level it makes it fun and memorable for new players for i experienced something like that when i first began the game overall great game but it is a bit too buggy hopefully they will fix that i have around 150 hours in the game i d still play and visit the game from time to time it is fun and a very nostalgic game i enjoy the radio very much the community is great and there are a lot of great people you ll pass by what made the game even more memorable to me was that i played it with a friend of mine we began from measly level 1 to 200 enemies at that level at lower levels were a challenge it was fun and will forever be an awesome experience
