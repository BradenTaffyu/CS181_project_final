2016 early access review a very very good zombie survival game its a breather from the over the shoulder gritty shooter zombie games that try and fail to tell a story first off this game is in fact extremely realistic how so you ask if you are injured by say a sharp peice of glass you can rip apart some curtains soak the peices in disinfectant and apply the bandage then when the bandage gets dirty you have to take it off and re apply another bandage weapons lose durability when used your line of sight is limited by every object in the game the list goes on a strong attention to detail a simple and intuitive crafting system that is tinker friendly and a constant feeling of dread when the walkers come around is what makes this game stand out thumbs up for this one
