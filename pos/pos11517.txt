2015 early access review new edited review recent pros balance has been fixed quite a bit so this game is much less of a grind given there is still grinding to be done loving the new rpg like elements this makes it so the game doesn t get boring too quickly navezgane is bigger now optimization has improved the speed the game runs for me lately animations and new hd zombies make combat more interesting ability to stun and decapitate zombies is a great mechanic glad it was added in beautiful world and challenging survival elements keep me engaged for long periods of time while playing recent cons while it is easier to level up skills than before some are still way easier to level up than others example upgraded two existing structures with wood and got construciton tools up to level 52 of 100 whilst having killed around 50 zombies with a bow and numerous animals archery is still only level 2 weak i am still experiencing weather bugs from a long time ago using debugweather in the console commands shows the outside temperature is registering as 137 degrees fahrenheit in the desert i know deserts get hot but i don t think there s a desert on the planet that gets that hot that temperature carries on into the burned forest biome as well strangely enough this only occurs twice a day once at dawn and once at dusk in the middle of the day when it should be the hottest i get normal temperatures of between 90 100 a tutorial on harvesting and skills perks would be helpful still a little grindy would still recommend this game to anyone i have enjoyed it immensely and with the most recent update i ll be playing it much more
