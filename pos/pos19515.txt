2015 i along with an unfortunately large number of people was not too fond of new vegas when it was released my original review was littered with complaints about bugs issues uneven difficulty and so on however with fallout 4 on the horizon i think i m going to miss obsidian they have or had an understanding of what i appreciate most about the series and it took me almost five years to realize it don t know what you got till it s gone when it comes to the post apocalyptic wasteland once you ve seen one bombed out building filled with skeletons you ve seen them all i got my fill of destroyed beauty in fallout 3 i expect something a little more intriguing new vegas creates a more thoughtful world the characters are interesting the stories are imaginative and there s always that superb twist of dark humor it ain t pretty though and i mean that in every sense of the word speaking from a strict game design perspective the mojave is amazing there s a linear structure which works well for first timers in subsequent play throughs you ll know where to go how to get around those freakin cazadores and create your own path if you focus entirely on the main quest line the average play through is roughly 5 10 hours naturally once you factor in all of the additional content side quests dlc mods etc that time balloons into absurdity i think it s perfect i also really appreciate that this game doesn t employ level scaling but the mojave is not only a desert it s also a desert that suffered through a nuclear war even new vegas itself is just a few casinos and some lights if you didn t notice the details you d think it was the blandest place imaginable the details are where new vegas absolutely shines each dungeon has a story to tell some like vault 11 are among the best the genre has conceived it helps to pay attention to posters and even subtleties like what somebody was holding before they died or how some everyday objects are arranged this is what i appreciate the most from fallout s jump to 3d though i have a soft spot for reading a paragraph of text when i right click on a broken vent sometimes i just want to be able to see that it is in fact a broken vent and move on not only are there multiple endings there are also several methods for getting to them every quest has numerous solutions and if you can t be bothered then just crack skulls until you re allowed to progress the faction system is also quite interesting especially now that it works and it s nice to have actual consequences bethesda s obsession with essential npcs drives me insane diplomacy is also extremely effective not only can you talk people out of fighting but you can talk people into fighting for you in a couple play throughs i sat back while my allies did all of heavy lifting even for the climatic hoover dam battle on the flipside there isn t any benefit to playing a stupid character this is the unfortunate side effect of higher production values everyone has to be voice acted and there s no time to record hundreds of lines to satisfy low intelligence play throughs playing an idiot in fallout 2 was so much fun the combat mechanics are well they re still rather poor this is something that i ve grown to accept with this game we can t expect all games to be at the level of fear 1 when it comes to shooting but fo3 nv are content with barely passable after all these years though i guess i ve just grown tired of pointing it out i never paid much attention to combat in the 2d fallout games it might be considered strategic but for me it s only entertaining when i knock a chunk out of somebody with a sledgehammer critically hit someone with an advanced karate move that kills them instantly or shoot their eyes out with limited edition red ryder bb gun basically when i get into a fight in fallout i only care about the results i punch someone someone turns into dog food and that s good enough since this is a review of a bethesda game on the pc i might as well talk about mods with skyrim i got almost all of my enjoyment through modding with new vegas it isn t really necessary there are a handful of mods that i think are essential new vegas stutter remover mission mojave and project nevada once you grab those you re pretty much set now i m not saying that s all you ll ever want in terms of mods but it s more than sufficient for playing and enjoying the base game the only other notable mods i have installed are a world of pain and daughters of a r e s awop adds hundreds of dungeons which can be fun to shoot through i have ares installed because the courier is actually a cool looking robot with anime colored hair this is totally immersive and most certainly canon also when playing new vegas instead of listening to starrrrrrrrs of the midnight rangers for the billionth time i listen to non stop eurobeat in short i have a new found appreciation for this awesome game mission mojave might make this mod unnecessary i m not sure
