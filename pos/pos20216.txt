this is my first warhammer 40k game i am not that invested into lore as some people but i still enjoy the game as far as i have reached in game the story is good lots of reading to do as there is not much voice acting skills are not that straight forward and would take multiple play throughs to understand at least thats what i felt there are ship combat too you have to do choices that can effect the ending i am playing coop and it works nicely too but there are issues though lots of loading screens in game combine it with your friends who live in different parts of the world with different internet connection speed you get the idea but still its not that bad only the host can make the choices in game dont expect baldurs gate 3 type choice for each character but your friends can do skill checks in game so thats a plus there is friendly fire too so positioning is important so my verdict i like the game if you enjoy turn based combat story heavy game chances are you would too
