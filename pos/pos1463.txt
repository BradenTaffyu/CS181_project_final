2023 early access review so i bought this game on christmas for 10 on sale from then i have played nearly 200 hrs the ui although is just big text box menus are easy to understand and work as intended the sense of dread that the game creates is perfect the immediate opening you will die sets the game up for the fact that you will die and that all you do in the game is just a slow crawl to your death and it is amazing the detail they have which leads there the gameplay is fun and rewarding the noise when you kill a zombie is perfect and works to make you know for sure when they die if you fail your combat you die however when you win it can lead lead to more loot gained such as getting a new weapon or essential building materials for your base the amount of depth put into each system is mid boggling the rule for me and my friends was if it happens in real life or makes common sense it will probably be the same in game eg standing near bodies will slowly kill you if you drink bleach you die you can smash a window to get into a car and then hotwire it there are just so many things you can do not to mention the absolute abundance of mods and multiplayer servers these go from changing animations and adding new vics to a full overhaul of weapons armour and adding huge cites and well made areas to the map servers have something for everyone laid back it exists hardcore it s there rp go for it pvp and much more you are guaranteed to find something that tickles your fantasy overall solid 8 10 only problems being its occasional bug and unfortunately not much storytelling in way of any notes or such
