2017 early access review this is the closest you can get to a realistic zombie apocalypse in a game you aren t superman in this game if you get even a single bite it is only a matter of time before you die and turn into a zombie just like everyone else and there is something horrifying about actually losing control and seeing the character you created turn into a zombie if you want to survive you must learn to be stealthy and clever instead of trying to be a hero after a few weeks the power and running water will go down so you will need to live off nature and take increasingly bigger risks to scavenge for the things you need rain and river water are dangerous and even canned food will rot away after a few months crops can catch diseases and take a long time to grow trapping animals and fishing requires precious food as bait for uncertain results but those are worries for the long term survivor i have played half a dozen games so far and i never made it to the end of the second month there are no spawnpoints savegames power ups or any other such nonsense that kill the challenge and immersion the game will kill you no matter how hardcore you think you are there will be a moment where you forget to turn off a heatsource burning down your base in your sleep you will get complacent and loot a bathroom with a zombie lurking right behind the door a crawler will get to you while you tend to your crops etc death is inevitable and that is for the best this type of game tends to get stale after a certain point and zomboid will end you before you can get too bored and if for some reason it does it give you plenty of settings to tweak the zombies you want them to hear see and or smell you from a mile away shuffling isn t enough for you and you prefer runners if so you are a braver survivor than i am the devs are currently working on vehicles which you can play with on an experimental branch of the game they are a bit unbalanced in their current form and they have a few graphic gliches but i still highly recommend to play the vehicle version of the game instead of the default just like everything else the town layouts are realistic which means that the distances between towns are huge meaning you won t even see most of it if you only slog around on foot the are a few negatives in this game the main one is the extremely slow development time while trying to learn about this game i kept running into posts going back as far as 2014 and it s hard to find out what is current information and what isn t npc s are very important in a game like this and i keep reading about how they were initially added but later removed until they are more fleshed out which also was years ago firearms are near useless the way they are currently balanced you can t even hit a zombie if you are pointing the gun directly against his head making this an extremely dangerous skill to level up that is generally not worth the risk of attracting every zombie within a large radius my biggest issue is that the melee combat feels a bit clunky i ve experienced two deaths so far because my character faced in the wrong direction while trying to fight off a zombie and got bitten i felt like i was fighting the controls rather than the zombie if you like mowing down zombies with your team play left for dead 2if you like to fight other survivors in a zombie world with light survival mechanics play dayzif you are a true zombie survival nut this is the game for you
