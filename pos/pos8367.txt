2018 both this war of mine and frostpunk have an exceptional concept simple but adorable graphics intense gameplay well written stories touching soundrack and ending which gives you chills these games can be incredibly hard and stressful but this is exactly what makes them so unique it s a challenge where you need to bring people through the struggles and loss to save their lives you will be forced to make difficult choices and deal with consequences i believe that 11 bit studios are real artists and their work is important not only because of the gaming experience they offer but more for the spirit they put into their games
