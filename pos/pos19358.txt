2022 the civilisations in aoe4 have some major asymmetry going on which i find brings really diverse gameplay the map that is selected affects your civ choice and the civ you re going up against has a major impact on your playstyle and strategy tactics despite this the game is really well balanced at the moment and if the multiplayer versus is not your thing the single player campaigns are really cool re enacting pivotal battles throughout history along with interesting info and videos on medieval times i m thoroughly enjoying all aspects of this game
