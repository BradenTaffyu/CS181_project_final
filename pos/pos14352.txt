2021 early access review like others have said it s a nice mix of factorio and satisfactory but you couldn t call it a clone of either dyson sphere has it s own thing going on and its amazing so far i really love the total annihilation style graphics definitely a worthy addition to your library if you enjoy spending hours optimizing your conveyor belts for an extra 4 production speed
