i love this game but there are too many dlc s it s very annoing that you have only the half game when you buy the deluxe edition and i m not so rich that i can buy every dlc sure it s not that horrible like sims 4 but it s very sad that you can only have a part of the game for the full price but still this game is very nice and have fun with it
