2017 the plot of the adventure game nier automata says that in the conflict of people and machines the aliens are to blame they killed almost the entire population of the earth left behind an unthinkable number of robots from small to large and safely disappeared few survivors hid in the space station and in the resistance settlements and to reclaim their native spaces invented androids those acting in special combat units descend to the surface of the planet and destroy the rusted persecutors of all living things centuries passed one of the androids a girl named 2b in the company of the talkative team mate 9s helps resistance in the fight against robots robots invaders for a little bit relaxed someone continues to aimlessly wander through the ruins of civilization and attack everything that breathes others go crazy and sound like imitations of sexual intercourse still others participate in a strange theatrical performance acting out the role of the clowns then the sellers of balloons finally there is a separate settlement of robots in self government pacifists who seek contact with people study philosophy and ask how do you conceive a child a madhouse if it s short all this is a strange but very interesting to explore world of nier automata in this story nothing can be taken for granted immediately since most likely the information received half an hour ago will be refuted after the next battle with the boss it remains to observe and build guesses to be surprised by the plot twists and to clutch at the head after another revelation the world of nier automata is relatively small in scale but it is full of interesting and simply amusing events and traveling on it performing side missions or searching for hidden treasure trails is no less interesting than in the classic japanese rpg in new game you can switch chapters and play not only for 2b but also for androids 9s and a2 however it is not entirely correct to compare nier automata with ordinary rpgs the most impressive in the game is a lightning fast bewitching combat system the blessing of which every battle with the most common rusty piece of iron turns into an acrobatic performance the contractions look relatively more decent than in the bayonetta no one tries to force attention to the heroine s extended legs although sometimes the camera catches very evocative footage and are much more measured and understandable than in the meral gear rising revengeance nier in this sense is intuitively simpler than the named games it gives time to understand what is happening and does not throw tens of new tests on the player s head at a time this semi meditative journey is akin to a dance 2b can be improved and customized for different game situations with the help of chips for some it may seem too tricky but the intricacies will bother only connoisseurs of high levels of complexity a separate point is how cleverly nier automata presents unusual solutions and finds in terms of game design being as a matter of fact one of the brightest author s projects of the last several years she absolutely does not hesitate of her identity the game cleverly switches from slasher to scrollshuter then changes the angle to the side view and after makes you fight with a giant combat robot giant this is when a player fights with a hand takes it out of action in a mobile armor soars up into the sky and shoots the enemy in the head and if you like to consider the main character you can destroy her skirt self destruction and resurrection of android and catch much more picturesque shots 2b of course will drive away the annoying operator but in the case of long ladders it does not help when asked why the heroine wears heels the creator of the game responds i just really like girls when after the demo version the internet was filled with juicy frames 2b in fact erotic content and the same illustrations of artists he just wrote to twitter long to collect you can collect the archive and send the archives are still updated weekly
