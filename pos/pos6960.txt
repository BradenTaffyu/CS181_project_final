2022 a fun game solo or with friends story is average imo but it feels that you don t really play raft only for the story i enjoyed building and expanding my raft exploring the various islands and doing dumb things it is nice that unlike other games what you build is actually useful to you and always used because the raft is everything so any time you spend building and decorating your raft does not feel wasteful or redundant one thing to keep in mind that over a certain number of friends early game play is hard i recommend giving it a shot if you like survival and building games
