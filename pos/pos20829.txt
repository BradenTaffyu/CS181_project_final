2023 all politics aside this is a solid game the creator is entitled to their opinion the ultimate love letter to the wizarding world been dying to play this since its first announcement i ve read all the books countless times and seen the movies more times than anyone this truly makes you feel like a wizard and has that whimsical dark feel to it i love how you can choose to be good or evil with no consequence haven t had this kind of system since fable 2 the way i play i m pretty much a school shooter with magic psycho mode love the tonal shift from school which reminds me of bully to everything outside the safe zones which become killing floors i also love how sadistic you can be towards everyone for once we have a game that truly doesn t feel like anything else entirely unique as things should be one of the best rpgs since skyrim i actually feel like doing everything there is to offer so immersive highly recommend it of course another 10 10 in my eyes avada kedavra
