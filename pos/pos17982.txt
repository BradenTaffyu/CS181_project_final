2021 when rome 2 came out in 2013 i was terribly let down and felt i hadn t learned my lesson from empire total war and was being punished accordingly but all these years later this game unlike empire was not left to die and was instead has bloomed into an amazing game it is now one of the very best in the series and i would recommend it to anyone wanting to get into the historical total war games
