2020 alright hold onto your hats people because we re about to enter the wacky world of garry s mod this game is like the swiss army knife of video games it s got a tool for everything and if you can t find what you re looking for you can probably just make it yourself want to play hide and seek with your friends done want to launch an xbox 360 into space no problem want to create a giant war between the halo spartans and minecraft mobs why the hell not i mean come on who doesn t love spawning a bunch of npcs and watching them fight to the death and if you get bored of that you can always download some mods and add even more madness to the mix
