2017 wonderful game i can tell you about the difference between it and ets2 each game has it s own charm ats is newer better graphics ets2 has more trucks way more and slightly more upgrades ats only has like 4 2 brands and 2 types of truck for each ets2 has a much bigger world ats is still young so getting max distance perk cannot even be applied as you only go between 3 states ets2 is full europe now including gb where you should remember to drive on the left side of the road ats is smaller because it actually has all the world realistically planned roads barely ever repeat in ets2 you can think hey i ve been here before or not or one more clover highway spread sigh while in ats it s always something new wherever you go and you feel the warmth when you come back to familiar places ats has long straight highways relaxing and enjoyable not too boring not too extreme ets2 has very sharp and plentiful turns whatever you prefer personally i love ats you still get enough turning off the highway in the city or on narrow roads ats has amazing scenery here and there makes you wanna go everywhere ets2 is repetitive the price for being that huge ats has view zoom d to look out for police p ats has very strict speed limits i think it can be turned off but do i really want to do that i left it on speed limits are actually pretty sane you may crash if you break it ats fines for speed violation are much higher and you re watched by police mostly less often by cameras so you a have to look around to see if there s police nearby b you have to watch your speed and current limit c you can decide if you want to keep your money or pay a lot for a questionable right to break the laws wanna be a rebel go ahead d overall it adds to the gameplay very well surprisingly well i hated speed limits in ets2 they were stupid and cheaply fined and meh ats offers more options for parking more exp for difficult position less for fast simple one none for just ditching the trailer at arrival small bit but also adds to the game score ats has slightly better traffic ai in general it s just refined and polished more so ats has a great potential and can one day beat ets2 in all aspects for now i can enjoy both depending on my mood but i must admit i love ats more it s an upgrade after all 10 10 if you love truck simulators yes it s time consuming and may be boring but it s not the game s fault for sure
