2022 as a player who always hated turn based games its hard for me to believe that i actually love this game so much i would even say this is one of best game ive ever played story is amazing voice acting is very good for most character the script and lines are so damn good game itself is very fun already there is so many build you can try and plus theres ton of mods can greatly improve replay value
