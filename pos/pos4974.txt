2016 i shot a radstag across a river with my sniper rifle it ran down the road three supermutants decided a wounded radstag would be an easy meal bothered by the gunfire some bloatflies decided to attack the supermutants the supermutants took cover by ducking behind a car a particularly clever supermutant shot the car one miniature nuclear explosion later there were two supermutant carcasses and one crippled supermutant that wasn t feeling too clever three mongrel dogs decided a wounded supermutant would be an easy meal 10 10 would go hunting again
