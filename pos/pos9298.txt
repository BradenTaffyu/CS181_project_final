2016 this is the true opposite of sleeping pills amazing ai is a little weird sometimes see example below but gameplay is very fun and smooth a just one more turn game even though it is not turn based only negative experience was with a neighboring empire that declared war on me they were superior but i barely managed to fight them of with me fleet and weapon platform positioned at my home system they then retreated to their home system and allowed me to pick of their outer systems in the end i had accumulated high enough war score to demand vassalisation
