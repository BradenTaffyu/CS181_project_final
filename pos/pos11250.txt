early access review i m addicted and can t wait for the full release but there are a couple of things that need to be fixed or added 1 there has to be a way the computer can tell you how much product you have in stock it gets annoying when it comes time to ordering and you have to exit the computer to look on the shelves go back into the computer forget what you need to order exit the computer look at shelves and repeat those steps 5 times 2 it would be cool to have reviews on what you need to fix in game instead of customers griping when they walk out the store and it goes away in 2 seconds 3 this game need some sort of music or customer chatting just hearing beeps all day can drive you crazy 4 needs some sort of dolly or push cart picking up one box at a time gets repetitive 5 minor in game bugs for instance customers complaining about a product that i m not even close to purchasing a license for overall i m loving it and i cant wait to see what the future holds for the game
