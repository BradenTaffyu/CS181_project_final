2021 jurassic world evolution 2 is a park management sim set in the jurassic park franchise world everything you can expect from that is here and yes dinosaurs are the main attraction a clear improvement over the first one in the series with fantastic visuals and good voice acting be ready for some micromanagement but it s not as bad as they say if you like dinosaurs or the jp franchise give it a go first of all be advised i will make a lot of comparisons with the first game since it is the best available reference and most people will come here having played jurassic world evolution first or jwe1 for short this game improves almost everything over its predecessor i d go as far as saying that if you are a complete newcomer skip the first and buy this one it is in general a more polished experience for those veterans of jwe1 everything we wanted in the first game be it an extra or a perceived missing is here the developers listened and it shows finally we got flying and marine reptiles every game element from the previous instalment is available here from the start even those formerly behind a paywall yes the lovely red and grey 90 s cosmetics from the original park the grim facilities from jurassic park 3 and the disney ified modern jurassic world blue hued style also the dlc only species and skins this means that you can play in jurassic world evolution 2 with all the assets from the first game you still need to play to unlock them though unfortunately all this means that you will need to devote more time to unlock things like dinos buildings and techs and it can become tedious after a while thankfully the most essential stuff can be unlocked on a single map and playthrough all others being mere cosmetics one thing is definitely true this one is more grindy and that is a feature that is seldom welcome certain mechanics have changed or have been expanded from the first game the management experience is far from difficult but certain things could have been made easier or more accesible with less clicks still some things feel clunky like map navigation and information overlays it s no longer as easy however now you need to mix and match more specific diet requirements for your herbivores so multi species enclosure design requires more attention and probably you will need to forget the old simple habits of jwe1 on top of this you need to juggle your priorities assign tasks according to staff abilities and manage the eventual refueling and restocking of vehicles and facilities all while keeping an eye on your income now the management is much more serious and bankrupt is a real possibility since all the new activities like research incubation and ranging have an associated cost nothing must be taken for granted now not even paths and electrical facilities while in jurassic world evolution 1 you could practically win with your eyes closed and no effort the experience here is deeper and the game s systems got more complex but in the right amount yes there is more micromanagement involved some things got streamlined like ranger team tasks but others became more complex and demand your attention more often like dinosaur breeding there s a whole new system of employee management and they even get mad if you don t allow them some rest now you need to hire scientists train them and assign them activities that in jwe1 were just a matter of a few clicks this game has more plates for you to juggle at the same time mind you just as it happened in the first game if you are efficient and know what you re doing it won t be a problem in terms of visuals graphics are as beautiful as ever animals buildings environment lighting effects this is a game in which you can lose yourself just watching the landscape and the dinosaurs interacting there are dozens of animal skins and customization to choose for and there are also building variations to reflect your personal tastes and the opportunity to make your park truly unique is there you can spend hours designing everything from the pathways and areas to the looks of the storefronts the catalog of dinosaurs is huge and i can only guess it will increase very soon with various dlc every single dino from jwe1 is present here from the start and then some they need to be unlocked trough gameplay though but that was to be expected dinosaur behavior is much better now they cuddle and sit down chat with each other more often and the sleeping animations are better they also have a territory which they will share with friends and defend from foes hervibores diet is now more complex and you must cater to their demanding tastes with more precision this in turn adds an extra layer of complexity since now you need to chose the vegetation more wisely there are several gameplay modes to enjoy which serve as an introduction to the mechanics of the game but are a bit limited the main campaign in particular does not feel fleshed out and is missing a lot of things like marine animals it resembles a very basic tutorial that i still found wanting chaos and challenge modes will keep you entertained longer and also serve for unlocking skins for the dinosaurs these alternative game modes are varied and fun with a distinct personality each wanna save the original jurassic park from hubris induced catastrophe feel like a paleo green peace activist ready to rescue some dinos before they are wiped out by a volcanic eruption want to delve into the mysteries of site b and play god by recklessly manipulating dinosaur genome you can do all that jurassic world evolution 2 features now many locations around the world each with their own distinctive vibes personally i liked more the tropical setting of the previous game but it s ok to have snow deserts and evergreen forests for a change i believe warm climate goes better with giant lizards and i was quite surprised when they did not die of exposure after the first blizzard the grandeur in music is no longer here and i miss john williams sorely his triumphant orchestral tones are in my opinion an inseparable element of the franchise licensed jeeps and explorers are also substituted by lookalikes perhaps to abate costs if i ever mod this game the first thing i ll do is mod in the glorious jurassic park theme as it s meant to be these days not even the movies have it which is most unfortunate regarding dlc it adds several missing dinos from the first game but is not really essential unless you really like some of the creatures they feature the recent carcharodon megalodon would be a popular candidate but the base game already offers a lot of dinosaurs and reptiles to interact with i recommend the biosyn expansion for the content it adds including animals and buildings but also a new campaign the marine species pack is also very good the price might be fair for what you get even if many assets were recycled and reused from the first game the sounds the graphics the models everything is top notch there are many voice actors involved like jeff goldblum and bryce dallas howard and their work is superb familiar characters from jwe1 are back too for good or ill like the smooth dr sua and the annoying cabot they interact a lot and their conversations are quite fun especially those between claire and owen voice actors turn otherwise stale management sim gameplays into a cohesive narrative and add color to your experience overall it is a fantastic experience if you liked the first one go for it you won t regret it ferociously recommended
