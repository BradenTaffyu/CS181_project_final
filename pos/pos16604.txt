2017 early access review this game threw me back into my teens when i did get a old banger to fix up or it would be trashed and when i did spend countless hours trying to figure out how cars work also as someone who quit smoking years ago this game let s me re live the sweet sweet times when i was able to just take a 5 minute cigarette break every now and than when it comes to games this is as good as it gets i mean you can die from being electrocuted trough a phone line how good is that
