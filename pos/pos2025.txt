2021 i love this game because i love kotor i loved star wars before that but those 2 games are the reason star wars is more than just a couple movies that nerds love to me i have 1000 s of hours into this game plus 500 or so on my first acc may it rip love it a lot but it s not kotor3 if you like mmo s and star wars it works but if you don t like one of those it ll drag i got tired of tibia and runescape before wow existed so this game is purely story for me 7 10 needs more kotor
