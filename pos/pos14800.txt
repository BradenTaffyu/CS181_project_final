2021 early access review this game is wonderful from the satisfying explosions realistic lighting and weather to satisfyingly destructive fire and physics teardown is by far the most amazing game i have played in 2021 i may be a bit late to the party but teardown has the potential to hold up for the future if this ever gets ported to next gen hardware it would be magnificent everything in the game is so amazingly satisfying teardown i must say is the ultimate stress reliever there is something so magical about seeing semi realistic destruction with no real consequences don t even get me started on the infinite stream of modded weaponry maps and random features i didn t know i needed
