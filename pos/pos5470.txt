2015 early access review i ve often heard that when making a game with retro graphics one must allow the graphics to fit and even enhance the gameplay i ve actually played a few old school roguelikes before going to caves of qud and in all of them i felt that a graphical update would improve the gameplay but caves of qud is the first ascii roguelike i ve ever played where i felt that the graphics did not need an update the reason for this is that it shares a huge similarity with older roguelikes in that much of the equipment needs to be identified before you know what it is but there is a major difference in that when said equipment actually is identified it immediately becomes apparent that any graphical representation whatsoever would have made it obvious what said object really is to the player for example the carbine a very powerful mid game rifle before identification the description says a strange artifact but afterwards it says a composite carbine with a banana shaped magazine if anyone here can make a fallout game where the average joe could not understand what an assault rifle is without giving the player an unfair and or non immersive advantage in identifying it i would love to see it there s also the fact that the lack of linearity and graphical fidelity and yes i did just say graphical fidelity gives you more freedom and better immersion as well as lowering frustation very very few ascii roguelikes actually have blood splattering on the ground and on many occasions death can really just creep up on you for no reason in fact these graphics hold a special place in my heart for actually being very unnerving in one specific instance with numbers and letters there s also a major advantage in that if you run into an enemy that you can t fight you not only get a clear indication of that you also get options there are actually other places to grind for xp which can not be said of most other roguelikes and if a really dangerous enemy won t let up there are numerous escape options there is no telling how many times warden indrix has saved my characters life another major difference is how character building is based less on power gaming and more on building a character that suits you character building for true men is bog standard but the system really comes alive with mutants there are various mental mutations that give you a great sense of power and physical mutations that make your character more likely to end up on deviantart i wish i were kidding it takes only one mutation point to make your character a f ing furry given that i main as a character with heightened hearing night vision thick fur and has four arms four legs and two heads as well as being amphibious seeing him as some kind of froggy cattaur with double arms and heads would only be natural lastly identifying objects is based a lot more on skill and a lot less on luck on many of the older ascii roguelikes dying without knowing what half of your equipment does is just part of the experience and there are many occasions where you can find out that your unidentified equipment could have saved your life in however there is no equipment that is necessary for straightforward identification and no need for sneaksy little tricks for said identification that often left me with 2 dozen tabs open in firefox just to not be lost i can not stress the importance of the examine feature enough it separates this game from all of its peers even then it s not overpowered you can t examine equipment in merchants inventories and without the right skillset examine ing something stands a good chance of breaking it this can lead to some moments where you really have to gamble on getting something powerful or practically useless to you final verdict 10 10 would accidentally blow most of my fresh water reserves on a box of crayons again
