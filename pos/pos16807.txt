2021 2023 review edit i love all of the new dlc that has been added since i made my original review lots of beautiful houses colors and decor to play around with and i m glad they made it where you can change stairs at least in the newer homes the pet dlc is cute although for a while there the pets would get stuck on floors unable to go up and down the stairs before they added their ability to teleport up and down cats weren t able to use the wall cat furniture for a while but now they can the pets do still get stuck in places every now and then which spams the pet can t reach location error but it seems to happen less than before the only complaint that i have now is that the game is massive which causes a lot of lag freezing and crashes fully installed and actively played this game takes up more space than my mmorpgs and lengthy open world rp games and because of this i only install it when i m actively playing it it s weird that the space used goes down when i uninstall and reinstall the game even though nothing inside the game has changed i m not sure if it s holding onto every single auto save the game performs but that s the only thing i can think of i have the upcoming house flipper 2 game on my wish list and hope that it comes with improvements on compression to take up less space and have less lag and crashes i still recommend this game i only suggest that players maybe not hold onto as many houses as i do since i ve noticed the lag is a bit less when i have less owned houses i love to flip back and forth between houses and try different things with each so i always have a few of my favorite houses floor plans to do so i love this game it s relaxing to take a house that is in rough shape clean it up repair it and make it look amazing inside and out the garden package is great too as you can really spruce the place up and give it great appeal to buyers or keep it for yourself however there s a few complaints that i have first there are some walls that you just can t tear down no matter how much you d like to and it s not limited to the exterior walls which would be nice to build onto a house second you cannot change the appearance of the stairs in any house and the wood does not match floor options that you have this is made even uglier if the stairs have a runner carpet as those are always dated looking and clash with most all of the options you have especially if you prefer a modern look and third some houses have cars in their garages but not all of them and while you can move these cars around or sell them you can t buy a car to replace it or to put in any of the other garages of houses without cars i know that s just a minor annoyance and doesn t really affect the house restoration but it s just something that would be nice to have honestly it wouldn t bother me if there had been no houses with cars but when they dangle that out there and don t offer it as an option for other homes or alternative vehicles to park in all these empty garages it makes me sad
