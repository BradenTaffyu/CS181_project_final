2018 dark souls 3 is the game that got me in to the seriesive got it from a humble monthly after wanting to play the game for a long timei remember my frist experiance being trying to beat gundyr for the first time and man was he kicking my ass i remember when i have beaten him that i jumped out of my chair and screamed suck my you dumb take that now when i play the game i beat gundyr without taking any damage and thats the beauty of the dark souls for me overcoming the challanges and making them your bi ch and feling great when you do that dark souls 3 is the best in the series by my opinion i have played dark souls 1 and 2 too but i dont enjoy them as much as i enjoy dark souls 3 level design is best in dark souls 1 but where dark souls 3 shines the most is in combat its fast and the dodging feels reliable unlike dark souls 2 where there is input lag and im scared when i need to dodge because it sucks in dark souls 2 no longer you need to use a shield because of that and that makes for some great action so in conclusion combat is best in the series thank you dark souls 3
