2021 thanks to this game and ets2 i can no longer watch a film or video play a game or go outside without staring and identifying the models of trucks and their brands aside from that game is fun relaxing engaging and easy to run on most toasters the only criticism is less on the gameplay and more on the fact that the length you will enjoy this game comes down to how far you re willing to go buying up dlcs i recommend a sale just so you can get more bang for your buck but the base game with at least 1 or 2 state country dlcs to get a good idea of how the game works
