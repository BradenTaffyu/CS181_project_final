2019 don t listen to the negative reviews you can see from that the game currently has the most population it s ever had this is just people having trouble adjusting to change i m sure things will settle back down after a month or two both in terms of population and in terms of angry people with the new cv update aircraft carriers i finally enjoy playing cvs and alot of other folks do too even though it s alot of hard work relative to the most successful ships battleships unfortunately a portion of the playerbase has become insufferable one of the more toxic game reddits i ve seen because they don t like playing against cvs these are alot of players who don t want to adjust to a changing game because they were allowed to do alot of dumb stuff without being punished and now it s easier to punish them for making mistakes they shouldn t be making like running out solo far far away from their team and dying and then blaming it on cvs this is a team game and you should always have a couple team mates somewhere nearby you if you re trying to play a stealth assassin this is the wrong game for that this doesn t mean the whole team has to stick together either just 2 3 ship groupings pretend like it s a squad game and support each other by playing your role those who got used to being able to long wolf and torpedo people like they were an assassin in an mmorpg targeting a squishy they apparently still like the game enough to stick around yelling at everyone who will listen so the fact the game if i had to criticize anything it d be that the monetization is slightly skeezy in the way f2p games are while you can play competitively and not be at a disadvantage while being a free player at higher tiers the grind is real and store prices are as stupid as you d expect in a f2p game
