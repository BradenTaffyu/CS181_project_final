2015 early access review i ve lived entire lives in this game braved bitter winters sorted and labeled crates of canned food wondering how long it would last me tended crops and cursed the misfortune of plant disease fractured my leg and holed up in the corner of some dilapidated warehouse dying of thirst since i lacked the speed to get home safely i ve lived a thousand lives and felt the touch of death so many times now i m only surprised when it doesn t come swiftly what i ve learned is that death isn t failure no it s a sweet release make no mistake i ve survived for a long time built impregnable safehouses with self sustaining crops high above where any zombie could reach but that is simply a different kind of death death in the form of boredom but it is a death all the same it makes sense though doesn t it you are the last person on earth the world is filled with endless zombies there is no happy ending to all of this but the point isn t to survive the point is to create your own tale make a snapshot of experiences that are memorable this game is really just an analogy for life and death compressed into a few hours at a time and how you choose to spend your time reflects on your personality how will you keep death at bay will you build walls will you hide will you run as far away as you can or will you pick up an axe and try to fight it it doesn t matter death will find you in the end but it will be a hell of a journey
