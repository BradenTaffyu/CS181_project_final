disclaimer this review is only about the single player modes mycareer because i don t enjoy online gameplay very much i think that the added nextgen on pc is quite huge and improves the game in the small details that make it seem more realistic i enjoyed playing mynba eras with the steph era and the jordan one i like the fact that rules are chaning throughout the ears and makes the game very interactive and fun to play for me i would recommend this game if you want to play careers and offline staff i don t really know about the online things so i can t comment on them
