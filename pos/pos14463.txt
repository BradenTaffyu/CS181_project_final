2017 i love this game but would i buy it full price no i have been playing civ since the original back in the 90s and over the years its changed dramatically yet even inspite loving this game there are a few things i find really disapointing but first the stuff i love 1 two tech treesyea you read that correct instead of having the old standard tech tree there is a second one that covers your civic abilities these in hand effect how you govern or opens up more to how you can govern better to your preferred style for instance one of my favourite abilities from civ4 serfdom has reappeared and the way this ability works is pretty great 2 still fight barbariansin previous games when you reach a certain age or a unit reaches a certain experience i have found that those units no longer gain experience when fighting barbarians thats now changed you can still level a unit but unfortunatly its at a very slower rate than if your up against a civilization target yet still its good that when you come up against mauraders trying to pillage your sea tiles that you can be rewarded 3 districtsat first i wasn t sure if i liked the idea of districts or not but i think the more i play the more i like the idea behind districts is that your cities are not just on one tile but can spread out over several tiles this in my opinion can be a blessing or a curse it can be a blessing if you find the right spot to build a city and there are plenty of boosters for your districts like mountains or rainforests for science districts the curse comes more with the lack of space issue especially if you land in a location and raise a city only because you find valuable resources but the city could fail to see its potential due to a lack of district space the game forces you to make more wiser decisions those are the main likes here are my main dislikes 1 all roads lead to rome err no they don t the way you build roads has been redeveloped for some bizare reason and they no longer have the abilities of earlier civ games first of all your builders no longer create roads only traders and a new engineer unit can build roads if you task a trader to trade with another one of your cities it creates a road on its path if you use an engineer the unit only lasts for 2 active turns and then disappears they seem to be a waste of time imo roads no longer give you any advantage anymore they don t provide added tile wealth like in previous games and they don t really offer any movement advance for units e g 3 tiles instead of one in fact i have seen units avoid roads for some reason 2 oh and the same for buildersthats right with no modifications your builders only have three active turns meaning that you can only get them to develop three tiles so for example in previous games if you wanted to say redevelop a pasture hill with rainforest to build a mine it might take e g 10 turns to do everything from cut down the rainforest and then build the mine now it take 2 of your 3 goes one to cut down the trees one to build mine the only saving grace is that every action is instant cutting trees take one turn building a mine is one turn etc etc i am not entirely sure why the devs have done this and especially why they have changed the way roads are built and work my only conclusion is to reduce map congestion but that should be left to the player to decide i used to love having a transport ship filled with builders who follow and invasion in case i have used nukes or if i need to redevelop the infastructure can t really do that now 3 boot polish can make it shinewell i think in this case there is a distint lack of polish and especially when the game costs 50 70 depending on what version you get before any discount is alarming there are a lot of bugs in this game and things missing that i would expect from previous games from the get go one bug is when a civ tries to contact you but then does nothing the animation is still playing for the civ leader but no pop ups why does this happen well i have worked out that parts of the game work to quickly and when the game is catching up the game crashes this is not a pc speed issue as it would happen all the time otherwise another bug which i have experienced and it seems reading the reviews for the game so have others other leaders are easy to piss off for instance if you build a wonder or choose a different form of government other world leaders seem to go into a nerd rage also why do the devs still insist on not having transport ships and forcing one unit per tile its so redundant and slow also where are my paratroopers i love paras as they offer a great dynamic to combat 4 a lack of consequenceone of the things i loved about civ4 imo my favourite version i think was that every important game changing task you did had concequences for example you got caught spying big time it had consequences you have developed nukes it had concequences now nothing does i had caught a civ trying to steal cash and sabotage districts and in spite the fact they apologised they did it again several turn later i declared war which seemed the only way to stop them but i turned out to be the bad guy for doing this and ruined the end game because everyone hated me and called me a warmounger put this down to a bug or intentional either way it ruined my game 5 out pricing the futureyep as it seems with all games these days the polish comes in the form of overpriced dlcs at 25 i think i will wait for the sales before i purchase rise and fall it seems that i actually hate this game considering that i put more negatives but i don t i struggle to hate any civ game even when newer versions remove the stuff i really loved i just think that when you make a conscious decision to buy the game you do it knowing the negative points there is still enough love in this game to make it enjoyable but thats where you as the player come into it
