2021 it has been a while since i have been so thoroughly engrossed in a game this game is stealthily addictive thought i would just play it for an hour or two to learn the ropes and ended up putting down 3 or 4 hours in my first session without realizing it if you love to manage and micromanage this is the game for you this game is still getting regular updates so you can still look forward to getting more content in the future additionally there is workshop support with great mods on there including multiplayer overall this is definitely one to get if you want to try many times to build up a civilization but end up way short of that 99 of the time
