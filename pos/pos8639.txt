this very quickly became one of my favorite games while i can t hunt my runaway employees i can take my anger out on the surrounding wildlife ethically and unethically my pros it has a perk and skill system every level up to 37 you receive one perk or skill point from then on you receive one or the other every 3 levels until lvl 60 if you see anyone over 60 they are a cheater 3 you can play it solo or with friends or into uncharted multiplayer lobbies i like solo but nothing beats losing your mind flying off a cliff with an atv with your boyfriend on vurhonga good to burn stress or time with it can be grind y if thats what you like theres trophies you can collect and fabled animals whitetail deer meese etc you can find or grind for if you re insanely lucky the dlc maps are worth it i suggest australia silver ridge not biased at all weapon dlcs are very helpful depending on play style but are not necessary as base game weapons work wonders i don t suggest buying dlcs until sales but that s me d
