2021 i never go out of my way to write reviews on games but this one just hit me differently i cannot remember the last time a game made me want to 100 it over 100 hours in getting every achievement there is still content that i haven t even touched because the story characters gameplay world building art music are all 10 10 in my eyes i call this game a piece of art i could go on and on gushing about this game but doing that wont do this game justice just buy it and experience it yourself this is coming from someone who never heard of the game until watching the first 30 min of it on yt second day of its release falling in love with the art style i had 0 knowledge of the omocat team company this game s kickstarter or anything prior to its release i went in blind through my entire experience since it s release the devs have released 3 free updates addressing bugs glitches and even added additional items and features a fourth update is incoming which i wager will come in a week from the posting of this review it would be an understatement to say this is the next big indie game it handles itself and its subjects so damn well its really beyond just an indie game this is an experience one that will shake you make you laugh make you cry make you feel a spectrum of emotions no other game least for me has ever come close to achieving if i had to put this game on a top 10 from 2020 list this goes in my personal top 3 greatest video game experiences of all time its easily the number 1 2020 goty for me topping got hades and other games that would appear in other s goty lists thank you omocat team for making this work of art an experience that i will never forget one that i will cherish and compare future games to for a very long time
