2020 often i wonder if my grandpa is benevolent or a sinister addled fool who wishes to promise tales of glory in a vast farmland away from the corporate world being a newfound resident of the rural town of stardew valley is both a blessing and a travesty it is a location that can simultaneously polymorph my being into a raging malevolent beast or an altruistic rabbit depending on the wishes of vraccas god of the ancient dwarven kingdom the scenery is lovely the denizens of this town are kind albeit the work remains hard and the villagers often maintain clouded ambiguous histories this is coupled with the fact that due to living in this mythical town i have transformed into a manic farmer with an erratic personality after the immense inheritance my grandfather left alongside the sprinklers installed to automatically water my crops i have been left with a large quantity of time coupled with a lust for excitement likely perpetuated by the star god s as such due to this inescapable lust i have been exhibiting increasingly peculiar mannerisms for example i typically initiate my morning by galloping atop my horse attempting to cause a stampede intending to inflict severe physical harm to the villagers i then frequently attempt to court any available woman in sight frequently showering them with tributes while attempting to entrap them within a handmade enclosure to ensure that they will never leave my side this is followed by light bouts of anarchy as i attempt to inflict acts of terror upon demetrius with homemade cherry bombs produced out of an assortment of scavenged sprinkler parts fortunately for myself the village doesn t appear to have any tangible form of law enforcement certifying that my actions will be without severe repercussions after my reign of terror i visit the local tavern mingling with the locals and attempting to locate a wife to produce future offspring in an attempt to populate the village after drinking copiously i ride home inebriated determined to scrawl through old dwarven texts in an attempt to learn the dwarven language and converse with a hermit who lives in the local mountain caves despite the fulfilling work stardew valley has transformed me into a sexual deviant as previously described my life as a farmer has transformed from a corporate worker into a genuine human being filled with complexity and autonomy unlike no other however despise my thrilling life the village has not come without it s downsides for i am now a sexual deviant in this valley i act as a rabid hound attempting to court every attractive female in sight employing every seductive trick i learnt from fifty shades of grey and how to train your dragon to acquire a mate i recall that just as my efforts at seduction were beginning to come into fruition it all came to a crashing end i was at the sun dance festival it was calm and serene being filled to the brim with potential mates i professed my love to leah inquiring if she wished to accompany me to the dance however to my dismay she bluntly rejected my proposal the dismay accumulated with every passing rejection with the tipping point being with hayley who appeared repulsed as she contemplated the thought seeking dancing alternatives i sought to ask the paraplegic george however the old coot wouldn t even entertain the thought of dancing instead wishing to lay on his haunches after being rejected by the paraplegic i attempted to offer my proposal to the children however to my profound disappointment it was met with a blank stare i couldn t even romance the children this is utterly abhorrent seeking no other alternatives i was forced to participate in the summer dance with the alcoholic shane who i had previously secured a friendship with by feeding him large quantities of light brews ever since the events that transpired at the sun dance festival i have continued my pursuit of securing a mate with increased zeal i frequently loiter outside the female denizens houses at night leaving them anonymous love letters at the front door while showering them in gifts and providing to them a basket of infinite praise it is to my great disappointment that i continue to remain unwed bear my words however that in the romantic department i will succeed in seducing subduing and breaching the interior of one of the females of stardew valley i will inevitably populate this sacred valley with my offspring taking up residence in stardew valley has caused my being to despise corporatism for corporatism produces a danger to stardew valley threatening to destroy the placidity and serenity of the town the mayor of the town is a corrupt miscreant seeking only to expand his influence and control over the town this is evident by allowing a corporate body to envelope and take up residence within the town this corporate body seeks to economically rupture the town itself and desecrate the serenity that has survived from millennia until now in this lush land furthermore due to extensive analysis it appears that the mayor has been soliciting sexual favours from maru using his vast influence to engage in premarital intercourse this is evident by the mayors lucky shorts that were brazenly abandoned in maru s room symbolising the mayor s hasty escape after premarital intercourse with the young damsel witnessing this act of corruption has caused the very veins in my neck to protrude in an act of defiance i have concocted a task to temporarily abduct the mayor s secret love and store her in the cellars denying the fiend access to his estranged lover for his insolence while the mayor on the exterior certainly appears as a respectable man he possesses an ambiguous morality lastly i wish to state the significance of inheritance detailing that without my grandfathers generous act i would never have been involved within these plots of intrigue and wonder furthermore i wish to state that it appears stardew valley is in turmoil warring with the southern tribes due to a conflict that has prevailed over generations there also appears to be a homeless individual who i take personal pleasure in barging into his tent and filling him up with coconuts and copious amounts of alcohol afterwards i assert my dominance by strongly requesting that he praise rivellion as a self professed health inspector it is additionally my obligation to note that the town appears to exhibit various health violations such as the mine shaft being broken and the hordes of hostile goblins residing in the mountains it is also in the towns best interest to bring to light the peculiar sexual ambiguity with my horse that some members of the townsfolk predominantly gus and sebastion have alas after further analysis i have understood that they merely commit peculiar acts of affection towards a stuffed horse yet despite this fact it remains disconcerting lastly i would like to implore leah to cease resisting my altruistic attempts at proposal and to instead give in and agree to attend an auspicious wedding with her as my illustrous and jubilant bride
