word of advice pick a lane and stick to it don t try to mix dogmatic iconoclast heretic there are not enough points available in the game and you can kinda get shafted by this in the ending if you haven t reached rank 3 of a specific alignment fun little crpg that gets a bit rushed towards the end but the first 3 acts are really super and are a great introduction to the 40k verse
