2020 very fun game i ve played total war since the rome days and three kingdoms has the best campaign yet there s many unique factions each with their own different strengths and weaknesses you will actually be invested to care about your generals each play through in the campaign map will be different which will really increase the replayability allowing you to have even more unique single player campaigns
