2019 looking for a relaxing management tycoon game here you go the difficulty curve is pretty shallow it really only gets hard if you want to push for high scores you only need 1 star per hospital to progress all the way through the game and are never required to compete against other players it s optional it does get a little difficult if you want to get 3 stars on every hospital or challenge yourself by out doing your friends on leader boards for hospital value or cure rates etc this reminds me a lot of old school relaxing management sims from decades ago what you see in the trailers is a pretty accurate summary of what you can expect while playing my only complaints are you don t really have any control over the outside shape of the buildings but you do have full custom control over everything inside even to the point of being able to change it instantly on the fly with no penalty which goes a long way towards why this game is so easy you can revamp everything constantly as needed without issue and secondly the speed controls should have an even faster option even playing in fast can take a long time to treat patients and wait for an income so while there s a lot of fun in designing your hospital layouts and some depth to the managing of staff it s actually kind of shallow in difficulty and once you get past the learning curve there s a lot of just waiting for income as you can t speed the game up by very much overall if you like this style of game it s probably worth getting but i don t think it s worth full price and the dlc are cute but also really expensive for what they contain imo the base game is worth at least 20 while the dlc are worth maybe 4 each i paid about 30 for the entire bundle of the game plus the 3 main dlc pebberley bigfoot close encounters not including the retro items pack which is just cosmetic and i m not disappointed but i d have been a little put off if i d paid full price for everything full price for game plus all dlc while i write this would be almost 70 this is not a 70 game but it s definitely a really good 30 one while you are here would you consider following my curator page want to read all of my reviews and not just the curated ones
