2019 nothing hurt worse than fighting sister friede for the first time taking a while to learn all of her tells beating her then watching her rise back up with a pissed off father ariandel panicking because of the erratic attacks getting ptsd from o s finally learning that the 2nd phase isn t so bad getting the slab and glad that the fight is over only to realize that friede doesn t know how to stay dead and comes at you even worse than before taking 10 embers just to get enough health to survive the fight and then finally beating her after 20 something attempts best game 15 10 would rip my hair out all over different ng cycles again edit okay slave knight guts is freaking insane it s basically the content creators asking miyazaki what he wanted in a final boss battle and he said yes
