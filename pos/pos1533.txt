2016 early access review i made the previous review 5 years ago after years of waiting to the new animations to play with my friends they added animations to remove multiplayer when i made the first review i was living in a small appartement with my gf 2 jobs later i have a kid bought a house and got married i am sure by the time my kid goes to college there will be npcs on the good news we did get an updated ui for the microwave long demand of the community buy this if you are still in the prime of your life with a long life expectancy original review from 2016 saying this game is early access makes many released games fall into shame this is simply put the best early access game out there a lot of other developers would have already called it a day but we still get regular updates with new features some bullet points why the game is awesome great atmosphere play this in your house alone at night and you will jump from your chair a really challeging game without being unfair you learn after every perma death multiplayer which makes the game even better if you play it with friends great communication from the devs every monday we get a zomboid an update on the game and pending features i am not even a zombie lover but i played this game already for 250 hours the only 2 games above this in my steam list is civ5 just buy it you will love it
