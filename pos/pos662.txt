2018 honestly i m not a farming game typa guy if you look at my library this game stands out like a sore thumb but i got it to play with my girl who loves these types of games and let me tell you this game is surprisingly fun to play the game is very well made and it s likely going to be the only game of it s genre that doesn t melt my mind with boredom hell it might be the only game of it s kind that i ll play period why well i don t really know i know i enjoy the game i know me and my girl can lose entire days to this game but i can t point to a specific reason as to why which is why i said it s very well made all of the different parts may seem meh on their own but the way with which they are brought together is what makes it such a lovely experience the combat is simplistic the watering controls are confusing and after the first year or two you ve done most of the basics and practically finished the game but i still find myself excited to play this game its relaxing monotanous in its chores and it gives a certain sense of accomplishment seeing your crops sell for a mil after you ve stockpiled for an entire season all in all i give this game an 8 10 the watering issues are absolutely infuriating at times but honestly that s the biggest complaint i ve got
