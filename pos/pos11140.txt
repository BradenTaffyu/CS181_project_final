2019 it s a highly addictive game that is very worth buying and playing the dlc adds more fun to the game and there s also been several free updates with new gameplay tweaks and additions that have made an already excellent at launch game more fleshed out since launch tips for new players build a lot of gp offices a lot and train up your gps like heck so you have a small army of maxed out gp docs also be sure to set your hospital policy to streamline treatment and set treatment threshold at about 85 90 if you have well trained treatment staff and fully upgraded hospital equipment you ll rarely botch treatment and the threshold will clear people out of the queue line and send them for treatment also when you re having trouble covering expenses but have fantastic hospital reputation it s generally best to start raising your prices hospital wide high quality care means high prices to the point that you can eventually max out your hospital s prices in the endgame when working torwards 3 stars if i had known to do this early on it would have save me so much wasted time in death spirals trying to avoid the 300k game over reloads and instead making steadily profitable hospitals
