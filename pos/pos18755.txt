2021 tldr fallout new vegas is the best fallout game to play because it possesses the rpg experience that fallout 3 and fallout 4 lack but its flaws lie in its rather dated graphics and lackluster gunplay the characters are amazingly written and have a lot to say your actions always feel meaningful as you make choices that benefit some groups but hurt others ultimately you define the character you want to be and you can play that way previously fnv had some performance issues but lately there have been major breakthrough mod releases that have mitigated and or eliminated most if not all of these difficulties i would highly recommend that anyone wanting to play fnv in 2021 and beyond should check out viva new vegas vivanewvegas github io a recently released modding guide that helps you install essential mods and utilities for you to have the best vanilla experience of the game with minimal crashes script lags and fps drops genre open world sandbox post apocalyptic rpg featuring melee and gun combatgameplay you start off creating a character and assigning s p e c i a l skill and perk points based on the kind of build you want to play as whether it be a good guy laser weapons focused medic or maybe an evil high strength melee guy who also focuses heavily on explosives as you explore the mojave desert you travel between small enclaves sprawling towns abandoned mines filled with mutated creatures and military camps along the way you encounter many different oftentimes wacky characters that usually give you quests to complete for money rewards and political favor among a unique location or a unique tribal faction the core gameplay loop lies in exploring the world killing adversaries based on your loyalty towards certain factions looting dead bodies locations upgrading your character as you level selling loot to purchase gear upgrades and completing unique quests along the way graphics in today s standards the game can look pretty rough but it isn t terrible the character models look decent and animate a little awkwardly while the open world is often littered with a lot of tiny cluttered textures although it gets a pass from me since it s pretty believable that a post apocalyptic world isn t squeaky clean of dirt and grime the lighting is okay but some indoor areas are pretty dark so be sure to use your pipboy light often story you are a courier for the mojave express and get ambushed during a delivery where a mysterious person in a suit takes your packaged item and then proceeds to shoot you in the head eventually you wake up and discover that you have been rescued and nursed back to full health from there the main story has you follow up on your mystery assassin in order to figure out what he stole from you and why he wants it simultaneously there is a larger plot unfolding as political tension is rising in the major factions residing in the mojave wasteland there is an escalating conflict about land dispute as the ncr are expanding eastwards into nevada attempting to establish order and law to the lawless desert while the legion are expanding westwards trying to take over territory while committing acts of mass murder and enslaving any survivors they encounter there are a multitude of other factions that are interconnected in this political war such as the great khans a tribe of warriors that has repeatedly been weakened and pushed out of their homes by the ncr and the brotherhood of steel a group of people obsessed with controlling technology that are in hiding due to a previously fight with the ncr where they were outnumbered and also pushed out of their residence perhaps most important of all is the faction of mr house who is rumored to be in control of the new vegas strip which is home to a wealthy and profitable gambling scene but nobody has ever seen him and he is somehow in control of a large army of robots that do his bidding although the story begins with you having a multitude of questions as you continue to play you understand how all of these factions interact why they like or dislike each other and what kind of middle grounds they are willing to meet on if any in order to solve this dilemma strengths the writing for the characters in this game is brilliant many named npc s actually have background stories that you can ask them about with multiple dialogue options to choose from and once you exhaust them all you get a much better idea of their relationships and attitudes towards others and more notably the factions of the mojave particularly the companion veronica has like 50 lines of dialogue about who she is what her goal is her relationship to her faction family how she feels about her enemy factions and how she even feels about you you have the choice to do pretty much everything and the game will account for it accordingly if you meet up with an npc that is part of a quest chain that you are following but you decide to kill him her there is more often than not an alternate way to proceed in the quest or the game will account for that death in a later questline and see that you killed the npc and proceed with the quest under that circumstance perhaps most importantly you have the complete freedom to play as a villain in a fallout game if you want to you can be a complete knob to everybody kill everyone you dislike and align yourself with villainous factions to aid them in their political agenda your relationship will deteriorate with anyone that dislikes your actions but you have that choice to pursue if you so desire the radio stations have great music tracks most of the time the tunes immerse you in the feeling that you are actually a nomadic wanderer travelling the desert with a gun at your side unless johnny guitar is being played there is a large number of weaponry to play with ranging from melee weapons standard firearms explosives and tech weapons that use laser and plasma technology the map is pretty big and filled with many locations to visit some of them being unmarked and up to you to discover off the beaten path exploration is to your benefit weaknesses the gunplay can be janky compared to the gunplay of modern shooters sometimes you might have your crosshairs perfectly aligned for a shot but the game feels like it doesn t agree and your shot proceeds to miss entirely some weapons namely the bigger ones like a missle laucher don t really have a proper aim iron sighted assist to make your shots line up more accurately like many early bethesda titles the game suffers from a small voice cast you will probably hear many npc s recycle the same voice actor throughout the game the voices are great albeit a little too frequently used among the different npc s so to speak i swear to you yuri lowenthal voices all but a single man in the brotherhood of steel bunker if you have a fear of insects moreso if you are afraid of large insects some sections of the game will likely give you either a moment of terror or at worst nightmares humongous irradiated insects roam the wasteland often in packs and are littered all over in hives making themselves feel at home in dark caves underground most of them are optional but just be wary of surprises at any time numeric score if you care 8 10 checkbox reviews are lazy copy paste bullsh t ascii art reviews tell you nothing let s be honest i only wrote this review for awards is a waste of everyone s time if you are interested in genuine detailed game reviews feel free to check out my others here or don t i don t tell you what to do
