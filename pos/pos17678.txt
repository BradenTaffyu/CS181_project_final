2017 this game is a dream come true for me the warhammer universe is massive and its just fits right in the total war formula luckly ca did manage to capture the feel and the brutality that the franchise is know for the city building management diplomacy aspect of the game is sadly streamlined even a bit more after rome 2 attila but since almost all the factions play differently in the campaign map i didn t find it as a negative thing however the meat of the game is the combat its fast brutal and looks f cking amazing the asymmetrical factions keep the combat fresh and almost always engaging interesting since its not historical title ca had the chance to make things a little bit more interesting and im pleased with the new mechanics that get in the game the magic is flashy and really fun to use the bit of an rpg lord heroes management is also a nice addition some of the faction mechanics is really nice and others well not so much looking at you dwarfs workshop and the modding community is also here and they are stronger than ever a big shootout to you beautiful b stards who makes this game even more fun and enjoyable the only two things i have a problem with it is ca dlc policy and that sometimes the game can be incredibly unbalanced frustrating and its still have some balancing issues in the battles which is fine in singleplayer but in multiplayer thats another story and i don t even play the multiplayer aspect of the game overall the game is too much fun to pass if you even a little bit a warhammer fan go get it now for the others i would say wait for a sale recommended
