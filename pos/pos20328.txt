if there s any justice this game will take over the world wonderful deckbuilder and one of the best designed games of any genre i ve played in years only complaint 15 hours in is that i keep running my steam deck out of batteries because i can t put it down incidentally it runs awesome on the sd too almost never bother to write reviews but this one is too good not to recommend a real gem
