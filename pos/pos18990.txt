2018 by far one of the greatest rpgs ever made pros made by members of the original fallout teamallows for a level of roleplay that is simply not possible in any other fallout game a variety of intruiging factions all competing across the mojave choices that actually matter and have lasting effects throughout the playthrough as opposed to a simple morality choice like in fallout 3 improves the shooting from fallout 3 by adding iron sights naturally builds on the lore established by fallout 1 and 2 instead of retconning and twisting it like the bethesda fallouts great build potential where almost anything can be viableyou can kill literally every character in the game and you can still beat it nobody is set essential cons unfortunately quite buggyconsole limitations forced the developers to limit the scope of some areascaesar s legion is not as fleshed out as it was originally going to bevisually not good for a 2010 gamemost of these can be fixed with modstruly a fantastic game i recommend to any fan of video games will never get a sequel thanks to bethesda s continued dumbing down of the series
