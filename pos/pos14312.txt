2022 early access review i didn t think it was possible to top factorio but this game has replaced it for me it is already a full game experience even with the dreaded early access label if you turned off bitters in factorio a long time ago because all you wanted to do was build a massive factory then dyson sphere is everything you wanted at default settings for those that need goals to guide purpose there is a fairly extensive tech tree that requires interconnected production chains to make ever more complex components while you balance power and raw materials those components are used for new structures as well as more advanced progression components called matrices you decide how to best spend your matrices to either advance the tech tree or upgrade your characters abilities speed power availability etc for those that like to continuously reinvent and improve previous automation designs this game provides the dyson sphere it is an end game mega structure that you also design yourself the resource requirements to build will most likely require you to extract resources from multiple star systems the best part is that the game does not just end once you build the big thing the dyson sphere itself becomes a resource for continued character upgrades as well as a source of power for the ever growing demand of your galactic factory you can then decide if you want to produce multiple dyson spheres in multiple star systems the game is at your own pace and very easy to pick up controls are simple and the interface is clean and easy to use there is no combat and i hope there never will be i can t recommend this game enough if you like resources gathering for crafting chains with self designed automation and simple logistics then dyson sphere is a must play
