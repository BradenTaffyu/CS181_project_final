2022 omori took me around 30 hours to play many tears searching reddit for information because of being invested in the game s lore however i have no regrets i m glad my attention was brought to omori and playing it was definitely worth it and here s why the game has an amazing portrayal of mental health and its issues including how emotions have an impact on people that was definitely a difficult topic to make a video game about but the result turned out to be excellent characters had their own personalities who were all moved by one huge event in all of their lives that changed them forever they all had their own way of dealing with those difficult times some healthier other not really and it was all portrayed in omori the lore itself begins slowly planting curiosity in player s heart when we finally realize what has been happening with characters it makes us think about both the game and our lives as everything in the game can be relatable on a close level doesn t matter if it s about the mental issues of characters or just their daily ordinary struggles when it comes to graphics it gives you an effect of a friendly and relaxing game which is why is lore hits you even harder when you realize it music in omori is amazing and perfectly matched to every situation which is also what made the game even better fighting system was something i personally enjoyed a lot to win a battle defeat a boss or just a regular monster you had to focus and pay attention and most importantly actually use all the knowledge you ve already had in the end omori is one of the greatest game i ve ever played i m willing to continue my adventure with it as there are many secrets and routes i haven t discovered yet playing it will always be worth it for me personally wish you all the best
