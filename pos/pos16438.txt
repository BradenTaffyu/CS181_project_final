2017 early access review this game is incredible five days ago i knew next to nothing about cars besides the very basics of how an engine works now with the help of some basic guides i m sitting here trying to perfectly tune my engine playing with the rocker shaft and carburator i ve had many mishaps along the way though death 1 good old standard crashdeath 2 fell down sewage well drowned in someone elses faeces not even my own death 3 got van stuck in a ditch died of dehydration trying to walk home death 4 another crash death 5 stopped by police took breath test nothing happened so i tried to drive away and their sirens went off got out and noticed a cop holding a ticket for me to pick up as i approached him i turned just in time to spot a minivan hitting me at about 80km h the game can be unforgiving but that s part of the charm and if you need a break from the core gameplay drive to the store buy a crate of beer stick 500 marks in the slot machine and take a drink everytime you win considering it s a small indie game it has one of the best in game representations of being drunk i have ever encountered you will be even more wary of drink driving after experiencing it in this game so that has to be a plus on a side note even although i know there s nothing intentionally scary in the game s a fantastic setting for a horror mod that i m sure someone somewhere must already be working on
