2020 arma 3 was released 7 years ago on 2013 and it is still such a popular game this title tries to be a military simulation game and realistic but with many flaws pros huge maps entire islands decent campaign story with multiple endings good looking graphics steam workshop support community servers solid playerbase 10 20 thousand players daily lots of weapons many vehicles tanks really good soundtrack scenarios scenario editor custom made missions cons awful performance even with a decent rig many weapons items vehicles are locked behind paid dlcs clunky controls very dumb a i clunky interaction ui weird physics leading your own ai squad is very exhausting and bad many missions can be bugged or just simply really bad for example preventive diplomacy the huge maps are mostly empty some parts of the game looks outdated7 10 it s a pretty okay game people love this game and i guess because of its realistic approach and co op modes or any other community made stuff the campaign is only decent the community stuff is really good but the very poor optimization can be in the way for many people including me and i have a pretty decent rig
