2019 in light of the recent negative reviews which are predominantly about ca s business practices here s a review on 3k as a game total war three kingdoms revolves around the three kingdoms period in chinese history as someone who had no knowledge and interest in this period i wasn t sure what to expect it has however definitely surpassed my expectations gameplay diplomacy diplomacy is better than it ever has been you can trade territories and have more meaningful ways of increasing or decreasing relations other than trade agreement or offer to join war there are actual diplomatic repercussions to post battle choices as well which means you have more options to weigh other than increased replenishment or money the potential for the recruitment of other characters also creates a trade off that has never existed in a previous title execute a powerful character or let them live but risk their continued presence on the battlefield for the first time in a tw game allies and vassals actually feel as though they have a function allies can be depended on and unlike the engame collapse of shogun or wh s vortex allies and vassals will absolutely help you also now have a reason to create vassals as well as helping to build up their strength previous titles meant vassals were just used for trade and buffer zones now vassals can help secure important objectives and reduce the new corruption mechanic spies also confer interesting and potentially powerful bonuses in my 4 campaigns i personally never found a way of getting my spies to achieve their end goal ie becoming the heir leader of a faction having said that their bonuses which include boost to trade and speeding up character defection still made their investment interesting and worthwhile diversity faction diversity is an aspect which has been heavily criticised yes the game is no wh even compared against attila factional unique units don t distinguish themselves enough for me this wasn t a problem for players who want the diversity of rome 2 or wh this may be disappointing the game also suffers to an extent due to build staleness there is no reason not to take 2 trebuchets which when upgraded with flaming rounds will rack over 300 kills a battle making ranged diversity moot endgame the endgame is the best it s been previous titles basically had paint the map as objectives vortex on wh2 is essentially a waiting game as you wait for rituals to finish and set up ambushes around key settlements now you are able to plan ahead and strategically take out key opponents to set up your endgame enemies as weaker and geographically closer factions presentation and design the artstyle and music as expected from a ca tw game is stellar the ui which at first seemed cluttered and confusing grows on you and in some respects feels simpler and clearer than wh the artstyle rivals that of shogun 2 and the voice acting is much better than expected there s little more to say in this respect other than that ca s art design team has knocked it out of the park again buy or not to buy in my opinion this is the best tw has been yet yes the game does not have the endless replayability that wh2 s myriad of factions provide that said the campaign feels more complete and strategic than any tw i ve played to date and it feels like the first tw where strategic decisions beyond the battlefield matter if this new layer of strategy appeals to you this is definitely a worthwhile buy at full price if unit diversity is critical this game will disappoint and waiting for the wh pack will be the better option
