2018 early access review lemmy 101 the co founder of the indie stone and a developer of project zomboid once responded on the forums to a post about npcs at no point anywhere in any of the store page do we suggest that there are npcs present in the game while we apologize that development of them has been delayed long further than we expected and understand the frustration of those waiting for it you can t hold us to task for a feature you assumed to be in the game that is not when we not only never once claim is in the game in fact explicitly state is not on our store page the whole point of the store page and early access blurb is for us to inform potential customers to the features and state of development of the game it s hard to know what further we could have done to prevent getting this complaint post beyond development of the game having gone differently and the focuses and requirements of the game s development to have been different and unlike all the early purchasers who bought the game with the understanding of npcs down the road you had nothing to stop you waiting or voting with your wallet except your own lack of investigation into the game s state of development if it s useful for you to blow off steam and get your frustrations at not investigating what was in the game before purchasing out of your system then fair enough but otherwise this post has no other useful purpose and there is nothing we can do beyond recommend you put the game aside and return to it once the features you want are present or request a refund if you are still within the window if we d have focused on npcs at the expense of the other areas of the game there is a very good chance that the game would have died and ceased development by now we ve taken the path we ve needed to to ensure the game reaches completion and features are added in an order that doesn t cause severe development issues down the road that s the fact of the situation and one we make great pains to express clearly on our store page if you think that the estimated sales numbers you quoted are either an accurate representation of the revenue we ve earnt or enough to mean we can just throw as much money and bodies at the development as we d like then unfortunately you ve underestimated how expensive running a business and a development team over years can be the dark side of early access or alpha funding as it was when we started is you have to lay out the big picture of development get people excited about planned features and so on long before you have the knowledge of what obstacles you will face what the pressures of development will drive your focus on what skillset you will have in the team down the road or what other priorities will emerge to keep the game afloat and keep people purchasing to continue to fund it all of these factor have a huge impact on development and it s just a sucky thing about early access that it forces developers to make promises they can t possibly have all the information without hindsight the developers 5 years ago who made the promises they did were much greener and much naiver to the challenges they would face and would have been wiser never to mention npcs in the first place the irony being since most of our negative reviews are about features like npcs not being present yet if we never promised them in the first place our review scores would be higher not lower and we d have probably at this point stuck a 1 0 sticker on the game and would ironically be used as an example of developers who did it right and finished their game in a reasonable time when you were complaining to someone other developer about their early access game despite the game s content being identical to how it is now the developers you are chastising now are not those same people and can only do what they can do to try and finish development of them yet still where many other developers would think we ve worked on this enough and stick a 1 0 sticker on it all these years later we re still working toward that goal and sticking to our principles of delivering the missing features yet that same dedication despite the fact many of us might enjoy working on something new is then turned into something to attack us with our game is not one of the longest early access developments on steam because we re the slowest tho i won t deny we re slower than a fair few it s one of the longest early access developments on steam because we re principled in finishing what we promised many others have delivered far less in far less time then hung up their spurs and moved onto pastures new and then later down the line when the planned features they never got to or abandoned are forgotten they are used as examples of developers that did a better job than us and to be honest i m tired of us having to apologise for not doing the same for a developer to show such honesty passion humility strength and integrity all in one is rare these days to have them actively respond on the forums so directly and frequently even rarer source page 3 everytime they release a community newsletter on progress some gamers find it appropriate to write npcs in the comments without even bothering to investigate the matter how is it that games like subnautica ark the long dark sandbox astroneer and more indie survival games can get away with no humanoid npc s but it s a total crime that project zomboid doesn t have npc s you guys remember starforge and grav those ring a bell yes those are games that didn t quite survive the survival genre it s because they ran out of juice before they could finish they over extended themselves people seem to really want the indie stone to die if people really expect pz to drop everything and haphazardly dive into adding npcs as if project zomboid was suddenly called project npc s and 100 of the player base wanted to play a npc simulator and that this game needs to commit seppuku for failing it s one purpose in life there is soooo much more to pz so much in fact that the lack of npc s isn t noticeable for people who enjoy surviving as a lone survivor e g subnautica or the long dark or ark singleplayer i think the devs are spot on putting priority on vehicles which at the time of this review are already amazing build 38 where vehicles are still in test test phase instead of pouring all their time into npc s i for one find the lack of people in a zombie apocalypse a lot easier to accept than the lack of cars especially if the lore dictates that you are lucky for being immune to the aerial transmission of the zombie virus these responsible and hard working devs who can communicate with such sincerity are the devs i want developing my game i can play assured that these devs won t mess up by over extending themselves and will soldier on despite the faeces people throw at them
