2017 yup this is a good onecompared to tww1 there has been some nice streamlining for example you dont have to deploy heroes anymore their passive effect works even when embedded so always embed them similarly city management isn t as much of a pain anymore the best setup is easily seen and you have a bit more liberty with what you build i would recommend waiting a bit until the tww1 combined campaign is in there also the blood dlc free if you have it for part 1 is out these things come in the next weeks game world feels much more alive and less laggy than in tww1 content is certainly more than in launch of the prequel already but if 4 playable races aren t enough for you wait for a goty edit after 400 hours yep this is still amazing regular balance and performance patches and amazing mods if you are ever bored with regular campaigns sfo grimhammer first and foremost
