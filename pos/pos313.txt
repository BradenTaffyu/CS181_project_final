2016 i have quite literally waited for this game to be released for many years now since giving the game greenlight and so far i ve played around 200 hours of it still having fun too this review will consist of bullet points and explanation when needed the goodies active developer i e the game is constantly updated fixed and upgraded crossover between harvest moon and terraria starbound minecraft yes point 1 above implies there is combat swords killings murder spree great original soundtrack costumise your farm layout we re talking about barns coops stable and not just crop plot location unlike harvest moon you can choose where you build the mentioned buildings so your farm is more personalised not to mention the different flooring and wallpaper you can choose for your house unconventional livestock a fan of mallard ducks yes the meme cute bunnies truffle finding pigs sure the game has it all and no no bacon sorry peeps crafting system a d i y mechanism that positively encourages you to be creative and not lazy need those precious bee house scarecrow keg furnace go and build them yourself let your livestock graze outside and feed on fresh luscious grasses it will make your farm look nicer and it s a win win situation happy animals and happy you since you don t have to have to feed them hay personalised play style there are skills in the game i e farming mining foraging fishing and combat that you can level up so you can focus on particular skill s if you are interested in it them plus it gives you secret perks when you reach certain levels the baddies main character s movement and animation sometimes feel clunky very minimum quest direction which can make it harder for players to notice that they have to go do have a certain thing to trigger the quest event reaction the uglies like similar themed game stardew can be tedious especially in the beginning repetitive and even frustrating at times but it does not take away the fun the assumed knowledge game is strong with this one a large proportion of behaviours in the game follow harvest moon system for instance seasonal crops wilting when the season ends talking to people animals increase the affection meter and the only save point being when your character goes to sleep this is not a negative feature but it does make it a tad more difficult for new players to pick these things up worry not though you ll still have fun and you can always look up information anyway this is just an odd thing to see but none of the building has an increased exterior size when you upgrade them when it obviously gets more spacious inside harry potter sorcery
