product received for free the most mixed bag of a game i ve ever played i love a lot of things in it and i hate a lot of things in it i d say it has some of the best mechanics in fallout with the real time vats being my favorite version of it and one that i actually use unlike the time stop or god forbid the time slow one that was in fo4 melee feels much better than the earlier games too the skill system is alright while i prefer the classic style from fallout 1 to new vegas with the funny little cards you can upgrade and equip according to your special stats building a camp is much more fun and useful than in fallout 4 as well with you being actually able to set it almost anywhere and sell off your stuff to other players and of course being able to check out other player s camps and stores which is something i do a lot myself however building itself was not polished much between fallout 4 and 76 the snap on still being pathetic as all hell and while i understand why this time around with other players having to be considered too the building limits are pretty lame i personally always want to put my favorite guns on displays in fo4 and this but i can only build just a few displays for guns the legendary enemy and loot system is incredibly much better the loot being still gained from occasionally spawning legendary enemies but this time they re just simply beefed up enemies instead of a stupid moron who regens all their health halfway through which i hated in fallout 4 they can be tiered one two or three stars and will drop loot accordingly which will have one two or three legendary modifiers of appropriate tiers and while most of them are garbage this time you can recycle them by selling them off for legendary scrip which you can use at a particular little moleman to buy either new legendaries as a type of reroll or you can buy legendary modules which can be combined with legendary cores gotten from events to turn your favorite gun into a whole new legendary by itself this is a mechanic i ve always wished existed in fallout turning your simple favorite gun you ve grown attached to into a legendary or unique as they used to be called however don t expect it to become amazing there are still lots of garbage modifiers it can get but you can keep rerolling them as many times as long as you got cores and modules if you wish and my favorite part of the whole game there are so many amazing new cryptidsin real life the appalachian region has a ton of folklore and cryptids in the mountains and woods i originally started playing the game just to hunt cryptids mothman flatwoods monster wendigo which is popular these days shoutout to wendigoon to lesser known ones like grafton monster blue devil snallygaster i love cryptids and i love seeing them all being depicted in pretty faithful manners too as absolutely awesome as the cervid skull wendigo is the fallout 76 depiction is more faithful to the original algonquin depiction and i can respect thatwhile there s more good i could talk about i ll switch over to the bad parts which should definitely be considered because they re absolute the scrap limit your camp has is very definitely designed just to make you buy a fallout 1st subscription it s scummy and they must know it s scummy because it s a very deliberate design choice it s total garbage and discourages switching buildsthe balance is all over the place frankly with some builds working almost always if you just got the right perks like most heavy weapons and two handed melee but some things you ll really have to get into the minmaxing stuff and rolling good legendaries to get to work properly like basic rifles unarmed or explosives i was really disappointed with unarmed especially since i love punching stuff in games if at all possible but here it almost feels like a challenge build like it s so bad that you d have to prove it works with some tricks or with good luck maybe i m just bad at making a build but there is only one perk to increase unarmed weapon damage while other weapon classes have up to three maybe more with cross effectiveness but then while for example missile launcher works off both heavy weapons and explosives it s still very weak and the ammo isn t very common and also weighs a ton feels like you re encouraged into specializing in it but then you don t have enough ammo to specialize in it the balance is very all over the placein a typical bethesda fashion it s also very buggy just before writing this message i had joined an expeditino essentially a co op dungeon raid but i got stuck in an endless loading screen when the host left the area into a new one i got loaded in but i couldn t see anyone or open any doors but i kept taking damage from enemies i couldn t see the lag is often also very annoying teleporting me back to where i jumped off a cliff to take a shortcut or making me miss hits i clearly landed to things like randomly staggering and enemies healing because they think i m not in combat with themall in alli think it s a good game it s definitely miles better than fallout 4 but there are so many bad sides to it that i wouldn t give it a very shining score it s the embodiment of mixed if you can get it very cheap from somewhere and you think it looks or sounds interesting i m sure you can get your mileage out of it i got it for free from a friend who got a code from humble bundle so i definitely got my money s worth6 10fallout 1st is such a scam though that
