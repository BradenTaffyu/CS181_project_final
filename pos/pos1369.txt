2018 early access review own it since the first versions on desura its development appears to move incredibly slow i cant say how many years its being developed now nearly a decade i cant tell desura stopped selling games in 2016 and at that time the game was already available on steam it was available since the official implementation of steam early access in 2013 one of the first 10 games to be sold in that program so its at least 6 years in development as of now updates tend to be rather rare and of small size yet i cant deny the long way they have come since the first version back then it was a very small level barely anything to do only basic systems present now they have a functioning simulation that is so vastly detailled that it puts every other zombie survival out there to shame features at least 2 quite big handcrafted maps with randomized loot a character creation system that is understandable and logical and a deep system for survival if you search for a game where you can roleplay in a zombie apocalypse this is it no other game can do that currently if you want to jump into a setting from your favourite movie or series featuring zombies you can do that best with pz want fast and running zombies like in 28 days later you can do that want more slow zombies and create a game with all the rules from the walking dead you can do that its so detailed and offers so many options to define your own game and set its framework that you can basically play an apocalypse you like to play in and you can do that as the person you want if you want to create yourself you can do that here as the game features a giant set of positive and negative traits including various phobia or stuff like being shortsighted or too fat all of that is then taken over into the simulation if you choose that your character is shortsighted and has no glasses then you cant see well ingame if your character is scared from open places then he or she will be project zomboid is hands down the best zombie survival simulation out there without being too simulative so newcomers couldnt get behind it it is a simulation in how complex its systems work but it still stays useable even for casuals although unforgiving it can further be played cooperatively versus or a mixture bascially you can start a game with a friend survive together and once you find handcuffs or other stuff you can tie your friend to a chair and have zombies finish the work and maybe your friend survives this and secretly plans to kill you later it allows open servers with many other players or private setup or just you you decide if i had to name anything that is the essence of pz then i would say its options pz has all that is needed to allow the player to play a zombie apocalypse the way he or she wants and thats true for every part of the game whether its the world the loot the character the game setup open private etc or the zombies if you search for a serious and unforgiving true zombie survival get this and forget all the other but only if you can get over its graphical style i dont mind it in fact i think its easier to improve this way and is more timeless than most 3d games that age badly after just 2 years pz with being in development for so long still looks good ish if you search for a fun game in the meaning of doing dumb stuff like in scum or rust then this is not it its rather more serious you can do dumb things like drinking bleach or spraying penises all over the place but thats about it its also no game you can win there is no winning condition that ends your run other than dying and thats the point you wouldnt somehow win the apocalypse by being extracted by a helicopter you are there and you survive and at one point probably die disclaimer the above counted playtime is only a fraction i own the game for a very long time and played it on desura mostly before then on steam and also gog so a lot of playtime is unregistered i basically drop in and play every now and then when they release a bigger update with new stuff that means i am not ever up to date for every change on the game the feature i wait most for are npcs if you expect npc interaction and desperately need that i recommend to wait as it currently doesnt feature any such interactions doesnt mean the game feels empty as pz has systems that kind of simulate npcs being there like a house that was closed the day before but now is opened and has shattered windows and being looted gunshots in the distance that attract zombies helicopter sounds etc npcs are a bulletpoint for development and i really hope they come and are satisfying if they are on the quality level i expect them to be then pz is truly the perfect z survival game but its already on the throne anyway
