2023 i didn t really consider this game til somewhere this year when a friend of mine bought me this game as a present i expected this game to be a regular farming game where you repeat the same task of plant harvest sell upgrade repeat with some npcs that can give you some daily missions to help you progress faster but this game had me completely immersed every time i booted it up this game isn t only about farming and efficiency but it s about living the life of a resident who just moved into a new town to find a more fulfilling life you re categorized as a farmer but you also have side hobbies and a social life as any other human being would as a farmer you plant a variety of seeds and care for your farm animals you can then sell the produce to help the community thrive according to the grandma the grumpy old geezer likes tulips maybe you could give him the left over tulip you kept in your chest though if you re tired of farming you could go collect sea shells for fun and sell them for a quick buck so you could buy that slick sword you were eyeing at earlier or you could enjoy fishing for salmon at a riverbank using that sick new fishing rod you just bought though working can be tiring maybe going to the town festival can help you relax that purple haired girl seems nice maybe you could go befriend her by giving her a purple geode you got earlier from mining what i m trying to get at is this game is a masterpiece that can pull you into it s immersive gameplay i wouldn t say this game is for everyone maybe you re into the satisfying feeling of mercilessly killing demons or maybe you re a masochist that finds it fun for all your progress be demolished by a minor mistake but if you want a game that can help you be at ease and immerse you into playing for hours then this is a game i can 100 recommend to you
