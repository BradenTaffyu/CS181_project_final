2022 early access review project zomboid is a game much like myself is incredibly autistic but unlike myself is on the complete fun side of the spectrum this game is brilliant and you ll wanna throw a mug at the wall when you lose your 1 month progress because some chad zombie with a bread knife in it s ass broke down the barricade to your bedroom and killed you in your sleep but then you ll look past that pick up the broken pieces of that beautiful gromit mug you just decimated and play again this is were the game traps in a self sustaining cycle of denial next run will be so much better you say as you pick hemophobic like the chad you are and go again only to die to the same exact way if you can look past this questionable game loop this game is pure thrilling entertainment that surpasses the need for masturbation any kind of tomfoolery on that level and don t let my 26 2 hours trick you i ve had this game for as little as 3 days as it has consumed me ferociously you might even say like a zombie but that s just my funny bone at it again but lets cut the and stop beating around the bush and get to the conclusion of this novela is it worth it most definitely it feels criminal that this game was gifted to me because it feels more deserved to pay at full price so get it now i beg you
