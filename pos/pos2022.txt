some of the greatest rpg stories ever made bogged down by an unimpressive mmo skeleton it feels like the original game was made with the intent to be a single player rpg game but at some point during development was forced to become an mmo this game originally came out during the big mmo boom so i wouldn t be surprised if ea just suddenly sprang the mmo requirement onto bioware expecting to make more money but all that aside it still genuinely has some of the greatest rpg stories i ve ever played or read the agent story especially is an amazing saga although i d recommend you don t start with it because not all 6 stories maintain the same quality as the imperial agent quest play this game if you want a great rpg not if you re looking for an amazing mmo
