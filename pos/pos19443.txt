2020 you ve probably heard of new vegas even if you haven t played it yet ask anyone from all walks of life about their favorite rpgs and chances are that they ll mention this game and if you re lucky they might mention that the fallout series started as interplay s isometric crpgs from the 90s and that steam has those bangers as well choices consequences customization engaging loot system they re all part of fallout new vegas from being able to repair weapons armor with identical items with varying durability to being allowed to kill literally everyone and ignore choose any quest you like the freedom this game provides is astonishing computer terminals have all sorts of interesting f ked up backstory stored in them so be sure to level up your science skill asap obviously the main quest and the handful of huge side quests companion quests etc are well written as well but the charm of these otherwise totally miss able stories purely existing to flesh out this post apocalyptic world is on another level the survivalist s story from the dlc honest hearts for example is a story you have to piece together through exploration and the payoff is beyond satisfying i m gonna stand my ground and say that dead money new vegas s first and most maligned dlc is my favorite its tragic soul rendering story of the secrets of the sierra madre surpasses any other dlc in the fallout series let alone nv honest hearts is okay i wasn t as invested as i was with dead money joshua graham is a fascinating character though if you find yourself in the legion s camp you might catch talk about a certain burned man keep him in mind old world blues is quirky in a douglas adams way and the individual bits are hilarious but it s also the dlc that completely threw me off the game for months the middle section became so tedious and boring for me even with all the cool gear last but not least lonesome road is the logan 2017 of new vegas dlcs it utilizes the sense of solitude and hopelessness that its worldspace reeks of and amplifies it with an engaging bad guy ulysses and a fittingly dark and grimy quest lonesome road feels like the final warning of what s to come a memento mori that ends with an emotional twang the real ending though is when you get back to the mojave a certain package awaits you with a voice recording that will stay in your mind for years you may also have heard that in terms of engine or graphics this game isn t really that astounding well duh it was made about ten years ago with an outdated game engine that said i encountered close to zero bugs on this steam version with no bug fix mods only one that enables steady high fps so don t worry too much if you feel the gun combat feels too wonky download some mods that improve fire recoil and such they really enhance the nv experience i ve written way too much tl dr new vegas is exactly as fantastic near perfect perfect as they say and then some talk about morality or fruitlessness of in a post nuclear american wasteland or gun bomb nuke your way through hoards of enemies remember they re not enemies because the game sets them up as so but because your own actions make them so your choice matters
