2023 early access review if you ve played ark especially since the begining you know what to expect the performance is not great and i ve had one or two crashes but the game looks and feels beautiful the creature ai is way better the animations look smoother and more realistic i got to behold that beauty when a swarm of piranha ate me up it feels like ark and i do love ark
