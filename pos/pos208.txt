2019 stardew valley may look to be a laid back kinda game huh that might be true but for some people like myself this game will suck you into the vortex like a hyper hydraulic toilet on the turbo rinse cycle option now i have very little experience in this genre of harvest moon lookin farm games but it s hard for me to imagine that they get much better than this there s just so much to do that it s hard to fathom you ve gotta clean up your farm so that you got a nice open spot to plant some little potato seeds gotta grow those little stink eggs up right quick to make a nice buck at pierre s store but what cha gonna do while you re waiting for the vegetables hmm i don t know you could get a fishing pole from ol willy and catch some salty sardines or maybe you wanna go into the mines and search for sparkly rock crystals while you fend for your life in the dank depths of the earth but this is only the beginning of what s on the agenda you can build some animal coops and milk some cows build a stable an ride a horse befriend the locals and maybe meet a waifu or husbando you can rebuild the community center cook up delicious pizzas and give them to your buddies maybe even sniff around in the open fields looking for grapes and then eat them the choices are yours and the pace at which you take it is yours to decide as well great music great style lots to do and a heaping helping of getting sucked right into the vortex of no return this is what stardew valley has to offer give it a shot if you re in the mood for losing yourself in the endless expanse of farm fresh manure and infinite anchovies to sum things up i d give stardew valley a solid scoring of outta control like a bull gone ape thanks for reading
