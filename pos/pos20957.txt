2023 overhelmingly positive should be right for this game it s not too hard it s fun and it s addictive o and it made me laugh out loud several times because of the characters and the story it s over the top beside all of that the diving is very relaxing and the game doesn t hurry you up so you can make sushi and sell it at your own tempo and upgrade your stuff before you want to go deeper into the story the upgrades are great and realy help you along deeper diving into the game yep dave hit several of my game spots i really like sushi by the way
