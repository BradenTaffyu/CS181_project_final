2021 if you re on the fence of buying it just do it as someone who s played every forza motorsport game and forza horizon game this is by far the most beautiful and polished the game has been it s an absolutely stunning game and very well optimized mexico can t be beat it is easily becoming my favorite map out of any of the horizon games there is more than enough things to do earning money is rewarding variety of races is endless especially when it comes to community blueprints and mini games music i d say is good not great pulse radio was always my go to now it seems like a pop station now i find myself on bass arena now other stations are good lots of variety there s something for everybody the amount of cars and customization is one of the reasons why this is easily becoming my favorite horizon game to date endless cars they ve added more parts to add and customize they listened to community and fixed the audio so i commend them for that final rating 9 5 10only thing i continue to feel in the most recent horizon games is that there really isn t a campaign well there is but doesn t feel like it as they kinda just throw you in the world with 400 races and pretty much say do whatever you want for me i miss the feeling of grinding for a purpose other than ranking up and buying every car i want which is nice but i want more out of it
