2017 early access review very good act 1 at first it was pretty hard for my friend and i to get through but we managed somehow i always enjoy how this game allows for so many ways to deal with certain situations i liked the new physical magical armor system the only thing i wish was that they had made it easier to know what items combined to do what i felt like i was missing out on how the crafting system worked also i m not sure on this source pt system granted you do not get much access to it till the end of act 1 but i m hoping this won t be something that is finite in the game i like to use the high level moves in combat more often
