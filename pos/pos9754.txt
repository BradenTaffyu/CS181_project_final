2020 in my opinion a must buy for everyone who is even only remotely interested in survival base building sims and even if you are not so much rimwold might change your mind so where do i start visually the game is rather simplistic but it has it s very own charm and i think it works very well to focus on the main aspect which brings me to the gameplay and o boy you re in for a treat there are different scenarios you can choose from for example playing a few crashed spaceship survivors or starting with a lost tribe depending on that your starting gear and building possibilities are very different there are also different storytellers to chose from which are basically defining the random events and how often they appear and difficulty as well there s an option for everyone there from a more relaxed experience to why the hell am i even doing this to me after that you re chosing your starting spot on a world and off you go survival is the main aspect you need to mine materials build shelter beds grow food or hunt animals and cook their meat but you also need to make sure that things won t spoil so researching electricity generators freezers but also guns and clothes and all the other things that ll make your life easier your survivors all have different traits and skills some are good at building some can shoot very well some others are doctors all while having different personality traits as well so some can be psychopaths nudists fast learners pyromaniacs all of that will influence stats bonuses behavious etc also be prepared that your survivors might punch each other in the face for not liking or insulting each other now this might seem like a lot and in the beginning it definitely is but i think it s not as hard to get into it and definitely worth the experience you definitely have to find out what to prioritize and in the beginning you might fail a lot but that s also part of the fun being hunted by a mad rat that kills half of your survivors du to the injuries they receive might be something that will happen to you the random events can range from raid parties trying to kill your survivors packs of manhunting animals to eclipses and other events i d say it s not the easiest and relaxed game even though it can be for a long time but then it also can go boom a hostile raid on your colony shortly after that a pack of manhunting squirrels coming after you then someone getting in a fistfight losing an eye and another one getting the flu but it doesn t matter it s really part of the fun even though it might set you back a bit the constant struggle is part of the fun in my opinion rimworld is giving me something that i didn t experince for a long long time maybe even not since diablo 2 only finish this building only mining this steel block only that one more thing it s a really addicting and fun gameplay spiral and i ve caught myself losing track of time so often there are also a lot of great workshop mods some of them i d probably couldn t play without anymore it s a great base building survival game with a difficulty that s challenging but never felt unfair to me in my opinion a masterclass in complex challenging gameplay
