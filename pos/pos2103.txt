2023 behind some baffling lack of quality of life features ultra nitpicky grindy progression system and an abyssmal launch server experience there is a pretty solid game here best thing that this game does is to carry over the payday the heist aesthetic while keeping the gameplay more modern and techy i geniunely love the simplicity of what are you trying to achieve in the heist while having advanced gadgets to work with spy cam is a favorite compared to payday 2 loud combat feels less arcade ish and stealth feels much more grounded which are both big pluses for me maps feel more worked on while i still wonder if they will manage to keep it up for the bigger ones like goat simulator or beneath the mountain these aside being a one build guy myself i really don t appreciate the progression system at its current state where you have to switch things around if you would like to progress at a faster pace also not having simple features like lobby chat on launch is just plain annoying they ve got their hands on the server issues at the time of this review so let s hope they keep this up overall i ve really enjoyed payday 3 and you should too despite the review bombing it s receiving right now mostly caused by the aforementioned server issues
