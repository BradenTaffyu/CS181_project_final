2021 fallout 4 is overall a terrific experience the gameplay especially when it comes to combat has been dramatically improved the loop of clearing out a dungeon looting everything and bringing it all home can be pretty fun and feels rewarding most of the time as usual the characters are well written and i found myself really enjoying being around the npcs in game for the most part some characters feel expertly written while some feel flat and forgettable of course only referring to the named ones here the map is one of the best of the series and is what i believe to be bethesda s most prominent strength with the fallout ip they never fail to deliver a significant fleshed out and exciting world to explore fallout 4 adds to it greatly on a scale we hadn t seen before that being said the main quest feels phoned in and recycled the choices you are presented with seem to hold no actual weight and it leaves fallout 4 feeling more like a game you want to do everything but the main quest in i recommend fallout 4 as i think the gameplay itself is some of the best in the series though you get this gameplay improvement at the loss of principal rpg elements stripping the game of what little actual fallout feel it has
