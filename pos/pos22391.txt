2017 in 2011 my journey began and in 2017 that journey ended the original dark souls 2011 kindled a relationship with a video game that i had never experienced before that relationship is stronger than ever having morphed and strengthened over time across the series three iterations the first game caught my attention enthralling me in an imaginary universe i had never experienced before but also tested my metal the second game continued on the first game s strengths but never captivated me like ds1 and now we have the third in all honesty i had my reservations about the latest and final souls game before the game s release i felt that from software the developer of the soulbourne series had exhausted their creativity and originality with the first and second games and thus the third would end up a mere imitation of the series previous outings but alas my cynicism was proven wrong spoilers aside this third outing in the series sees players take control of the ashen one a being tasked with bringing a bunch of lords of cinder to task thus ending or beginning anew the age of fire a daunting task as in ds1 ds2 you yourself became a lord of cinder at each game s conclusion the game functions and plays exactly as the previous two games if the formula aint broke then no point trying to fix it over 35 hours you will explore a wide array of environments defeat enemies collect souls consume said souls and kit out your character with increasingly more powerful items outfits and weapons so that you can go and explore more dangerous locales defeat even bigger enemies and consume more plentiful souls this formula is repetitive but maintains the player s attention through continuously presenting him her with increasingly more challenging encounters that require skill learning knowledge and for me at least pure dumb luck for some the souls games may prove difficult but i believe the better term is challenging once you have learned the ins and outs of the game s combat and rpg mechanics you should be good to go of the three souls games ds3 does a good job of presenting the player with challenging encounters that never enter the realm of feeling impossible the only boss that disproves this is midir an optional dlc encounter who functions much like other bosses but has a ridiculous amount of health that can take what feels like eons to whittle down moreover the challenges the bosses present are arguably made easier by offering the player options to summon npc characters to help fight most of the games many bosses on the other hand your journey is complicated by numerous invasions whereby npc characters will invade your world and try their damndest to end your life however the ai of these invaders leaves a lot to be desired most can be easily defeated by stepping backwards after the invader attacks then darting back in to deliver some damage rinse and repeat and you ll destroy any invader overall the choreographed invasions are pretty poor in comparison to what would occur in previous souls games boss fights are the highlight of this game and they rise to the high expectations set by both ds1 and ds2 ds3 provides a plethora of diverse bosses that range from humanoid warriors to hulking behemoth tree giants each have their own style and atmosphere that never come too close to seeming akin to each other a major boon for ds3 is that every boss has at least two different phases which force players to often alter their strategy mid fight in order to compensate for a new phase of attacks or even environment however ds3 is quite conservative with regards to the kind of bosses it presents to the player ds3 does not provide anything close to the alien and strange creatures that can be found in ds1 or bloodborne rather most bosses stick to having a humanoid form whilst wielding a large sword or club like weapon to fight these big badass bosses one needs good equipment ds3 does a great job at providing a magnificent array of armor sets weapons and spells importantly the game plays on the nostalgia factor by providing items from past souls games at one point i was able to kit out my character almost exactly as once done in ds1 as well as ds2 one complaint that i do have with regards to weapons is that the game has a tendency to force the straight and great sword options on the player due to them being so common prevalent and effective both dlcs added much variety to the weapons arsenal as well as special attacks that can be quite mesmerizing on first sight moreover if arcane warfare is your thing then ds3 has it covered faith pyromancy and mage builds are supported by a multitude of spells for each school of magic and are devastating in both pve and pvp an integral component of the souls games is exploration the ds3 adventure occurs across many well designed environments each having their very own particular atmosphere and context specific encounters from dark dungeons to sky high castles putrefying swamps to forgotten caverns the games does a great job at proving a wide array of areas to explore apart from the challenging enemy encounters the player will interact with several npc characters some of which will help you out while others will attempt to hinder your progress these npc s are far more expressive than those in previous souls iterations with many doing more than just standing around looking glum as in past souls games some of these encounters reveal lengthy questlines that once completed have major influence on the overall main story line as well as on a variety of events this is a welcome advent to the souls series leading from this we have the lore of the game like previous souls games little of the game s overarching narrative is told through direct story telling methods rather the bulk of interesting and enigmatic lore and story comes from item descriptions and thorough inspection and observations within the game world by just paying extra attention to one s surroundings major plot points and supporting content can be uncovered for those gamers that prefer story flung into their faces through lengthy cut scenes and detailed in game codex s be aware ds3 as well as all other souls games takes a more active rather than passive approach to storytelling with regards to presentation ds3 is a beautiful game that successfully brings life to a dark fantasy world characters models are well designed and textures are good enough to seem realistic however some areas lack the intricate details afforded to others making for an uneven experience from region to region adding to the aesthetic of the game is the music and sound ds3 sticks much to what has been done in past souls games adventuring across the game s world is mostly done in absence of any music score this and the environmental noise and sound do well to capture the feelings of isolation loss and entropy once a major encounter begins then only does the typical souls score commence overall dark souls 3 is a fantastic entry and end to the souls series it may not experiment or adjust the souls formula as much as some may have hoped for but it does present a daunting adventure that will challenge anyone willing to take the chance personally i find dark souls 3 to be a great souls game not quite as good as its older brother dark souls 1 or even its demented cousin bloodborne but it is a damn fine game in its own right score 9 10
