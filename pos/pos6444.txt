2017 i like the game as it is although one thing irritates me and that is the fact that you cannot buy used older trucks so it would be nice to see a second hand shop where you could buy older and used trucks from like early 2000 s or maybe even older ones this would affect the price and condition so it could make driving less easy and by doing so it would add more content to the game thus you wouldn t have to buy a brand new truck every time if you want it to be your own
