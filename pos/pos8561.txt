2018 lots of people give negative reviews stating it is boring and they can never find an animal and track forever this game requires some patience but tracking on average is around 10 minutes if you never see an animal you aren t playing it right big surprise this game is not a run gun action game it is slow and meant to be so i play this game to relax and chill with friends not to get excited shooting is done really well and if you only get flesh shots well don t blame the gun would recommend obviously as some stated the glitches can be annoying and i feel as though the leveling system is too slow and mundane but not enough to steer me away
