2018 i don t usually write reviews because most people couldn t even bother to read them despite this i would say that this is an amazing game that is surprisingly dead for how good it is dark souls iii was my introduction into the souls universe and it was truly an amazing experience people always say dark souls is difficult dark souls is hard but it really isn t it s challenging it requires your attention masterful architecture stunning graphics wonderful level design full of shorcuts and the fights the tactical side behind each fight leaves so spoiled that every other game fighting mechanic seems rather simplistic and boring in comparison bosses are fantastic for the most part every bosses were unique and well designed tbh the bosses are so good that you feel honored to be killed by them each boss has a personality and backstory that makes fighting them either extremely exciting or super sad one of the most beautiful things about dark souls iii is the music the music is simply stunning 10 10 for me
