2020 while i do love this game truly as an actual hunter i d like to see more animals squirrel bobcat racoon beaver etc there s more to hunting than just trophies i d also like to see added weapon choices black powder rifles pistols and shotguns opens a whole new weapons cache maybe even the mountain man outfit today s modern rifles could be added too more calls can even be added at different attraction levels i e electronic coyote calls with a further call range and please please fix the range finder sight for bows 2lbs for a sight when all of the other sights are 0 5 lbs overall good fun hours turn into days but it could use some new content not just maps
