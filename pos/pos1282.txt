2015 early access review attempt 1 i spawned in an office inside a construction site where i found a pencil and a piece of paper i went outside and got attacked by zombies i managed to kill a few with my pencil but got quite scratched up i hopped the fence and got attacked again my pencil broke in a zombie skull and i got bitten on the arm i managed to get away but was moving slowly due to my injuries i found a house ripped up a shirt and bandaged up my wounds i went to the bathroom to look for some pain killers but found a zombie and got hurt again i stumbled from the house and got attacked again i headed towards some trees to try to lose the pursuing zombies but died just as i made it to cover time survived 6 hours 4 zombies killed attempt 2 i spawned in a trailer park where i found a school bag which i filled with a selection of food from the fridge and a bottle of water i went trailer to trailer gathering more food until i found a baseball bat i left heading north and found a house to stay the night the house across the street looked like a good place for a base with a high fence around 3 sides i went through neighbouring houses sheds and garages for supply s during the days and read some beginners books for carpentry and cooking by night zombies kept wandering into my garden over night and i had to clear a few out each day with my trusty baseball bat i found a warehouse while exploring and found a hammer nails saw and axe after a day of chopping trees and sawing logs i closed off the entrance to my garden to a narrow opening and that seemed to keep the zombies out i got good at killing zombies with my new axe while on supply runs things were going well i got over confident and managed to scratch myself on a broken window i bandaged it but after a two days of replacing bandages i had an infection i pushed forward my plans to raid a medical centre i had seen a long way south i travelled the train tracks and entered the medical centre the alarm went off as i made my way through but i carried on stocking up on supplies even as i heard zombies entering the building from the front i planned to hop out the back window when i was done but they came through there too trapping me i battled my way out of the building but was scratched and bitten and in a bad way i headed to a nearby house i knew i was going to die so i stashed my bags of gear in a cupboard and went outside to die time survived 8 days and 14 hours 147 zombies killed attempt 3 i don t know where i am but i ve got a rolling pin and i m gonna find my house and then go and get my stuff back i would definitely recommend this game i m only interested in playing single player mode so i feel it really needs the planned ncp characters to add more interest to the game also looking forward to the addition of vehicles the new animations in the weekly blog look like they will improve the look too
