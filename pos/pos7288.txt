2016 far more than re skin of ets2 when you buy american truck simulator you are buying two things an excellent base game and the promise of significant expansions dlc improvements over the next years the game as it is now is already excellent the world although maybe a little small compared to euro truck simulator 2 seems far more detailed and far more alive than some of the parts in the base ets2 map of course the game engine is pretty much the same and it will feel very familiar to ets2 users there are however plenty of things to enjoy in ats from challenging deliveries to long open roads not to mention those great american trucks with california and nevada in the game at the time of writing this review the world can feel a little small in my current 33 hours of gameplay i have visited all major towns and have explored over 75 of the map something which would have taken far far longer in euro truck simulator 2 on the other hand with a free arizona update coming soon and the promise of significant map expansions through dlc american truck simulator is only going to get bigger and better over time this is a great single player experience that can also be enhanced through multiplayer play with the truckersmp mod which is easy to install and free if you are tired of driving around california and nevada on your own join up with some friends and join a convoy tl dr a great single player and multiplayer experience that promises to get even better as more content is added to the game by developers well worth it for people who enjoyed ets2 it is more than re skin and it is also a great introduction to those who sneer at or have not had the pleasure of enjoying truck simulation
