rimworld is a simple kind of fun it s not intending to tell an enrapturing story with a deep and engaging plot and characters doing things that make sense as the developers put it it is a story generator much in the same vein as dwarf fortress and kenshi it is looking to simulate as many systems as would make sense for the stories it wants to tell much like these other games it also ends up telling a very disjointed and mostly nonsensical story if you are not attempting to give it a little bit or role play with the characters you have like good stories too part of the fun comes from losing and dealing with that loss every great victory has a crushing defeat to follow sometimes all you can do is flee and hope for the best it is not a game that you win rimworld is a game that is meant to be played for as long as it is interesting many of your colonies will end in relative security and stability there is a win condition technically multiple even but they re not really goals to be sought after they are just ways for people who want an ending to get to one aside from the main one that is meant to be the driving force for most players which is build a ship so you can gtfo they don t really make sense unless you have made some kind of story with your colonists behavior around it i can t really write a review without mentioning mods either this game does have dlc and it is perhaps the best integrated of any extension but the mods are the meat of the content for this game from total overhauls like combat extended to new systems like pawnmorpher to simple additions and quality of life stuff like vanilla expanded and puah if you have a problem with the game or think there s a feature you want but it doesn t exist someone has probably made a mod for it like any well supported game there is of course a whole list of fetish mods outside of the workshop as well but i ll let you find those on your own when you ve exhausted your fun with the base game no shame in having fun give it a try see where it leads you try to learn the endless number of systems in place and pull your hair out when all of your dudes get wiped because a bunch of bugs rained from the sky crashed through your roof and then destroyed everything you spent hours making in a matter of minutes
