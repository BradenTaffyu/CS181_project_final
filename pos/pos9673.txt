2014 early access review imo this game blows away iracing for proper realism it has a raw and gritty feel to it the feedback from your car and road surfaces is impeccable add to that the fact this is only for pc and one can quickly forget all those games who cater to the kiddy console users leaving us with 2nd rate code for pc this is a must buy for sim racing enthusiasts
