2018 great overall strategy game campaign is amazing for me it feels like a perfect cross between civilisation heroes of might magic and of course warhammer i used to love homm and this feel like putting homm on steroids great great game only downsides are dlc policy and pricing steep get on sale p on the flipside you ll easily sing 10s if not 100s of hours into this if you re into this type of strategies norsca is really op and campain on normal is incredibly hard if you get frustrated that you get obliterated after 10 or 20 hours do yourself a favour and start on easy playing empire with norsca attacking is just insanely hard it s a deep and hard strategy but also fun and rewarding watching shock cav charging through enemies never gets old
