2017 early access review i know what your thinking look at the graphics and 30 dollers wtf i said the same thing for a year looking at this game but here is the lowdown on rimworldit is absolutely epic the depth of this game is unprecedented in its vanilla form it truly is a vary great game but with the workshop which has a huge active community the sky is not even a limit anymore if you like colony building a bit of exploration tower defense and survival games this has great big bits of each in it you will not be disappointed my one major con pawn ai they truly are stupid as hell sometimes the ui does provide ways of dealing with their bad choices but it is a bit clunky in that respect i give this game a 9 5 10 and its still in alphaalso its a must have for any brown coats out there it is not in the firefly universe but it harnesses its amazing spirit very very well
