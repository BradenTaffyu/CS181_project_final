2020 this game is overwhelmingly addictive it is similar to factorio where i am the cause of my own problems and not as crazy as dwarf fortress but there is a lot to dive into i enjoyed the early game but had trouble with the transition this game focuses on a base building game ant farm style oxygen co2 water heat moral and food become problems balancing but there are multiple ways to solve it i love it even when i made a mistake in the mid game and my power production coudnt keep up i had to scramble for 30 min to save my lovable little dupes and though i was in a panic i learned from it and look back as fun the music is relaxing and i often feel that ill just work on one project and go to sleep and i lose track because of the fun i am having i highly recommend checking out francis john on youtube his tutorials taught me so much and helped me understand the little known mechanics of this game his videos range from beginner to beast if you are thinking about getting this game please check out his lets plays thanks to his videos my latest colony the plucky cosmos has survived 1950 cycles which is roughly 130 hours and conquered space the development team klei is still hard at work on this game they have added new building types and are still hard at work bug squashing their builds they also have plans for dlc in the future though most of the current updates which add content are free i have had a lot of fun conquering space and making the dupes happy thanks for reading and good luck
