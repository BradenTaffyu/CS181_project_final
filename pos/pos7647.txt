2021 early access review this game is the best driving simulator i know why you ask well first there is the soft body physics which are very similar to a real car that means if you re rallying and you want to cut the corner and hit a rock with the suspension instead of the wheel you will break your suspension oh don t worry you can still finish but you ll have to suffer the consequences of your decisions or you can restart the scenario and try again with a fresh car to get a clean run as the youtuber jimmy broadbent said in beamng compared to so many other racing games the car actually feels like an object you have to look after secondly there is the sheer amount of fun stuff you can do with this game like dirt rally tarmac rally track racing drifting derby off road drag or simply just cruising in a comfy road car at comfy speeds there is a career mode i have tried a little and intend to look into more with nice fun challenges that are not conventional of your typical racing sim there are a lot of scenarios you can choose from like classic dirt rallying i really love dirt rally and it s really good in this game police chases cool stunts like in movies deliveries races some light and breezy and some very challenging and sooooo much more i have played 20 hours so far and haven t even remotely scratched the surface of this game s content the maps in this game are very impressive my favorite is italy a highly detailed and very huge map of a countryside in italy with very long serpentine roads that go through the mountains and seaside with three cities to explore and drive in and countless dirt and gravel roads to put your rallying skills to the test there is industrial site where you can practice your drifting rallycross derby there is east coast usa where you can cruise on the highway and make cool police chase scenarios there is a photo mode in which i have made all of my most recent desktop backgrounds on top of all that there are a lot of mods that can add to your driving experience and the devs are super supportive of them even so that they made most of them accessible on their website and in game you can download maps components for your cars new cars and so much more i recommend getting the nurburgring map mod you can find it in the repository under the name ks nord it s a super realistic free and scanned map of the legendary nurburgring circuit in the nurburg area in germany most of the fanmade mod maps in this game looked really good to me and it s fun to see such a loving and passionate comunity in a racing game also look up beammp which is a multiplayer mod for the game it is being constantly looked after and updated by their creators and so far i find it really fun doing some roleplay with people racing and cruising anyway i could go on about this but i d rather play the game instead see ya
