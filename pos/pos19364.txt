2021 a fine modernization of the classic rts formula for someone who has been starved of classic rts games the past 10 years this game is a blessing the campaigns are introduced enveloped in some of the best intro videos i ve ever experienced in this genre gameplay wise it feels familiar and that s not a bad thing to it s core this is an age of empires 2 for the modern age the gameplay itself is more or less unaltered from it s predecessor where as the ui among other things have been enhanced the negative feedback i ve seen online has mostly been concerning the speed of the game the limited selection of civilizations minor fixes which have not been resolved since the beta stress tests these are not something that i feel strongly about a few of them will surely be fixed in the future and upcoming flc dlc will resolve the amount of civilizations the price is a bit too steep but i ll gladly pay it for a new entry in the age of empires series all in all can highly recommend this for old rts lovers who grew up with c c aoe2 it s siblings
