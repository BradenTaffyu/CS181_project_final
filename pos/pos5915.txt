2020 early access review ignore the negative reviews while the game has its crashes and its bugs and obviously missing content the game s foundation is there and the developers are actively updating the game each and every day with a plethora of fixes and additions slowly turning bannerlord into a 100 smooth and playable state for every single soul i ve crashed a few times with certain things yes it s annoying but it s early access you all bought into it expecting too much if you all read into the early access section taleworlds told you what to expect from it yet you all still bought it bannerlord is in every way an improvement over warband yes warband currently has a bunch of features bannerlord does not but the developers will get there a massive and diverse world beautifully detailed unique factions though they are currently generic and bland they will evolve over time vibrant and active world while a lot of it is basic it s still very early in development well thought out economy still in the works but it has the potential to be much better amazing siege warfare the foundation is definitely there and sieges are amazing as is but playing as the defender is currently broken still an amazing new edition over warband world map animations are beautiful and improved no more annoying marshals thought this deserved its own point awesome ai and the ability to have the ai take over your army i was really looking forward to seeing if bannerlord would let you give command of your army to the ai i am not too strong at micromanaging my army while playing warband so this feature was amazing the ai is also much smarter than warband s bannerlord is still extremely early into its public release and a lot is wrong with it but it certainly is playable and it certainly is fun the people that are complaining about how long it took to get where it is right now are the impatient ones that expected a perfect nearly finished v1 0 release at this point bannerlord is definitely worth getting into and watching the world expand i m having a lot of fun thus far and will continue to enjoy the game as it evolves just remember it s early access and you can t expect so much from these releases early access does not mean it will have everything you expected in fact quite the opposite in most cases please stop posting negative reviews and comments within the discussions about how bad this is for the time it took it detours many interested parties with falsified or ignorant information
