2018 frankly i have never tried any kind of farm games before this one even though i could have plenty of patience i didn t see how this one would be fun for me yours truly being more of a first person shooter guy taking care of a piece of land sounded more like a burden and a job than a game until my boyfriend and me decided to try this game mostly because of the hype after completing 2 years into the game and 91 hours until now i can safely say that stardew valley has given me more fun than what i have expected all across the board how would i describe this game graphics and sounds are pleasurable to look and hear over the cuteness of them land management makes you challenge yourself into being effective and efficient enemies can be challenging if not properly prepared and you gotta plan carefully what crops can you grow in what seasons or else they may just perish i hope this game keeps growing in content and hopefully it will just become more and more awesome than it already is
