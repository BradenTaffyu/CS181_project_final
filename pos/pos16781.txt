2021 so i like the sims a lot the only issue is the sims has gameplay that i don t like my favourite part of the sims 3 is building and decorating the house full stop i will spend hours on that this game is the good part of the sims 3 to me but it s the whole game is it weird yes is it fun mileage may vary if you re really into fiddly things and decorating and all of that jazz you ll like it as i stated this is basically the sims 3 building and decorating but way better and it s the whole game i liked it so much i got the dlcs garden hgtv add ons the gardening is okay it s not really my favourite but i m still digging into that the hgtv is kind of fun but i ll admit i ve never seen the show so i don t know if there are references that i m missing or not i find there is some annoyance with not being able to place things just how i want them and the search function for items is a little annoying at times having to click through multiple menus to find a certain thing you want and keywords often missing things you may want to use when being specific for instance bookshelf will not bring up the items bookcase i feel the items could be separated in a more efficient way i would like the sims 3 room function selection available but it certainly doesn t break the game just takes getting used to graphics are fine no issue with that once i upgraded my skills i found myself getting a bit more creative with items and actually starting to really enjoy the process so it s a little slow at first but stick with it
