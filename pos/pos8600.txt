2020 this game is for 2 types of players 1 players with surgical precision2 players with meek patiencebut that doesn t mean it s hard for other players the game itself is a good representative of realism and unparalleled beauty the atmosphere quality and audio is appealing to a point where the game creates it s own aesthetic ambience even though the only mode of transport around the vast maps is through a dlc vehicle it is pointless because walking through acres of land looking for animal tracks is worth your time because of the astounding adaptations of nature this game awards the player with thehunter call of the wild is well worth your money
