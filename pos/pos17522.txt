2016 i think it is very easy with the steam review system to recieve an incomplete understanding of how good a game is or isn t with just a thumbs up or down it is hard for anyone to tell you much about a game so i would like to break this game down as much as possible to give you are really good source for information firstly lets address the negative reviews that state the game is great i had a lot of fun but dlc these reviews are not reviewing the game ignore them immediatly there are problems with this game but dlc is an option the problem would only be if the game did not have enough content to begin with so lets look at that what do you get in the base game the base game gives you 4 races empire vampire counts dwarfs and greenskins the map that you are playing on is set in the old world of the warhammer universe by default all races have 2 legendary lords however through the free updates some have gotten more each campaign can take anywhere from 40 to 70 hours to complete if you consider 1 dollar an hour a pretty good investment this game oozes good value however if it is that would not matter alright so gameplay this section has to be split into two sections campaign and battle starting with campaign this side of the map is a perfect example of 10 steps forward 2 steps back campaign pros all cam paigns feel really differentdiplomacy is easy to use and understandstances are all useful and feel intuitivevisuals are beautifulcities changing to match faction is an amazing additioneconomy is limited forcing players to actually make desicions when building armiescampaign cons regional occupation the concept that only certain races can occupy certain cities terrible idea movement in your land is same speed as enemy causing annoying chases through your landthough cities due change when upgraded it is very hard to see the difference unlike attila or rome 2onto battles the battles stay mainly the same from previous games with the addition of crazy new units to spice it up the ai is also much improved you can tell a ton of work went into making these great however the games keep pushing towards smaller maps and faster battles which may have gone a little to far in this one battle pros ai it can actually put up a good fight diversitymagicvisualscustimizable ui bound to space bar nice additions to control make it easy to move armyimpacts are greatly improvedbattle cons no blood maybe i m just messed up lack of kill animations understand the point of removing the match combat of older games however a system like dawn of war where when they go to kill an enemy it plays a combat animation would have been nice maps are very smallbattles are very short 5 minutes 8 minutes lastly we need to discuss seiges and the lack of battle diversity in terms of types total war warhammer features two battle types seige and land battles no minor settlement battles no fort battles and no naval battles not so salty about the last seige pros the first few feel epicart is beautifulseige cons single or double wall leaves zero strategyentire battle is spent watching your troops slowly try to break past theirsinfinite tower range makes artillery uselessonly feels like there are 5 different mapsdifferent factions have the same settlements with different artdwarfs are the most dissapointing as if you want their trailer it shows multi tiered setlementsin conclussion total war warhammer improves on much and gives you a ton of value for the money you are spending even without mods or dlc some of the issues i have mentioned can be fixed with mods with the game all moded out like mine is the only issue i still see are that seige battles are dull and lack strategy other than that this game is amazing and if you love tw like i do this is a breath of fresh air into a very old franchise
