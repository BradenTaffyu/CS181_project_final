this is great base game but with alot of bad ai bad game logic and sloppy execution the developers have for some reason abandoned it and the only reason i can give the game a 10 10 is thanks to the amazing modding community that fixes alot of the problems now you would think the devs would be thankful for the mods but nope they have an in company competition of how can we break every mod with every tiny update i ve never seen a game that breaks with every update so consistently 0 10 for that level of stupidity learn from rimworld a game where mods keep working for years despite constant updates
