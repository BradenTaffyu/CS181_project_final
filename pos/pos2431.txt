really enjoying my time in fo76 playing it like a hybrid single player online game mostly i m enjoying my time working through the story lines i admit i came to the game only recently so my experience is much different than those who have been playing for a long time i ve even modded up the visuals more to my liking i m finding it a rewarding immersive fun fallout experience it s no fo1 or 2 but i m not taking it as such i d give it a recommended in it s current state
