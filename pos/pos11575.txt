2014 early access review this game really puts into practice so well the concept of survival scavenging crafting and buildling i really recommend it if you like this think about fallout 3 with zombies hunting and building renovating a place of your own set in a post apocalyptic landscape the constructions players can set up are equally representative of a post apocalyptic environment if you heard of project zomboid well if you ask me this is exactly that but better the annoying needs are removed the game plays fluently the environment is already less buggy and your freedom is more obvious the crafting system is worked out very well as well the game lists everything you can make with your inventory when you choose something it shows the shape but not the materials fill in the correct materials and you now know the recipe so no need to fill it in yourself next time just click what you want to craft like in terraria no need for a wiki indeed great
