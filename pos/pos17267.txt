2019 not since before gw destroyed warhammer fantasy have i enjoyed a warhammer fantasy battle as much as this it take the essence of the table top game minus the b o and puts it on your monitor it is missing some of the units and aspects of the game such as skaven misfire events but still has the satisfying crunch of hordes of rats hitting squishy elves i recommend it to anyone missing the rank and file and massive hordes with the plus of not having the accidents of knocking over a movement tray of 60 models would gladly horde and munch down warpstone tokens again gain
