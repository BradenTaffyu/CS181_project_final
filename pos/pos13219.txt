2017 the best video games in my opinion have 3 features they are fun they are replayable and they are educational this game fits that criteria better than almost any other i ve played whether you just want to shoot some froggies into space build a complex space exploration program or teach a science class this game can do it all and will keep you coming back for more and more and best of all you learn about the physics of our solar system and orbital mechanics all while having a blast i really can t recommend it enough just buy the game already it s not rocket science oh right it is rocket science
