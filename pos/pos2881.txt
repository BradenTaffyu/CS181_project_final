2017 so i feel i have enough information to give a well informed review now that i m 36 2 hours in i ve been reading however that if you haven t left the island yet you are still in the tutorial immediate kudos for a content packed game having played the original divinity tile from 2002 i ve seen this game develop from a diablo esque point and click action rpg to the turn based strategy game that is now divine divinity original sin 2 although i ve missed a game or two since then i wasn t quite sure what the storyline was but the game clearly helps you understand what s been going on in the world of rivellon right from the start the immediate immersion into the game has the amazing quality to have me asking questions and wanting to seek out the answers to those questions i was compelled to keep playing as i see the story unfold and each decision leads to more tangled pieces of the web of mystery that i need to solve the combat was easy to figure out immediately and i have to give larian studios another amazing pat on the back for integrating full controller support for a turn based isometric rpg one of my big turn offs is that although i ve played for keyboard and mouse combo for many years i like my gamepad much better and will not buy any titles that don t support it there s some dispute about the tactician mode and whether or not it s too hard having played 8 hours in tactician mode i finally discovered that if i wanted to enjoy the game and be able to progress in it that i would have to play in classic mode even in classic mode the fights are still difficult and i ve had to play a few of those get killed multiple times go level up my characters and improve my gear and then finally win sometimes winning just barely with half my party killed the character creation was a little strange from most rpgs i ve played since you aren t really locked into a particular class and you can be whatever you want based on the allocation of your talents and skills i chose to play as origin character ifan ben mezd since i wanted to find out more about the storyline and how people fit into it the build selection during character creation made it easy to figure out what skills and talents were appropriate for the style of play you wanted for your main character i always choose a good combination of melee and magic so battlemage was perfect for me character dialogues have an added flair to them that give you extra choices based on certain tags you have or aquire or choices specific to certain origin characters the voiceovers are amazing and abundant even down to having your own personal narrator many rpgs don t put that level of artisitic detail into their games when it comes to audio choices the environment is beautifully rendered and i enjoy it in full 4k resolution on my 65in television full camera control with zoom in and out makes the environment easy to navigate overall notes about divinity original sin 2 content packed packed like it could rival the amount of content in skyrim mysterious and interesting storyline that makes you want to keep playing combat system is easy to figure out but beware of tactician mode was too hard for me full gamepad support in a turn based rpg a rare find i would play tyranny if it had gamepad support detailed voiceovers and soothing soundtrack great looking environment that scales well to 4k resolutionsi hope this review helps someone
