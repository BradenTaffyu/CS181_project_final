2017 recently i was asked by a friend who is new to the souls series what i thought of this game so i thought i d put what i wrote him here this game is a masterpiece i d recommend it but i will say its hard like it can be discouraging at times however there are few feelings that come close to the sensation of defeating a boss or enemy you ve been stuck on for hours tl dr beautiful game challenging but rewarding fighting system and a non intrusive but intriguing narrative to boot 9 10ill keep the review brief so you can skim through it because honestly you ve got to experience the game for yourself to fully comprehend what this game is about story vague left to interpretation sorta thing but intriguing you re character seems to be the only one out of the loop and it really helps cement the idea that youre not ready for the grand task you ve been given you d expect alot of satisfaction from the end of the game however the real story chunks are tucked away in item descriptions and in the connotations of npc s visuals f ing fantastic graphics are great even on low settings and this mystical middle age setting looks so incredible the world is detailed and reinforces the main story with hints of the impennding doom that a dark age will induce oh and fashion souls is real and trust me you re going to spend a lot of time making your character look badass gameplay toughest part easy to learn hard to master the levelling system require stat placement which means various builds can be created with various intended functions from melee builds to caster builds to healing builds some styles are more forgiving than others and others require late game items bonuses spells to properly flourish there are of course meta builds that perform pretty well but everyone will also be trying to perfect there own build online fantastic community is still pretty big for pve and pvp but the game is getting getting old now co op is great and can be used through most of game minus something like 3 transitory areas that dont really have anything important in them invasions are what made dark souls work getting invaded and winning a duel makes you feel powerful if its a 1v1 invading can be unforgiving because of gank squads 2 players who corner single invaders but it can be so rewarding when you pull of a whole squad kill and you get to do the infamous point down gesture pvp has its own arena if invading gets tiresome so thats a plus but high wait times if your not around the meta level in arena soul level 120 is the recommended meta range general pvp can be alot more frustrating than other games but alot more rewarding mistakes can be unforgiving and there is a big issue with the lag in fights however for a guy who i know likes to feel the flurry of a good fight this s delivers highly tactical gameplay that rewards smart decisions and good spacing dont get me wrong the arena is useful for easy matchmaking but theres a whole pvp system called fight clubs where players gather in a non dlc area to do 1v1s fair warning there are no real rule enforcement in fight clubs so you just gotta act honorable and hope your fighting compatriots do too and not gank you thanks for reading this has been my first review on steam so i hope its clear and legible i look forward to invading you and may the flames guide thee
