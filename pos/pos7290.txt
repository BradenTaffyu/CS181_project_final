2017 i thought about being a trucker irl a few years back got cold feet and played this instead i certainly don t regret it pros driving in the american sw means many fallout new vegas references for me is that weird the heavy cargo pack is a fun challenge fun looking highway interchanges in ets2 i feel like i m going to roll my truck on its side half of the time i don t have that feeling in ats map dlc s are amazing especially colorado still recieving updates 8 soon to be 9 trucks to choose from and the workshop has plenty more cons not the most realistic most new truckers looking to become an owner operator would most likely start with an old used truck and not a shiny new one out of the dealer and the only place you would see a daycab at a truckstop irl is at the pumps
