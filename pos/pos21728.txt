2016 dark souls is and always has been acquired taste out of all my friends on steam most of whom i know personally and share interests with i can count those who play dark souls 3 on a single hand when i first heard of dark souls i would have never believed i would spend hundreds of hours on one of the series games i was intimidated by the difficulty and attempts to complete the first title resulted in frustration and anger i felt inadequate because the setting appealed greatly to me but i wasn t very proficient at the combat mechanics which force you to critically analyse your surroundings memorise attack patterns and generally be cautious and that s where that ended back then then bloodborne came out and immediately grabbed my attention and renewed my interest in games of the soulsborne franchise it was actually the first of the games i completed here s the deal these games reflect upon your ability to deal with a variety of situations they reflect whether you are able to handle loss whether you can keep a cool head in a tight situation so maybe you are very impulsive make decisions on the fly and maybe everything turns out okay every once in a while but are you able to bear the guilt of your failures the fact that you have made a mistake if not you will rage you will become frustrated or even doubt yourself you ll throw controllers and shout at the screen just as much as you might feel the frustration pulse through you in any situation in life but can you improve that is a clear yes it s definitely possible but you have to be willing and overcoming a seemingly unsurmountable obstacle through great effort training and self reflection is a wonderful feeling giving you control of a character that seems to be so severely underpowered in a world of giant beasts and magnitudinous god creatures is intimidating but along the way you will find that any god may have its weakness and a character that seems weak at first may have unforeseen strengths the only thing you can rely on is yourself and your willingness to learn and persist or you may lose your sanity everything in this world is supposed to make you feel small weak and endangered but you have it in your hand to change the perception you have of yourself will you like this game that depends on you are you willing to give yourself a chance
