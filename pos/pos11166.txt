2020 honestly spent so much time at once on this game hours of fun and if you have the dlc you can stretch the time out even more after a while it becomes a bit of a slog trying to just pass a level but if you re like me then you tend to binge a game as much as you can at once and then forget about it for a while then come back months later to play again
