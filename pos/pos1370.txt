2016 early access review project zomboid is a refreshing gem in the survival game genre when i bought this game in 2011 long before steam greenlight i stumbled upon this game on youtube it was far from what you have seen before the closest thing to it at the time was minecraft the developers humble about their little project back then the map was tiny weapons did not exist in the quantity they do now the food system we have now did not exist multiplayer was a massive requested feature but was thought to never happen there was no progression system the graphics were odd you get the idea it was not a big game now after 5 years a lot has changed it has become quite a survival game since the steam review section consists mainly out of overused memes people complaining about their pc not being able to handle the games and people ranting with 1000 hours that the game sucks i will post more of an introduction than a review i will of course say what is good and what is missing but i will focus on it more in detail than a short review would at the bottom i will sum everything up with a tl drwhat makes the game good its combat system overall the combat system is satisfying you don t feel too strong or too weak your character feels like he is hitting bodies made out of bone and flesh not bodies made out of papierm ch or not rocks like in other games there are three different types of combat bluntbladeragedblunt consists out of bats spiked bats and sledgehammersblade consists out of knives and axesranged consists out of pistols shotguns and riflesif enemies get too close hugging close an axe won t do much damage a knife however will a blunt weapon is efficient as long as the enemy is in reach however it won t do as much damage as a close ranged knife or an axe guns do good amount of damage if the enemy is at the right distance if the enemy gets in melee range it won t be nearly as accurate as if he is a few meters away axes have a sweet spot where the blade contacts with the enemy where they will be the most efficient if you swing too much your character won t hit as hard mood and needs your character of course does not stroll through the zombie apocalypse like it s nothing under all those pixels he also had emotions and needs which this game wants to deliver to you your character can feel a variety of things which affect his combat and health your character can feel pain sadness nausea panic sadness boredom hunger and thirst exhaustion tiredness and temperature all these affect you somehow pain and panic for example can reduce your accuracy with weapons if you are in great pain you won t be able to sleep hunger and thirst obviously will kill you if they get to great boredom and sadness don t do but change the appearance of the world it becomes darker in the future however they will play a bigger role nausea makes you recover less if injured or if you get really sick by eating that month old lasagne then you may die exhaustion makes you a slow weakling tiredness reduces your awareness and ultimately makes you collapse on the street if it gets too bad your character can defeat zombies that means he is also able to overcome his emotions here are some examples if you are in great pain you can take pain killers if you are bored you can go outside mom will be proud or get drunk dad will be proud he can also read or something if you are tired you can drink a coffee you can also use the ancient chinese trading secret method of sleeping if you are thirsty you can drink out of the toilet bowel and so on your character also adapts over time he is less prone to panic the longer he is around zombies and is not so emotionally impacted after seeing corpses all day what about progression and stats project zomboid lets your character develope over his lifetime and you get to already influence your character s skills and talents while you are creating him while creating your character you can chose his pre apocalypse profession and his traits the higher the benefits of these professions the less points you can spend on other traits there are many traits and professions so i will only give one example you want your character to be able to build objects that can actually stand then you can pick carpender this gives your character more experience in carpentry allowing him to build more complex objects right off the bat if your character does something often he will gain more experience and gain level this can improve how efficient your character with the knife on the field or in the kitchen and much more how much can you control in the environment your character can farm build and scavenge if you don t want to starve then you need to plant food if you don t want to get killed by a horde then you need to be able to build sturdy houses and if you want tools you need to scavenge for rocks to build tools there are many differnt crops that you get to plant you need to plow the soil water them regularly and make sure no one steps on them for building there are many different structures to chose from the things you build become more sturdy the more expereience you have this can been seen not just by their hitpoints but also visually challenge project zomboid is a game that is challenging for new players but once you get the hang of it it gets pretty easy after a month of playing the electricity and water supply will turn off because the power plant will get over run this forces the player to find a well in the middle of nowhere to obtain more water or to drink out of every toilet bowel in the city since there is no power you can not refrigerate anymore meaning you will have plant food yourself there is no greater goal to accomplish but not dying which truly makes this game a survival game this can get boring over time there are things to still be added a much requested feature are npc they once were in the game around 2012 however the developers found that they simply were not smart enough so they removed them since then they have been working on them and other projects so they won t blow ass once they are in the game people simply have to be patient other things like generators a nutricion system is coming too so don t you dare think that the developers have become lazy the fact that these guys are still dedicated to this game after such a long time this being their first project is very comforting to know they are also remaking the visuals and combat system for the third time to make it even better you can check their youtube channel for some footage of that they always have new ideas and mods can also improve on the experience here is my favorit one as an example there are things i can not mention because of the character limit on steam like the map editor for example tl dr project zomboid is a game with a great atmosphere with a satisfying combat system needs and moods alongside a trait and experience system and a great soundtrack it succeeds at delivering an entertaining experience the game still has not reached full replay value since you are all alone but if you buy a copy with a friend it will definitely last you a lot of hours don t let that shy you away however since even alone this game will deliver since patches come regularly with the developers listening and interacting with the community on their forum i can only recommend this as an early access
