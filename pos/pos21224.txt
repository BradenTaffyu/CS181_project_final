2022 ok this is a honest review on the 120 hours i had on this gamethe game the game is a battle sort of combat area where there is a blue and a red team and you must pick the right units to beat the other ones or just see which units are better then the other units there s a campaign mode you have a limited amount of coins to spend to beat the other units on the other side which while playing the game its challenging and you must find different ways to beat your opponents and if you beat all the levels in the campaign you have of course beaten the campaign you have chosen but its not the only campaign so you can keep on beating all of them or even beat every campaign without being defeated once or just leave the campaign bit alone you can also download custom campaigns there s multiplayer i haven t played much of multiplayer but this is what you can do in the mode there s 3 sections local friends and quick match local is there you plug in a other controller i think and your friend and you get to pick a team and both of you duel it out to see who has the better team friends is where you get to fight your friends and duel it out thought online and quick match is where you go online and fight a random person with a team and they also pick a team the workshop is where you can find lots of creations from other fellow so called gamer s and see what they have made what you can find in the work shop is sections you can pick from what you want to download with concludes battles campaign units and factions you can put filters on the stuff you want to download which is popularity newest rating and subscribes which is in the category section for filters and i would suggest picking in the timeline section of filters all time because you won t find anything else if you pick today this week and this month there s tags what you can pick from in filters which are challenging historical humor pop culture other and my favourite on powerful you can also upload your own work you have spent time on for others to download custom content in my opinion in my favourite mode is custom content because you get to create your own ideas which are of course battle campaign units and factions i m going to talk about units and factions unites are so so so fun to make you can make them super powerful you can base them of a character you like in anything or just find out how to mess up the game even more with a glitched character what can one shot anything factions is where you can put your broken and op characters in like a group so you can take them out on the battle field there also secret units how to get secret units is across most of the maps you can find weird objects and stare at them for like 6 seconds and you might get a unit there s 54 units so you can just them your self which is very very hard or just look it up on youtube my take on the game from the hours and hours i have played on this game was amazing i loved everything from it but one thing which ill explain later in this review i found the workshop amazing seeing what people have created and seeing if they have a more op character then mine if they do fixing mine i looked finding all the secrets units and messing around the only problem i have with this game thought is the achievements if you want to enjoy this game and mess around doing so do not and i repeat do not do the achievementssome of these achievements by looking at them might be easy but there not there dreadful and for the people who want to do all the achievements i have found out a way to beat all the campaigns without being defeated once and its pretty easy but i might put it on youtube but i going to try and hit a goal of 10 subs not much but if i do ill reveal the glitch i think if your thinking of getting this game then get it because you will enjoy it last thing up vote this post please this took 1 hour of my time and i hoped you enjoyed it
