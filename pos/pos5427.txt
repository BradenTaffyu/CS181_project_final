2021 early access review this game is awesome i don t write a lot of reviews but i m hoping maybe someone will see this and give it a try i have played the old freeware version for a while and recently bought it on steam to get the official tileset and updates the breadth and quite literally depth to this game is ridiculous it s kind of hard to describe but imagine a cross between nethack cdda dwarf fortress and elder scrolls iii morrowind the map itself is massive you will probably spend your first few hours constantly dying in the starting areas but as you begin to get better and make it further each time it s a roguelike so if you aren t a little you will play it with permadeath enabled you realize how huge it is and it s fully persistently simulated as well so you can literally fast travel to one corner of the map dig down a few strata and then dig a tunnel all the way to the other corner of the world map this would probably take you a week if not longer but you can still do it which illustrates what makes this game awesome it encourages you to try and break it in the most ludicrous ways i e stuff is too expensive at the alchemist why not buy a love injector off of him then stab him with it causing him to fall helplessly in love with you and then just making him give you everything he owns for free ended up with a companion that has better stats or mutations than you why not just pour cloning draught that you got for free from your alchemist simp on him and when he undergoes fission and an identical clone of him pops off of him like a budding cell why not just psychically dominate the clone kill your old self thus trapping your consciousness in the body of the clone of your companion and rampage around the world with your identical twin i could go on and on and the atmosphere to this game is incredible the soundtrack is super sick crazy avant garde new music type mixed with perversions of more classical fantasy type themes all of the item and creature descriptions flavor text etc paint this crazy psychedelic sci fi fantasy picture that is very unique and will definitely suck you in if you like to read the whole game is just one awesome mental audio visual experience in closing if you re like me and as you ve gotten older have become more picky about games and it s harder to find ones that capture your attention then i can not recommend this one enough
