this game gave me an existential crisis truly a storytelling masterpiece very engaging plot weaker pacing on the second route but extremely well compensated by third an open world with stunning art direction that s the living proof that it s possible to make an actual open world where every single part of the map feels meaningful and worth to be revisited the ost will always be one of my favourites
