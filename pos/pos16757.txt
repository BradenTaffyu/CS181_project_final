2023 look i ve been putting off writing a review for this for like the last year part of me wants to say i don t recommend it purely because you will be trapped within the game unable to claw your way out you will forget to eat you will forget your friends you will forget to sleep but but i love the game it s so comforting and brain smoothing and as a millennial it s probably as close to being able to buy and decorate a house i ll ever get so i guess pick your poison not having the game and continuing on with your tiresome life or get the game and experience true home owner euphoria at the cost of your personal and social well being
