2022 i want to preface this review by noting that unlike many die hard fans and new vegas supremacists my journey with the fallout franchise started with bethesda s fallout 4 while i love that game too i found myself uncontrollably attracted to the idea of the fallout universe and learning more about the lore through this search for more fallout i was immediately exposed to the undying love that fallout new vegas received from pretty much every fallout fan i promptly bought the ultimate edition and jumped into the undeniably better side of the fallout franchise i was baffled by just how much more detail fnv s writing and even world itself had compared to fallout 4 i would go on to explore every corner of the mojave and beat the game dozens of times on xbox when i got a pc i immediately purchased every fallout game and played them thoroughly but i found myself going back to fnv when i wanted to experience that fallout feeling again the themes ideas and stories in this game have stood the test of time and will inevitably stand the test of time for many years to come needless to say i and many others believe that fallout new vegas is the best fallout game and should be played by everyone at least once
