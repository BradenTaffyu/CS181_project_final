2020 as a massive fallout fan i absolutely love this game so far i had some difficulties with optimization of the game at first but i fixed it with diving into ini files and now the game is truly enjoyable apocalyptic appalachia is a beautiful map and is as equally detailed as commonwealth of fallout 4 there is a lot of customization in the game from weapon armor to building your own c a m p i love the building system in this game quests are immensely enjoyable diving into the earlier fallout lore overall i truly love fallout 76 and would recommend it to any other fallout title fan as well as those looking for an extremely detailed rpg that you can explore with your friends i have also played the game before the wastelanders dlc and i still enjoyed the game just because you have been hearing bad comments about a game does not make it a bad game stop being so bigoted
