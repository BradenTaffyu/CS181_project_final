main story 6 10 never completed it and saved shaun only once to revert the save lolside quests 10 10 best part of the game nothing on witcher 3s level though never did do the one for diamond city radio since his old personality is better dlc nuka world 7 10 pissing off preston garvey is funny and non hostile raiders actually makes sense far harbor 8 10 wish it was longer but 100 an improvement on nuka world makes nick one of the best characters and old longfellow is a cool fellow indeed vault 88 and automatron 6 10 basically sidequests with more to do depends if you like building or shooting factions 6 10 minutemen are de facto good guys railroad are boring institute are selfish and evil brotherhood of steel are authoritarian didn t side with any of them and reverted any ending saves since i never beat the game companions 9 10 didn t use alot of them but i ll probably get their perk and do their quest at some point no clue why but my favourite is cait and brought along for a majority of the game nick is a second because of far harbor settlement building 10 10 i didn t like it at first but my arse wasted over 30 40 hours with at least 5 spent on displaying all my power armour in sanctuary maybe i ll continue with new vegas soon and actually finish the tv show
