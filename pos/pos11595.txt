2022 early access review hello steam community i have played 7 days since it was released in its early alpha stages honestly the concept and thought design behind this game is a golden ticket idea its so loaded with content i even thought to myself when minecraft was released wouldn t it be awesome if there was a random open world zombie survival game out there with crafting in it the funpimps delivered this experience there have been challenges and bugs in this game that i think has tried everyone s patience at one point and the ui at first felt really clunky however writing this review almost a decade later into its development this game has come a very long way for those of you who loved minecraft and dead rising i think you would love the creativity and the endless possibilities in the game it never ends and it will continue to surprise you even when you thought you had done everything 750 days later everyone s experience is absolutely unique and that is also what makes this game amazing you can generate the common world navezgane which was predetermined by the developers and had tasks added to it or you can generate a completely new random world and make your own path you can even customize your game settings for an even more unique experience 7 days is also absolutely terrifying from zombie dogs chasing you relentlessly to zombies creepily walking by your base at night the game has on the edge of your seat experience the 7th day is when things get interesting and i won t spoil the surprise for newbies the game is offered on multiple platforms console and pc although due to one of the publishers going under telltale games the console versions are on a different alpha version still super fun but a different experience i would recommend getting this game on pc i own it on both xbox and pc and honestly love both but the graphics and crafting ui experience on pc is much more robust and its amazing to see what they have changed last thing to note this game is still in alpha and for those of you who don t know the software development world really well it simply means developers have not yet finished developing the game in all honesty that s how most games are even with most aaa game titles some titles come out half baked the fans provide feedback then developers re develop based on that feedback i hope the funpimps continue their development of this game and you decide to give it a try
