2017 early access review i would recommend this game to anyone one of the first thing you will notice while playing dead cells is it s very fluid easy to understand easy to manipulate controls just from getting from point a to point b you will notice how creative you can get with your movement to optimize your path choice throughout the level the game also decides to compliment this with movement upgrades while you progress through the vast and rich progression system that has so many item unlocks and different unique build types that puts most metroidvania roguelikes to shame this game has a lot to offer it is well worth your time
