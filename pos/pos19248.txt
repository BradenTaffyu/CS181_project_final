2022 to be compatible with new computers it requires modes to work fluently and properly of course you can still play even if you don t do anything i also think that you will not need to evaluate the graphics in such an old game as for my assessment i think i have finished the story of the game 3 4 times trying to make different choices each time but i still know that there are completely different places characters that i haven t seen and tasks that i haven t done the freedom offered to those who play is so good that i can t tell i would like to say that besides the nuclear waste and hatred left over from the old world there is a game where you can do what you want without limits even if you have a slight interest in roleplay style games i recommend trying it out
