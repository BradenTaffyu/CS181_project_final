2023 i just play single player i dont like online because of the way you have to play and do everything so quick i like builing up the defence and then work my way forward therefore i really really like this game sometimes it is easy to break trough but a lot of times it isnt it also depends on what difficulty i play i like how the tactical map is and how you can progress your squads i loosed some by wrong management but i now have one strong one who is helping the weaker ones that are in trouble i wished i could do more settings tot the gameplay and set different kind of resource points and the ai could be somewhat better overall i love playing this game
