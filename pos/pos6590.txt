2021 this is one of those games that surprise you i thought that i would never be interested in a game about truck driving and here i am after several years and over 200 hours in game and almost the same in american truck simulator this is a great relaxing game and if you invest in a good steering wheel it s even more revarding over the years scs software added a lot of new contenct both a free updates and also as paid dlc s and the game is still in development a wide range of countries cities and trucks makes it a great game for truck fans and gamers searching for a relaxing title i usualy listen to podcasts or audiobooks while driving and it works really well
