2017 ghandi has completed the manhattan project still run for your life a good strategy game but not as good as civ 5the good tons of civilizations can have a wider empire mods do not disable achievements yes i like razing cities fasterthe bad missing the ability to brine the ai the ai actually builds wonders on lower difficulty not a fan of the district systemthe bad dlc cash grabs 50 bucks for the new dlc and no discount are you serious yes i know developers you have bills to pay and families to feed however why is there no discount for people who own the base game the discount is only available for people who are buying everything newin my honest opinion better to civ 5 and wait for a better bundle for civ 6or you can buy endless legend i guess
