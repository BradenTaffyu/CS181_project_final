2023 haven t even finished this game yet and it s one of the best immersive rpgs of all time enough said don t know if the dlcs are the same quality but the base game is certainly worth your time my only complaint is that it takes a bit to get into the first couple hours can be confusing and a tad boring when going in blind just stick with it trust me
