2022 first time ive been happy to leave skidmarks for real though this game is a great game to relax and slide around an absolutely massive catalog of cars with no garage size limit the cars themselves all have fantastic amounts of customization options rivaling that of nfs underground 2 the livery system feels very reminiscent of it in fact it would be nice to see a tab in game of people uploading their car designs and allowing people to download the design to their own cars overall the tuning system is pretty good ive never been smart at tweaking cars in small ways to get huge changes until last night i finally dove in while it was very much me just moving sliders around until the car was drive able again i did eventually get a tune of my viper that made it significantly more competitive than the stock tune honestly cant say enough good about this game a decent variety of tracks and a massive list of cars with insane amounts of customization only thing is i wish the community rallied together a bit more i see tons of lobbies with just one person in it with only a few lobbies with over 8 people it would be awesome for the community to gather a bit better into a select few amount of lobbies because oh my god are the 10 16 person tandems a blast that moment when you have a clean run on kami road with over 9 people in a line is just pure magic and satisfaction
