2017 early access review after the literal scene of being born i found myself standing in the kitchen there was a note attached to the fridge door telling me mum and dad will be back once they re done their vacation in tenerife i ve been left home alone to take care of the property the same note also told me to fix up dad s old car for my own or else they would take it to the junkyard outside was the body of the car looking like it would never run and in the garage i found a lorryload of different parts which for the majority i had no idea what they do or where they go the first thought i had was something like what am i supposed to really put this all together and that somehow makes a car shrugging i set off to do it i fiddled around with everything i found trying to put them together like a jigsaw puzzle rubbing every part on each other till they finally snapped on as if glued i also realized i would have to tighten every bolt and screw to actually put the engine the frame the bits and bops together properly there were times when i was about to cry in frustration but i refused to see any tutorials or guides online on how this engine is built or how the car frame is put together i need to eat so i get into the van outside expecting it to move like in gta5 or some such i soon realized it actually handles like a real car i d have to warm the ignition coil being a diesel engine before the car would start i d have to fiddle with the gears nobs and things to switch on lights parking brake and the radio that s really neat i thought i love realistic approach on things like this in games i drove around aimlessly till i found a store the store there is no other place to buy groceries that s fine we re in a small town then a dude in a yellow tuned up vehicle starts babbling his mouth to me how rude so i flipped him off since the game lets you do that and somehow flinged his whole car high into the air killing or incapacitating him in a gore of blood when the car came crashing down i quickly made my purchases at the store before bolting off the items were neatly put into a bag for me handy i d say getting back home filled with renewed vigour and a full belly i continued to work on my car it took me several frustration filled sessions to get comfortable enough with all the controls of the game the building of the engine eating sleeping peeing finally the engine was in the car and the moment was at hand the bloody thing worked it ran i was overjoyed the satisfaction of getting that rusty little piece of to work was so amazing from there on out i slowly worked on the car some more buying new parts from the catalogue via snail mail relaxing in the sauna getting drunk on beer in moderation peeing on my face while in the shower for a quick drink to satisfy my thirst when needed and now after around 50 hours i have a car that looks good goes fast and literally has my handprint on it it s tuned up and ready to go the satisfaction of building my very own car from the scratch was literally so good that no other game has ever made me feel like this and i don t even know anything about cars in the first place the game also has survival elements in it you have several needs you need to take care of or you will die these would be hunger you need food or you ll starve eating sausages mac and cheese pizza fries with fried sausages at the bar or even smoking will take care of this thirst you got to drink too you can drink water coffee milk cartons bottles beer booze piss and probably something else as well fatigue your body tires and you ve got to sleep it off or get a good refreshing coffee to keep yourself going stress living is stressful and you ve got to relieve it somehow that s what the sauna is for sitting in the hot room and throwing water on the rocks you can also pee on them disgusting i know helps you to relax and forget about the annoyances of life chopping some firewood and smoking can also help you to relieve stress and last but not least bodily functions you ve got to take a piss every now and then why is this in the game i don t know but i m almost willing to admit that if left out it wouldn t be realistic enough in a fun way plus you can pee on people remember to squeeze out the last few droplets then there s everything else the game has to offer the game world is positively large and you can do plenty of different things if car building is not your forte i d advice you to do that though it s really satisfying even if you don t like it you can earn money in the game by doing various odd jobs such as chopping firewood and then bringing it to a guy who will gladly pay you for the trouble you can take the truck and go around the area emptying people s septic tanks remember to release the full tank on top of the yellow car dude who hangs at the store all day long or alternatively take it to the treatment plant so you won t get fined for doing so you can brew booze kilju a sugar wine type o drink and sell it to a local man who s always drunk who is also a lottery millionaire or his wife anyways this same person also will call you at nights for a pub pick up job which is the perfect opportunity to learn more about this supposed lottery winning you can go to town cruise around in your car go to the store buy food alcohol car parts other necessities such as the bug spray to keep the mosquitos away not to be mixed with flies who don t care if you spray or not swim go to sauna play cards for money fish cook fish light the fireplace punch people ride a moped pay and play a slot machine visit the pub for those delicious fries and sausages coffee smokes and booze you can take a boat to the island where your family summer cottage is located and do all of the above in there the amount of content is really great for a game that s been made largely by a single guy that s just all the fancy stuff besides the car building once you re actually done with that you need to get it inspected so you can legally drive the thing it s amazing the amount of detail in everything is astounding even and talking about driving cruising around is satisfying and every car feels different the cars feel like they handle realistically visually the game is very modest it s not very pretty if you gauge it on the graphical quality in modern standards but still somehow the game looks gorgeous the game world the nature everything it just kind of works and as a whole manages to look really good the only detailed bits are the cars really everything else is a so so but that only adds to this weird charm this game has the same goes for sounds it s nothing special but all together the game creates a very immersive soundscape that sounds realistic to me even the funny northern dialect the people in the game world have is very pleasant to listen to now a non finn won t probably get as much out of the game as a finn who has lived in the 90s 1995 to be exact would the subtitling is very simple and leaves out lots of little quirks these people have and only tells you the barebones basics of what people are actually saying or implying same goes for item translations which is supposedly taking a laugh at the rally english which to put it short means broken english macaron box being one of the best examples plus there is a whole bunch of inside jokes in practically everything in the game and a non finn would have difficulties understanding the majority of them in most cases the radio is also one big joke the game is basically a survival game with a heavy focus on car building you re actually living in the game s rendition of a 1995 s finnish small town in the middle of nowhere i ve lived in a small town like that back then this game is pretty much as realistic of a portrayal as it gets
