2017 woah this game is more than i could ever hope for i had never before this game had an interest in trucks but now i do thanks to this game and ats it s a relaxing but fun game peaceful but there are challenges you get to customize your truck to every little detail even more with dlc and steam workshop pros and cons huge map you can expand it even more with scandinavia vive la france and going east dlc which are all worth it soon italia dlc too don t be afraid to throw money at scs for more content they deserve it customizations there are many brands of trucks in this game and so many things you can tweak down to the square inch with your truck wheels rims decorations dlc like the hanging dice bull bar top light bar horns engines chassis etc realism road signs if you wreck there s damage unlike original ets realistic landscapes etc challenge the game is quite peaceful but there are many challenges you have to deal with fuel stops damage to your truck other cars sometimes the ai doesn t pay attention or if you get truckersmp multiplayer third party you have to deal with the many drivers that are real people and the major lag the only thing i could possibly say is a con is that scs didn t implement multiplayer i thank the good people at truckersmp for doing that it makes the game more exciting to play but is sometimes less realistic as there aren t many cars mainly trucks and there are more bad drivers
