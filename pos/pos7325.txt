2019 not sure why i like ets2 or this game so much it is very relaxing most of the time though the ai has it s moments where it becomes frustrating it s not the most accurate sim or fair either if you have detours on you have more exits and roads in real life and in ets2 while this game has fewer options but it is still fun and you can turn off detours i play with a steam controller so i am missing a lot of buttons like drop axle and retarder and whatnot i have them set to auto i still have functions like shifting parking brake diff lock the more fun or important things to have bound and that s what it s about fun you can customize and turn off a lot of things you never have to park a trailer yourself if you don t want to turn off traffic offenses rain detours etc devs are constantly working on content to add though work is slow due to licensing and the quality only real complaint is how the torque hp works in this game they severely underestimate how much pulling power these trucks have i have my transmission selected properly for towing heavy loads but there are times you have to slow to a crawl on a main highway like 25mph or slower and downshift constantly to avoid stalling with a 2150ft lb torque engine even if you stay at the rpm where the peak torque is supposedly doesn t help at all
