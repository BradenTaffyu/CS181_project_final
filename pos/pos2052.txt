2020 finally available on steam i have sunk hundreds of hours in the game been playing since 2015 and i can only recommend it it has a bit for everyone great storytelling pvp and pve content which is both free and paid if you subscribe once you get all the expansions that you can play later even if you don t resubscribe combat is fun and engaging and also easy to get into there is also a lot to explore and to find collect datacrons etc i also love the artstyle of the game it is really beautiful and immersive the soundtrack is also pretty dope
