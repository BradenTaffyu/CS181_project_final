2018 i start a new farm and before i realize it i ve been playing for 4 hours straight and don t feel like i wasted my time i ve never been a huge fan of these types of games but stardew valley is so addicting and fun and i fell in love with it if there s even a con i guess it would be that concernedape is making this solo so updates are slow however i heard that should be changing soon with the hiring of a team to work on the game fingers crossed 10 10 farming addiction
