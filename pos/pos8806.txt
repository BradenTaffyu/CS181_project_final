2016 185 hours and 3 full campaigns in and i finally feels like i can review stellaris objectively stellaris is a 4x grand strategy game from paradox so i kind of expected a civilization in space kind of game like galactic civilization 3 which isn t a bad thing since i love 4x games but what i got was something different a 4x grand strategy customizable nearly open ended rpg and that is where this game sets itself apart from all others in the 4x field campaign 1 since everything was new i tried to chose things familiar humans warp drive materialist individualist etc while i found myself at odds with the influence and sector mechanics i was able to build a nice little empire with several allies in a federation eventually building myself up to a real economic and military power with the help of my federation friends we were able to stop aggressive neighbors over throw a fallen empire and beat back interdimensional invaders more than once i found myself wishing for more victory conditions and when i started feeling like it was getting a little stale i pumped out a crap ton of colony ships to meet the domination victory condition owning 40 of habitable planets all in all a good run campaign 2 within 5 years i had encountered a fallen empire and they hated me from the beginning instantly declaring war which i immediately had to surrender a couple of years later i met another fallen empire and they hated me i was playing peaceful scientist cat people maybe everyone was allergic because everyone even regular empires kept insulting me threatening me and declaring war on me until i was finally curb stomped into a chunky red paste what did i learn from my violent and abusive loss better influence and sector management techniques campaign 3 military dictatorship using wormhole generators to move what a difference a little experience makes never once during this campaign did i find myself struggling with the influence mechanic and working with the oddities of the sector mechanic have become rather easy fallen empires treat me as a child in need of patience enemies avoided my vast fleets and my economic power was unmatched when one of my rivals triggered a galactic wide robot uprising all i needed to do was put all my robot populations to death and outlaw ai easy peasy later when i stumbled across the robot capital world i invaded with a genetically engineered xeno army killed all the robots and had a beautiful gaia world all to myself of course i had no friends allies trading partners or anything else sadly i started getting a little bored so i again jumped to a domination victory currently stellaris is the tale of three games early game brilliantly fun and engaging lots of events that change depending on your pre game choices lots of 4x fun and lots of role playing make the early game really enjoyable and re playable mid game lots of repetitive management is required with not a lot of new game content occurring being a warmonger can certainly spice this part up but that may not be everyone s cup of tea late game some very interesting galaxy wide events disasters occur and the rise and fall of some of your neighbors keeps some interest however the lack of more victory conditions does make things drag a bit overall i love love this game does it need more victory conditions yes does it need more mid game events yes does it need better tool tips yes are wormhole generators the greatest thing ever yes one final thing to keep in mind is that the clarke patch is about to release which will fix a lot of the sector issues and questionable ai decisions and the future asimov patch will address the mid game issues which means that things are going to keep getting better so i highly recommend this game to everyone edited to add wow the clarke patch hit and what a change midway through my fourth campaign and suddenly after load the sectors started actually producing science costs reduced slightly fighter and bomber groups became wildly effective federation partners began fighting their own battles a bit other empires asked for and offered safe passage through their space diplomatic requests began to pour in enemy ai combat decisions became much smarter and all the frontier outposts i had been hiding in sectors to avoid influence costs grabbed me by the scruff of the neck bent me over a log and yelled squeal like a pig what a massive improvement the future asimov patch is still needed for mid game content but if you were waiting to buy stellaris well wait no more it is even better now
