2016 more than just farming i ve never played harvest moon or any other of that type of game so i can t tell you how this one compares here s a quick breakdown of the types of things you can do farming 3 seasons each 28 days long crops take different amounts of time to harvest make wine beer maple syrup pine tar preserves pickled vegetables ranching chickens cows sheep horses slimes foraging each season has specific items to find in the wild berries roots ets mining delve deep in the mine to find ores gems and monsters to fight fishing and crab pot difficult to do at first but lots of different fish to catch depending on location and time of day crafting level up get blueprints make thing like bee houses furnace tapper preserves jar charcoal kiln and more cooking upgrade your house to have a kitchen get recipes cook all kinds of stuff socialize meet the villagers give gifts to make them like you 5 10 candidates for marriage depending on if gay is ok family expand your house get married have kids wal mart er i mean joja mart embrace corporate business models or support local small business prices cheaper at joja rebuild the community center little spirit things want you to rebuild the abandoned community center by bringing one of each type of certain things to form bundles also it unlocks things later on i think and you get free goodies for doing it but if you side with joja mart they will tear it down to build a warehouse mini quests check the postings outside the town store for reqeuests villagers have like fetch me a radish or kill 6 slimes in the mines etc you get gold for these and the villagers will like you more 2 day time limit though oh and you get either a dog or cat but they don t anything productive just wander around and sleep now that you know what you can do i ll tell you what you have to do which is nothing no time limit no pressure well sure you should grow crops in the beginning so you have money but you don t have to socialize and marry if you don t want to you don t have to forage or fish or mine do whatever you want whenever you want though you don t get all the blueprints of everything you can bulid until you level up to certain levels it s not like terraria where you can build whatever as long as you have the materials you could have the materials but not the blueprint yet so you can t craft it i think the key addicting thing about this game is the save point it only saves at night while your character sleeps you can t save whenever you want which is good if a day is going badly just back out and start that day over but bad for getting sleep in real life oh i ll just take a peek outside my house and see how my crops are doing and i end up playing another day and then another the time of day moves quickly it takes a hour just for me to run down to the beach looking for stuff that washed up then over to the little plank bridge area for those pink things and back to town shops close at 4 or 5pm so it s a race to get where you want and still forage along the way if you stay up past 1am you faint and lose some money or items or something i try not to have that happen the artwork is very detailed check out the inside of some of the houses posters on the kid s walls different furniture and wallpaper in the living room trees plants flowers are beautiful in all seasons music is pleasant but does not distract honestly i don t hear it much of the time because i m concentrating on what i m doing price is right you get a lot for your money the replayability is huge choose this girl to marry this time choose a different one in another playthrough or be single choose to rebuild the community center in one playthrough go the joja route in another highly recommended there s something for everyone in this game unless you hate 2d games to begin with parental warning so far there s only been one questionable thing if you want your kids to play there is a slight reference to someone having an affair with a married person you re asked to find something and that item is in another person s room oh gee how did that get there so far that s the only thing other than the gay thing that parents might be leery of for their young children to play this game addendum over 200 hours into this game now feels like 50 i swear this isn t a game at all it s actually a space time bubble trap built into the game to make time in the real world move faster so you think you ve only been playing for a little while but actually it s been hours and you realize your throat is parched because you ran out of drink and couldn t tear yourself away from the game to get a refill and also you realize you re about to pee your pants this game is the first thing i think of when i wake up before i even get out of bed i m going over a mental checklist of things to do even worse i get confused about what day it is in real life and even what month what season i see things in real life that remind me of the game like a patch of tall grass and i m like oooh i gotta switch to my scythe and cut that stuff down then a second later oh wait that s in the game and i m in real life or on friday i think i gotta visit the travelling merchant some time today and then oh wait that s in the game bottom line tl dr version run don t walk run away as fast as you can before you too get sucked in and it s too late a black hole s got nothing on this game and now there s more content will the madness ever end will i ever see trees and grass and houses and farm animals in real life again oh the humanity
