2023 this game is no different to all other games people will like it or they won t this game like all games has it s fare share of bugs that are very annoying if your trying to get 100 or for those who can t even get the game to launch i ve done two play throughs gryffindor and hufflepuff i could not quite finish everything on gryffindor but 100 on hufflepuff i thank the devs for having fast travel as without them the game would have been so boring to the point of giving it away i m playing on a 1080 monitor so i was handicapped not being able to view the scenery to its fullest i personally enjoyed the game with all it s quests side missions and puzzles which weren t overly hard at all i hope the dev s can fix the issues that other gamers are having as they want to finish the game as well would i give this game 10 10 no as no game can achieve this but i will give it an 8 room for improvementsedit i ve done one more play through and couldn t finish it due to bugs in the game the demiguise moon quest cant be finished like my gryffindor play through this game has become a nightmare for alot of players with constant crashing and numerous bugs of all descriptions warner bros need to do a lot more to getting these bugs fixed instead of bringing out an update every six months perhaps some hotfixes or workable work arounds they need to fix all the issues to stop the game spiralling sideways and crashing
