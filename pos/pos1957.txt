2021 honestly the hate for this game is due to the fact that it does not auto connect your account to there system so if you buy a subscription or anything it does not go to your account now for the actually review of the game this game i can explain as simply as a better version of wow world of warcraft for those who are looking for more of a interactive story than a addiction grind now i will explain my reasons for this explanation first off instead of what wow does with every quest being given to you through a text box the majority of quest in this game are given through interactive cut scenes which adds more flavor to each quest than just clicking accept and hearing a pleasing sound when you turn in quest second all cut scenes are fully voice acted even your own character has a voice which is a double edge sword since looking at fallout 4 had the same but the fact that all npc you interact with have a full voice line then just a hello there or good day to you or for the horde makes it feel more immersive than wow third all the expansions can be accessed with just a subscription now to explain wow requires that if you want to play the newest released expansion you must buy it which can cost around 40 120 depending on extra content you of a edition you want where swtor when a new expansion comes out all you need is the subscription to play it now there are pre order stuff you can get for the expansion of swtor ive seen in game but never bluntly oh hey you want to play the new content then pay for the game all over again on top of your subscription fourth balance to explain i feel after playing all the classes in the game both in this and wow this game has far better balance between classes than wow does in wow some classes are nerfed to infinite and some are just broken in this game however i don t see anything like that happening now to admit i have not played pvp so i don t know there but that s just cause wow ruined me to pvp in mmo s cause i got stuck always trying to mid max skills which then makes allot of the variety not fun anymore hope your eyes are open to how this game is so much better than wow in mmo respects leave a like to the review would be awesome since i really just want to help people see good games when they come by and stop wasting there time and money on mediocre games i love wow but dam this game does things way better
