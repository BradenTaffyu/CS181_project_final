2020 a great mil sim for those looking for realistic military operations in a grounded setting i was originally put off of this game and arma 2 by their in depth systems and not really grasping what to do in the missions or eden editor i recently decided to put more time in and learn these different systems and i m having a blast now this game takes a small amount of dedication to learn but your time will be well spent if you re a military enthusiast looking for a realistic shooter most of my time has been spent in eden using light mods and vanilla game assets but the modding scene is just one more reason to join arma 3 today be it ww2 ww1 warhammer star wars or modern day weapons or maps the list goes on and on if you re looking for a multiplayer experience there are many different modes and servers such as life koth death match ect the only negative thing i have to say about the game is that some of the vanilla vehicles are locked as dlc but you can easily get all of them and the base game during one of the many steam sales in conclusion buy this game
