2023 my name is walter hartwell white i live at 308 negra arroyo lane albuquerque new mexico 87104 this is my confession if you re watching this tape i m probably dead murdered by my brother in law hank schrader hank has been building a meth empire for over a year now and using me as his chemist shortly after my 50th birthday hank came to me with a rather shocking proposition he asked that i use my chemistry knowledge to cook methamphetamine which he would then sell using his connections in the drug world connections that he made through his career with the dea i was astounded i i always thought that hank was a very moral man and i was thrown confused but i was also particularly vulnerable at the time something he knew and took advantage of i was reeling from a cancer diagnosis that was poised to bankrupt my family hank took me on a ride along and showed me just how much money even a small meth operation could make and i was weak i didn t want my family to go into financial ruin so i agreed every day i think back at that moment with regret i quickly realized that i was in way over my head and hank had a partner a man named gustavo fring a businessman hank essentially sold me into servitude to this man and when i tried to quit fring threatened my family i didn t know where to turn eventually hank and fring had a falling out from what i can gather hank was always pushing for a greater share of the business to which fring flatly refused to give him and things escalated fring was able to arrange uh i guess i guess you call it a hit on my brother in law and failed but hank was seriously injured and i wound up paying his medical bills which amounted to a little over 177 000 upon recovery hank was bent on revenge working with a man named hector salamanca he plotted to kill fring and did so in fact the bomb that he used was built by me and he gave me no option in it i have often contemplated suicide but i m a coward i wanted to go to the police but i was frightened hank had risen in the ranks to become the head of the albuquerque dea and about that time to keep me in line he took my children from me for 3 months he kept them my wife who up until that point had no idea of my criminal activities was horrified to learn what i had done why hank had taken our children we were scared i was in hell i hated myself for what i had brought upon my family recently i tried once again to quit to end this nightmare and in response he gave me this i can t take this anymore i live in fear every day that hank will kill me or worse hurt my family i all i could think to do was to make this video in hope that the world will finally see this man for what he really is
