2020 early access review i do recommend playing it if you played and loved previous m b games i m enjoying this one a lot just like m b w it has the grounds to be a 10 10 experience but dont rush into bannerlord yet if you re new to the m b games i would wait i ve got many issues that i would like to see fixed and worked on and i do believe they will by the time its out of early access hideout battles system is so annoyingly stupid you go into a battle against 35 bandits with a fraction of your army less than 10 i believe it makes it impossible to win even if you have tier 6 troops fix this in game i had to download a mod just to take 50 soldiers with me in game event log it was in the previous m b w my only chance to know what happened is to read the notifications as they appear once they re gone i cant possibly know the events that happened before i got a fief that i had no idea that i got relationships and interactions the interaction system seems good but incomplete there s the i have a question option but there are no questions available going to a tavern and asking the keeper about anything is useless as they know nothing interacting with your own townsmen is anti climatic because they dont acknowledge that you re the lord of the fief notables still ask you who you are like you re a common scum relationships are weird but understandable mostly giving gifts is useless because it wont increase your relationship with a lord also i cant seem to find a log of what affected my relationship with a lord previously all of a sudden i m an enemy of the king and i had know idea what happened to cause that also i want more options to raise my relationship with companions sieges its too easy man i remember in warband planning sieges took a lot of effort and planning you had to weigh the losses and gains but this one felt easy garrisoned units are always less than 150 troops which makes it easy to take i know its tied to food consumption but it should be noted that within my first year in game the kingdom i m in northern empire eliminated 3 empires to a point where i m not helping other lords in battles because i dont want to make it easier than it already is companions as happy as i m with appointing companions to do various tasks and creating new parties and letting them help me with notables missions the parties feel empty i cant appoint them to do specific things just like warband i want to be able to order a party to patrol a certain area raid a village or to garrison somewhere i m only limited to give them troops or tell them to join my army smithing this is the most difficult and vaguest system in the game when i first heard about it i exploded with excitement because i love customizing to death the smithy stamina makes it way too hard to accomplish anything that i had to install the infinite smithy stamina mod i dont know what unlocks a certain piece of equipment its a huge waste of time and resources just because i want to create my own unique weapon performance i do consider my pc as a mid to high end machine yes my cpu is old but my gpu is gtx1080 it lags it freezes i cant understand once i go into a 600 soldiers battle so i reduced battle size a lot just so i can play normally loading screens takes ages to load and they re everywhere i dont want to go into a loading screen everytime i want to kill a band of 7 looters or bandits or i want to talk to a village notable there are many notes and issues but this is what i remember now even with all of these issues i m still enjoying it after i m done with my first campaign i plan on returning a few months later to see what s new and what go fixed good luck to the developers i appreciate how hard you work and i love the daily patches you re pushing it shows how much you guys care
