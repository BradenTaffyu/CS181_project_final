2021 why is this game cool someone will say that the graphics in this game worked weakly yes you are right but there is nothing more important in the game especially in such a game as an american truck simulator where it is insanely important to convey the us atmosphere in independence from that big city you drive or small towns of course for greater pleasures from the game i would recommend buying dlcs since thanks to them you can feel the atmosphere of more diverse states for peace calm and excellent atmosphere 10 10 thanks
