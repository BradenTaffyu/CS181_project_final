2019 despite the eula shenanigans the expensive price and with the addition of both expansions this is now a truly epic 4x experience i must admit i initially had a pirated copy but once the gold edition and gathering storm went on sale i paid up because the game is now as it should be fleshed out with dozens of leaders to choose from and jam packed full of features coming from civ v i despised the graphics at first but they have grown on me massively particularly with a mod that replicates v s colour scheme it s actually a beautiful game and the unit animations are pretty cool too the wonders districts buildings are all incredibly detailed and city planning has never been more intricate made more so by the district system seeing your cities sprawl as they tend to do in real life and the effect of the day night cycle on your cities at times i just flick the mouse around gazing at how it all looks but back to the district system this is the pi ce de r sistance of this release and i had in the past envisioned a system like as being the most realistic organic and logical way to develop cities rather than just on one tile to see it come to life in civ vi is spectacular and the way all of the mechanics of the game blend together make it in my opinion the most complex in the good way and detailed release in the series you have to consider each district building tech civic era progression etc so carefully and balance each choice with how it affects all of the other components of the game it s like the most advanced game of chess you could ever play and my postgrad degree is going down the toilet as a result although i am ultimately a neophyte when it comes to winning a game my main focus is building cities and optimising every aspect of its growth this therefore demonstrates that the game is suited to different playstyles those in the forums who power through on deity chasing specific victory conditions or players like me who assess their geography leader style and go from there i think the ai has improved a bit from release it s not perfect but it may not ever be so many aspects of human history culture technology religion money military diplomacy geography etc are all present and it s all so well thought out that you will be thinking five ten twenty turns ahead about the ramifications of each decision you make whichever style of play you choose you should be able to develop strategies and pursue your aims utilising your environment and leader s abilities it truly is epic and while expensive at full price mos def worth it on sale the latest jun 19 update made further improvements and the idea that firaxis is continuing to listen to players and implement changes is another plus update aug 20 the improvements have kept on coming and firaxis has gone from strength to strength in short i hope civ v players who were sceptical at first give it another look the graphics should grow on you but more importantly because the way the game s systems are intertwined is so complex yet logical civ v was like this too but vi s systems seem more logical and are next level because of the district system
