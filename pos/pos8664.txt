2018 first review eva yay 300 hours into the game i m still enjoying it like the first hour more so actually since my skills and perks have increased my level increased and i have nearly all weapons and ammo as others mentioned the graphics are amazing sure few little quirks here and there but imo it s 95 perfect related to the sheer size of the two base maps and one dlc often i just wander around and take pictures of the pretty sights it looks real enough that you ll look both ways before you cross a street wildlife is great presents a nice challenge during the day night yes some animals are getting stuck in the bushes rocks but again i think it s 95 perfect developers update the game constantly and try to fix problems even fixing the exploits some have put on youtube smiff but who wants to slaughter 30 animials in five minutes anyway bores and european bison roam in larger groups but they will often attack you back stumbled on a gathering of 14 bores and it didn t end well for eight of them and for me getting run over thank you medikit if you want to start hunt bunnies in layton easy fun game to hunt and gets you money do the missions good money and xp for sometimes easy tasks other missions will age you and your hair will get grey explore the lookouts unlock the basecamps and have fun hunting doing so atv s can be a quick way to get from a to b but are noisy and will scare away every animal nearby you could be sneaky and sorta try to push them into one area and then hunt them all down but is it fun up to you speaking of fun if you like to run around like in cod or other fps and expect to kill 50 animals in five mintes forget it this game repuires patience and sneaking up skills that can take some time
