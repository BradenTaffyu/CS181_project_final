2017 i decided to play more than just 1 hour to actually get a sense of what the game is like and not just throw a random review out there spoiler free edit proposal purchase immediately so with that out of the way please note that i ve never player any of the previous games this is purely my opinion about this one graphiclet s start with the most obvious one here for me the game looks great the artstyle the characters the city everything some of the underground scenes aren t as appealing however mostly the dark areas but that doesn t take anything away from the game i m running the game with a gtx 970 strix an intel celeron g1840 as well as 16 gb of ram and i honestly had no fps issues ever the game did crash twice under 16 hours of playtime but it was mostly down to my slow cpu so personally i had no issues with fps what so ever although fullscreen doesn t work what so ever borderless window fixed that sorta controls gameplaythis is a tricky one first it was really hard for me to get used to the controls to a point where i kept switching between controller and keyboard and i still didn t feel exactly good with either but by now i settled with the controller steam because it s the most natural one for this type of game the game itself feels fluid and smooth the combat is hard but never unfair my one and only complain is the fact that you can t switch between your targets easily once you lock onto one though that might be just me playing too much dark souls the open world is nice but to be honest it feels a bit limited from time to time sometimes a clearly open way will have invisible walls around it forcing you to either avoid that area or go around it but overall it is a really beautiful world in it s own right the few online elements are a nice touch as well seeing where other players died before you makes the game feel a bit like dark souls where you know you re not alone others are struggling with the same part you re playing at being able to repair some of those androids to help you can sometimes turn the tides in a battle storyto get a deeper understanding you should ask someone else if you re just looking for an opinion from a casual gamer it s great i of course haven t finished it but it seems very interesting the soundtrack for me is a mix some of it i really like some of it not that much but that s just a personal opinion i m sure most people love every soundtrack the game has to offer because it is great just not my taste overall i didn t regret pre ordering go ahead and get the game for yourself it was time for a game like this to give me some hope after some obvious failures i m looking at you no man s sky
