early access review sometimes i read books for the stories usually i read them for the prose the kind of prose i like can say so much with a single sentence typically games don t scratch this particular itch i play games for the choices they offer me until i played caves of qud i thought that great prose and great choices didn t co exist this game is so meticulously and beautifully crafted to combine those two elements be ape still and muse wanderer what fantastic avenues qud opens up in my mind every word and every pixel is crafted to fire up your imagination to give you a peek into a world this world has always existed in my mind though i may not have known it was called qud the bare descriptions and glib rejoinders from npcs trigger neurons that bring me to that place unlike any other game i ve ever played there are thousands of positive reviews for this game so i don t feel the need to elaborate much more they ll tell you about the insane builds you can create they ll tell you about the crazy ways in which qud will kill you they ll tell you about how you can dream up inventive solutions to your problems it s all true but there is something else in qud that goes beyond all that some epiphanies that can t really be put into words thank you for making it and continuing to support it for free so many years later
