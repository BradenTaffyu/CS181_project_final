it s a warhammer 40k rpg by owlcat which means it s ambitious wants you to play both as a scavenger and a king and it s quite buggy it s also the first owlcat rpg i could actually finish i have a lot of complaints about this game but the important thing i ve enjoyed it and played it till the end the highpoints where high and low points while not as enjoyable never really became too irritating for me i don t think the world is a good fit for the story they re trying to tell it s all quite predictable and one note and also it s not a world where you want to spend a lot of time it s all made of misery the meat of the game the usual rpg fare is all good character progression combat conversation are all good parts like exploration and economy are limited as you re supposed to be a leader above such concerns there s a rudimentary space combat and colony management that are not very interesting i like the combat it kept me entertained at the moment there are plenty of bugs interfering with choices and consequences but even when it all works the branching variety is a little disappointing there are also some pacing issues by the end the story rushes forward very quickly and all the sidequests and space exploration are done earlier i d recommend trying it when it s all patched and done one thing you should note is this game performs worse than it looks and fsr that could help with it doesn t look good the experience on steam deck is not great
