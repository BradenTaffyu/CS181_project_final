2018 i put off buying this game for around a year cause i always thought meh a game about farming its gonne be hella repetitive and boring but i just spent almost 8 hours in one session upon buying so that was a surprise it cool cause you have quests caves to explore and kill slimes an infinite amount of animals you could buy and sellcan have a cat or a dog based on your preferences upgrading your items houses barns coops though it takes day highly addictive and now with multiplayer 10 10 cause i was proven wrong and i love this game as of now
