hands down the hardest game i ve ever played it took me over 70 hours of trial and error just to have a colony actually survive to day 100 now i have almost 30 hours into one save file and i am finally making progress absolutely would not recommend to anyone with a family or a job but a phenomenal game none the less easily makes my top 10 favorites list and i literally may never beat it
