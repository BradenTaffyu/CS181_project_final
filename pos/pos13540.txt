2020 ksp is a game where you build and launch highly realistic rockets this construction is modular so you can build up whatever you can think of the controls for building said rockets are also very intuitive the realism of ksp comes from how it s fictional universe mimics ours in every way except appearance essentially all the things that real rocket scientists have to account for you do too but instead of humans you get goofy expressive green dudes with big heads the game lets you choose if you want to have money or research be factors or not meaning the game can be enjoyable for many different kinds of people ksp has a solar system ready for you to explore full of planets moons and even a sun if the base game ever bores you you can always install some mods which can let you do things like mess with helicopters lasers or y know antimatter and warp drives to conclude my block of text i want to say that ksp 2 is currently being worked on so that is a good thing to keep in mind tl dr realistic rocket building game but with goofy green dudes instead of humans also has large modding community and a second game being is worked on
