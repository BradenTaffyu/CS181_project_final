2015 early access review i have never written a review on steam until now why because this game is so good i have to recommend this to everyone we all know most of the early access games are terrible most well known example being dayz however not this game the devs are so passionate and caring about this game if you browse the forum they respond to people who have troubles running the game smoothly multiplayer issues or anything in trouble generally devs stated the reason why this game is on early access is because they received an overwhelming response from kickstarter and decide to polish the game and bring out more content further which they did read more on what the devs said and you can see how much they have added now my comments on this game this is the perfect game for a bunch of friends to gather around at a table to chill out and have fun if people can t already do this physically irl the diversity of the game makes it suitable for any age group mods in game allows you to play any kind of games as long as you make them work mods also allows you to re visit nostalgic games in your childhood this game s simple controls allows anyone to get used to the game in no time the game has an in built decent voice chat that allows vocal interaction with other players you are not require to own the mod the room is currently using to join mods will automatically be loaded furthermore hosts can load individual items from separate mods while in a different mod hosts and promoted members can also spawn items from chests and saved items from the game you can also instantaneously upload an image from internet as a board by simply inserting the url in required place the community is mostly great most people have self discipline are well mannered however you occasionally get some trolls that do nothing constructive and are only there for ruining other people s games luckily hosts have a ban function and ability to limit players from flipping tables and drawings etc on top of that you can rewind any amount of times so you can undo if anything messed up it also autosaves so you can continue the games whenever you feel like if you ask me to rate this game i d give it 8 5 10 at this stage atm this game is fairly underrated as well as a lot of room to improve i hope this game will get out of early access very soon so more people will buy it i m looking forward to seeing this game having more people playing
