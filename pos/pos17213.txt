2023 one of the best total war games there is i would say if you like this pick up warhammer 1 any relevant dlc warhammer 1 and 2 actually unlocks content in warhammer 2 you basically get a combined map of both games and they play in warhammer 2 warhammer 2 dlcother total war games shogun 2 total war not fantasy instead its a really good historical total war shogun 2 fall of the samurai most modern total war game there is rome 1 remastered rome 2 total war atilla total war this may depend on the person for me its really tough campaigns and i enjoy that napoleon total war medieval 2 total war is another good one but its starting to show its age rome 1 total war is a bit rough on new systems same with shogun 1 medieval 1 and to a lesser extent empire total war empire is just a buggy mess but its a gem a rough gem but still a good gem anyways i love warhammer 2 i will always love this game i would avoid warhammer 3 as it doesn t bring much to the table especially with the recent behavior of the developers banning people from the total war forums for any negative critique and of course threatening to not support the games you bought from them if you don t buy their dlc only other thing i will say on this subject is this remember total war three kingdoms they dropped it without notice and the community was left stunned not angry just stunned and worried that their favorite developers who were never perfect but they made amazing games and they generally tried to be well liked just dropped support on a recent game we wondered if they were okay or if something bad had happend that was in fact some early signs that this team may have well lost their way and that s a real shame all in all i love these games and i wish the team members behind these gems are doing well i hope they find their way back to the right path fans and dev teams walking in line with each other do note the modding community is strong the community is strong the content creators that love this series are honest folks like jon from many a true nerd or legendoftotalwar are great folks to watch for good and honest opinions both of them love the series they just love the series differently and that s just fine i love them both and they are both correct in their views i think so that s my rant this game is great and 90 of the total war games before it are amazing too the ones that are not are just getting unplayable due to age or they were made unplayable by being abandoned troy and thrones of britannia are both just okay total war games as far as i know though i have not played it pharaoh is much in the same camp as the other two they are okay
