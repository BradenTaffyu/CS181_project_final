2021 overall its a great hunting game the base game is good enough on its own to give you an enjoyable experience hunting several varieties of animals i feel that some of the best content is in the dlc s i dont mind the price tag for maps are they are just a large and some of them have a truly diverse animal population the weapon packs have some items that really should have been available in the base game 22 rifle tripod stands tents and atv s are also dlc items that i feel should have been included in the base game the cost for these packs are not huge and i have bought them but they really do impact your play in a meaningful way so it is hard not feel like they were left out on purpose being a former hunter in real life i would say that the realism of it is pretty good lung shots and heart shots drop animals quickly and using the right ammo along with good aim greatly influences this a poor shot will leave you tracking this wounded animal across the map till you sneak up on it again or just give up they have a system called tru racks sumthn like that that simulates different qualities of animals so you end up with little bucks average bucks and monster bucks weight and coloration plays a part in this too in short every animal has a trophy of some kind and they are varied by what must be some sort of rng all that having been said this game can devolve into a shooting gallery were you kill everything on sight as there in no real incentive not to you get money and experience for every kill you claim and wiping out a heard of deer with your dlc m1 garand on your dlc tripod stand becomes the quickest way to bypass the grind it feels like the game starts as a hunting sim and becomes a poaching sim once you realize the progression system is going to take a long time to do ethically again this is a game i would recommend but it is just that a game
