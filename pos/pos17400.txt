2021 i have always been a fan of total war regardless of its fantasy or historical streams i love all of it but i especially love this game i was raised on stories of liu bei and his brothers and cao cao s rise since i was very young played dynasty warriors and seen the fantastical versions of these legendary characters and read up on their history all of it i loved this game is probably the best interpretation of this historical mythical period with the character designs more in line with the stories than history itself but that makes the game all to more better a part of me appreciates the historical details that the game employs but another part of my is also really appreciative of how things have been changed for game play value and quality this is one of the best total wars out there and the amount of support reworks changes and love put into this game is incredible from creative assembly from the realistic versions of the character designs from their traits and attributes to their character design and appearance all of them are really well done and detailed this game is one of my favourites and it will continue to be so highly recommend pros best diplomacy system yetbrilliant and beautiful character designsbattles are smoother than ever featuring a unique general unit grouping systemgame is so well optimised that turn times are so short that its hard not to keep goingchinese voices english subtitles make the game so much more authenticrating 10 10 this game is fantastic
