2022 do not i repeat do not purchase a subscription via steam it will not register to your account correctly and you will be hanging out with customer service unending purchase a subscription on and it will save your sanity now my review at this time i have 304 hours into this game but i played it religiously since launch so thousands of un logged hours are included this game has come a very long way since 1 0 and while i do not agree or enjoy every single feature this game has become a really great and unique approach to an mmo i have played quite a few mmos myself but out of all of them swtor is by far the most story and single player focused by far out of all of them now naturally some players are more critical of the single player focus that swtor encompasses now but i believe it is very inviting and interesting for new players and for those who want to play this game without having to endure the pvp and group filled activities like the older updates did unlike many games that emphasize story choices yet there is no true consequence to them swtor certainly capitalizes on that for every class story and in the expansions it will keep you busy but interested for countless hours
