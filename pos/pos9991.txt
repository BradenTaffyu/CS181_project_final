2016 early access review rimworld could simply be described as a mix of dwarf fortress prison architect and firefly but it is so much more than that let us go through a standard day in rimword buying a hospital computer from a caravan who decide to let their animals eat all of your crops finding out that one of the raiders in the next attack is the brother of your colonist train an army of squirrels to attack you colonist s traitor brother too many attack squirrels died so now your animal trainer colonist freaked out and went crazy and is now lighting everything on fire trigger your fire suppression system to keep your hospital from burning down fire supression foam covers your entire hospital treatment room makning everything dirty all the dirty foam gives my sick colonists infections in their legs forcing me to amputate them 10 10 would have colony of cripples again that sounds made up but crazy stuff like that actually happens remember losing is common but it can be really fun pick up this game for sure in you are interested you won t regret it
