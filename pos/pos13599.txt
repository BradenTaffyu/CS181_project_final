2018 it really is way beyond time i left some feedback on kerbal space program i dont know what to say other than i have researched more rocket science than i ever expected i needed to know and sunk more hundreds of hours into this game than i ever expected to in terms of value for money cost versus hours of entertainment i think it is my best buy ever i do now honestly feel after several hundred hours in this game that if the steward stewardess on my next interplanetary flight were to say we dont wish to alarm any passengers but is there anyone here that knows how to fly a space ship i d probably ask ok what s our periapsis do we have an apoapsis or are we on an escape trajectory and most importantly how much delta v do we have in the tanks and where are we trying to go two years ago none of that would have made any sense to me at all brilliant amazing cannot recommend it enough this game backspace backspace backspace backspace simulator is me trying to find words perro cojones its the dogs b0ll0cks 1 raised to the power of several million best value game i ve ever purchased
