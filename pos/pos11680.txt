2019 early access review 7 days is one of those games you can either play solo or with friends each offers a unique experience the game may of been in alpha for longer than some people have been in uni but that doesn t mean its bad the developers still seem to be very passionate about their game and are constantly patching the game from one alpha to the next even if it s several months between patches this game may take a while for you to learn the basics but once you master it and have your friends at your back you ll look forward to every singe horde night and wonder which one of your crazy friends will die first i d recommend creating hosting a sever for a small cluster of your friends to join and play on or put a shout out on the forums and try to join a small group on a privately hosted server either way you ll have many hours of fun and enjoyment out of this if you love the zombie survival gameplay
