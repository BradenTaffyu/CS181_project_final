2014 early access review a fantastic zombie apocalypse simulator helmed by one of the nicest and most determined developers i ve ever seen in the industry the game starts by spawning you at a random location in a massive world map filled with flesh craving zombies which you can fully customize want a shambler runner no problem the game allows you to change almost every aspect of your undead foes after which you must then search for supplies and an adequate safehouse for survival the game is very hardcore with permadeath as well as essentially an insta kill system if you get attacked by a zombie you either get bitten or scratched being scratched has a small chance of you becoming infected while being bitten is pretty much always going to infect you 95 chance i believe infection leads to a slow unavoidable death the game also has multiplayer however it lags a good deal for me to the point where it just isn t fun but i do have extremely poor internet so it probably will be a lot of fun for those with proper internet the developers are also currently working on an amazing npc system that could very much rocket this game into one of my favorites of all time it s supposed to be able to generate events that are similar to situations from the walking dead but randomly of course being early access does mean that the game has bugs it is however fairly stable from what i ve played so far but it does have a fair share of annoying bugs and issues particularly with the ui overall i can t recommend this game enough it s just amazing so far and they re planning on adding a huge amount of stuff that ll make the game even more worth the purchase if you like zombie games and extremely nice and helpful development teams and communites centered around your games then you should get this game i would recommend if you wish to research the game that you watch recent let s plays while you can read the wiki it seems to be outdated in cetain aspects and probably will remain so until the developers stop updating the game so regularly here s the wiki link this was the first review i ve ever made i also kind of suck with my paragraphs so give me a little slack panother note i had a section here where i said what things had been added since i first made this review but decided to delete it since i wasn t updating the section and i don t think that would give justice to how much stuff they actually have added into the game since this review was published
