2019 it s simply the best rpg experience for roleplaying games until the full release of bg3 this game for me was something very unique i played the other two larian games before this one and my opinion was great divinity 2 being able to transform into a dragon always made me praise developers with new approaches but dos2 my opinion is different it s one of the very few games where i could flag as perfect seriously the only flaw the game has for me would be achievement hunting and that s not a flaw by any means of the game itself about the game s features you can have a single player or co op rpg experience with the choice made you can create a unique character or using the main cast that larian gave us fane beast red prince lohse ifan sebille this is my opinion but for me and my friends we got our own chars and when i played alone i picked the ones i wanted red prince ifan lohse fane class choices view diverse and unique way to build your char i played bg3 ea in my opinion dos2 wins because of the freedom of making a hybrid class right at the start of the game as of now while on another hand bg3 subclass has a more immersive touch in how unique your class will be p s you can respec your stats and class anytime you want after prison so feel free to play around with your builds dos2 for example i made a polymorph knight it was fun but at some point in riveillon i realized i was having a hard time finishing some things so i switched to death knight warrior with basic poly skills bruh this was so good i mean in one second i was doing dps and healing in another turning enemies into chickens and when necessary flying to smash archers to a pulp let s not forget the hentai tentacles when you morph your arm and simple brutally slash enemies senseless with your base str scaling which also heals you due to being a death knight bg3 ea on the other hand made it s classes are more tradional and less diverse but the overall interaction of nps environment rpg i found it much better than dos2 so i dunno but at least for now game wise i find this a more solid unique roleplay class experience p s when i played with my friends i did a maxed summoner bruh that thing was broken af fr my impression about the maps after that you re going to have 4 chapters prison riveillon isle of champions capitol arx i think it s marvelous how you re able to bypass this in so many different ways specially it was done in a manner when you replay for achievement hunting honour mode etc you can get a fresh experience or new flavor too the best of it in my opinion is prison i missed and found so many things in the three times i redid prison chapter at least how i ve done it and found about it i counted 6 ways i guess it may have more unique endings second region you can have a variety of consequences and endings too but arx is a bit more limited in outcome but you do notice a lot of closed gaps in arx about your choices in other chapters from good to bad stuff so keep notes about some quests so you don t lose content midway hahaha xd companions this hard to talk about without losing a bit of the magic or spoilers with that in mind i ll give tips for people who care about achievement hunting slighty spoilers view which won t damage your experience fane lohse ifan have unique achievs you need to play as them to get lohse and ifan have two you can get with them as side companion also which makes fane the most solid protagonist for achievement joke lol all the others you can get theirs achievs while playing as side companions and you can only choose the max of 4 of the unique ones so you need around 3 runs at minimum to get all of it with save scumming relationship with your mates you can date each of them and if i remember correctly all of them are bi so you re free to swing the way you want very obviously but each date has a unique scene most unique one is fane fane stealing the spotlight again uh p s lohse stole my heart thought lohse song is pure fire a video of divinity original sin 2 by nightlizard this was def my fav moment in the game i felt so good friendship with your mates well this i really can t go into as much depth as i wanted to without giving away a spoiler so i ll keep it short the most unique character dialogue opinions are fane or red prince having both or either of them as companions is a unique experience that will last and enrich your story on the other hand fane s achievs conflicts with the best companion possible so you should keep that in mind p s i roleplayed as red prince thought and didn t regret being the father of dragons p s2 fane is the shrewdest companion to have while red prince is a love hate being in addition to these the others have a unique personality ifan s gentle aspect made me wonder if lohse or him were better candidates for ro sebille i think will be a soulmate for revolutionary mindset players beast hmmm i don t know he has a few points but i felt every strong point of his cast in the shadows with the others dragon age varric made me have some minimum standards for dwarves x important note the way your companions will be at the endgame depends of your choices too resolve traits ost sound design in general are great for effects pretty clean sound fx and helps build an immersive atmosphere when battling or walking around talking on market and other places there wasn t a single track i disliked some i loved so much everyday i listened to it on my phone after i bought the dlc add on for the tracks quirky bones and sing for me are my favorites p s sing for me was the song most played on my phone last year so yeah i really loved it d borislav slavov composition skills are top notch him jeremy soule and yuka kitamura def are the composers i would recommend to anyone to listen to on the go from games that is final conclusion obviously because it s a game and not a sandbox you re going to have limited approaches but with that criteria and the title in mind your choices and consequences really matter mostly from the start of the game to the end of the game isn t exactly a spoiler but depending on your moral choices the way people treat you will change some unique content dialogues and what not will be lost too endnote meant to people with villain mindset you can freely attack npcs and loot them better you can sell your gear for them kill them and get your gear back classified info only for evil doers
