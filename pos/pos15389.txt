2015 early access review great survival game especially when played with friends it s gets harder as the days go by and each season brings new diffuculties when you work as a team you have to help each other out it s fun setting up base and planning journeys to get items you need to survive the artwork is quirky the sounds are good aloy of them are quite eerie one of my most enjoyable games
