2019 the long and short of it is civ 6 is better than civ 5 in this completed state civ 6 stands above 5 and quite frankly most 4x games due to the flexibility of the game which increases replayability dramatically civ 6 does whatever it can to throw situations at you that differ campaign to campaign to spice up the flavor of a match gone are the policy trees of old from civ 5 in are policy cards that can be swapped when you learn new policies in the civic tree that compliments the science tree in every 4x game this adds an additional layer of strategy missing in 5 in civ 5 what you picked is what you were stuck with you started to go down the piety tree only to discover 2 or 3 civs were way better positioned for religion sorry you just lost all of those points the civ 6 policy cards allow you to pivot and change up your game plan while staying realistic you can t swap them whenever you want but it s often enough that you can shuffle into a new strategy if the old one is failing gathering storm adds weather and natural disasters into the mix you get a risk reward system in the early ages when settling do i settle next to a river that has flood plains signalling it has flooded before to get those sweet food yields do i settle on fertile soil near a volcano that could potentially erupt these are all welcome situations that allow me to make meaningful choices in the game gathering storm also controversially added climate change into the game it s actually insane to me that people complain that it isn t realistic because it doesn t affect the game enough real life climate change is the subject of much heated debate but the climate change in civ 6 is far more disastrous than the real life one once you and other civs start building coal factories it doesn t take long for the ice caps to melt and the temperatures to rise along with the sea levels coastal tiles become lost to the sea and permanently destroy valuable districts with no chance to rebuild them essentially climate change is in this game as if it was advised by al gore personally i think a better system would ve been just to have pollution the more you use coal and neglect policies that enforce environmentally friendly policies the more polluted your freshwater gets and the lower your food yields are in tiles affected by pollution i think this was a missed opportunity in an attempt to be woke another change of pace is the overhauled diplomatic system gone is the old civ 5 policy where city states dictated your influence in the world congress civ 6 introduces diplomatic favor this is a new form of currency that you can obtain from city states and other diplomatic means like following a promise to another civ this diplomatic favor then can be used to vote on proposals and eventually a proposal pops up end game that rewards diplomatic victory points or you can simply trade your diplomatic favor for resources gold and other goodies from other civs this system works better than the old civ v one though the proposals themselves are weaker in 6 than 5 in 5 i could actually choose the proposals if i had the votes and was hosting the world congress i could really shape the world s proposals to benefit me and over my enemies in this it s pretty passive except for a few circumstances and you cannot control the proposals what is a massive addition to 6 is the emergency system that is grouped in with the world congress is genghis khan conquering everything that breathes an emergency could trigger which will allow all civs to vote whether they want to participate in this emergency to stop genghis khan i love this system because it offers chances to team up with the ai to stop a juggernaut warring in this game is also a huge improvement over 5 warring in 5 was particularly difficult in the earlier ages before you got your catapults going in the early stages of 6 cities don t have walls yet which makes conquering them a much easier proposition this is particularly useful in taking over city states that might be serving as a buffer also you can stack units again if you research the different corps and army technologies this is a welcome addition as the end game in 5 could feature units everywhere like ants also the attack animations look better than 5 but that isn t a big deal warring is also handled differently diplomatically grievances are generated for breaking promises or declaring instant surprise wars this gives you a better handle on how the rest of the world views you you can compare grievances with another civ to clearly see who the world would favor should you go to war you can also unlock reasons to go to war as certain situations arise a civ converted one of your cities you can now declare a holy war for significantly less grievances because the war is seen as being more just it s a wonderful system that gives transparency when dealing with the other leaders civ 6 also introduced loyalty in rise and fall this can be a fairly frustrating mechanic as newly captured cities might rebel and turn into a free city and really put a damper on your conquest there are policies and governors that can assist in offsetting this best to capture that capital quickly as it can be a huge help in getting new cities under control it also serves as ameans to prevent you from settling cities far from your civilization and near other civs to attempt to steal resources that city could easily flip to the close by foreign civ the last major change from 5 that i ll cover is the districts system gone are the days of building tall cities that only take up one tile with a bunch of resources now you can create specialty districts that offer adjacency bonuses if they are near certain districts or tiles this allows you to specialize cities instead of building everything in the production list additionally you can assign governors to cities that you can level up with governor points these governors provide massive bonuses that can be exploited if you specialize properly within that city again this offers more strategic choices based on the lay of the land as opposed to just building the same production order as you would in 5 with every city with a few changes overall civ 6 is some of the most fun i have ever had with a 4x a lot of that is because this is the first 4x game i have played with friends which the game handles pretty well it seamlessly allows you to switch between a cloud game and a live multiplayer game in the same campaign i didn t want to move on from civ v i had over 150 hours in that game and really enjoyed my time with it but it s time to put 5 to rest and move on to 6 it is a superior game in almost every facet civ v will stand the test of time as a true 4x classic but it is being put to bed by 6 at full strength in 2019
