2016 early access review been playing my latest game for about 200 ingame days everything was fine then a toxic fallout came for about 2 weeks all animals died i ran out of food and all i had was 2 raider corpses ate them then fallout stopped the next day morale was low animals started to reappear and i started getting food then few days later booom siege i panicked and started deconstructing everything to build a spaceship colonists tried to mine compacted steel near the siege camp and by the time i realized they were all dead or kidnapped except for 1 man i was like ok i can handle this alone kept building the ship but the guy got crazy cause all his friends and his wife were dead he decided to start burning up the house my game died with him
