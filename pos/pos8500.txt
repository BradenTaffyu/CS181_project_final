2022 the hunter cotw is one of the most relaxing games i own it s weird to say this about a game which goal it is to kill animals but in the end it s just a game even if you don t find any animals for an hour i still enjoy wandering through the beautiful created maps and take some photos or go after some quests it just doesn t get boring for me and i like to come back to it once in a while the only thing i wish to change would be to add more animals to the already existing maps i mean a higher variety that are more map specific a lot of animals you get on one map you also get on the other map even tho they are very different locations i know a lot of animals can be actually found in more countries than one yes but they have so many special animals that are country continent specific too which would make the maps more uniqe and exciting to play like they kinda did with revontuli coast now i think it would add way more fun to the already good game experience
