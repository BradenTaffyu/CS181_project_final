i originally was going to give madden 25 a thumbs down review due to the initial performance issues however after i restarted my pc and booted up the game again all the performance issues seemingly went away it plays at a locked smooth frame rate consistently now doesn t stutter etc there s a few bugs here and there but rarely gamebreaking gameplay wise this might be the best madden in years not a high bar but still the gameplay feels very responsive realistic and smooth doesn t feel cheesy the run game feels hella good passing game feels great the boomtech and new physics makes tackling and hitsticking much more satisfying everything just feels really good and fun to play i played the 10 hour trial and decided to buy the early access at a discounted rate because i was able to tell that i d be playing this a lot and i didn t feel like waiting for release that s how much fun i was having truthfully also it s crossplay so i m going to be playing with my console friends tread lightly though this game runs just fine on my rig but as you can tell in the other steam reviews that might not be the case for you probably bad porting from ea get the 1 dollar ea play trial and see how it runs on your rig before buying
