2017 finally a grand strategy game that won t require you to watch any let s play youtube videos in order to understand the basic game features it s a really deep game but without the overwhelming complexity that plagued paradox s previous games like victoria ii and hearts of iron iii you can t find a single slider in this game which is a huge relief atleast to me stellaris got one of the best tutorials i have seen there is no tutorial mission or a 300 page manual instead you simple enable in game tutorial at the start of the game and it gives all the information you need still leaving you to figure out how to master the game space combat is rather simple when fleets engage you lose control and ai take command over your ships you can relax and watch the entertaining fighting without worrying about the most efficient playing style land combat on planets work out the same way except there is no eye candy available you can just see army icons taking damage until other party is completely wiped out while all this might not heard to be any entertaining believe me it is when all your careful planning diplomacy and armament finally pays off it s a feel like no other there are incredible amount of game mechanics in stellaris but they are far easier to learn than they are in other paradox games mechanics also works perfectly are well described and introduced with a good pace during the game i for example came across with genetic modifications when i had played stellaris for 65 hours total develop team has put great effort towards customization you can choose and name your race leaders ship designs fleets planets etc this gives great opportunity for roleplaying and play as you please you only directly control 5 10 planets and rest is government by sector ai this is a great feature that reduces late game micro management that plagues pretty much every single strategy game in some level only problem i find with secors is that you still control every single spaceport compound where you product spaceships and there is no one click button to sector spaceport this is needless micro management and could be solved by simple adding every spaceport to the outliner list almost everything else in this game like exploration via science ships are done by easy one click orders stellaris got two bigger problems at the moment first is a lack of midgame features after you have explored the galaxy and colonized every planet there might be nothing to do for a while especially if you play with a pacifistic civilization wars of aggression not allowed this partially fixed with leviathans dlc which adds midgame features still there is a chance that you won t encounter any of the leviathan s guardians in your game second problem comes with a lack of victory conditions currently you can only win by war own 40 60 with federation off all colonizable planets or to conquer all other empires i admit it s no easy task to find a victory condition besides current ones that would still keep the game challenging in my mind now is exactly the right time to get this game because at its current state you will learn the game during your first game paradox just announced their first major expansion to stellaris called utopia which without a doubt makes the game harder to approach for new gamers since it add many new features to the base game stellaris is all about the journey not the destination 10 perfect game9 excelent game best of the genre8 good game worth your time7 average game nothing really special6 bad game avoid5 painful to play completely waste of time4 failed game unpayableedited for steam awards
