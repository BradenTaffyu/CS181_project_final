early access review i understand everyone hating on dark and darker for presenting as a free to play game it is not this is a limited demo and it is 30 dollars for the real game despite this this game is incredible and more than worth a play i have 400 hours in it playing with a small sweaty player base it is multiple times better now with all the new players this game is deep really hard and so frustrating and above all else this game is so damn fun give it a shot you won t regret it
