2015 so there i was sitting in the metal death machine engineering came up with my heart racing as control are counting down from 10 not always in the correct order it was my first flight i didnt know any of these guys and just right before i stared to cry the lead pilot jeb told me i ve done this thousands of times over you ll be fine there i was sitting in this rocket then just as control reached zero the whole machine started to vibrate violently and we accelerated into the blue sky i thought wow this is amazing i m going to duna then right when the ledgendary jebadiah kerman hit the big red staging button to go to stage 8 things took a turn for the worst all of the sudden a huge bang shook the craft fire everywhere i saw my fell astronaut brethren fly through the sky from the exploded rover 2 then a few seconds after the first explosion another happend and a stray booster scraped alongside the hull only to destroy the parachute so there i was freefalling in a metal can i look over to jeb and what i see is a smiling maniac with nothing but fire and evil in his dead eyes seconds before impact with the harsh unforgiving ground i suddenly appear back at the launch pad 10 10 would revert back to launch pad again
