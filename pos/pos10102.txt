2016 pre ordered no man s skygame didn t workgot a refundbought rimworldbest thing that s ever happened to me update because my review got so much attention i feel like i should put some actual information in it not just a nms joke so rimworld is a great game if you like management in games if you like games like civilization or even rts games i feel like rimworld could be for you i ve had way more fun with it then i expected one of the best things about rimworld is even when you lose a game and basically rage quit chances are you will be thinking about playing or already playing again in like a half hour its too good you can t stay away update for version 1 1 i need to add a disclaimer to this review after the recent update there have been quite a few annoying bugs added and the game seems to be less stable also mods seem to be in flux now stuck between this new buggy version and and the old version so its not a great time to jump in also i don t know what the heck is going on with the dlc or the base game s price i m not opposed to dlc but the things i ve seen around the dlc so far kinda set off red flags i d recommend you dig into what the dlc is your self before you buy so you don t end up caught off guard just avoid the rimworld community on steam cause its extremely toxic on both sides at the moment you likely won t be able to find any useful info and asking any questions is likely to get you attacked by one of both sides its kinda a mess inside and out so while its generally still a fun game just know what you are buying before you buy it i will update the review again as soon as the next base game update bug fix drops
