2021 review from a guy who is complete newcomer to souls game dark souls 3 is technically my first ever experience with a souls like game and after completing the main campaign and defeating all the boss in the base game boy do i have things to say about this game combatthis is one of the best aspects about this game i ve always loved games with methodical combat games that give you a sense of weight in each attack and who make you think twice about outcomes of every single press of a button i was introduced to my passion for these kind of games with monster hunter world ps i know these 2 games have a lot of differences but i m not trying to compare them i m just stating an example of type of combat i like in games there is a vast variety of weapons to choose from from small and fast attacking daggers to big and heavy hitting hammers from magical staffs to magic emitting swords and thunder summoning spears its present and if you re feeling particularly daring u can even go unga bunga with bare fists or different kind of glove like weapons you also have an option to infuse weapons with different types of elements and debufs like fire frost dark lightning etc in terms of variety of weapons this game doesn t fail storythe story can be pretty straight forward or pretty deep depending on the players i think the main campaign and cutscenes and dialogues do a pretty good job at explaining the story well but if u want to take it a step further u can dig deep and find how deep the story actually is and if u feel like u can also read lore ad stuff if u will to do soo i ve read some lore and to be honest it pretty darn good if u are into magical mysterios stuff gameplayaah the gameplay here comes the fun part lemme state the obvious here first this game is hard like real haarrdd but if u play it co op it gets kinda manageable the gameplay is super fun if you re into this kinda combat it took me a little bit of tweaking the keybinds to get comfortable with the controls the game posses a pretty good challenge but the real challenge begins when u fight the abyss watchers the difficulty level go from hard to damn this game real quick but it makes the reward and the sense of winning even more satisfying imo as the game progresses u travel through a variety of environments and cities and man is this game beautiful when it tries to be the sheer beauty in the environment and the creativity gone into the types and aesthetic of the game is faccinating issues complaintsas much as i like this game it has some issues that bothered me the most annoying issue is the camera sometimes while fighting your enemies you have to fight the camera but emphasis on sometimes some people might not agree with me on this one but invaders were and still are a really annoying thing to deal with like sometimes i just want to play with my friend enjoy and play the campaign but then suddenly this invader with lord knows how many estus flask and level decides to drop and kill both of us in like a heartbeat and it can be real annoying ps invasions only happen if you are embered or the person you are playing is embered which is most likely cause the host is required to be embered to invite other players and done off the most important things to remember it does not have autosave i lost my complete agme save file because i didnt knew it overall i d say that no fear comes close to fighting a giant baby with a hand for his head with over 60k souls on you 10 10would love to give myself a close heartattack experience again
