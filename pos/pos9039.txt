2016 a romp stomp through the stars the grand strategy 4x hybrid that is a true paradox on a 2d map with mechanics that feel so 3d you ll forget you re not in space stellaris is a thrill ride in space gameplay focuses on combat exploration everything from the stats the ai uses to the strength of opposing forces in battle is transparent in the game you explore the galaxy but have to fight for control features include land armies naval ships you can build to spec pirates grand strategy grand strat is a balancing act of managing many complex features of the game at once like a waitress with arms loaded with plates but here instead of micro managing you have the unique ability to delegate whole solar systems to sector management by the ai while you concentrate on the macro management big picture dev of your empire you control the leaders scientists construction ships cs that carry out your orders simply clicking on the sun of a solar system ss while having a cs selected will present order options so that you can queue up research stations rs or mines for the whole ss for example but anytime you don t like the direction something is going you can seize control redirect 4x popular for a reason i love tbs 4x games like civ 5 where you accumulate wealth dominate the world to the tune of a victory condition while taking turns with the ai civs traditionally grand strat games leave that aside for a strictly sandbox style where you walk out on the world stage and wonder what to do 1st but stellaris is like a gateway drug into the world of grand strat you can see the basic goals of the game you know where you want to go without any hand holding gameplay the goal of the game is to wander the galaxy researching as many ss s as you can while building colonies mines or rs s on them the zone around the outside of your empire is your known world which you push outward as you explore with your ships you can t build there unless you totally explore the ss then build a frontier outpost on the star to push out the borders of your empire in any direction you outpost then it s yours you can build but you are limited by resources energy especially influence because it builds up slowly over time certain tasks like meeting leader mandates will give bonuses in influence build a decent navy of at least 2 fleets send 1 fleet with the science ship 1 with the cs zip from planet to planet laying claim just be careful not to forward settle the ai empires if you claim a star close to an ai they see this as aggression and they will destroy you before you ve had time to build a big navy cautiously take stars to either side of ai leave buffer stars until you are ready to fight meanwhile you will encounter either nasty aliens if you are a xenophobe or intriguing alien races if you have a xenophile type personality you can either fight or flee to safe planets in the early game stage of exploration colonization in the mid game you must begin to form alliances trade networks or begin waging war to take resources from other empires late game game changing special events occur winning losing unlike most grand strat games stellaris has winning conditions you can win by domination or by colonizing 40 of the habitable planets to score achievies you must select ironman mode which is really no big deal in paradox games many achievies are easily obtained without winning the game emergent story telling stellaris reminds me of xcom in the way you get to choose which research you will focus on directing your own course meanwhile event chains are unraveled through popups with story to read it gives the added romp of a great rpg by allowing you to see unexpected events unfold in a sci fi narrative that is extremely playful intriguing pros narrative is extensive soundtrack graphics art are great dlc provides enjoyable ringtones e book novel artbook feature rich fully customizable creative experiencecons tutorial an annoyance to be turned off see key mapping in options situation log sketchy outliner needs to be longer to view more info mp causes desync issues on low end machines rural satellite internet stellaris is a stellar sci fi strategy game with extreme re play value with 100 hours in the week since release the game is addictive time consuming one of the best gaming experiences in the galaxy i highly recommend it for gamers of all ages who enjoy info intensive strategy games
