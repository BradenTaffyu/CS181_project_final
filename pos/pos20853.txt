2023 a game so immersive it made you feel like you were the victim of a literal witch hunt from all the drama when it released the game i dreamed of as a kid is finally here voldemort s going to look like ghandi after i m done with this game murdered so many people all over the countryside my wife s boyfriend now calls it grand theft avada kedabra oh well their blood is on ranrok s hands it really makes you feel like a wizard given the chance i would do unholy things to professor garlic i m friends with a slytherin and i hate a weasley this game got me up accio grass broke don t buy hogwarts legacy because jkr is awful woke don t buy hogwarts legacy because it features british people been waiting to have an experience like this since playing chamber of secrets in ps1 as a kid this is basically the hp game i ve wanted since i was 10 and that was a long time ago haven t felt this way playing a game since skyrim the sense of wonder the pure giddy joy that i get with each and every new quest location the choice of which activity i want to spend my current gaming session in the views i never really get too invested in the story of a game unless it s exceptional hogwarts legacy is by far exceptional with age i didn t think i could feel like this about games anymore but hogwarts legacy has well and truly proven me wrong i really am left marveled by how good hl is it felt so easy to mess up yet everything is flawless it s truly a dream come true for hp fans i m glad the fanbase literally has a game that they deserve and can be proud of it s seriously impressive and the art design really captures the magical world i m glad we have a win the atmosphere in the game is incredible filled with affectionate detail and polished like a gem my first time playing i spent about 2 hours running around the castle exploring and i was in complete awe the game feels so nostalgic for me it s such an amazing journey and is one of the best games i ve played in a while i teared up when playing it for the first time because harry potter is so dear to my heart the opening scene mission with the thestrals showed me the care involved in making the game while simultaneously making me feel like i was on a mission with dumbledore this is one of those cases where you can see it s more a labor of love than anything else the attention to detail the amount of things that were lacking from previous experiences the original storyline that completely fits with the universe the gameplay mechanics that visibly take advantage of the potential within the world this is a game that was clearly made by hp fans who knew exactly what was lacking elsewhere the game is so great not just as a hp game but as an open world game the map is not as big as many other big open world games like valhalla but it has many interiors to explore and most of the world actually feels alive like you re actually living in the world it doesn t need to be big only interesting to explore that s the problem with ubisoft games is it s all fluff no soul while you can tell with this studio they actually like video games and wanted to make a game they themselves would enjoy it also should not be discounted how much better the game probably is because it s a single player experience without all the baggage and technical challenge of it being an mmo styled game a very wise design choice that obviously raised the ceiling for quality experience the one thing that completely baffles me about the game is how badass you feel in a fight when you play things right i would never have guessed that a teenager with a feeble wooden stick could feel just as cool to play as kratos or dante the combat animations for the player are impeccable as well as the accompanying visuals and sound effects definitely the biggest surprise was the combat and it being actually fairly challenging i also really like that the difficulties aren t just health increases and are literally just better ai with more interesting encounters in addition as a black gamer i can honestly say that this game has easily the best black customization options i ve seen in a video game it s so exhausting to be excited to play a game only to come to the character creation menu and realize they have little to no hairstyles that look like you it honestly takes some enjoyment away from my experience not being able to make my character even look like me to a meaningful degree it might not sound like a big deal to some but it s obvious the developers went out of their way to represent everyone and the care they took in adding in great looking black hair options is a big deal to me so many other franchises need a game like this star wars lord of the rings game of thrones those would all be incredible now while hogwarts legacy is a decently fun game and is lovingly cozy to just experience hogwarts i cannot forgive the devs for adding plumbing in the bathrooms we all know cannon is that witches and wizards poop on the floor overall though a really great game that i think actually lived up to the hype congrats to the dev team for embracing the concept and lore and delivering a franchise worthy experience
