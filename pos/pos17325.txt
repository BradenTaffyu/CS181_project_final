2019 before i start i would like to say this is my first total war game i also spent a significant chunk of time of my childhood growing up in china but i will leave the review in english both as a practice to my writing but also i feel like it might be interesting to portray my thoughts to people from a different culture about a game that takes place on my homeland the gameplay is addicting and captivating to strategy game fans that makes you say one more turn before bed to yourself constantly one of the very first video game i touched was starcraft 2 back in 2010 so i really enjoy the fact that there are real time combat in a turn based strategy game it feels refreshing after playing sc2 for years and hundreds hours of civilization i also really really enjoy the music there are not many tracks which is a downside but i absolutely love how they did the music here is one of my favorite piece youtube video the peasant s lullaby total war three kingdoms soundtrack views 63 144 a positive campaign theme all credit goes to richard beddow simon ravn richard birdsall and tim wynn for composing this beautiful soundtrack the music make use of several ancient chinese instrument and weaves them together into a beautiful masterpiece the overall visual is very beautiful to look at not stunning but really easy on the eyes the campaign map of china uses vibrant colors to show contrast between rivers land and trees not only is the campaign map beautiful to look at there are also peasants working on the fields soldiers patrolling the main road pandas eating bamboos and hunters hunting wild animals making the entire map feel alive small details goes a long way now let me talk about something i feel is lacking about this game the multiplayer is somewhat lacking when i play a co op match even after i signed the shared victory treaty i still can t reinforce my partner s army i have to wait till i rank up to form a coalition to be able to do so doing so makes the fact that the first half of a co op game is just minding their own business it s worse that sometimes you won t be able to see each other for a good 50 turns if you pick two factions that have distant starting locations update 11 22 2021 it s been months since ca abandoned this game a shame but my review still stands that this is a good game please note to get the 1 7 1 bug fix mod on workshop as it fixes many of the bugs that ca will never fix
