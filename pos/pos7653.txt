2017 early access review super fun after finding out about this i went on a search to find any free games that could do what this thing could do nothing then i took off the free filter and still nothing compared this game is a true simulation of physics and it does it extremely well and accurately the next best thing would be rigs of rods but even that doesn t come anywhere close to the power and freedom you have in beamng highly recommended
