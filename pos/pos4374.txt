2022 in this game you mount and then blade if you re a really sick bastard i guess you could blade and then mount you break people s legs very noice and slow you raid pillage rape and marry your cousin you know the usual feudalism stuff it s like a mix of total war and crusader kings 3 but from a first person perspective instead of god view with a combat system similar to for honor but better or like that part in skyrim where you take over castles but over and over and over again it s absolutely fantastic the melding of real time strategy with third person combat is a great mix allowing tactically inept people like myself to still have fun with the game i could say so much more but alas it s almost harvesting season 10 10
