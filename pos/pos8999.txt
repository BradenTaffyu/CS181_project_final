2021 bought it thinking it s a civilization like 4x game it turned out to be an rpg you can become a xenophobe authoritarian and use planet killer level weapons to commit genocide or you can become a xenophile democratic then form an intergalactic federation to spread your egalitarian ethics and then use your planet killer level weapons to destroy anyone who disagrees with you there are a lot of quest chains and a lot of choices to be made most of the times you end up with scenarios more interesting than scripted side quests
