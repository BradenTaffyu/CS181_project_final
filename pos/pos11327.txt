2014 early access review firstly i want to say i m really enjoying this gamesecondly i would tell what is good about it but i rather tell you a story once upon a time in a hell hole far far away there was a nameless man who could punch insanely quickly and break bushes with his fists he plopped into existence on a remote server with nothing more than his starting items and a zombie mauling his face due to server latency his journey started light heartedly he came across a body of a dismembered fellow citizen he politely inquired if the citizen would be requiring that wrench on his persons any longer the man took the gentleman s silence as a yes please good sir i cannot bear to have it in my locale any longer the man then starting using the head of the wrench to mate with the faces of walking dead it was the start of a beautiful relationship and symbiosis between two sentient objects man and wrench after some through mating with skulls the wrench began to tire the man acknowledged his silent partner s weary state and left her my lawyers say the wrench must be a she due to gender neutrality in his inventory to rest the man travelled onwards admiring the fly tippers that had plagued the lander with their rubbish tipping on public highways are there no gentlemen left anymore the man asked himself his companion would retort is she were not so tired the man after many minutes of walking the man was ambushed by 4 gentlemen all armed with firearms pointed at him the gentlemen asked in the most gentlemanly fashion want 2 help us come build a town d that man pondered for a while this could be a trap what he was more worried about is that following 4 burley white men into the bushes late at night could ruin his reputation as a stand up and decent gentlemen weighing the risks he agreed politely the 5 gentlemen travelled down the road for what seemed like many hours 20 minutes until they came across a small town partially build in the middle of a plains area for the next few days the man and his fellow gentlemen laughed sang and drank the polluted water from the river merrily and as a result were plagued by the ungentlemanly affliction of diarrhoea many days passed of incontinence and building then a large pack of ruffians assaulted the town s walls the more nimble ruffians simply vaulted over the walls in a most ungentlemanly fashion while the slower ruffians pounded on the walls and demanded an audience with us i stood upon our half built watch tower gazing at the ruffians the ungentlemanly behaviour the pounding on the walls the way they attacked us like feral beasts the way they were dressed and many of them unclothed being a gentleman i knew this could only mean one thing the french had found us the walls fell many died from being driven indoors and presumably forced to sample their heathen food i did what i could but there were too many frenchmen to repel i came down from my tower firing my rifle as fast as i could at the hordes of unwashed frenchmen i could have sworn one was wielding a baguette i was forced inside i fired my rifle with the most british and gentlemanly fury i could muster the frenchmen piled up by the door but there was too many i then barricaded myself inside buying myself only time in my last efforts i took out my tired companion i bashed and bashed and bashed the wall in front of me breaking through enough to escape on the final swing my friend broke into pieces i heard her speak to me broken on the floor be free i ran outside jumped over the fence and off to freedom then i disconnected the serious review in a nutshell 7d2d is what early access games should be it has a good range of features to keep you entertained while updates come out the devs were friendly and helped me with a fov problem i had with the game i suffer from acute simulation sickness what put me off is seeing people and curators endorse the game as like minecraft can we please get out of this trench of comparing everything to minecraft the genre is voxel world not minecraft it s like calling all fps games like cod there is much i still have to explore and it honestly is one of the best survival games i have ever played compared to a game such as dayz everyone seems rather friendly which is much better than other zombie world based games like dayz not making many comparisons for obvious reasons because not many people seem to shoot me on sight which was refreshing once you get access to guns everyone loves you totally unrelated i m sure definitely worth a pickup i can t find much wrong with it the only problems are purely cosmetic and don t break the game which is nice because every build seems to be very stable aside from the few bugs that do get fixed rapidly the only major complaint i have is that the range of melee weapons and a zombie s reach feels misleading if a reticule turned green when in range and red when out of melee range i would be happy with this but it s hard to judge range and distance espically when you are like me and you modded the fov files because you suffer from motion sickness aside from that completely worth the money nice to see someone finally did the genre justice the only warning i will give however is that this game is pretty damn taxing not on your hardware but on you 1 the ambiance will quickly start messing with your mind really good props to the sound artists and it s easy to give up because of it being too hard 2 thankfully 7d2d isn t hard just because it has to be or it feels it must be it s hard because it is and thats what counts
