2019 i ve been playing this game for the first time and i want to share the story of how i realized it s kind of amazing the last of my three original colonists a female trader named onesan died nine years after founding the colony the story of her life on the planet is what amazed me and it convinced me this game is something special it actually made me a little emotional none of what i m going to say is fake this all happened onesan arrived on the planet with her sister min a 16 year old k pop star and her best friend august a miner min died early on from injuries she took during a caravan ambush barely a year after that august bled to death from injuries she received during a very bad pirate raid on the colony onesan broke down often in the early years by year three the only person onesan knew well in the colony was her husband steel onesan and steel had gone through a very rocky courtship it took two years of awkward back and forth flirting before steel finally won her over but after three years of marriage steel was seduced by another colonist and onesan separated from him despite steel s cheating she never broke down again she couldn t afford to she was the colony s lead trader and negotiator onesan was always busy constantly on the road between her colony and the friendly one nearby during the periods when she wasn t on the road she tailored clothes for the rest of the colony steel stayed on his side of the colony working on armor and weapons for years they rarely ran into each other despite the relatively small size of the colony eventually the relationship with the neighboring colonies changed and the trade deals began to dry up after her final return trip onesan was suddenly very eager to be with her estranged husband again it seemed like all the time and distance apart helped her to forgive him in a strange cosmic coincidence steel had broken up with the other colonist while onesan had been away on her last trip they got back together and for one more year they enjoyed each other more than they ever had before on the day she died onesan was hunting near the edge of the map far away from the colony a large pack of manhunting arctic wolves entered the map almost on top of her onesan was ripped to shreds and bled to death before steel and everyone else had even left the safety of the walls as the final member of the original colonists and the colony s informal leader onesan deserved the best possible funeral a catacomb was excavated for her deep inside the nearby mountain and a solid silver sarcophagus was placed inside for her to rest in steel constructed the sarcophagus for his wife personally it was excellent quality he titled the sarcophagus shadow of onesan the description reads the sarcophagus is engraved with a picture of ryoko onesan minase practicing construction skills with visible exhaustion hundreds of cowboys watch with amazement the work seems to represent suffering the lower part of the image is dominated by a large group of shamans this representation tells the story of onesan becoming a master at construction tasks on 5th of septober 5509 you can see a screenshot i took of it here not sure why but onesan s death did not make steel upset i know she was important to him though he would leave his work at the machining bench all the time to visit her sarcophagus he d always be there for a long time staring down at it i ve been paying closer attention to him since onesan died and as far as i can tell he hasn t flirted with any of the other colonists since her death eventually i decided that steel was going to focus on leading onesan s people off the planet now he sits at the research bench every day slowly unlocking the path to the stars i like to imagine that someday when the ship is ready he will send her people off but instead of going with them he will stay behind on the planet to be with her
