2018 after 247 hours playtime and 61 achievements gathered being level 52 as well i thought time for a little comment on this game it is in one word graphically one of the most beautifull games i encountered and played the realistic sceneries and animals are awesome i got am totally hooked of course there are couple of things i do not like so much as well for example there is a little bit too much rainy wheather for my taste and i m not particullar a fan of night time hunting the latter one is game of choice as you can rest through the night for some of the missions it looks like the game knows your onto it and when one time you are overrun by a lot of bears and when the mission is to spot 3 different kind of furs you hardly can t find any lol still all is doable and eventually you ll get them there are also sometimes technical quirks as well though i m not too much bothered that sometimes some rocks or grass is a bit hoovering obve the ground when the geese dlc got released there were a lot of complaints on bugs etc i never ran into them though myself i do have to admit thusfar i didn t hunt for them either but to me they are very annoying darn those geese are making a lot of noise all the time this is probably the most negative bit on the game i can say and for that currently i m focussing onto the medved area i can recommend this game really i do i love it i m hooked on it when you can appreciate really nice graphics ever wanted to hunt without really killing animals but feel the excitement when you hear paw or hoof step coming closer you can bring in patience then this is a must buy game i wonder what kind of new animals and missions they can come up with in the future happy hunting a fan
