to be honest the beginning of the game is a bit frustrating but as you progress and learn more the better it gets yes there are some issues with the ai being concrete walls on rails and the traffic cars are basically scripted to be in your way truth is get better lol also traffic is mostly in the same places on each lap of circuits so you can plan ahead as far as the physics go imo they are better than forza horizon the cars actually feel unique the upgrades actually make a drastic difference to how that car handles and drives a lot of people are giving this game a hard time but lets be real this is a mobile game ported to pc if you have seen carx drift with where that game on pc started vs where it is now is insane this game has a ton of potential if you want a game that gives you whatever you want with no grind this is not the game for you you have to earn the things you want in this game and its a nice change from all the racing games the last few years also if you truly miss you old school midnight club need for speed vibes this game has it i find myself reliving the same energy i got as a kind driving through the city of midnight club dub edition the map is beautfil races are fun albeit once youre faster than the ai racers the features are cool car selection is awesome the game has some minor performance issues but i still run 60fps stable like 98 of the time on ultra witha 3060 r5 3600 and 32gb of ram also make sure you install on ssd to maximize performance give the carx devs time this has so much potential and is already so good imo if you dont like it go back to forza leave your negative remarks in your mind and go somewhere else legit constructive criticism is welcome negativity is not its a waste of a read and waste of your time for posting unless this game is in the same state 2 years from now then you can complain its been out for barely a week get your panties out of a bunch karen
