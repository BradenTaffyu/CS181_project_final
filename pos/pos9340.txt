2021 assetto corsa is basically a pure perfection it is one of the best racing games simulators ever made you see i am a casual gamer i play racing games with a gamepad and with all assists on and despite the fact that assetto corsa is labelled as a hardcore driving simulator in reality this is an extremely accessible game even for fans of arcade racing games like me if you like playing racing games do yourself a favor and buy assetto corsa don t bother with that abomination called project cars i had extremely high hopes for project cars series it seemed that these games had everything beautiful graphics amazing sounds plenty of tracks and cars to drive but to my disappointment cars and handling in project cars games are utter garbage physics are a complete joke every second car spins out when exiting from the corner and playing these games with the gamepad is impossible not to mention super toxic online community and tons of fanboys who defend pcars despite its horrible flaws assetto corsa doesn t have these problems physics in this game are perfect i can complete a lap on monza with lamborghini huracan gt3 or f1 car without ever spinning out when exiting a corner cars have weight they don t feel floaty they also have grip as well as responsive brakes and overall behavior assetto corsa is basically gran turismo for pc although the game features somewhat outdated graphics if you install community made mods such as csp sol and horizon the assetto corsa will look better than any other racing gaming currently available on the market and i didn t even mention mods my god this game has thousands of mods you can mod everything everything you can mod graphics weather install new cars install new tracks add new liveries add custom apps create new championships drive on free roam maps you can even install hud from initial d and drift on akagi mountain roads with toyota ae86 overall the assetto corsa is still a truly amazing game despite the fact that it s seven years old it features tons of content and is super accessible both for arcade racing drivers as well as for sim racing drivers the assetto corsa competizione is the best gt3 racing game ever made however the assetto corsa is currently a more feature rich game thanks to the amazing community which supports it i think the future of this series is bright especially since it s able to offer an incredible driving experience even if you are a complete racing noob like me
