2022 during 2013 i got this game for my xbox 360 i played this game for hours it really did help me through hard times in my life it s truly amazing that just 2 years of development can make such an incredibly detailed game with over 4 000 hours of playtime on my 360 i m still learning new things about this game but on 10 10 2021 while playing fallout new vegas on my 360 a legionary at the legate s camp shot a missile at me causing the explosion to turn my screen into a static red color game being barely visible not knowing what to do i restarted the game since that didn t work i restarted my xbox only to have an error message appear with a 3 red curves replacing the green led curves on the power button luckily this game is super re playable so instead of whining about all my lost progress i got fallout new vegas on my pc it feels like a whole new experience and i m glad i m replaying this game on new hardware with mod support because it feels way better than what i was playing on my 360 game has one of the best stories in gaming history possibly one of the best rpg mechanics and an immersive atmosphere i give this game a 10 10 there s a reason it s listed as top 10 best rpg s made don t worry i ll get my 360 repaired in the near future
