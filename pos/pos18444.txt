2020 an awesome addition to the bloons tower defense games lots of variety and fun ways to play there are new towers bloons and upgrade paths also some new features like heroes and monkey knowledge all in all it is a fantastic tower defense game but there are a few flaws that really take away from an otherwise great game 3 upgrade pathsthis is by far the most monumental change from btd5 there are now 3 different upgrade paths for each tower but you can only choose to go down 2 at a time this adds a ton of variety to planning out your towers do you want a tower that hits hard with long range or a tower that hits hard and fast you get to choose this gives you a ton more customization for each tower and is one of the reasons i keep coming back to btd6 instead of btd5 heroesthere are now hero towers that you can unlock with your monkey money you can only use one of them at a time and they level up on their own they attack the bloons and give you abilities at first i thought these were a little strange but they have since grown on me they can change the way you play the game sometimes the only thing that still bugs me about them is the voice acting some of the heroes cough quincy cough have voices that sound like your typical youtuber some are done much better like pat and adora luckily you can disable the voices if they annoy you monkey knowledgewhen you level up you gain monkey knowledge that you can use to improve your towers most of the improvements are very minor bonuses but they feel like a fun reward for playing a lot okay now on to the flaws powerups and instamonkeysthere are several powerups in btd6 like supermonkey storm and monkey boost how do you obtain these powerups you either gain them from a daily chest or buy them with monkey money now you may be thinking that s not that bad you can buy them with the ingame currency yeah but you can buy more of the ingame currency for real money so essentially you can have infinite powerups if you pay enough money it s feels unfair and very mobile game like i m willing to let this slide because you can get by without them but wait it gets worse there are also instamonkeys instamonkeys are essentially just free towers that you gain from events or buying them with real money i feel like this is crossing a line what you can just place down a tower that already has upgrades on round 1 these features makes the game essentially pay to win there shouldn t be microtransactions in a pay to play game to begin with but these type of microtransactions are the worse kind it wouldn t be as bad if they were selling tower skins i would actually be willing to buy some of those but the current microtransactions just feel like cheating luckily you can completely ignore these but they leave a bad taste in my mouth if you are willing to ignore the microtransactions then you will probably have a great time with this game good luck fighting off the bloons
