2020 i heard mixed reviews about this game and have been meaning to give it a go well it s been two days and i have been playing it none stop i absolutely love this game i love love love it lol i suffer with depression and anxiety and these past few days i have just been getting lost in this without a care in a world it s really helped me to just forget things for a while i do have some things to say that i don t like the lack of stuff like in general and i more colour palettes for items etc but i am confident that eventually they will add more with dlc etc i would love more bathroom stuff decor clutter etc better rugs curtains but hey this is coming from a day one simmer so i guess i am being picky hopefully i will get to play the garden dlc soon anyway if you re looking for a highly addictive but chilled out game then this is it
