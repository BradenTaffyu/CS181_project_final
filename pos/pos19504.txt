2013 where do i even begin with saying that this is a really stonking great game let s just start with some history fallout new vegas is the fallout 3 that should have been at least most of the elements that make their appearance in new vegas were actually of the original fallout 3 which was canceled when it was almost finished by bethesda so they could make their own 3 which wasn t as amazing as it could be in several factors and fell quite short of its numbered predecessors to say the least fallout new vegas is pretty much more of a fallout 3 than the actual bethesda fallout 3 was so calling it fallout 3 5 isn t doing it any justice whatsoever plus fallout 3 runs quite badly on the pc partly due to gfwl and apparently is even more crash happy so there is that on to the actual game it is incredebly enormous in size i bet that you easily will sink upwards of 50 hours in it at least if you just take your time and explore like me expect well over a hundered of hours of gameplay on your first run the game world feels huge with way more than enough places to discover also it has a gigantic list of quests so yeah this game is going to give you some real bang for your bucks evenmoreso with the ultimate edition which covers every piece of expansion pack dlc with it which ups the game length very reasonably and brings enough stuff to the table to make it worthwhile not only do you get to go to entirely different locations which will feel entirely different to the mojave wasteland but they all bring enough new in stuff to the table which is also useable outside the expansion pack arenas have i mentioned yet that this game has a gigantic amount of weapons seriously i cannot remember another game that has such a gigantic and varied arsenal of weapons to use true it is partially due to the expansion packs bringing a part of it to the table but even without it is bigger than fallout 3 and with the expansion packs it absolutely makes fallout 3 looks like a dwarf if you compare the two the only thing fallout 3 has weaponwise what new vegas doesn t is the rock it launcher but that is about the only thing even if it isn t graphically amazing and it is made on an extremely rickety engine gamebryo which really should be replaced next gen and is still a bit glitchy it is still really acceptable and hey graphics aren t the most important things in a game story s pretty great too it all starts off getting capped in the face by someone looking like bugsy siegel if he wasn t shot in the face yet and wasn t living in a post apocaliptic nevada las vegas you wake up a week later and decide to pay this gentleman a visit where ever he might even be to have a very stern talk with him what s more is that there are multiple big factions duking it out for power over the mojave and new vegas and it is all your choice who s gonna come out on top by what means necessary or you just decide to take it all for yourself voice acting is pretty well too mostly just don t expect the nameless npc s to say something amazing darn hear me rambling about this game and i ve probably haven t even covered a small part of it in short this is a quality game the ultimate edition is where you should go for and it is really dirt cheap during event sales like 5 bucks in the summer sale and you really should pick it up for a game of this calibre it is practically theft
