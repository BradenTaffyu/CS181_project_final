2021 i m going to be writing this review from the perspective of someone who has never played any of the other civ games really amazing game if you love the 4x strategy genre you might see some people saying that this game isn t as good as civ 5 i have never played civ 5 so i can t really speak to that but if you are new to the franchise i don t think this game will disappoint it has great graphics beautiful soundtrack and so many different scenarios you can find yourself in the game can be quite complex but after playing one or two games you can easily learn the basics throughout the game you really feel like you are building an empire you ll be able to explore the world and find unique landmasses world wonders and hostile entities there are so many decisions to be made around war alliances expansion city development world wonder building research government type etc the creators try to stay true to the actual historical background of each the civilizations the ai although they can be a bit dumb do seem to have some sort of personality with certain civilizations being more aggressive than others and having certain mannerisms the just one more turn feeling is very strong with this one would recommend buying when on sale although this game is amazing it s still very expensive especially with dlcs
