2021 american truck simulator is another production from the great scs software studio considering how they care for their players in euro truck simulator 2 it couldn t be otherwise the creators once again prove that the games they create are complete products and the support does not end when the game add on is paid for but all the time soon there should be an update of the state of california the original state that appeared with the game s premiere over 5 years ago and is still being improved and adapted to current standards both visually and technically i must admit that i do not know any game development studio that has an approach similar to scs software s policy here the player and his final satisfaction are clearly in the first place and this is the most important thing for them repeatedly updated added and extended at no cost even several years old add ons are something we do not encounter every day the basic version of the game was originally supposed to include california from the premiere and after a short time nevada due to the delays the studio decided to provide players with another addition arizona completely free of charge hence we finally have 3 quite different states to visit in addition at very attractive prices we have the opportunity to expand our game world with new additions that appear regularly each of them is prepared with increasing care so that the quality that is offered from the very first moments with the game is even higher something amazing plus what would a truck game be without these massive vehicles in the game we have a wide range of trucks from leading manufacturers to choose from originally kenworth peterbilt and volvo trucks were available in the game but with time and subsequent updates of course free updates new brands mack western star and freightliner were added so that you could move around the game world with virtually all types of trucks that actually move around the united states of course we have the option to personalize our truck by selecting technical aspects such as the engine suspension or gearbox but also its visual aspects both external and internal thanks to this we can literally feel at home in the middle of our truck another important aspect is the ability to run your own company which as we develop we can expand with new employees buying them trucks to work and thus earn for us a very interesting economic and logical mode that is a lot of fun in addition to expanding the world itself through numerous updates the numerous companies already present in the game are also expanded new ones are added extended with new goods that we can transport in addition the game regularly features seasonal events that consist in fulfilling specific goals by players from around the world e g transporting 300 000 deliveries of vaccines within a certain period of time which is a great variety and thanks to which we have the opportunity to receive nice prizes many people are surely wondering if this is something completely new or just a copy of euro truck simulator 2 transferred to american roads personally it feels completely different driving short european trucks with tight turns and roads in europe and completely different in the united states driving american beasts whose turn profile varies significantly in my opinion both productions complement each other perfectly and it is worth reaching for both summing up is it worth it yes of course the game will provide us with many hours of fun and i assure you that we will not be bored because personally i can t wait to go on tour and visit places that i have not had the opportunity to see yet i highly recommend it and see you on the route
