2014 well i bought this game on the first alpha days when it was 32 99 i really like strategy hope i wrote it right and simulator games fps games this game contains many objects and many ways to play the vanilla has no many weapons nor cars and aircrafts but there is a big but you can use the workshop on steam to use maps missions other mods to make your playing much more funny and realistic if you consider spend around 40 50 when it s on sale do that on this game of course
