2017 early access review really fun and addictive game massive replayability i ve had 2 succesful colonies so far and i can honestly say that both my experiences was unique well actually all my experiences if i count all the times i failed and i have to say losing in this game is also fun it makes a great short story my 1st succesfull colony was with casandra 1 of the 3 storytellers on basebuilder difficulty yes there s 6 difficulties which you can change anytime i played on temperate forest biome there s 8 biomes it was a nice fun colony and i wanted to build the ship which took me 13 years btw mmm i wonder if it was because most of my peolple were lazy or slowpokes i guess so i had growing season all year which was nice not too many colonists so i got really attached to them all my 2nd succesful colony was with randy on boreal forest biome also started with basebuilder difficulty till i got some defenses up and changed to some challenge randy is random he decides if he is going to give you a long happy life or kill you as fast as possible i got randy who wanted me to live a long happy life but also tried very hard to starve me to death see the problem here was that i had 27 colonists and growing season was 10 days a year so i had to make indoor farms and they use electricity but randy gave me events that made me sit without electricity most of the time like an eclipse or a solar flare and i had to make peace with the fact that i m obviously not going to be able to grow anything during winter hunting was an option but there wasn t really alot of animals during winter so i decided to put a few colonist into cryptosleep during these tough times and it kinda did the trick the raids wasn t too bad because of my many colonists it was easy so i changed the difficulty to rough and randy send me a volcanic winter taken from the wiki solar panels will not produce as much power volcanic winters also appear to significantly reduce the inflow of wildlife which can easily lead to meat shortages and famine if you don t have sufficiently large farms for your colony well we started slaughtering the colony animals this did upset a few people who happens to be bonded with the animals but we gotta do what we gotta do right finally growing season arived and randy send me a toxic fallout taken from the wiki a distant chemical fire has released a plume of poison over this entire region any person or creature not under a roof will be slowly sickened by the toxic dust settling out of the atmosphere it will last for anywhere between a few days to over a month plants will wither under the fallout this event will usually wipe out all wild animals and poses a serious danger to tamed ones unless they are restricted to an area under a roof toxic buildup which is caused by toxic fallout can cause dementia and eventually a carcinoma according to game files if it progresses far enough however the latter is treatable via a lengthy operation with the use of at least medicine or removed via a surgery if you are running low on food wait for animals to die and then butcher their corpses i still don t know how i managed to survive that but we did thanx to the many colonists in cryptosleep but what did randy do next he send me some huskies d but thats another story after the huskies i got a zzztt event this event can only occur if there is at least one battery with stored power and connected to an active power grid with a power conduit at any moment a power conduit may suffer a fault causing it to explode and expel all stored power in the attached circuit in the process the amount of stored power directly affects the size of the explosion up to a maximum of 15 squares in diameter from a total of 90 000 wd stored the explosion can damage any nearby structures items and colonists as well as catch anything flammable nearby on fire the explosion will often completely destroy the one section of power conduit where it occurred cutting off power to anything past it unless there is another path for the electricity to flow around this damage laying redundant pathways throughout your colony prevents this in addition to the explosion and fire it will completely empty all batteries attached to that circuit isolated batteries will not be discharged if this event happens at night and your colony is dependent on solar power then you may be without power until morning this could affect your crops growing in greenhouses or hydroponics basins as well as heaters and coolers that happened in my greenhouse and as my people try to put the fire out it got worse most of them burned to death others collapsed due to exhaustion till i had 1 colonist left i tried to send her to open the cryptosleep caskets but remember those huskies randy send me earlier yes well they changed into manhunters xd damn its fun to lose in this game d
