2019 i honestly believe that anyone who has given this game a bad review didn t play long enough i didn t like the game in the beginning the graphics bore me and the mechanics seemed tedious one day i was steam surfing for a game that could quench my gaming thirst and after months of not touching the game and even uninstalling it i decided to give it another try i downloaded the multiplayer mod from the workshop so my brother could join me on the reluctant adventure this time playing i decided to read the social dialogue and learn about my characters this helped me develop an idea of the story that i would be narrating after a couple of hours i became familiar with shortcuts which really improved the efficiency and enjoyment of the game my colony had a story and each individual contributed to the survival of the colony and some also contributed to its demise the events that took place left mental and physical scars on my people they developed dementia from long periods spent in one toxic summer they raised animals who although seemed a burden with how much of the food rations they were eating ended up saving the entire colony by dragging them back to safety after an intense battle with local pirates what i love about this game is there is charm and dread in the evolution of your story and the choices you feel may have been the right ones may have actually ended your game early it doesn t feel like a programmed experience once you have become involved in the game the game i dismissed and uninstalled after 0 7 hours of playtime has now become a life long favorite
