2023 love the game so far dense 40k atmosphere great character customization options and enough enemies for everyone combat and text heavy game so if you arent into reading or clicking enemies to death this maybe isnt your cup of tea had strong vibes of baldurs gate 2 and fallout2 playing this which is a big plus for me didnt encounter any meaningful or gamebreaking bugs game shut down once during my gametime of 14 h thumbs up
