2020 wanted to 100 this game before i reviewed it finished it with only two achievements left chang and 50 homes sold and to chug out the latter achievement i cleaned 22 first offices and sold them for a meager 1 2k euro profit each average time 40s first and foremost i cannot recommend this game without garden flipper nor it being purchased full price the game feels lacking with the dlc it ll feel worse when you don t have it plus it doesn t feel like a 30 dollar game if you are expecting a meme game this isn t it fam aside from a few references and tree physics if you want to clean houses adjust floorplans and overall make a house cute this is it here are the main problems i have with the game 1 bounds if you have built anything really close to a wall or another buildable object you will know what i mean some objects building minigames are impossible to finish if another object is in view be it walls hedges or buildables i lost count at 5 on how many times i had to readjust a shed because the house outer hedge pulled me out of bounds 2 consistency be it actual mechanics or perks the game falls out of line a few times with the weed detection perk garden exclusive dandelion looking weeds do not appear on the mini map with plaster you cannot use it when you select the paneling tooltip even though they use the same tool hell some couches aren t couches and desks desks 3 tablet when it comes to user interfaces that act like websites search functionality should be decent the tablet s interface is almost as bad to navigate as hot topic s website and that s saying a lot some sections are designated rooms others are fixtures you have accessories and decorations as separate tags when they should be unified the list goes on garden exclusive issues the dlc feels far too overpriced due to the fact that it feels like it should ve been in base i don t have the time to write a separate review for it so here are some poop points for it specifically 1 plant bounds some of these issues have been addressed i will say what irritates me is how low sitting bushes can t be tucked under high sitting bushes when there is clear room for them trying to place plants in a pretty way requires you to plan everything ahead of time being able to salvage a pre generated plant on the plot is a roll of a die 2 weed inconsistency this drove me mad when i had to finish the last garden e mail some weeds are actually plants whereas some plant looking things are weeds mowing through to try to find the missing weed is efficient but moot when you re trying not to destroy a pretty looking pot here are a few ways to better the game 1 mod workshop support skyrim survived this long because of it if you can t fix your issues let your community fix them plus like with skyrim the modding community will add longevity to your game 2 multi faceted tablet we need a favorites button and tab for radiators and anything else you want to reuse for search allow it to flip into room or item category mode akin to the sims and group content accordingly tag everything appropriately and allow users to see those tags and click through them let tags be searchable as well as item names 3 tags on hover i don t know if it s a thing i haven t tried but being able to know what item is already in a home on a lot and buying it for consistency s sake would be nice a lot of plants have been sold and poorly replaced because i can t find out what was once there some games opt for holding ctrl or alt and hovering over an item to see what that item is here are a few things that aren t necessary but would likely make the game more entertaining 1 tech tree now this is me being picky but imagine if you could speed up or automate building a type of item by building x amount of that item type i get tired of building the same bathtub and shower over and over again because of its many steps and bound issues that i try to circumvent you could replace the building tree with it it just seems right 2 hard soft fail states i can jump out of a 2nd story window and survive i can trash someone s house and still get payment i can sell a house in total disrepair if i d like as well it would be fun to do dumb stuff and not completely get away with it it could be a toggle so you can opt in to the suffering imagine accidentally selling something you weren t supposed to and have it be a new task tacked on or completing a task poorly and finding a present at your door to put it concisely though i enjoyed this game it got over 50 hours out of me and i ll probably still play it every now and then to relax it feels pretty incomplete and has its issues namely with framerate and optimization which i refrained from going over if you want something to mindlessly drone over for a few hours as you listen to something i d recommend it in the house garden flipper bundle on sale outside of that i wouldn t recommend it unless you wanna burn money
