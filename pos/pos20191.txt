generally i wait until fully finishing a game before posting a review however given i already have 128 hours played i wanted to go ahead and share my thoughts this game imo is amazing i am a huge fan of crpg s but i also play a bit of everything just recently i finished pillars of eternity 1 and 2 pathfinder wrath of the righteous divinity original sin 2 and bg3 all great games that being said i am having more fun with this game thus far than any of them i had heard of the warhammer universe but outside that knew nothing about it the world lore is awesome went in knowing nothing and love every second it s easy to pick up and learn the writing story characters everything has been top notch for me so far the class origin system and the amount of builds you can make is crazy you could have a party of 6 warriors whom all play and gear totally different from each other the combat is my favorite part to the point where i even enjoy doing the random events during space exploration and travel if you enjoy crpg s this is def a must buy imo i had watched early reviews and seen people mention it was buggy but out of my nearly 130 hours i have encounted none the game also runs flawlessly i am playing 1440p ultra settings everything maxed and maintain around 150 200 fps at all times using a ryzen 5800x3d rtx 4070 ti not had a single issue or crash my only gripe with the game is the ship battles not that it s bad as i do enjoy it and there is alot fo depth to it once you start leveling up your ship but i just find it s not near as good as the ground based combat imo that said the voidshape battles are few and far between so it s not a big deal i am about 75 done with chapter 2 i would guess and there are 5 in total i believe i have done literally every single piece of content thus far explored every single planet the game is massive and is def a must buy if you like warhammer crpg s or just good games in general
