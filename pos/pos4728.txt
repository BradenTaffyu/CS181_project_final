2019 war war never changes but fallout does in the case of fallout 4 not always for the better the game is big very big there s a lot to discover in the boston area and you ll be rewarded for your explorations the basic mechanics of the game are basically the same as in fallout 3 there are different factions you can join and have their own story line as well as special tasks or side missions these also affect the end of the game which is why you will have to choose a faction at a certain point there are also some npcs you can take with you and they also have their own quests the main story is interesting but has been neglected new in this part of the fallout series is the construction system settler management and equipment customization not all new features are automatically bad but some of them are just simple gimmicks and just seem out of place in a fallout the building system is rightly controversial either you love it or you hate it you can build settlements on specified building sites there are no limits to what you can build whether it is a house a palace or something completely different however each building site has a different limit on the amount of objects you can place from defenses and traps to power plants cables and tons of decorative objects everything is possible but the handling is rather clumsy and imprecise it is basically a worse version of the geck construction set with which you can create your own mods but if you get the hang of it and have fun with it you can spend countless hours without really making any progress in the game the settlers who live on your construction sites and can defend them if you provide the equipment have needs like electricity and food so you can also get dissatisfied and leave you can give them tasks or orders and even let them run various shops where you can buy almost everything customizing equipment with mods can change weapons and armor significantly this also includes the well known powerarmor which is now available in different versions and can also be found in the game world another new feature is that it now needs energy cells so you ll need to consider when and where to use it there are perks that you can level which will give you advantages in your settlement but you can have to collect and recycle almost every object in the game to get the necessary amount of material to build proper settlements and upgrade your equipment to high levels not all materials are plentiful your settlements can be attacked which can be extremely annoying if the settlement has hardly any defense and you ignore the warning because you have something better to do or just can t do you will suffer losses npcs can die and infrastructure such as power plants can be damaged graphics sound and also the editor you use to design your face are excellent you can have a lot of fun with this game with building system and settlers as well as without
