2020 early access review i literally became obsessed with this game over the course of this week i ve just completed chapter 2 and honestly raft has really exceeded my expectations in everything i would want from a game and more i m not the biggest gamer but raft is one of the few survivals game that i ve actually really enjoyed i have loved everything about the game from the story the quests expect the island where the damn birds threw rocks and the hustle to survive you know i lived for the grind for food there s just so much to do endless something i would have never expected arriving initially on a dinky raft raft has definitely made my quarantine a lot more fun this week i am so excited for ch 3 and and all future developments for this game i will be decking out my raft with potted plants in anticipation
