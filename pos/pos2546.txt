i ve been playing since launch and was free to play until literally yesterday so let me tell you this game is a work of art difficulty is fairly approachable by pm standards the visuals are excellent and gameplay is usually pretty fun once you figure out how it actually works even the gacha is fairly tame and accessible and i can t imagine it being hard to get everything you want if you buy the battlepass the only thing this game demands for you to succeed is your loyalty and dedication but the real draw as per standard is the story every proper story chapter has had better writing than the previous with even chapter one being fairly competent and chapter three being a very high bar to pass if you pay attention to the story and allow pm to immerse you in their world you will find both a breathtaking story and an immensely rich world in the form of the city if i had to offer up any warnings or anything i might not like i would say two things first don t expect to be able to pay your way to victory hard work and learning the underlying systems of the game will take you much further than anything opening up your wallet will accomplish don t expect to get farther than chapter three if you aren t willing to learn second the subject matter and themes like in all pm works can get pretty heavy i d still reccomend giving it a shot even if you struggle with those things but be aware the story voice acting music and visuals all work together to deliver some incredible emotional pummelings an easy 9 10 and the only reason it isn t a ten is because of how many experiences people who weren t in on day one like me will miss out on
