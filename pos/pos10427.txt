2021 bought acc upon release but never really got in to it my main race sim currently being iracing however with update 1 8 and the improved force feedback and tyre model i am beginning to love it still not the best experience in vr but if you have acc in your locker now would be a good time to revisit it put in the effort to get a decent safety rating and you will have some good clean online racing
