2020 if you liked other civilization games there is a good not great chance that you will like this i would have to say it s nearly the same experience as of playing civ 5 or 4 the biggest difference is how they reworked some of the machanics such as road building and diplomacy over all i have enjoyed the 300 hours i ve spent playing this and if you find yourself enjoying your first 100 hours then definitally buy the expansions
