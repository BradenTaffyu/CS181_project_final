2019 new vegas is such a genuine realistic deep world that it becomes so hard to tear yourself away from it what dude there are giant scorpions and ghouls who have adapted to radiation and live for hundreds of year there are freaking aliens what the hell are you talking about i know i know that sounds like a ridiculous thing to say that a game with such a far fetched premise could feel like it deserves to be taken so seriously but this is a world that is based mostly in logic despite it s more campy weirdness let me explain that each character settlement and area are based logically in fallout 3 people have built a bunch of walls around an unexploded nuclear weapon it s called megaton and it s the first settlement you see after leaving vault 101 have you ever asked why the hell they did that it makes no sense it s literally a bomb the water around it is irradiated if this were real life why the hell would anybody build a town there there s no logical reason for them to do so bethesda simply did it because it was a neat idea and it makes for a nifty looking town even the town s name doesn t make any sense why would you be proud enough of settling around this bomb to call your town megaton after these bombs have destroyed your entire world the logic behind the settlement completely falls apart if you think about it for more than 2 minutes usually you re so into the game that you don t consider things like this but they can begin to weight on your subconscious and your ability to suspend disbelief you stop caring so much about the setting you begin to have a bit less fun you care about the story and characters less and start treating it more like a game you begin to feel less of an emotional connection to the game eventually you set it down for good no longer interested this was my experience with fallout 3 in new vegas however each settlement and character is grounded with very realistic motivations novac is a settlement based in an old motel which people began to settle organically because it s down the road from repconn headquarters an old robotics manufacturer that although equipped with dangerous security systems features tons of old technology to salvage and trade the name of the town itself is short for no vacancy taken from the half broken sign out from in front of the derelict motel in which these people have settled every bit of this place has a reason for existing and the fact that it does makes it feel like a real place to you you take it seriously its inhabitants feel more like real humans you start to forget that you re playing a game and you become more immersed the entire game features this kind of lovingly crafted fiction the characters are no different they have real poignant histories they are funny and irritating reliable and flawed the factions are equally legitimate i particularly loved how the ncr had their bases situated in realistically feeling locations along the river the quests and side quests are so deep they give you a myriad of ways to deal with problems and they re universally well balanced and solvable by all roles stealthy sneak through quietly killing your foes on your way to your objective not combat oriented you can hack computers lockpick doors or smooth talk your way without fighting or if you re a madman go in swinging a giant hammer or blowing everyone away with a giant minigun be good or evil or something in between chaotic good go for it lawful evil equally viable the game will mold itself to you and its storytelling does not suffer no matter what role you choose for your character no matter what story you think up the game will go along with you it is fantastic at that this is one of the most brilliantly crafted and written experiences in the history of gaming it s buggy as hell so you ll want a fan made patch full of bug fixes and its graphics have aged very poorly the character are pretty poorly animated and the textures are muddy so you may want graphical mods too but aside from that if you like rpgs this is absolutely not to be missed buy the ultimate edition at full price without a second thought feel free to follow my curator page if you liked this review
