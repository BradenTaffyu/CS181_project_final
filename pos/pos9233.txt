2016 my thoughts after having just played from earth to overwhemingly defeating a fallen empire it is a good game i didn t stay up till 6am playing it for nothing the start is really well thought out and you genuinely feel like a species reaching out into the unknown the anomalies are great and the randomness of techs means you will start out differently each time i do have to agree with the mid game complaints though the problem is that sectors are in no way comparable to playing as a king with a bunch of unruly dukes to manage sectors are too simple basically you can add infinite planets to a sector and everything just works those areas become effective dead zones on the field when your empire is growing and the number of empires in the world is diminishing internal politics is what would normally offset that decrease in activity i fully expect this will be addressed in later expansions but it does feel a bit slow grinding up your ship count and having nothing internal happening to occupy you thinking of ck2 i consider the empire building and internal power struggles to be the mid game and it s something we don t have here yet some of the ship ai isn t great i had 1000 the max ships attacking and they arranged themselves into a column so only 100 could shoot at any time pretty frustrating as there was no opportunity to change it fortunately the enemy did the same but it took away from the immersion somewhat overall i think this game is a whole lot of potential built on some solid foundations it feels a bit weak in the diplomacy compared to paradox less experimental games i d also like to see better ship management maybe using a 3d or layered 2d battlefield to really resolve those collision issues end game could possibly benefit from some supertechs as i was mostly just getting 5 modifiers to research really fun though and i look forward to it getting the true paradox treatment over the next few years
