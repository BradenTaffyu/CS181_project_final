2016 early access review i should have reviewed this game ages ago i absolutely love this game it is in my opinion the best survival crafting game i have played it has a focus on realism barricades take realistic amounts of resources no building guns out of iron ingots and plants or something like that in this game updates can be slow and the game isn t yet complete but the devs always put out quality updates and do everything they can to keep in touch with the community the game has come so far and has a fairly large fanbase and a pretty great community of players and modders if you re unsure about buying an early access title don t worry here this game is stable and has plenty of content if you really really won t buy then i implore everyone whom has an interest in survival crafting games or a generally realistic survival simulator to at least keep an eye on this title
