2014 early access review this game interested me for a while before i finally bought it i have to say it s well worth the 15 bucks i spent the atmosphere is amazing when i play i usually turn off all lights and then use a headset for a full immersion experience i love the fact that you make the story as you go along i haven t played for very long but with that said i will be playing this game a ton from here on out in my last play through i lived 16 days i found a huge warehouse surrounded by loads of zombies i cleared them out for a full in game day finally when i was done i searched the warehouse the power was off by this time in the game i was stumbling around in the dark as i forgot my flashlight i went to the 2nd floor trying to find a bed or couch to sleep as i was exausted i thought i saw a door well was no door was a railing fell to first floor and got stuck behind crates with a broken leg eventually i died as i couldn t move i killed over 200 zombies secured my safehouse area gathered enough food and water to last me a month in game time and the thing that kills me is that this game is amazing 10 10
