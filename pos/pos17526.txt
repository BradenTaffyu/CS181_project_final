2016 alright where to start first off this game is a fantastic addition to the total war series after the past few duds rome 2 and attila put out by ca since shogun 2 the races feel unique interesting and powerful in their own ways there are 4 base races to choose from empire men orks vampire counts and finally the dwarfs one improvement to the series is a more in depth character build system which truly makes your characters feel unique and special with the you being able to make your general a good fighter in their own right a good behind the scenes leader and caster or focus on campaign traits and use them to quell public order issues and lower vampiric or chaos corruption on top of this system is the quest chains for the legendary lords which provide them with some of their unique gear and weapons from the tt game this gear provides interesting benefits such as improved stats better abilities and sometimes allows your lord to access a lore of magic in the case of azhag the slaughterer in my opinion the graphics are definitely a step up from what they were in attila and the gameplay is fairly fluid although the ai will have some hiccups sometimes but this isn t a huge issue now should you feel absolutely obligated to buy the dlcs short answer no while the dlc adds extra options to the base game the base game itself has enough content to keep you occupied some complaints i have seen is that some of the dlc namely the campaign packs are a tad overpriced my opinion is that they are certainly above what i expected but not unreasonable in my eyes otherwise the dlcs released so far have been solid and did add some good stuff to the game look the way i see it the game is a gem this is certainly a big improvement over the last few total war games for former warhammer fantasy players this game even with the dlc is a steal compared to the price we have had to pay for miniatures in the past from games workshop i give this game a 10 10 great base game with few complaints from me the dlcs are good but if you want to buy the campaign pack dlcs i would wait for a sale factions packs will probably be in the similar realm as what warriors of chaos is priced at 8 us if i m not mistaken which i find to be a fair price even without a sale while blood and gore 2 99 us is behind a paywall so that ca could keep the games rating down to attract a larger audience
