2015 early access review this game is absolutely fabulous i ve played it ever since it came out about 2 years ago in august the very first version was completely different to what it is now but it has evolved a heck of a lot since then and it s fantastic to see the game works fantastically and provides us with a very accurate simulation of vehicular physics as well as free objects too such as walls tires wheels etc this game doesn t have an objective yet however if you were to play it you d immediately find yourself crashing cars in numerous different ways into other cars through other cars using the ai throwing them from a cliff the list goes on the actual game itself is fantastic it looks good and it feels good the ui is friendly simple and professional it looks great and it works great it s not something which will leave you feeling confused there are lots of levels open world levels testing arenas blank spaces and hilltops plus there is an entire modding community dedicated to making new exciting terrains for us to use the terrains look great they re very well detailed and are huge you won t be cramped here vehicles are a complete masterpiece the original vehicles have a ton of detail and look incredible every single individual component in every vehicle is distinguished you can see every strut spring and shock absorber when you aim the camera at the bottom of the vehicle you will see the suspension arms and axles moving accordingly you can see the leaf springs compressing and bumping against the bump stops you can see all of this happening in a game the vehicles themselves are charismatic and each have their own unique handling characteristics from a small hatchback to a full on mid engined supercar or you can drive a dual axle tractor unit the list honestly is endless as well as mods too you won t find yourself short of vehicles to try each vehicle is individually customisable down to every last part do you want your car to only have a right door and no glass no problem do you want your box truck to have engine tuning and 4wd no problem do you want your pickup truck lowered to the ground and drifting no problem you can do it all finally the game looks incredible apparently emphasis hasn t been put on to the graphics however if this is beamng not trying then they must be able don t be put off by the game s early access title you may run in to some small bugs however their constant updates will make sure your gaming experience is fine the game can crash it can give you some painful times but they re not something that happens that often not in my experience and not in many other s either i highly recommend this game it s worth every penny
