2017 in love as i am an harvest moon fan from the first ever harvest moon on game boy i was quite curious about stardew valley i was searching a long time for a similar game but couldn t really find what i wanted i got gifted this game and fell instantly in love with it it is so colourful and cute loads of thoughtful details the characters all have a background story and depending on your actions different events happen also some very sad storys that make you think about your decisions lots of hidden unexpected things happen as well a bit of magic here and there the soundtrack is absolutely matching and lovely gives it a great atmosphere as well as the animal sounds all in all a very cute and good game loads of effort put into it and very stable running lots of mods available as well to make it a bit more as you prefer it also easily playble with controller so i often play it after work on the sofa to chill out
