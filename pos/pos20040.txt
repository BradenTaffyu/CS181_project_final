2019 i john schnatter embarked on an adventure to the mojave desert to sell pizza and garlic sticks but instead found something much greater after running around for 5 hours i came across a town with a kind elderly woman who gave me a room to sleep and food on the table i then proceeded to lead her out for a stroll one night and had her head blown to bits for selling a woman to slave traders and leaving a man broken and without a wife so yea i m gonna have to give this a 10 10 honestly
