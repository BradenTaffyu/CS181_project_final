2023 early access review to be honest if you just crank the xp and loot gains up and at the same time max out the zombie threat and limit the cheese bases it suddenly becomes an epic exploration and fight game invading points of interest with a team and running bloodmoons at random places you find i e carl s cars and collision center are good ones a it s a ton of fun and not about the grind anymore don t get me wrong the base building stuff and solo play can be fun in it s own way but it s the exploration with the jump scare combat or fighting hordes with friends that s where it s at imho well that s my 2 cents anyways i know some people like survival grind but honestly my time to play with friends is limited so time to fight the undead horde with friends hopefully well all survive this time
