2014 early access review youtube video i can hear them let s play 7 days to die badly day 1 views 1 564 apologies for the quality of the visuals in this i m still having serious problems recording it in a way which doesn t end up mashed watch it in a tiny screen perhaps i m going to recommend this on the basis that i have just sat in a poorly lit attic absolutely scared out of my wits praying that the door i had made would hold and the zombies would leave me alone knowing that in the morning i had to go back out there and find food and some kind of cure for the disease i caught drinking dirty water because i had nothing else yikes you should however be aware that things are getting slightly buggy it s so good you ll forget it s alpha and my god is it alpha mind you the zombie breakdance of death is almost enough to make up for that
