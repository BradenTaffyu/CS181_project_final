2020 early access review wait 10 more years for final release to truly enjoy this grand game the reason to buy for me was not so much to play it now but to learn to mod it and enjoy it later with some fine full conversion mods it s an investment in the future really the gameplay is a mixed bag atm the goodthe main game loop feels pretty polished and satisfying combat is great challenging a bit better than in warband smithing is an amazing crafting minigame and one of the best new features of bl you smelt refine discover new parts and explore new unique weapon combinations as you make your own gorgeous weapons make some of the best most beautiful weapons yourself and use them to chop chop smash smash thanks for that bl the ui now allows for easy micromanagement significant quality of life improvements here the not goodthe whole game is vanilla rough unbalanced some mechanics don t work yet or work poorly like don t try to get your brother married it won t work don t get married don t save your brother you can but you might not be able to access their inventories main quest can be impossible to complete you can only complete as vassal the game doesn t know you are an independent faction when you are in fact an independent faction troop trees are rough and basic and copy paste vanilla values uninteresting to explore characters can be missing impossible to find stuck in some castle while in fact are not in that castle the game points to location a when in fact you can find them in location b somewhere probably near location a or not characters can sometimes be teleporting around like nonsense smithing which i like a lot is beyond op and completely crazy broken mild spoilers at least for now until they fix their sht you can smith 2 handed swords level up smithing like crazy sell dozens to kings at half price or so and make easy millions or buy the best gear in game and hundreds of horses by trading just 1 2 swords while workshops are very hard to figure out make very little and most will not make any money at all as in zero kingdom features are broken or questionable like clans which are now your vassals they are a mess instead of getting auto offers from ai clans are hard to get easy to lose and unfairly destroy relations this makes kingdom almost impossible peace offers from the ai will not happen but you can buy peace with money and since money is not an issue atm it s just silly parties are poorly maintained ai armies that you pay for they do not auto recruit but will get themselves captured and will waste valuable troops sieges have various issues like 1 guy unreachable forever will make you fail the siege troops management is a mess broken walls could be more like messy bottlenecks but sometimes are simply turning a siege into a field battle aka not much sieging gameplay if you simply break walls opening gates from the inside is tough but when it works it s silly and op i also had a few crashes after sieges most castles are not yet in game there are just a few and a ton of copy paste so not much interest in sieging the same castle again and again xp seems pretty broken it s extremely easy to get to around lvl 13 15ish and then pfff xp requirements for companions are simply broken they will not lvl up not this century at least you finish the game and they are still 1 2 lvls away from where they started executions are a questionable feature that simply splits the game in either you do it play a quicker much simpler and more repetitive game make a ton of enemies potentially ruin your character ruin diplomacy be forced to go down the genocide path and bypass any reason to siege or make a kingdom or not do it play the long game of building good relations with the nobility but miss all the murdering fun secretly wish you could do it and cry yourself to sleep every night and end up in a mess with your kingdom anyway the problem here is you can easily lamify the game by executing all nobles and instead of a juicy rewarding emotionally messy and mechanically complex end game you just chop chop chop chop chop the end the ui again needs more clarity focus better framing better organisation less clutter more consistency and polish upgrades are hard to figure out at first a bit odd and the grey shield icons over the skills that can upgrade are simply not visible enough they should be colorful bright glowy animated with a color that stands out personally i prefer the grid structure of the warband inventory the frequent entirely useless and poorly designed autosave doesn t async save in the background it freezes the game for a few seconds you can t turn it off and for now some crashes may happen depending on how you play and what you may try last but not least press n to access the encyclopedia there should be a large button for it in the main ui world view it s essential cheers
