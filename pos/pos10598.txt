2016 so here is my first impression of the game after about 6 hrs of game play i have been a heart of iron player since 2002 yes since hoi1 at 36 years of age i consider myself a mature adolescent who is fond of strategical and tactical games and played quite a few other paradox games especially eu4 my review could go back and forward a little but i just write down the things i noticed over these 6 hours i loved the movement the game has made since hoi3 the complexity level has gone down a little and it is somewhat easier to play and comprehend but it has therefore also picked up a little bit of pace not a bad move in my opinion the game feels like it has the right balance between pace strategic decision making and low level management the graphics are great simple and very effective i am no technical expert but the engine looks comparable to eu4 with some enhancements left and right the world looks amazing by night the lights of the cities with planes flying above is gorgeous the troop information differs based on your zoom level and shows just the information you need the moment the transition from one information level to the other is made seems a little bit off though i played my first game as the netherlands and determined my tactic up front align with the allies as soon as possible retreat from my overseas colonies make and hold fort holland and give the allies an opportunity to use this beachhead a tactic which worked out perfect and gave me a good view on the behavior of the ai and to be honest it seems to have some flaws in regard to tactical decision making the game followed the historical developments and once the war between poland and germany had started all allies who i could join at that moment declared war and opened a west front i was able to quite easily hold the province of holland gave up on the other provinces and england and france came to the rescue however france off course was being targeted by germany and italy as well same for belgium the french were actually winning the war with italy and conquered rome however within a month after conquering rome paris fell and the french surrendered completely giving back italy to the italians while it was on the verge of capitulating itself as well italy only had some minor provinces in the south at that moment a similar thing happened to belgium while dozens of french and english divisions where creating and holding a beachhead and actually fighting back brussels fell and belgium capitulated isolating fort holland as well the problem seems to be the victory points which determine the outcome of the war the conquering of certain provinces or areas gives you victory points and each country contains a number of points and it will capitulate after it loses a certain percentage of them france for example will lose victory points if you conquer dunkerque calais and of course paris for belgium the majority is represented by brussels i would expect the ai to defend these victory points before moving attention anywhere else so defend paris before invading italy also the victory points are now static meaning that if luxembourg para trooped into defenseless brussels belgium would capitulate while in reality it probably could easily win the war i like the victory points system in itself but maybe a more flexible setup don t exactly know how yet but if paradox is listening in contact me would be great i also enjoyed parts of the ai the troops i drew back from the dutch indies i used to help the allies in other parts than holland while france was invading italy i recognized an opportunity to take sicily the english arrived just before me creating a beachhead which i was able to use the areas i conquered thereafter where recognized as english territory not sure why and not sure if i mind it although the english had to retreat i was able to hold most of the isle and the ai helped me by sending english troops navy and intercepting italian reinforcements it seemed to work very well i also like the option of volunteer troops america spain and other allies send volunteer troops to help defend holland giving me extra manpower to defend and hold the resource management system i still have some doubts about it could be that missed some aspects but the balance seems a little off steel seems to be overly important while rubber seems the least important i like the concept of trading and giving up some of your homeland factory capacity for it what i don t like however is that it seems that you don t create stock so for example if i produce tanks and need to import steel i will lose some of my factory capacity fine but if i stop producing tanks or reduce the production speed i will import more steel than needed and still lose the factory capacity if i forget to cut the import i have lost capacity over time and did not get anything back the surplus resource was not stored how to solve automatic adjustment of import or maybe a warning if there is a surplus for imported resources just like you get a warning now if there is a shortage could be that i missed this maybe same seems to be going for produced equipment although it looked there that there was some stock there edit found it there is stock so no comments there however the production screens and possibilities are perfect in themselves easy to master and understand and give the right information all in all it is a fantastic game with some room for improvement there are a lot more improvements made to game than discussed above but they can still be optimized as well drawing and making plans for your troops the navy and air force screens everybody who was afraid for these type of games before can now join the fun and everybody who was already into these type of games are still very happy like myself it was worth the wait
