2022 euro truck simulator 2 is very simple but incredibly addictive driving through the european countryside is very soothing and makes the perfect backdrop for listening to music or a podcast for those of us who need to keep their hands stimulated while they listen to something this game is absolutely ideal your brain can go on autopilot while you go on long drives delivering cargo or simply exploring the map the developers continue to update it despite the fact that it s nearly ten years old there are also regular dlc packs but prices are fair and the only packs you really need are the ones that add large swaths of driving area to the map you never feel pressured to buy anything the addition if driver truck garage management systems was a nice touch that takes it from simply being a driving simulator to something that has an additional axis of progress you can work towards beyond your player s driving skills it feels good to be able to do my own deliveries and watch my trucking company expand at the same time
