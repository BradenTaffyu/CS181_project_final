2016 really fun game i have played over 300 hours and enjoyed it quite a bit i ve even dozed off while driving not recommended hahagraphics are great living in san diego ca the landscape and buildings feel familiar enough that you could almost place yourself at times i come back to this game almost monthly for a few days i ve yet to place the arizona dlc but i am excited it s impossible to regret purchasing this game unless you re looking for some form of demolition derby this game rewards you if you apply even a modicum of patience and safe driving my favorite feature of this game is the ability to hire staff and purchase extra trucks it s a minigame that increases your profitability a real treat do it nao
