2023 i bought this way back in 2018 and played for around 20 minutes which mainly entailed skipping the dialogue and struggling to see myself playing through an entire game in this style ending in promptly uninstalling it and requesting a refund cut to 2023 and with all the buzz around that baldurs gate 3 i re bought the game on sale and gave it another shot and i played through the game start to finish alongside completing all of the quests i could find it s tough to empathize but i despise turn based games and prefer the more normie rpgs so for me to play through this whole ass game and sink my teeth into it is a glitch in the matrix it wasn t an immediate love affair the game s mechanics still felt off initially but then i let go of my preconceived notions and allowed the game to work its charm and charm me it did the turn based combat which had been a sticking point for me began to make sense it added a level of strategic depth that most action rpgs lack dos2 is a game that s clearly had its share of thought and attention to detail the world is beautifully designed and packed to the brim with interesting characters dialogue and lore that actually feels like it matters i know that nowadays every open world rpg with a dialogue system and multiple voiced characters claims that it matters and has an impact but there isn t any way of putting it it does have an impact and does matter to put it bluntly i fell in love with a game style i used to loathe this title is so brilliantly crafted that it transcends my personal gaming preferences it taught me that turn based rpgs could offer a depth of gameplay that rivals if not surpasses my beloved action rpgs and that is a testament to the mastery of larian studios
