it starts with the monthly subscription then you want some more tracks and some cars to drive on those tracks next you buy a logitech driving force gt then you realize it s pretty bad and upgrade to a thrustmaster t300 mounting that on your desk isn t ideal so you get a playseat challenge it s pretty hard racing side by side on a single monitor triple screens but your pc isn t powerful enough for triple screens new pc then you play at a friend s place who has a direct drive wheel and load cell brakes which feel much better than your thrustmaster t300 so you buy the same oh but the playseat challenge isn t sturdy enough so you get an aluminum rig but now you don t have space for your sim racing rig because your house is too small new house see where i m going with this
