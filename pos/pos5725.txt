2022 this game is a gem the graphics are beautiful the gameplay engaging and the combat has the type of depth that you don t see in many other games bannerlord is enjoyable on a lot of levels from the rts arcade type one on one combat that takes a few minutes to learn but about 100 hours to master to kingdom level strategy where you lead 2000 men and now some women into battle when i first got this game i went to the arena and trained one on one for 8 hours honestly even that tiny slice of the game is fun replayable and almost worth the full price the battles are where this game shines and leading an army never felt more realistic the combat is deep with the unique mount and blade collision based combat the sword actually has to hit your enemy in 3d making a lot of realism flow naturally from it character development is great with lots of interesting choices and skill builds melee builds and horse archer builds feel almost like two separate games the endgame is not quite as strong as the mid and early game but it is still fun especially with a couple of mods i always play with the improved garrisons mod for example this brings me to the odd phenomenon of the vocal minority who hate this game but still play hundreds of hours just look at some negative reviews they fill the forums and message boards and i never quite figured out what their problem is except they all seem to be fans of the original game who wanted some mystical product that never materialized well i am sorry for them but for you i recommend this game 100 it s already awesome and will get better with time get on the train now you will enjoy the ride
