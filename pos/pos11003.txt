i just want to say i dont think this game is necessarily bad its just not as engaging as cities 1 i thought cities 1 when it first released was terrible but over the course of 7 or 8 years and seemingly dozens of dlcs there was so many features and new content types added that the game became pretty great now starting fresh on a new game expecting it to be as fleshed out as the 8 year old game is crazy there are several great things about cities 2 such as the road builder and tools and the now built in modding makes it easier and i have not had a game crash due to mods yet unlike the first game yes there is a lack of diversity in cities 2 it would be nice for there to be more building styles instead of the same building have 3 colors i personally would love for there to be parks industries university and airports dlcs that are closer to the old game i liked how we could custom build those zone and assets to make them however big or small and they truly added dynamics to the game in a way that the current set up does not seem to allow all in due time maybe co should focus on adding features like those sooner rather than later
