2020 10 15 2020 edit i ve played the game for more than 400 hours on bethesda launcher and now on steam and to be honest as possible it s really fun to play with friends and random people players are always keen to help out new players i ve met my fair share of people that attack your base with fat man s or etc but every game has that well aside from the mini nukes but if you hit a certain level like 100 for instance people will start treating you like an enemy using any method to glitch you out of the game and kill you till you leave the server and i m talking about veteran players that are over 500 lvl they don t give a crap about you and they will spawn camp you and steal your loot and everything you have it s avoidable yes but if you want to farm some materials and you capture a base someone will go out of their way to constantly kill you even if they take it for themselves the storage thing is so bad i m super shocked that a company will allow your items to drop if killed by a player or a npc because someone can easily steal it from you and don t get me started with the hackers and modders this is for the new update i never did the daily ops before but those seem fun at first but then slowly get repetitive over time but it s not bad if you don t overdue it and with the new legendary perks 50 of the other ones are super useless and not needed hopefully they add more legendary perks in the future oh and you scrapping normal perk cards for legendary coins is made pretty good and the mob scaling is kinda okay i wish they gave us more exp in return for fighting more stronger foes they even made it so we get less exp from creatures that are a big a level the season 2 is going well we had the the bench press disabled for awhile because you can stack the str buff as much as you want and we didn t have it for a week the game still has a lot of bugs they recently fixed tons of stuff which is nice nothing new and fun for now but hopefully in the future we get more stuff pros feels a bit like fallout 4 but mmo like which might be an issue for some people main story has some good characters having a group and really well made events fun with friends people are nice to new players rose i love her she is a spicy robot launching nukes killing super mutants and raiders is always fun the battle pass is not bad legendary perks and scrapping normal perk cardsseason 2 awards are not as good as the 1st one but we have new stuff scaling foes level cons it still has a lag delay when you shoot and kill a creature or a player crashes imagine spending 1 hour killing in the nuke sites to finally get to launch a nuke and the game crashes fun the storage system is so stressful having to waste time thinking what to do and how to organize your storage having limited space and selling stuff you need is stupid having fallout 1st removes that which is another con lack of apparel bugs and i m not even talking about the rad roaches visually nukes in fallout 3 look better than in the 76 one which is sad really lack of events we need more no chat there are so many limited stuff that they can make good for instance the perk that allows you to pacify animals or creatures they made it so you can only tame and send them to be in your base as a guard dog if you find them in the wild so that means you need to find them randomly encountered in the map so fixed spawns you can only pacify them and that s it they won t even follow you they just roam around and not attack you that s incredibly sad a lot of hackers and modders where are the raider vixens you sometimes glitch under the world and die with your loot gone forever fallout 1st at least make it cheaper voice chat is cancerous nuclear winter sucks as a battle royale why even make a battle royale it s dead the building circle is kinda small caps capped at 30 000 most enemies give less exp now and even with the scaling level thing it gives less season 2 power armor skin feels so lazy50 of legendary cards are useless originally my score was 7 10 but now i have to change it to 6 10i still enjoy the game but it tends to get stressful with the stupid storage system
