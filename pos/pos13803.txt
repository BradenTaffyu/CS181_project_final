2018 this game went from an afterthought playing only 7hrs of the game in 2016 to a borderline masterpiece in 2018 the description is lying after constant updates and dlc the dlc is actually amazing by the way except maybe the spec ops dlc there are well over 20 vehicles and 40 weapons there are 5 locations 4 being free this is counting the vr map and there are so many tactical options that this game has simply so much replayability that you can t be boredin multiplayer there are around 15 official gamemodes and numerous amounts of community made gamemodes that you cannot get tired of it my personal favourite being invade annex where you are deployed onto an island with 63 other players and are tasked to take it over in a combined arms offensive infantry ground units and air units there are numerous campaigns all bringing an interesting story and show off many aspects of the game some of the campaigns are longer than some call of duty campaigns and also deliver a far greater experience i won t spoil anything but one campaign in particular hits you right in the feels and provides many difficult decisions to make to shape the campaign the showcases are mini campaigns with a bit less of a story but still provides a great experience they aim to teach players the new changes with each update as well as provide a bit of a tutorial finally the editor gives you the ability to make your own scenarios or mini campaings and can be used to teach yourself the ropes such as sniping physics jet and helicopter flight and so much more just remember that it is a realistic military simulation so you will die in one or two shots enemies will die in one or two shots weapon calibers differ damage and more it s common sense in a military environment so if that doesn t interest you this game is not for you
