2019 the game is really good for me it s the best total war game i have played reasons why the character menu theres diffrent armour and weapons and just things to equip to your generals which i find really fun the city buildings it s just really enjoyable for me to keep expanding my cities and making them grow and seeing what options i have for my cities and towns and so on it tells you if it will benefit you or not there is alot of information in the game so you don t get too confused the main characters for me all of the factions and their main guys are really well done to me their armour their backround the voice acting is very good aswell you will fall in love with the faction just need to find the one you really enjoy theres one for all of us the way they made this game is alot like shogun but much better and it gets very addicting because you want to become that emperor and there is alot of land to take and it s not super easy but it s enjoyable af if you love total war games this one is for you trust me the game can only get better with future updates workshop and a few more dlcs and one of my last words is if they would make a medieval total war with this kind of style it would be the best in my opinion the game is really really good it will not disappoint you and as mentioned it can only get better
