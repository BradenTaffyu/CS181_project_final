the base game is pretty old and dated however pick this up with all the dlc when on sale and then spend the extra money on content manager free but still support the developer csp pure and perhaps l a canyons if that s your vibe and suddenly you have the absolute best driving game and most bang for your buck you can get right now the modding community is insane and have done wonders with this game
