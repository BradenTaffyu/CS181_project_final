with every 5 cool features a remaster adds 1 questionable or outright stinky addition is implemented as well i do believe this is the case here and will start with the negatives firstly loss of atmosphere imgur com or vibe in certain areas it got rid of several mature elements first of all upon death units simply disappear imgur com in original aom they left a bleeding corpse texture that slowly turned into a skeleton and then disappeared completely the game also seems to have removed skeleton props completely imgur com also why the hell gaia now looks like groot imgur com secondly the campaign voice re cast everyone speaks as if they are bored sleepy or indifferent to what is happening original voice lines especially ajax and odysseus were expressive and striking to be fair the new dub feels so bland i can barely tell who is speaking if i close my eyes thankfully there is a mod i really hope developers won t delete that restores original aom voice lines go install it if you also hate the new redub lastly i dislike is the new god portraits i am not going into the debate whether it s ai generated or not you can google this mudstorm yourself however regardless whether generated or hand drawn in most of the cases they resemble mobile game ad visual style hypertrophied oversaturated bombastic over the top art that is so generic it doesn t even matter whether it is ai generated or person made the older portraits which are available optionally nice have timeless look that even if not as flashy looks supreme lame now let s go through cool stuff despite what s mentioned earlier this game looks awesome i actually like the new lighting much better than high contrast one they did in aoe3 de the new god power effects are fantastic and unit models are an eye candy almost no complaints here visual upgrade is unquestionable coolest being the inherited from aoe 3 buildings collapsing into small pieces secondly the new gameplay changes are welcome i am particularly happy about god powers being re usable more than once by charging them with favor i feel more inclined to use them and enjoy the cool effects more without fear that i waste it in inappropriate moment civilization changes are fine the norse receiving the biggest overhaul map editor received a few quality of life updates i welcome very much as a scenario maker i am thrilled to create new awesome adventures for the community looking forward to the new content and expansions i hope they will do justice to the chinese pantheon and mitigate the abysmal tale of the dragon dlc we got in aom ee also who s willing to bet 5 the second dlc is going to be hindu civ or sub saharan africa considering the latest trends ultimately this is another great remaster worth playing
