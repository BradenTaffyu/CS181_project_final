2014 early access review its like the sim s in a zombie apocalypse except it s just you your the last person alive that hasn t turned no friends or family to be with unless you play multiplayer there will be npc s added in future patches but the interactivity with these is still unknown they will most likely be hostile in the early game your first challenge is finding a decent weapon as a spoon just doesn t cut it however breaking into peoples houses can set off security alarms which attracts nearby zombies that will chase you down unless your quiet and stay out of eyeline during the first couple of weeks the electricity is working so you can use household appliances like ovens to cook food it s not long before it turns off and you have to resort to eating canned food if you have a can opener or other dry products most food in the fridges will go off quickly as it is no longer chilled you can cook your own meals by building a campfire though i found this unnecessary as it s easy to stock pile large amounts of none perishables eventually the stored food will run out as well as the water supply you will have to come up with other ways of survival like farming fishing and collecting rainwater in barrels learning carpentry skills is essential as you can then use collected wood to make all kinds of structures like wall s box s furniture even barricades for your doors and windows to stop the zombies getting in your safe house btw you can cut down tree s with most weapons it just takes much longer than an axe the game really is a survival sandbox with no real story except the one you make for yourself overall i enjoyed this game more so than games like dayz i like the isometric 3rd person viewpoint as opposed to 1st person as you can see if someone is sneaking up on you the developers have announced that future patches will contain npc s and vehicles which will add another dimension to the game i give this game a solid 8 10 and can recommend it to people who like sandbox style survival games tips always carry beta blockers with you as it reduces your panic level when around hordes of zombies carry bandages painkillers as if you get bitten scratched your less likely to turn if you attend to the wound immediately always carry a spare weapon as low durability can cause them to break take drinks none perishable food with you as you may be away from your safe house for a long time find a large hiking bag as it can carry the most items when exploring buildings whack doors before you enter this will let you know if there is a zombie on the other side as they will start banging on the door give yourself escape routes when i enter a building i open all the doors as you can quite easily get pinned down by charging zombies take spare clothes with you unless your already fully clothed as you can die from hyperthermia hypothermia if there is a sudden temperature change attack crawling zombies from behind they are slow to turn around and much less dangerous
