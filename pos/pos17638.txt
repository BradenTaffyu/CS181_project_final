2016 definitely the most polished total war release to date a solid 9 10 at release pros all the races have extremely different rosters and play styles that keep you interested in the game for much longer than a normal total war title i usually find different nations have rosters that are very similar in normal total war games the lore is interesting and at times funny battles are flawless and the flying units are pretty cool cons i feel like the chaos hordes arrive too quickly in the campaign maybe if they came in at around turn 100 it d be better all in all i m looking forward to expansions of this game should be interesting
