2016 does not open from this side the gameupdate i m leaving the real reviews up to those much better at it than i am but i d like to weigh in on the performance and stability issue going on i m playing the game on an r9 380 12 gb of ram win7 x64 and an ancient amd phenom ii 955 it s on lowest detail at 1680x1050 but the game runs at a pretty solid 25 35 fps there s some parts that play at 10 15 fps but overall it s very good considering my cpu is the equivalent of a potato nowadays and according to the sytem specs i shouldn t even be able to run it i ve also had zero crashes as of yet and i ve played it since release so i ve been playing on version 1 03
