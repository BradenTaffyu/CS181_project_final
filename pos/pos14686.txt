2017 tl dr civ 6 vanilla is still better than civ 5 vanilla dlcs with the exception of content amount the of civs wonders scenarios that said the work it needs is not what firaxis current development path appears to be prioritizing civilization 6 is in a weird place right now it s been over a year since launch and only minor improvements have occurred with the game s core features and not in its most critical failing areas like ai firaxis at the same time is only producing content culture packs of new civs and scenarios without any announcement about an expansion that would add new features techs or alter elements of balance and pacing this has set a lot of the community against them and frankly they re right to do so the individual paired civ dlc packs are bs because they don t address the thing we all actually want new and or improved mechanics and tuning on ai and diplomacy that said however i went back to civ 5 for a minute in order to refresh my memory and frankly civ 6 at its base is fundamentally better than civ 5 with all of its dlc with the exception of content of civs mostly all the features from the fully expanded 5 are present in 6 either fully or in a way that s either improved upon or just altered in a manner that s different enough to make a direct comparison invalid so for the question of is this vanilla product better than the prior installment s vanilla product yes it is it gets a thumbs up for that reason however this game really needs new mechanical content and re balancing tuning especially when it comes to pacing the tech civic development splitting technology into a tech tree and a new civics tree means you burn through both more quickly especially the civics of which there are far fewer and end up over developed in both well ahead of the timeframe you would expect even when you don t focus on it i have consistently maxed both trees out at around the 50 60 range of turns passed in a game on normal and epic game speeds in the late game you can develop replacement techs faster than you can build the unit a tech unlocks it s ridiculous you need a mod to correct this now but you shouldn t have to what the game needs desperately is an expansion like civ 4 s beyond the sword which brings in some more late game tech potentially brings back corporations and natural disasters rebalances the development path and improves ai so it s less reliant on starting buffs to be competitive ideally they d improve upon that idea and integrate more modern issues too like terrorism from non state actors corruption of government and potentially civil disturbances due to cultural ideological clash within your own civ these elements might clash with the comic book cartoony pc theme the game has embraced though which is a shame but sticking with the release of only small content dlc packs makes me and i think others worried that no such expansion is on the way any time soon you d expect at least an announcement by now anyway the ball is in firaxis court to address the problems with their game but all is quiet on that front thus far hopefully this will change soon edit aaaand a week later now they announce rise and fall here s hoping it s good
