2016 despite a lack of game complexity and dumbed down features from previous total war titles i was excited to experience the lore and battles of the warhammer series from a more visual and immersive medium there is a lot of potential for the game to be expanded upon especially with proper support for the modding community it will be interesting to see what s introduced as dlc as the game makes you want more
