2018 early access review don t be scared about early access this game is fully fleshed out and good to go as is two playable classes 1 currently in beta testing phase new dungeon every day lots of progression to be had with each tier of difficulty unique and fun playstyle that feels fair and when losing you generally know what went wrong and how to fix it very well balanced highly recommend it to both rouge lite lovers and newbies who want a little challange for once
