2017 do you like collecting shiny things giggling about cute stuff and exploring as much as you can possibly putter over to then i have a game for you i ve been playing this since near the beginning of early access and it has come a long way in terms of content and the devs have been so dedicated to making this one of my favorite games it has been a good relaxing game due to being impossible to stay upset while playing
