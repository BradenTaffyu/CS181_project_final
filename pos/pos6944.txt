2019 early access review a little game with a big hookraft is a simple game that is simply fun i can t describe this one for you if you haven t played it then you re missing something i finished it some while back and am still drawn to it because of the peaceful gameplay when you re not playing hardcore the music is lovely but the concept of floating at sea on a raft is really immersive though the story finishes when you ve beat the game the creative mode and hardcore survival mode give it replay value if you can pick this up sometime on sale even better i highly recommend this jewel for gamers of all ages
