2018 early access review i bought this game to support the devs after they delivered a great product of assetto corsa before through early access this game while having only 1 track and 1 car you can see that it is very well polished and visibly an improvement over the previous asseto corsa i had no issue with my g29 physix and realism continues from the last one which is considered one of the best in the sim racing genre but the textures for now seem a little bad they can be enhanced
