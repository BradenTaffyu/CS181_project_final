2022 if you like real time strategy games i do recommend age of empires 4 the goodthe game is gorgeous it runs well and the battlefield is highly readable the audio design is astonishing with the chirps of your units changing in language over the ages units conversing together scouts calling out what they spot as they explore the ui is not impressive but it does what it needs to do there s some interesting quality of life ideas that were introduced to make the genre a bit more accessible most importantly they succeeded in making a rts that s a bit more accessible many of the changes they did tend to focus on the macro side of thing strategy as opposed to the micro it emphasizes less doing a thousand actions a minute and more having a solid build controlling the map seeking information if you enjoyed playing some starcraft 2 or age of empires 2 but was a bit overwhelmed by the amount of investment required to improve age of empires 4 is much more accessible finally i was a bit skeptical at some of the core changes to the design of the franchises having landmarks at age change reducing the number of different units etc but i have to admit i am 100 convinced they did the right thing the gameplay is fun and quick i can play with friends of any skill level and we can have fun the badthere s a lot of bugs and errors in tooptips a tech says it increases damages by 2 but it secretly also increases hit points some techs outright do not work each patch relic has released has introduced as many bugs as it has fixed spearman with infinite range anyone there s also a ton of little things that the game does wrong the replay tools are pretty bad compared to competitors allies can t join walls together etc overalli work in game development thus understanding how some things work behind the curtain the important question i always have with a new game is are its issues deep rooted issues that affect the fundamentals or at they superficial and can be fixed later the former often requires revamping systems doing major changes and takes months and many developers will not do it the latter takes time and is a labor of love but it leads to a game that improves over time age of empires 4 has excellent fundamental it s just a great game it has a thousand issues but they re smalls and they re fixable if you don t mind a bit of friction as of the writing of this review january 2022 then go ahead and purchase it if not wait a few months but either way you ll get a splendid game
