2017 this game helped me through uni it was at times a literal life saver i wish i was being dramatic but i m not stardew was literally my escape from the world work and stress and i would spend hours upon hours just living life at the farm i hold a special place in my heart for stardew and i wholeheartedly cannot recommend this game enough it has everything to offer rpg elements of multiple choice and romance options dungeon delving into the mines defeating monsters and finding new items a farming simulator of knowing how to manage and regulate your fields for the best value of crop worth or just for fun because growing flowers are pretty or just genuinely giving you a break from the world it s soothing calm and you have all the time in the world on the game to live your life however you want there is no pressure involved at all but you re never short of anything to do even if it s just showing your in game cat or dog some love
