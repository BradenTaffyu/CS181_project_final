2022 god of war is one of my favorite game franchises and i m glad to being finally able to play this masterpiece on pc it was the summer of 2007 when we first discovered god of war with my brother and cousin on a ps2 demo disc that my cousin possessed it was god of war 2 and the game left us speechless even though we were far too young to be playing such a violent game but just like all the children back then we didn t care we kept playing until we finished the demo naturally we asked my uncle to bring us the full game and luckily for us he did now we had the full god of war 2 experience on our hands but we didn t have a memory card to save our progress once again that didn t stop us after 6 hours of gaming we conquered the game and the cliffhanger left us both excited and frustrated we later asked my uncle to bring us the first game and we successfully finished that one and put an end to ares as well we somehow found a way to play god of war 3 afterwards and managed to beat it as well knowing there wouldn t be a god of war 4 we resorted playing psp titles and even the official java game called god of war betrayal years later 2016 shone bright upon us santa monica delivered a gameplay video of the new god of war which took place in norse mythology not gonna lie seeing blades of chaos not being present in game we were quite disappointed and this new style didn t appeal to us we tried to hate this game for what it is until one day my cousin bought it for his ps4 and we were brought back to our childhood once again we were greeted with a more mature kratos this time it s like he grew up as we grew up it took some time but the game grew on us we learned to appreciate the change and embraced it fully now we pre ordered ragnarok and simply cannot wait for it leaving my own past behind let s get to god of war kratos ended the greek pantheon and made his way to nordic shores to live as a man rather than a god he found himself a wife and a son followed soon after being distant from his son and losing his wife at an unfortunate time he finds himself alone with his boy through the game you ll get to see the development of the relationship of kratos with his son on their journey to scatter his wife s ashes from the highest peak in all realms kratos is no saint he s one of the worst examples of a horrendous human being however despite lacking necessary humanity towards others kratos always deeply cared about his family he s aware that this is his chance to make things right with his previous family and find inner peace he s sought after god of war manages to turn such a simple story to a deep meaningful one it shows that it is not goal that makes the journey worthwhile but how you get there the gameplay wise it s very good unlike the previous games this one gives player a free camera at their command and adds lots of rpg elements thus resulting in exploration being very rewarding and satisfying on the other hand combat is great you have this leviathan axe with lots of moves and variety and you get to use your good old pals blades of chaos they are a bit weird to use from a third person point of view but i eventually got used to it i m sure you will as well however leviathan axe feels more powerful overall therefore i ended up using it more than blades of chaos all good things aside there aren t much enemy variety in it and most of them are overused through the game i think this is the only bad thing i can say about this game but i m sure ragnarok will change that from a completionist perspective this game was surprisingly fun to 100 sigrun gave me a hard time on give me god of war difficulty though don t get me wrong i m not complaining she s perfectly designed as a challenging boss fight and she was probably the toughest boss i ve ever faced in any game props to santa monica for that moving onto another topic as you all know god of war has won the goty award back in 2018 and most people opposed it by saying that red dead redemption 2 was the one that deserved that award instead of god of war as a diehard god of war fan and not having played red dead redemption 2 yet i slightly agree with this mostly because how very well detailed red dead redemption 2 is like i said i m stating a sketchy opinion here because i ve yet to play red dead redemption 2 will this change after i ve experienced the game we ll see anyway just wanted to mention this here since we have been discussing this topic with my friends since 2018 tl drgod of war is an emotional journey of a man who s having trouble facing his past from narrative to gameplay it delivers the best of them i believe that this game should be experienced by every human being out there
