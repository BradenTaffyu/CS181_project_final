early access review man what do i say about this game that hasn t been said before i m not usually the biggest fan of empty builder games that is to say construction focused games that give you little reason to progress except for the sheer euphoria of going bigger and better i never really progressed that far into satisfactory and i refunded factorio shortly after purchasing it dsp is the rare exception i m not sure why but something about the progression in this game feels like i m building my own little civilization you start off as a lonely lil bot guy chopping down trees and breaking rocks to make cute little machines look how nice and neat everything is i m sure everything will stay organized forever d i remember thinking 200 hours later looking at the sheer absolute volume of spaghetti going this way and that i think i may have spoken too soon i remember turning a few small smelters and constructors into a massive industry slowly terraforming my little green planet until it was covered in more machine than land i remember the first time i left home to build a new industrial zone on an entirely different planet just for the sole purpose of firing dyson swarm hexes from one place all so i could watch and laugh at the tiny little zaps firing at the sun how adorably tiny my swarm was by comparison to a star and i remember the elation i felt when i finally encased the sun in one big solid shell of swarm hexes sure i didn t need to and it was a pain in the ass to complete but man the feeling of hey i just surrounded a star in mirrors all on my own i m sure i felt the same way that the world felt when we first set foot on the moon like we had just made the entire universe feel just that little bit more within our reach something about dsp is just magical like that i stopped playing about 2 years ago and only recently came back to look again at what i d built i ve forgotten how most of the game works and i have no idea what i m looking at anymore and yet despite that my little machines keep running it doesn t matter if i don t know what anything s doing anymore my interstellar industry still merrily chugs away doing a thousand and one things at once and that s why i say it feels like a little civilization it doesn t need my supervision it just does what i told it to do long ago and i think that s just extraordinary
