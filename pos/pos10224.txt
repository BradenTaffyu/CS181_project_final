2019 this review was written with 17 hours of playtime ever bought a new game and fell so deep into it that you find yourself doing tasks associated with the game in your sleep holy mackerel ive been saying for months now that designers don t make good games anymore i will now eat my words i purchased rim world last night after tiring of the other games i find myself installing and uninstalling minutes after firing them up let me begin by saying if you played factorio and thought wow what a deep game with so much to do and enough management requirements to almost make your head explode well let me say that rimworld takes factorio and drops it off in preschool before it begins its day as one of the best strategy group managing games i have ever come across the brutal events that will befall you and the losses you incur only push you to play again with a new set of tactics to try to hold on a few days longer rim world doesn t hold your hand at the beggining but it gives a fair shot to the beginner with its scenario customizing options the generated lands are brutal and exciting and the globe is massive i have never thought an angry squirrel could wreak such havoc when it busts through your colony s front door and lays siege to the people inside while you scramble to draft able bodied people to take position against the threats i am giving this game a 10 10 there are a few things i am still fumbling with as far as controls and understanding how to keep pets from walking inside and outside of my houses causing dirty floors i also am struggling with animals that self tame that you want to release from your care that don t seem to vacate as you free them i hate the exploding cow like animals that catch everything on fire and they seem to be the ones that self tame and then become walking time bombs around my weak fortifications i have found a way around this by walling them in while they sleep and then just letting them starve but i find that it weighs heavy on my gamer heart and would like to know how to control my livestock a bit more nothing a few you tube vids wont solve but a game like this makes you want to figure it out for yourself and survive with the sweat and grit you landed with any gamers out there who liked prison architect factorio terraria will find this game to be a million times better and should air on the side of caution when it comes to time spent this game will have you calling in sick for work just dont forget to eat sleep and use the bathroom like a normal person this game will attach to you and hold you tight ok update after 350 hours i have learned much about controlling boom rats and animal herds and i still feel the game is just as good although i am less enthusiastic i have learned enough to be able to eat and use the bathroom without any issues i found the workshop mods and theres nothing that can stop my clan if you attack my city i harvest your organs burn your weapons sell your organs to mech traders attack a second time i capture who ever survives and feed you nutrient paste made of your dead comrades im sorry this game changes a man
