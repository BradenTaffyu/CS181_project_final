2023 look i ll be honest here bannerlord was released in a basically unfinished state however i m still recommending this game for two reasons 1 the bones of it are good i played a lot in early access and had enough fun for it to be worth the price in spite of the many unimplemented features 2 the bevy of fantastic mods available through the workshop make it absolutely worth it for anyone still on the fence i recommend starting off by installing if nothing else the realistic battle mod r b m it rebalances all of the factions and makes combat much more interesting if you re still hankering for more there are plenty of mods that improve diplomacy faction mechanics settlement management trading and many many more facets of the game that isn t to say that it s a shame that the devs couldn t finish their game it sucks that this is a thing nowadays where publishers rush a product out the door and expect the player base to take up the slack with mods and fan patches but i think it s a testament to the core playability and funness of a game when there s such a robust and dedicated modding community out there trying their damnedest to keep the game alive and functioning you re lucky taleworlds count your blessings let s hope your next one will be a little more polished
