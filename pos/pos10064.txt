2017 early access review survival crafting combat farming fun game is intensely addictive it has that just one more turn feel that hasn t hooked me quite so badly since the days of moo and civ1 tons of replay value tons of depth definitely some quirks lot of you stupid git don t do that plus pyromaniac drug addict pawns lighting my base on fire ultimately though each game takes on its own feel based on what events happen what kind of characters called pawns you get a ton of freedom to do whatever you want and ultimately just try to survive what the world throws at you
