2021 early access review this game is phenomenal if this is what the game is right now as a beta in development game then i can t wait to see what happens when the full game is released i mean this is more or less my first logistics game and i am absolutely floored by the detail the game play and the system used i confess i get a little nauseous flying into space given the scale of the solar system but once you get used to it it s just a whole new experience i strongly suggest though that either have someone help you get started or watch youtube let s players to get an idea of how to get started the starting of this game can get a bit tedious but stick with it you ll love seeing how everything flows into everything else into the final goal of creating one of the most astronomically stunning structures ever to be postulated i can t wait to go to a new star system
