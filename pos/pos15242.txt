2020 this is one of my favorite games and one i always come back to i ve been playing this since it first came out klei is always doing something new and fresh this company actually cares about their fans which is super nice i absolutely love klei the artwork for this game is fantastic and unique i love the little animations they provide for upcoming events and their merchandise has quality to it something you don t see much anymore highly recommend this to anyone who s looking for a survival game it takes awhile to learn all the ropes but it s really fun
