2017 at first i was not sure about buying this game i had never played a mount blade game before i like strategy games but also like to be part of the action and i felt that maybe warband would be more about building an empire with strategy which would bore me at some point i was completely mistaken i started mount blade and studied the game learned how i should level up my character learned how to level up my companions in different areas so my army can perform well in all circunstances made a little army and fought as a mercenary for a lord started kicking butts everywhere i went bringing doom and massacre to everybody that stood in my path with my two handed sword leveled up my character in such a way that he could command many soldiers but he could fight like a madman take many hits and still be up i started recruiting more and more each battle i faced i won i felt like like my character was the conception of an homosexual intercourse between griffith and guts berserk fans would know in which god made the miracles of making griffith pregnant giving to birth my character which had leadership skills and combat skills then i had an army of veteran soldiers which could fight an army three times it size and make a massacre i made my own freaking empire and declared war to everyone as i was undefeated in battle i thought i had it all figured out i thought i was a genius i was completely mistaken i sieged a castle and all the nord men went for my ass even the king himself nowhere to flee i had to fight my way out of there but i understood right there that there is a limit which your 300 manly spartans like army could stand and it was at that moment that i understood the importance of having alliance with other npcs to help you out and then i knew i was i was completely right the nord kicked my ass murdered my veteran army and put me as a prisioner without my army i was nothing again just as i started and had to climb my way up again and be more careful with my actions this game has lifted me up put me down in the dirt and doing it all again and again many times it is the perfect combination of strategy and action i recommend it to all my fellow gamers who like a game that is difficult and that needs time and patience to get a good grip of it once you get a good grip of the game you will stand a chance i am a collage student and this game became so addictive to me i had to uninstall it i do not have enough time to be a respectable human being and play this game at the same time but god knows the good time i had playing it
