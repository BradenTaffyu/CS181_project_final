2016 this game is just fantastic obviously you can see that from the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on steam so i will keep this short and try to focus on negatives and things you may overlook in general stardew valley is what pc gamers have been looking for to scratch that harvest moon animal crossing itch if you like that type of gameplay just buy this don t overthink it it does it all and more what puts it over the top is the customization level and modular building ability a la minecraft terraria style and oh boy is there depth plus multiplayer is coming pros i mean this was made by one guy beautiful artwork that has attention to details i mean it even changes dramatically with the seasons its incredible music is absolutely a treat and once again changes with the seasons controller support works ok i m just glad it exists character customization male female sliders for colors your appearance changes with different gear etc you have a large farm to work with the world in general is a good size there are 28 npc s all with their own schedules and agendas the pixel art for their faces is outstanding you can have a pet and get married i haven t even done anything with the latter yet there is mining and fighting monsters although the fighting is casual and isn t even completely necessary i could go on and on here really cons sometimes the controller support part feels glitchy until you learn how to use it mainly the part with the right stick nine hours in and i m still figuring out nuances it would be great if the hotbar were longer so to minimize going into the pause button to juggle things the bin you put stuff in to sell each night should show all of its contents why not allow the player to retract items put in right up until they go to bed its not a dumpster so things don t get tainted long story short this is beyond excellent i can t get enough if you like this genre this is a no brainer
