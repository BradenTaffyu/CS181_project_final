2016 my people were happy species flocked from around the galaxy to inhabit worlds i colonised with robots especially for them in advance i had a welfare policy that left noone out and all species were represented fairly my navy was vast and had the most advanced weapons and defences due to our unrivaled technology all envied us then they came destroying everything in their path and devouring all at first we did not worry as it was on the other side of the galactic centre but they moved so quickly a decision was made to bulk up the navy a fleet was assembled the likes of which the galaxy had never seen before the plan was to go straight for the head and remove it at first the battle went well we were outnumbered 4 1 but out superior range and technology meant we could push forward but they just kept coming as each fleet was left as scrap behind us more took their place and our losses grew we tried to send reinforments but it wasn t enough the grand fleet was lost an allience of once friendly neighbours were startled by our sudden militerisation but envious eyes narrowed when they saw our mighty fleet fall they declared on us we pleaded we pointed out we were trying to protect the galaxy but they would not listen our empire shrank to a fraction of its original size its fringes annexed and passed around as a prizes we then watched as each fell to the hungry not with glee but with sadness as we knew we would fall soon after great game make your own stories role play is a big part of it for me a lovely grand stratergy
