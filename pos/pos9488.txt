2021 assetto corsa is a game that i would strongly recommend you could sink probably a thousand hours or more into this game with the addition of content manager and some mods the game looks very good despite being 8 years old the physics are very realistic and it takes a while to figure out your car s limits it also allows for vr support and wheel which adds even more to the experience i have only scratched the surface on this game but i would recommend it
