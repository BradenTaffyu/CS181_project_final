2023 not very happy with this gamei love this game for all the reasons everybody else is loving the game harry potter fan etc etc let me tell you the things i don t like about the game sometimes the world feels very empty even though you find students and people everywhere but they never react to anything you do there are beds and you have a bedroom but you can t sleep in it you don t even get a chest to put cool gear that you find and don t want to sell even if you can make other gear look like the one you like sometimes we just like knowing that we can hang on to legendary stuff and keep it you can t sit in chairs with other students and just watch them do their weird things you only feel like you are part of the world during missions that s the only time that npc s react and interact with you great game for harry potter universe fans not so much for open world players who want an immersive experience sadly
