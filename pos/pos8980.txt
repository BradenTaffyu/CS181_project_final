2018 i tried playing this a couple times and couldn t penetrate the early midgame it finally clicked for me on my last playthrough i played a race of monastic space elves called the malinar pacifist xenophobe spiritualist i took inward peace and life seeded as they seemed snooty enough to prefer only gaia worlds and to do their own thing in early expansion we managed to take choke points we had three neighbors orassian marauders and two xenophobic purifier robot races i quickly fortified my choke points with defensive starbases and continued my path of soul searching for a hundred years i was universally disliked but mostly undisturbed until the orassian s unified under a great khan he walked all over my carefully layered defenses to spare the consumption of my territory the proud malinar bowed their heads to the new khan afterall my people would surely outlive him and they did unfortunately rather than splinter the orassian s united under a new khan but consolidated their empire and gave up universal conquest for fifty years i plotted seeding my people in habitats throughout space and fortifying my borders a hive mind immediately next to me was also a tributary of the khan finally i rebelled every single neighbor of mine was allied with the orassian s and i fought a war of succession against five civilizations simultaneously thankfully my bulwark of starbases held and i won my independence free from the khan my people unlocked their innate psychic ability i started to dangerously plumb the depths of the shroud half hoping to end the cycle instead my leader was chosen by the void and become an immortal god king cognat was renamed malinar as an embodiment of the ethos of my people we built our research nexus our sensor array our ring worlds and our dyson spheres when the fallen empires awoke we stood against them and beat them back to their homeworld almost simultaneously the unbidden appeared in our universe bent on consuming it all while the remaining empires fueded and warred my people martialed their fleets and plunged head long into the expanding territory of the unbidden killing these otherworldly invaders wherever they found them after three decades the unbidden were annihilated though hated by the universe at large when it called the malinarian s answered it is now the era of the malinar from our small but powerfully defended sector we project our force to the very edges of the universe unruly civilizations are brought to heel by our final instrument of peace the mouth of peace a gigantic ship that encases entire worlds in psychic hamster balls the universe will know peace one way or another
