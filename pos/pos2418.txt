2023 the game is inexcusably buggy runs like garbage looks like garbage too but it s reasonably fun and most bugs aren t game breaking i d buy this game on sale and treat it as a single player or co op w friends game a lot of the multiplayer stuff is more end game anyway the game is a bit pushy about buying their membership nonsense but you can still enjoy and play the game just fine without it even if it makes it seem like it s required
