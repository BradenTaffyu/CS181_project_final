2018 no run will be the same the game is a constant sequence of trial and error that s accompanied by addictive fast pace metroidvania gameplay beautiful pixel graphics and a diverse pool of different playstyles somewhat challenging at first but when you do a couple of runs and get the gist of the game it ll become much easier after a while the challenge becomes solely on how you build your character because items you pick up will likely be different each time the end goal is the same but there are various paths you can choose to get there you may like one path or the other it s all up to you even after finishing the game there s still a lot of replay value such as trying out new builds unlocking items finding blueprints achievements daily challenges and additional difficulty settings for completing the game each time on higher difficulties it ll really keep you occupied and you ll likely be finding yourself having a hard time getting tired of the game fortunately for players who may find it challenging even after a few runs due to the rouge lite nature of the game there are permanent upgrades that you can unlock in order to make future runs a bit easier each time the game is not without faults however for one there is a lot of item balancing that still has to be done enemies scale depending on how you power up your character power ups come in the form of scrolls and the more scrolls you get the more powerful the enemies become which becomes a problem since focusing on one style means you ll be getting less hp compared to a more balanced build while enemies deal a ton of damage although this can be slightly rectified by stacking damage reduction up to 75 item and build balancing were being improved or worked on quite often during early access and hopefully it ll carry on after the release since some items are very powerful compared to others the biggest flaw is the item unlocking if you blindly decide to unlock more equipment you ll have a less likely chance of finding the item you want during runs this means that if you unlocked a weapon and you realize you hate it you can t do anything about it and you ll be finding them in stores and random locations while you sink in to regret nevertheless there is the simple solution of just unlocking the items you like if you are absolutely troubled by this problem or to start a new save knowing this fact hopefully the devs can somehow improve and fix this gameplay mechanic in the future all in all dead cells is a must buy for any metroidvania fans or any players looking for a good 2d side scroller the game is undeniably fun i feel like there is still room for the game to be tweaked and i m sure the devs know that too it s still a game that i m proud to say i played during early access thanks for the journey and countless deaths motion twin
