2022 around 2yrs ago i was your average competitive fps grinder rushing through 1500 hrs of csgo and then around 2500 hrs of rainbow 6 siege i had never touched anything else apart from some good single player games playing those fps games every day really affected my mental as somedays were awesome but most were exhausting as i played the same map over and over and got outplayed by or just outgunned by others finally i decided it was time to stop i began scouring steam for random games that i may like and then warhammer 2 caught my eye partly because it was on sale i had never played a strategy game ever but for some reason the screenshots of entire armies fighting each other seemed really cool to me so i began searching for some gameplay videos to see how it played and then i found this video by legendoftotalwar from his save your disaster battles series it featured a doomstack essentially an extremely powerful army commanded by ikit claw a character lord from the game the moment the battle started i was spell bounded thousands of rats throwing poison bombs shooting lightning cannons firing gatling guns and throwing pink fire at the enemies and burning them off even as someone who knew nothing of the game i quickly realized how overpowered that army was and how quickly it was eradicating the enemy that video basically sealed the deal for me and i purchased the game immediately but i still was absolutely clueless as to how to play the game i quickly searched for legendoftotalwar but realized that he was a veteran player and further reddit searches informed me that he is an extremely good player who discovers and uses cheese tactics a lot which while amazing take time and practice and weren t suitable for beginners and thus began my journey of schooling to learn warhammer 2 as i began with zerkovich s you such at total war which taught me a lot of basics and then watching multiple full campaign gameplays by awesome people like elven plot armor who explained everything they did and lionheartx10 etc today i am an absolute lover of the franchise and immensely enjoy my time with warhammer 3 but wh2 will always hold a special place in my heart as it was the one that started it all
