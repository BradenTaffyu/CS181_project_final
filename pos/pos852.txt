2020 game is nice and chilling at first seems like it can get boring fast but it is not cuz at least first 2 years you have new events and new recepies and more far u still need to search for some objects or grow special plants to get emblems and achievements but it is not only about farming also about building relationships and friendship and every npc has its own preferences and behaviour also music is nice too
