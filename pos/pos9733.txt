2016 early access review i started quite innocently at a save three wonderful colonists things were going well i got some growth up and my happy colonists were making friends with the visitors my farms were doing exeptionally well and after not too long i had over one thousand in rice potatoes and corn in addition to quite a lot of strawberries all of this in my refridgerated room i figured i didn t have to worry about food for a long while i was wrong i got the fine idea of buying a hen and a rooster from a traveller thinking eggs would make some fine additions to my food storage i made a barn and made sure all the animals had access to food focusing on other things i completely forgot about the animals for a while until all of a sudden there were 30 chickens i was a little shocked about the rate in which they d grown and started a hay farm to give them an alternate food source that didn t ruin me this would all be good and dandy in no time i was wrong by the time i d gotten the hay sowed and partially grown i was down to less than 500 of all vegetables and to top it off a blight was around the corner and completely destroyed all my crops i had to start over completely panicked i slaughtered some chickens at this point it was 70 so i figured taking 25 of them to the slaughterhouse would give me some time i was very wrong desperately looking for a way out i had to slaughter another 20 something chickens now they were approaching 70 again i was just hoping for a caravan to show up so that i could sell some chickens and buy some veggies i got some hay grown and decided to cut off the chickens access to all other food sources now they were getting past 80 but i had some hay hoping it would work out i kept at it i didn t mind the chickens for a while until i noticed that some of them were starving by then i d gotten my veggie count back up a few hundreds i let the chicken into my pantry and forgot about it some time later and a lot of chickens later a caravan finally appear so i figure finally time to sell some chickens let s check how many i ve got 241 chickens is what i ve got and they ve pretty much cleaned out all my food by this point angered and slightly panicked i sell all the chickens the caravan wanted them cheap but i didn t care i just wanted them gone so some 1600 silver later i happily decide that my days as a chicken farmer is over and get four alpacas instead i was delighted finally no more chickens the caravan takes on it s way and i go about my merry business of rebuilding my food stock until all of a sudden it pops up in the corner chicken 13 has gotten food poisoning from rice puzzled i look over to the barn and sure enough i have more chickens it s at this point i remember chickens lay eggs the chickens i had before laid eggs i forgot to sell the eggs so i go at it again harvesting my hay crops early and locking them away from the food supply mad at myself for forgetting the damned eggs but these are just tiny little chickens they don t lay eggs yet so i decided to let them live until they re adults so i can slaughter them for their meat and i go about on my merry way guess what chickens lay eggs and these started laying eggs because i forgot about them and they grew up i got angry because i could see where this was going so i marked them all for slaughter and forcefed the eggs to my innocent settlers they didn t like it very much but i couldn t wait until the next caravan to come along now i don t run a chicken farm anymore i will never get chickens again i love alpacas 10 10 would do again a perfect 5 7 score for keeping me entertained
