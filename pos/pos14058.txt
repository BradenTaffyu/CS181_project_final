2019 early access review easily an instant favorite of mine hands down the art style is absolutely adorable and the game itself is like a mix of factorio and modded minecraft new colony managers be warned however you will get frustrated at this game your base may stagnate you ll find that your power sources are taking more fuel than you have access to you ll release a deadly plague upon your innocent duplicants and you ll find out that meep has found yet another way to get himself stuck inside a pit filled with chlorine gas indifferent to his imminent asphyxiation and you ll only notice this when the game gives you a little red notification saying someone is suffocating i ve personally gone through at least four different saves for a total of at least 2000 in game cycles and i have yet to actually launch a rocket in any of them if the idea of this piques your interest but you re still on the fence about buying for whatever reason then there s one more factor to consider it s a klei game and it s definitely worth the money
