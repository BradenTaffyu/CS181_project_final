2022 i ve enjoyed playing this game finished all the story missions and mostly buying junkers i either just get them running or fully restore them i get the most satisfaction out of restoring complete junk to or near their former glory i mostly avoid the the car show room except for getting achievements what s the point now as for actually restoring the cars there is some issues all the operations involved in a vehicle are absent electronics vacuum air intake exhaust fluid delivery are all only represented by various parts the actual operation of said part where and how it s connected is only assumed you re supposed to know this already i guess some parts aren t even connected to their counterpart there s no hoses no wiring harness cables just the assumption that they work somehow i guess the brake master cylinder works via bluetooth connected to the 4 wheels some other peeves about this game are lack of engine animation your shop is dirty as hell but thankfully we learned how to clean finally customers shop employees no no other npc s in which to interact i should have my own show room in place of the current rent a space storage most of the engines sound really bad and there should be more options for driving i give it a 7 10
