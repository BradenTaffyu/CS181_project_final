2019 dust cars fading lights it s the highway the city the small towns and lone watering holes late night fuel ups awful coffee and flickering signs nuts wheels logs pallets chips over sized special transport mile chewing gas guzzling american way of living trucking few games come replete with great chill factor tinged by a bit of excitement and a whole lot of satisfaction as does this one with almost 100 hours thousands of miles and my own garage i m deeply satisfied quick points simulation 9 10 once they add ability to spend the night in sleeper cabs it will get the 10 10 management 8 10 the management is not intense which allows for the chill factor you can still hire drivers own multiple garages trucks and trailers plus take loans the only things i d like to see added are more purchasable trailers better control and availability of jobs hired drivers take on and perhaps ability to invest in business you re shipping for tycoon 10 10 if you like to just buy and hire others then leisurely drive around the country while you rack up money then this is for you or if you d really just wanna drive your heart out and hoard your cash there s that too skill 10 10 even using the keyboard there is some definite skill to develop in driving the truck and ats makes this feel as real as it can wish i could afford a wheel and pedals cause i m sure it s awesome with them visuals 7 10 the rando events long range visuals and detail in cab and truck are great with them testing the dx11 and constant improvements i am sure that visuals will continue to improve i d love to see some development buildings and structures that change over time or buildings and structures that build with deliveries you make kinda like interactive game play scenery sounds 10 10 get a radio station pedal to the metal close your eyes and ride the roadways you asphalt cowboy price 8 10 i feel the base game is well priced but i think every other state expansion should be free paying over 550 for all 50 states is insane not to mention all the feature dlc i think 300 should be target for this game all said and done in summary this game is definitely worth the base game cost and a couple of the states you won t regret this experience
