2017 you have found your next one more turn addiction as a long time total war fan from all the way back in rome 1 my expectations were mixed rome 2 was a disaster and tw1 hadn t clicked with me i was almost prepared to write off the series i didn t think anything could match the old peaks of the series medieval 2 and shogun 2 having now sunk a good 40 hours into playing a full campaign well color me shocked the slump is over total war is back and in all meaningful respects it has never been better there have been numerous major improvements to both campaign and battle mechanics even the tutorial is the best i ve seen in the entire series if you re a newcomer to total war games this is your entry point the changes to the campaign are signficant the vortex rituals in which you have to strike at the other major factions before they complete them to slow their campaign progress as well as defend your own give a well defined and transparent rhytmn to the campaign and help you craft goals and decide who to strike next the biggest change however for my money is just that the money in tw1 and much of the previous total war games i found my coffers slowing to a drip and stymying my building and tech progression here however you get serious cash for defeating enemy armies and there are numerous shipwrecks littered across the ocean which sometimes yield a whopping 10k each enough to build almost any building in the game i can t put into words how much this improves the primary campaign gameplay loop you get cash injections you get to do more exciting things there s a lot of options to make more money in general with both hero perks special buildings and trade the chaos forces are much less irritating than they were here in tw1 spawning at player defined times through the ritual as well as being able to fully eliminate the chaos factions from the map without worry of unexpected respawning anyway i have only completed one campaign so far and it was quality throughout even adorned with high quality cinematics i m looking forward to the next now in terms of the battle mechanics here s where things really get interesting combat is now a many to many relationship observant fans of the total war series will remember this sort of combat in games like rome where you can watch a circle of spearmen all attacking together sometimes against the same target per multiple soldiers rather than a series of duels you have a pushing wall of troops always attacking when possible i personally prefer this and i expect many will too the battles themselves are thrilling although the largest battles you may find yourself forced to play them in slow motion to properly micro with a large army still kinda wish they would do the mtw2 k thing and let a friendly ai take over your second or third armies but hey it s still pretty reasonable oh and artillery are back in a big way as the elves you quickly get access to a basic seige unit configurable to be both a shrapnel shot or a singular powerful shot the shots feels satisfying to me in a way i haven t enjoyed since shogun 2 s fall of the samurai artillery which was similarly potent i fully expect to get a couple hundred hours out of this and if you re a fan of the series you will too especially if they fufill they promise to connect the world of tw2 to tw1
