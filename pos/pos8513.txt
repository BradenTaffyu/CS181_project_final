from the perspective of a non hunter who has never played a hunting game before it feels weird writing such a glowing review for this game i did not expect to like it i don t even really know why i bought it i got it during a steam sale because there was a dog dlc and i figured if nothing else hey at least maybe the dog stuff would be fun but the whole thing is just really unexpectedly enjoyable so much so that i ve even bought more dlc packs already i feel like i could type paragraphs upon paragraphs to explain different aspects of my enjoyment of this game but i think it boils down to these facts the game has a very earnest and respectful presentation of hunting and wild animals it is supremely relaxing to walk around in the beautiful scenery and soundscape of chirping birds rustling leaves and blowing wind it feels at least a little edifying to gradually learn about these real animals the tracks they leave and the sounds they make should you choose to hunt the experience feels very rewarding i know that last one s a weird point to make in a review for a hunting game but you kinda don t have to shoot a single animal in this game to unlock any locations you could just walk around taking photos and enjoy it just as much personally i am grateful that this game gives me the opportunity to gain insight into hunting without harming any real animals i recommend getting the atv dlc to help unlock the map if you don t want to walk everywhere and both the retriever and bloodhound dlcs the bloodhound was really helpful in tracking my first few deer before i knew what i was doing and the retriever seems equally helpful as i begin to try hunting waterfowl developers can i please have a horse dlc so i can ride a horse around instead of an atv
