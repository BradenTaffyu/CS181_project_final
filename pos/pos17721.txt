2016 despite all of the issues surronding dlc pricing for the game tw w is arguably the strongest in the series i only envision the game improving upon itself as time goes on and ca despite still causing controversey with their pre order bonuses dlc pricing etc have improved marginally compared to the past releases of rome 2 and attila i strongly suggest a purchase if the total war series interests you or even just the warhammer property if nothing else this game is poised to take the place of the now defunct fantasy battle property and it won t quite cost a liver to pay for
