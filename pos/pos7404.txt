2016 like euro truck simulator 2 but better has a great map with free and paid expansions on the way makes you feel like you re not alone when driving around lots going on only bad thing i can say about it is that it only supports dx9 this makes the game have very bad aliasing 9 5 10 buy it worth it even at full price
