2018 early access review edit the review here is for build 40 and earlier before the animation update there are many survival games out there but rarely would i ever call one a survival suite that title is reserved for those rare special games that go far beyond what other games do project zomboid is a survival suite a 4x survival simulator of sorts don t be fooled by the 2d graphics it s unbelievable how much you can do in this world it s so detailed that even forgetting to shut a stove off can burn a house down as fire will spread it s soo detailed even the windows on the house can be broken repaired blinds put on them taken off locked unlocked climbed through rope hung out of and more nearly every inch of the world can be interacted with this is not something you will see in games but once in a decade if you were patient enough and survived long enough you could build your own homes wherever you want or burn the entire world to the ground zomboid is seriously impressive and it s the kind of game you wish you had back in the super nes days as if all that wasn t enough there is a ton of customizable options to make it play more how you want with mods you can do even more they are still adding to the game many years after starting this project and what is yet to come is some fairly big features it s a very slow to develope game but they do get stuff done and what is here is already far far faaaaar beyond my min requirements to heartily recommend this one even the multiplayer works really good so yeah there is a lot of good to say about this masterpiece let s focus on the very real negatives the reason for being it s a huge world and it will probably keep you busy for dozens if not hundreds of hours however the progression is only deep on leveling up your characters attributes which can take a very long time on defualt settings some of the skills are not even rewarding to level up as they don t really unlock big new cool exciting things you can build that you will care much about considering how long it takes to level them i find this to be a poor design choice then you have skills like reloading which is oddly it s own skill why not just merge that with firearms skill lightfooted and nimble and possibly stealth should all just be 1 skill as well so much redundant design going on here i am half surprised they don t have a skill for forking with a dinner fork while they are at it and make it take 1 year of real life time to level up yet all it does is make you fork your dinner better you eat 5 faster yep that s half of zomboids skills in a nutshell d unprogressive there is about no armor tool and only a little weapon progression with attachments this is both a good and a bad thing good because then it s a bit authentic to real life bad because what do you do once you have a bunch of guns food and water gamers who want carrots to chase might end up bored before winter even arrives and the next problem adds to this problem too hot or too cold no just right you can play the game too hard or too easy there is not enough of a middle ground too hard if zombie infection is turned on you stand about 0 chance to make it to winter without getting infected 1 little missed swing you can be scratched just 1 time and you have a 25 chance it s game over 50 100 hours of work gone and they don t even always have to swing to get you it seems there might be a health meter but it s pointless in this mode for the most part so why is there even a medicine skill good question yeah you gotta get good to survive but you will get hit i don t care how careful you are there seems to always be a crawler waiting for you in every zombie pile 1 brainfart and yer done 100 hours gone you can play in the same world but who cares about your base the real thing you don t want to lose is your character and the many hours leveling the skills because on defualt settings you level sloooooooooooooooooooooooooow again for skills that half of them don t even do much too easy if zombie infection is turned off the game is too easy and the only real danger then is being crowded once crowded the most annoying thing in gaming history happens where you are just stuck forever shoving zombies back unable to attack unless you have a stab weapon equipped there is no dodge roll or something to get out of that situation when it happens have a knife or game over this crowding problem means having zombies always run makes it about impossible to win too even if infection is turned off medium rare ultimately the game lacks that nice medium in difficulty and i should also mention the world doesn t progress to become more dangerous in time no mutant boss like zombies no mutating wildlife no zombie bears just the same old zombies everyday i can t even find a nice reason to prepare as there is not much to prepare for clear a town out and everything gets pretty quiet and safe for a long time huh now what build a house why i have found many i can live in already build metal walls what for the game doesn t give me enough reasons to do much of anything at the end of the day it s trying to be realism is why oh yeah zomboid strives for realism yet somehow my character can cut down a tree and into logs and then into planks in less then 2 minutes of ingame time so while it might be more down to earth then just about any other survival game it s still far from realistic so it s a shame they are a slave to this soo called realism to a point where they won t do more fun things like mutants item progression and so on which could give reasons to build a fortified fortress a reason to go looking for a better blade weapon a reason to find that ultimate shotgun most players seem to agree long term you will generally quit out of sheer bordom as the world doesn t throw enough problems and rewards at you to keep going for years and years conclusions of a mad fox don t let those negatives scare you away the more i like a game the more i tend to critique it make no mistake this is about the best zombie game ever made and the only reason i don t have 500 hours in this is i am waiting for long awaited features like the animation update i have yet to try it but i hear the hydrocraft mod and other mods can certainly fix some of my existing complaints with the game seriously zomboid is really good games like this are why i cannot stand the aaa game industry anymore they make next gen graphics for last gen garbage gameplay zomboid is special and is probably the best survival game on steam and that is saying a lot cause there is some pretty darn good survival games out there these days and i ve played almost all of them so you fellow sandbox survivors out there good luck in the apocalpyse and don t drink the bleach
