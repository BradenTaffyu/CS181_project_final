2022 this is not just a rpg open world game my friend this game is the definition of perfection while i was looking for ways to express my admiration for the game i thought writing a good review might be one of those ways as always i ll start with the jaw dropping story the story that will make you excited sad happy unconscious all of the emotions that you can have on the top of it will leave you with nothing but a curiosity that leads you to learning more and more also the references to the previous game nier replicant are pretty nice details how can a game s story be so perfect leaving sixthy hours behind with the game and still i couldn t get over it it literally slaps you in the face also being unpredictable is one of the finer touch of the story for the story telling its a bit unique from other games without giving major spoilers there are three main characters for us to accompany and these are 2b 3 9s and a2 all of them is playing major part in the story as you can expect form a rpg game there are multiple endings and these characters is being key for them to talk a little more deeply you are starting with 2b and 9s is accompanying you as a side character after finishing your first playthrough you are going to play the same story but this time with 9s but don t be prejudiced there are differences that make this style quite fun 2b and a2 is a fighter model that will crush everything in their way in the other hand 9s is a hacker model that is not good at combat but hacking and i can t go without saying that he is not fun comparing to 2b and a2 and i kinda dont like his personality at all just sharing some personal thoughts because it my review alright for the gameplay i love every aspect of it it has so wide and unique aspects that each one is a different pleasure tons of weapons combinations tons of move sets and comfortable modifications that allow you to direct the play style you want you can just be a terminator or tactical fixer its all on to you you will have fun in both ways cause combat is a lot fun and when it comes to music mate its awesome it really puts players in to a fashionsome of them are so beautiful that i listen to them every now and then finally its a tradition for me to give a score and its 9 10 for me one point i broke consists of a few parts i wish this place was like this and those are just personal dislikes like there is nothing to do with the game i love this game the end
