2022 what if i told you that every space game you ve previous played is wrong about space and what if i told you that to get space right you need little green men in space suits to set you on the right path kerbal space program is ultimately not just a fun game about space it s an education on basic orbital dynamics and a love letter to real world space programs you are given a sandbox but it s no ordinary sandbox full of fun and creativity no no this sandbox has is a solar system full of gravitational wells and delta v calculations it requires you to think not just regular video game thinking but real thinking you learn how small we are and how vast the distances to the places and things we claim to conquer with a robot or a fragile tin can can be you learn gumption and flexibility when your old ideas stop working and your new ideas fail to work the first time there are no lasers no fusion drives no aliens ksp is work calculating planning and trial and error in the extreme from designing your first rocket in the vehicle assembly building to rolling it out to the launch pad you can take pride in your achievements because they are yours and basically follow the real world principles of space travel there are few gaming moments more satisfying than the first time you achieve an orbit land on the mun kerbin s natural satellite or land a probe on a hostile planet in kerbin s solar system using retrorockets and parachutes to achieve what seemed impossible a few minutes before if you landed a probe somewhere you can be sure that you learned something unless you work at nasa and maybe even then kerbal space program is janky as janky as you d expect from a game that is simulating down to the rocks an entire solar system for you to explore but the jank is part of its charm and can even be leveraged to your advantage like using a dirty sock as a makeshift co2 scrubber on apollo 13 ksp is not for everyone despite the jank and the frustration if the bug bites you you ll be coming back to ksp for years to test new theories build new rockets and explore the unexplored because there s something fundamentally compelling about a game that sets your free with only a set of tools and the unknown there s something exciting the universe beckons it begs to be seen explored probed and landed upon not because it is easy but because it is hard are you up to the challenge
