early access review despite being an early access title it s obvious how much thought and effort has been put into making a mostly very polished base the art and animations are excellent the gameplay is intuitive and easy to grasp if you ve played this kind of game before and the existing systems tie into each other well certain aspects can be very micromanagement intensive such as farming but hopefully these kinds of things are streamlined as development continues the thing that i enjoyed most from playing was seeing the potential this game has i m looking forward to seeing how it evolves as time goes on as the possibilities are endless keep up the excellent work slavic magic i look forward to seeing what you do with this
