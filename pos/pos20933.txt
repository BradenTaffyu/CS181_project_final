2016 words can t sum up how amazing this is it s the best game i ve ever played period you may think that this game is about time travel and girl drama and technically it is but it s so much more than that too you feel like you know the characters after a while the entire game is relatable for a person my age and nostalgically good for anyone older the game addresses tons of real life situations that are impactful and affecting in a very interesting way especially with the time travel the story progresses very well and is a good blend of emotional funny interesting fast slow and intriguing time travel gameplay element doesn t feel very gimmicky at all it fits very well into the game graphics are very good usually a lot of stuff is stylized and things that don t need to be high detail aren t but it fits perfectly into the graphical style of the game voice acting is spot on even including the usually ommitted regional vernacular hella of the bay area cool to have a game so close to home too with the local slang and the awkward teen dialect that does exist basically everything is 10 10 except the lipsync play this game and you will cry hella this game ate my soul except in a good way 10 10 have played over 3 times over again already and would do it again listen to the soundtrack almost daily
