2023 note i put almost 1 000 hours into this game before the steam release i see a lot of reviews on here complaining about pay 2 win features as a person who has put as much time as i did while spending zero dollars i can say wholeheartedly that you can absolutely enjoy this game without spending a dime there are two in game currencies in mtga gems and gold if you do the daily quests at the bottom of the home page you can start accruing gold through meeting the requirements in any game mode you can use the gold to buy draft tokens the top tier draft costing 10 000 gold each draft adds the cards you draft to your collection and you get pack and gem rewards depending on how many wins you get before three losses grind the gold save your gems and when you have enough spend the gems on the season pass it becomes exponentially easier to get gold cards and gems after unlocking the season pass from there you can keep the cycle up make fun decks try different game modes keep it interesting and when wasn t magic expensive pay to win paper magic was never free this game gives you the opportunity to do everything for free so enough with the complaints final pros cons steam version initially runs very well compared to my old installs less loading less glitchy f2p model isn t that difficult to grind around new card sets come out quarterly keeping the gameplay fresh and the meta changing tons of redemption codes available to get a head start as a new player just google mtga card codes and you can get a head start on building your decks tutorial and beginner friendly modes like explorer help the learning curve flashy visuals and cool sound effects only 1v1 matches no chat function just emote wheel which is pretty much just as toxic as chat sore losers roping running the timer down when losing to drag out a game fair share of toxicity in the community but what game doesn t have that nowadays overall this is the best digital version of magic in my opinion i find tons of enjoyment in the game without paying a cent just make sure to read the cards as you play 9 10 would attack the face again for free
