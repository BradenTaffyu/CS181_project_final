2017 arma 3 is the best military simulator that i have ever played it s a very realistic game with endless possibilities and a community that adds so much content it actually looks like real life warfare and you feel like you are on the battlefield but you actually have to work in team if you want to get the maximum experience out of the game there is no fake environment sounds every bomb step and bullet that you hear is actually being shot by another player and you feel the adrenaline whenever you start getting under fire that s what i love about this game it feels real however the game isn t optimized that well overall i would not recommend this game to people who only like really arcade shooters like cod but if you like realism in your game play this game is worth every cent
