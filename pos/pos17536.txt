2017 yes it is expensive but this review is not about the price tag but about the game i have been buying the series on release ever since shogun i but this time i felt sceptic about the game and decided to wait a bit in the end i probaly should have waited a little longer for a decent sale to pay a decent price i am glad i didn t i feared the game would be poorly balanced because of all the corny magic flying generals oversized warhammers and and big ss monsters but in fact it is balanced quite well this is probably due to the years of experience with the tabletop battles and whatever pricelabels games workshop puts on their products they always make sure they are basically sound they have to keep up to their reputation having said that i need to point out the quite obvious it is set in the warhammer setting so you do have to stomach punk headed giantslayers bomb dropping gyrocopters goblin doomdivers and over the top undead if you cannot deal with these this game is not for you if you can however and you are into fantasy battles you will enjoy it pros and cons on the plus side are the fact that diplomacy for the first time actually works you can form effective alliances make conbfederations and direct your allies to actually help you the fantasy elements work really well it is a fun combination of magic steel monsters men you get attached to your generals and can level them individually and allocate magical weapons to them you can rename settlements and heroes the race generic characteristics are great if you play orcs you will have to continue fighting otherwise your troops disintegrate if you play dwarves you bear grudges if you play elves you can conquer all but not very efficiently not all races can occupy all types of settlements humans cannot conquer dwarf holds this is a fun aspect that also creates ruins the feeling of doom when the hordes of chaos and beasts arrive you can fortify your cities well enough to leave them i actually failed during my first empire campaign you will want to play the game trhough with all factionson the downside are the strategy elements are quite simple management of cities is not overly exiting and is very much like the rome ii campaign the ai is quite predictable in battles battles are usually either too difficult or too easy and it is all to tempting to click on the automatic resolve button the difficulty level is maintained by favouring non player economics a faction with two cities can field huge armies a player is not able to do the same even if he controls a vast empire it is too easy to buy special units and it is all too expensive d
