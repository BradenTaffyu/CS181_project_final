2022 1 cloud sync issue maybe only me i had lost my progress twice because of this issue the second one happened because the cloud sync suddenly turns on by itself and overwrites my save i recommended to disabling cloud sync in the game properties and always backup your last game saves the game itself always backup your game once per day on your first run that day i don t know if it was intentionally feature 2 poor no internet connection issueif you play this game with poor internet or no internet connection some issue might be happened 2 annoying things happened to me were in game achievements you already unlocked keep popping out on your screen endlessly achievement not registered i remember when beating the giant the in game achievement pop up but when i check steam and in game progress that achievement wasn t unlocked yet 3 true ending is locked behind the hardest difficulty nightmare and to unlock nightmare difficulty you have to beat all previous difficulty
