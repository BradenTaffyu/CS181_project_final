2018 i had to think for a while about how i wanted to write this review not only because wh2 is a great and complex game but because of how it fits into this trilogy of warhammer games i want to come out by saying that i think warhammer 2 is a great game if you don t know anything about warhammer don t worry the game gives you the basics of what you need to know about the lore to show you how that fits into what you are doing in the gameplay and if you want to know more you will find that this game is a great stepping stone into the rich world of warhammer if you ve never played total war this one has the best tutorial system thus far it carefully walks you through the basics of how to move units and manage your empire the library of tutorial videos made by youtubers that is available in game is also great the reason i think it s great is because it builds upon what its predecessor did in a constructive way in warhammer 1 the end game challenge of needing to face armies of chaos warriors was interesting however inevitably the general total war gameplay of expanding your empire took center stage and really the chaos invasion didn t really take that long to kill once you knew where they come from the best strategy was to try to kill the chaos warriors near where they spawned but the problem with that is that you fight chaos in one part of your empire while the other parts can sort of sit around and while the chaos invasion wasn t there you would often get stuck grinding out these wars on one or two fronts agains the same enemy which becomes repetitivewarhammer 2 improves on this by spreading your resources out and focusing more on the vortex race with the vortex race the repitition of fighting the same enemy multiple times on one front is broken up since you periodically need to move your forces back to defend the homeland from attacks from multiple angles this switches both the enemies you fight against as well as the terrain you fight them on in addition you can t easily camp the spawn of these enemies because some of them come from multiple angles and there are also the possibility of intervention armies by enemy factions they force you to spread out and take engagements with the enemy across your empire many say that the vortex race is flawed because you don t really need to participate in the race i don t see this as a problem if you want to play the race you can and if you prefer the traditional total war gameplay that s fine too it s a matter of letting the player play the game the way they want the new occupation system is also great factions can now all occupy wherever they want with some penalties for unfavorable climates what this means is that is varies how the ai and you will populate the map combined with vortex ritual resource sites it means that these mutli turn sea voyages to found colonies in faraway lands are actually useful and feasible in doing so you gain access to valuable ritual resources as well as unique building scattered around the map with insane bonuses in warhammer 1 it was advantageous to keep your empire somewhat connected and homogenized which was problematic because it limits the number of places you can fight on and it often means your campaigns play out similarly each time speaking of warhammer 1 if you own that game you also gain access to the mortal empires expansion which melds the campaign maps of those two games once the third one comes along they will also be giving out that campaign map for owners of all three games in this way it s good that they didn t make this game on a whole new engine or anything so they can all meld together in this way in terms of other good stuff in the game the 4 factions lizardmen skaven dark elves and high elves are all great and fun to play with i won t go too far into that because many other reviews also cover that my favorite is the skaven since i like all the war machines and contraptions they have cons and other stuff many people complained about the dlc in warhammer 1 and it s no secret that this game will have just as much if not more dlc and flc the argument that developers shouldn t charge so much for dlc is stupid here if you feel that the base game is worth it for whatever price you paid then that s good but we shouldn t attach extra content to our evaluation of the base product the value proposition of dlc and the base game should be evaluated seperately and yes in my opinion it is entirely possible to get enough enjoyment out of a game to cover as much as this game will likely cost with all content which will be well over 100 therefore my review only encompasses the base game though i will tell you that the tomb kings dlc is a great buy as well one disappointing thing is that norsca from warhammer 1 has not made it into warhammer 2 because of scheduling issues between when they made norsca and when they made warhammer 2 that made these two pieces of content unable to be merged this is an issue because it means you will face boring armies from the norscan tribes in the north and owners of norsca can t play their race in this game i know ca is trying hard to get it in the game but it s unfortunate that it had to turn out this way mortal empires is also a little rough around the edges but it s improving with every patch and i m hopeful it will be great by the end of warhammer 2 s development cycle this is a new process for ca and i m not surprised there are some hiccups in the beginning
