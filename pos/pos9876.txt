2016 early access review i have two questions why is this game early access and is it the best game ever made 108 hours and i only installed it a week ago obviously i ve not slept much and had to take 3 days off work dont buy this game it will wreck your life as it has mine i installed it at the same time as doom and mad max and i ve not even looked at those this game now controls me i will say the first 5 minutes i almost rage quitted as couldn t make anything do something i m glad i made it through those first few minutes although it came at a cost of insomnia so i normaly play games on a hard level no reason to be any different here with a cutsie looking game wrong i chose hard setting and permafrost mode things went well for an hour or so was just building rooms thinking this is nice then a small raid turned up i killed those got some weapons and i m thinking i m great then a flash flood with lightning nothing bad happening with that or so i thought the rain stopped but the lightning carried on for a few more seconds enough time to start 3 small fires miles away i figured i d leave the fires to do their thing then a couple of days later ingame days i was surrounded by this wall of fire my 4 chars are doing their best to stamp out the flames but 4 people with no water dont stand much of a chance and so it turned out a few minutes lates my whole building is burnt to the ground and my people are dying i quit chose an easier setting and kept permafrost mode wrong again had to quit again i m now playing on the second to easiest setting with no permadeath and i specialy chose my survivors before starting this time this game is incredibly fun but you are only seconds away from dissaster and having everything erased right before your eyes my advice is save regulary dont select permafrost or atleast until you know what you re doing i m not sure the 3 storytellers make any difference they all seem to throw anything at you this game is hard but very rewarding you will care about your colonists and even their slightist injury the enemies are not clue dead either they will look for cover to shoot from forcing you to do the same so is this game better than rome my favourite game of all time hard to say been so long since i played rome but if i had rome installed i would still be playing rimworld
