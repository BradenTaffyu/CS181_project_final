2022 8 5 10 i ve heard harsh criticism about it when it got released but now it s a great game to play nothing like kicking ass in power armor with your buddies pros alot of weapons armor clothing with ton of customization options same goes for base building a great community full of generous and friendly people a great expierience travelling alone through the wasteland and even better with friends alot of diverse enemies to face cannot say the same for bosses though many fun events where you can have a blast playing with friends huge map with alot of content various fun quests that can be done alone or with friends ability to choose to engage in pvp or not fun and exciting pvp cons brotherhood of steel in appalachia doesn t make sense it s kind of forced there the game could use more bosses your reputation doesn t go down even if you kill settlers raiders few of the power armors look out of place and don t fit the fallout theme
