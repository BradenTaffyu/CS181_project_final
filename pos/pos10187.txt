2023 overall impression tl dr rimworld is an excellently designed colony building simulator with rich storytelling advanced relations between pawns and high influence of the environment and various factions on gameplay it offers a very moddable environment including mods allowing for multiplayer gameplay and is a haven for creativity your playstyle might differ every single session with your colonists being either blood hungry organ harvesters or maybe nice peaceful neighbours offering free beds trying to recruit others into their fold if you were looking for an exciting colony management game search no more with ludeon studios being a small self published developer that s even eager to lower the prices of their product for the sake of availability you would certainly be supporting the right guys final rating follow vaporlair for more reliable recommendations experience gameplay lore in rimworld your primary task is to keep your colonists from dying and fend off potential attackers that might want to steal some of that wealth of yours you ll do that by providing means of defense barricades weapons armour naturally your colonists cannot live off their military lifestyle only you will have to provide them with sustenance clothing recreation each pawn has its individual happiness meter that is influenced by its traits ideoreligion if you decide to get the dlc and relations with others the ultimate goal of your plays is to leave the planet by building a space ship and flying into the unknown but most likely you d rather dwell on the surface of your rim planet for a longer time gameplay is vastly diverse and allows you to make money in various ways selling organs to traders becoming a drug baron being a legitimate art creator and large rug baron or maybe simply raiding nearby sites belonging to other factions tribes outlanders even a certain fallen empire it is all possible virtually everything is gatherable and changeable the only limit is the sky and well that overhead mountain roof that will fall on your colonists if you won t take measures while digging your underground base one thing that isn t mechanically possible however is creating multi layered bases there are no first floors or cellars in rimworld which would likely bring it somewhat closer to dwarf fortress in terms of gameplay but i feel there s enough surface to manage the colonists needs if there is not you can have more than one colony at the same time it s a game about settling after all from the lore perspective rimworld does a good job showing humanity s post apocalyptic future it is all described within backstories of the characters virtually all you meet in their childhoods and adulthoods descriptions of factions and events tell us a rather grim story about overuse of technology attempts to genetically modify rather terrifying creatures create self sufficient mech hives that turned against their creators and well a lot of pollution and havoc this all holds together and creates an oddly realistic environment where player faction is but a little player on the scene and has no major influence over the things but our colonists can thrive in all of this if we only play cards well audiovisuals graphics audio visually rimworld is a pleasant game with lots of textures to different objects these are usually simplistic minimalistic but working well together and allowing for numerous combinations of structures floor furniture it s a colorful game with lots of customisation options while there are surely titles that put even more effort into graphics but i would say that rimworld is satisfying and there are many many mods that could deepen the experience music in the game is calm futuristic pleasant if you ve ever watched firefly you might notice some interesting similarities or at least inspiration kudos for that after hundreds of hours of gameplay it must become repetitive at some point but it wasn t ever irritating to me fortunately there is a lot of space music to support yourself with while playing have you for example listened to space a hole made for red guerilla and adapted to space station 13 well with what some of your colonists will be doing let me tell you it is more than good optimisation mechanics bugs the game runs alright when unmodded a decent pc will manage with a full colony provided that the population density isn t ridiculously high and the map isn t very large animals might lag your game both wild and your own so it is important to remember that culling option exists there s a lot the player themselves can do to prevent the lag i wouldn t say it s ideal but with rimworld s large scope it s alright bugs well are quickly fixed but that still leaves us with imperfect ai that sometimes makes your colonists do things most stupid pathways entering fire fearlessly only to get burned moving one thing at once despite having a lot of space in one s inventory all that fortunately rimworld has a large modding community that s endorsed by ludeon studios hence to these issues you can easily find a fix hopefully they can find themselves in the base game someday tags strategy base management sci fi
