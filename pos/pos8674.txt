2018 i have never been hunting have never wanted to go hunting and don t feel hunting should be done except for food reasons i have felt that way since i was very young until now i secretly have always wanted to go hunting but i could never reconcile my love of animals with my desire to hunt them down for food now i don t have to with this game i almost feel like i am actually hunting my husband and i sit together while we are playing each taking turns controlling the game we currently share a computer normally when either of us is playing the other is off somewhere else doing something else while playing this though we both want to be around watching the other playing helping them spotting and hearing the animals they are hunting kinda like a rl hunting buddy him having gone hunting before he knows what it is really like and hes even said this game is very realistic in the beginning of playing there were certain things we would mention we wish was available in the game not realizing what we were asking for or wanting to see is already in the game as perks and skills i actually enjoy this part of the game very much as the skills and perks are designed in such a way that having them is not game breaking or overpowered as these all seem to be very close to what you would learn as you hunted more in rl if you are like me and go hunting you wouldn t have any clue how to track or anything when you first start you learn that as you hunt more the animals would be my only complaint but that really isn t the game devs fault we have yet to fully replicate true ai so until that day the animals actions and reactions in game are limited to their programing and how they are designed to respond to certain actions this makes for some interesting animal behavior in game making some of the animals very easy to track and kill or making them run circles around you leaving you dizzy and them trotting off laughing all in all this game is so much fun i absolutely love playing it as for recommending this game i already have to a few people that i think would enjoy something like this
