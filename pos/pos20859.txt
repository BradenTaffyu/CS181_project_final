2023 initial impressions hogwarts legacy is made by some devs who really respect the universe and wanted to put something dope out that fans have wanted for a long time the amount of not only fan service but interesting memorable things for fans to take away from the game makes it something you should not miss out on if you re not going to be playing it because you re worried about the opinions of a hateful woke mob then you re missing out on a great experience if you grew up on some of the old school harry potter games like myself some of my first memories in gaming or even if this is your first game in the series but you enjoyed the books movies you have to play this game neversaynever i might do the devils tango with a trap one day you re not a transphobe or a bigot for playing the fun wizard game thoughts after finishing the game it s really good almost a 10 out of 10 for a fan of the hp universe if you like hp at all you need to play this fact the combat feels so good i didn t think they would be able to make it so responsive and enjoyable to use the mounts and broom control is so dope the main story is the least interesting thing going on in the world but it s still pretty good the relationships and side quests exploring the hugeeeee world is where the real money is for me it is expensive so if you can t afford atm you should wait for a sale but you will have a lot of fun with this one and it really takes a long time to go for 100 or even just play most of the content so i believe you will get your moneys worth
