2023 i m a game developer and i m overwhelmed with how toxic the industry has become in the last 10 years due to greed and venture capital games have transformed from actual toys to play and have fun to machines for juicing and parasiting on users addictions and cravings in that context of our society dave the diver is an amazing relief and gives me back my inner child passion to get back to making videogames that really are fun to play to make an art form with love to make content just for the sake of telling a good interactive story to give a nice moment to people this game is a 10 10 it never stops giving you new content and new core mechanics even in the late game the game has lots of minigames to solve and when you thought you ve seen and perfected all the core mechanics suddenly a new map town or challenge is unlocked with completely new mechanics to learn and master it doesn t recycle too much it doesn t take the easy path its development demonstrates what is really possible when you make something with love and real effort and not just for an easy cash grab i want more games like this i want to make games like this not a single lootbox in sight not a single child becoming a gambler as an adult
