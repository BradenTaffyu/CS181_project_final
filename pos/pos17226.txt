2019 the game itself is great but like a sportscar with no engine the workshop however gives you some nice overhauls some make it more challenging but fair others make it a experience for non hardcore gamers i absolutely love this game butbring us more than 2player coop and reduce the time unseen fractions need to end their turn edit they fixed the issue with ai nations taking up too much time just wanted to add that the devs are still improving the game experience
