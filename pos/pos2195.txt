2021 i bought this game in december 2020 as someone who absolutely loves fallout 3 and 4 here is what i have to say about it when i bought this game about 6 months ago there were a few major issues i had the game was as optimized as a potato and no matter how beefy your machine was it ran like garbage it s fun solo but even more fun with friends not many other people were playing at the time content was somewhat lacking now in june 2021 i don t know what they did but it runs similarly to fallout 4 now much much better it s still cool solo quests feel similar to fallout 4 and with more of my friends to play with it s a blast they ve added the brotherhood of steel and have fleshed out the map more the takeaway this game isn t a blockbuster world shattering experience it feels like fallout 4 but with new lore stories and multiplayer it s tons of fun and has what i would estimate to be 100s of hours worth of playability combat is fun and engaging the lore is good and there s a lot of it most of the environments are pretty interesting and blasting ghouls with friends is satisfying if you re on the fence about buying it i d spend about as much on this as i would on a good movie ticket 10 definitely recommended but not at full price it s good not great if you do end up getting it i m always looking for teammates
