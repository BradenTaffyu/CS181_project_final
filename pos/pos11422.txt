2016 early access review if you love minecraft dayz basebuilding and scavenge this game is made for you if you ever wanted to be an architect but didn t want to play sims or rust then here you are right the game supports very good whatever your style is to play a good zombiegame the mechanics are easy to learn and the controls are okay i haven t played with a controller so i can t say anything about it but with keyboard and mouse its absolutely fine one of the most important things for me to play 7days to die was that i can play on my own or with friends i don t need to login into a world filled with psychos and bad educated kids or people without selfesteem who only get their kick from killing defenseless people torture them or insulting them in the chat enough of ranting about these people they aren t worth a thought tbh i can recommend this game for above reasons and it looks pretty good for an early access the community is very busy and the devs are making constant updates and take care of their fans even the game is still early access it felt never abandoned from the devs who doing a lot of work to make a good game i myself hadn t any problems with the game so far it was always in a stable condition if you like survival with a game that fit your preferences then 7days to die is the right game for you the devs are working hard on this game and always staying in close contact with the community
