2019 dead cells is a masterpiece it is a roguelite metroidvania that requires pure dedication it shows no mercy and requires cat like reflexes it is the most immersive game i ever played there is not much of a story you are a prisoner and you need to escape from the depths of the prison i am not quite sure what you are but each time you die you just crawl back to the beginning as a humonculous and morph into a human like creature with a light for a head you encouter several random events and several bosses but the main storyline is all up to your imagination which is not a bad thing in my opinion the goal is to escape the prison and beat the king there are multiple roads that all lead to the throne room most levels have multiple exits that take you to different levels all the levels are also generated with a seed which you can set yourself no run is the same due all of the random generation and different paths weapons skills etc after you beat the king you gain a boss stem cell you can activate these cells in the starting room and this makes the game a lot harder there are less and less health refill opportunities for example but it also allows you to open doors which can take you to different levels contain powerful weapons or just some extra stuff there are currently 5 stem boss cells and at the end of the game there is a 5 boss cell door which will take you to new grounds you unlock new items by finding blueprints or looting them from enemies and bringing these to the collector between each level once you brought the blueprint to the collector you can spend cells on them to unlock them permanently you collect cells from dead enemies or capsules that you encounter on your path after each level you can spend these cells for permanent upgrades weapons mutations after each boss you can also spend these cells to increase the amount of rare quality items you find these qualities go from none to to to s there are also legendary weapons which have an l in the name any weapon power trap has 1 or 2 colors which represent brutality tactics and survival red purple and green you can level up these 3 skills with the scrolls you find you must choose which one you want to upgrade every skill gives you 15 extra damage for that color and a hp boost that gets lower and lower personally i just level up 1 skill and only use weapons of that color the hp bonus is nothing compared to 15 extra damage there are more than a hundred weapons like swords bows shields traps and other crazy things which all are unique in their own way not a single weapon is the same you have to be lucky to find the weapons you want but every weapon can be powerful be sure to check the stats of the weapon how you crit what modifiers it has like burns or poisons enemies or 50 extra damage to frozen enemies etc you can change these modifiers randomly between each level runes are like permanent powerups that enable you to get to new areas like run on walls stomp through the ground climb on vines and more i would recommend going for these as soon as possible the game has a built in custom mode where you can tweak the game very precisely like which weapons drop or which upgrades you have or anything really and even if this is not enough there is also mod support with steam workshop but personally i would not recommend using mods the game gets easier over time with more powerful weapons and your own skill level mods can very easily ruin your experience dead cells is an absolute must have no run is the same it really stays a challenge for me it is the game of the year i can not give it anything less than a 10 the game is perfect follow my curator page steam cloud save working fine controller support yes xbox one bluetooth working achievements next to impossible fps on ultra steam overlay not working launch command gamemoderun command issues none os arch linux kernel 5 2 11 de gnome 3 32 2 cpu intel i7 6800k 4 20ghz gpu nvidia geforce gtx 1080 nvidia 435 21 drivers
