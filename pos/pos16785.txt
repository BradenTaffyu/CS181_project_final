2021 do you download sims 4 once every year to download a hell lot of custom content and then you are busy for two nights and days straight customizing houses when you are ready and could actually play the game you deinstall it again great then you are like me and then this is your game because you can do exactly this you can t build the actual houses but can work on all the interiour designs the game also supports the steam workshop so there is also a lot of modded stuff you can choose from the game will not keep you tied for several weeks but it is like sims you can always play some hours and come back after some time when you feel like it also perfect while watching a show or stream on a second display the new luxury dlc comes with a lot of additional furniture etc and i really liked the tasks there even better than the base game most important pro for this game it is way cheaper than buying sims 4 all dlcs especially when you just design the houses anyway
