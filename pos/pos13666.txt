2017 i have literally been gaming since the inception of video games i m 45 so pong was where i started my very long gaming hobby through those 41yrs i have played many many games all genres all eras i have never played anything that is like arma 3 before there is sooo much to this game that it is unbelievable you can literally play anyway your heart desires i can t really say anything that has not been said about the game what i can do is dispute a few of the negative comments 1 terrible gfx this is absolute bs arma 3 actually has very good realistic gfx just because someone has a machine and they can only run the game with 100 low settings that doesn t mean the gfx are it means your pc is 2 can t join a server major bs there are thousands of servers from vanilla arma to zombies survival to role play there are plenty of servers that run vanilla arma that require no mods and are very easy to join the game does require a decent pc and internet speeds i am running an fx 8350 fx 480 8g 8g ddr3 and i get 50 60 fps in sop and 35 47fps in mp since the latest patch the game has actually performed better for me with the fps i would definitely recommend the game if you like the fps style military games with heavy teamwork emphasis endless numbers of ways to play 10 s of thousands of user created mods option to play realistic mil sim games zombie survival strict role play endless variety deep emmersion this is probably your game
