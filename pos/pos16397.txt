2016 early access review hello i am ex betatester for this game i m totally in love with this game although i have a couple of points that i want to bring up this is not for people who are easily frustrated by anything this game will make you cry and laugh at the same time this game will make you cringe in total suffer when listening to the voice acting no pun intended this game will ruin your life if you start playing it seriously do not take all of this game seriously this game is a piece of art not a normal game this game is a horrible time eater this game is not a finished product it is still in its development phase this game is totally worth the 15e so go ahead and give it a try f re
