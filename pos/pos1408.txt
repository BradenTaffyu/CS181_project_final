2016 early access review this game is how h1z1 dayz and any survival zombie game out there should be i guess somehow graphics immersion and depth messes up with gameplay so maybe it s impossible for a game like dayz or h1z1 to achieve perfection lelhonestly now my dear dayz and h1z1 devs play this game and learn how it s done and apply to your games for chrissakes
