2020 since i haven t seen many others mention this its worth to note that the trigger warning should be taken pretty seriously and while i recommend the game to everyone because its phenomenal maybe wait until you are in a good mindset before playing it through the game is still fantastic in every single way though art the music characters gameplay the story easily one of my favorite games of all time
