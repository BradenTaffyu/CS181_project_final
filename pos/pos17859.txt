2023 after 3000 hours on coh2 and 10 years of memories it s time for this game to carry the torch a little more arcade feeling than the last installment however workshop is already in place and maps are already pumping out can t wait for wikinger spearhead mods to drop let s hope we never see another bugsplat update i am sorry i have never been more excited for something and so wrong to judge but this game is utter garbage it literally spits on the entire franchise nothing has been fixed since launch content is a slog and incredibly slow the developers refuse to release modding tools to rival that of coh2 so some mods aren t able to be fully fleshed out as they were in earlier installments same boring content and microtransactions feels like someone fell asleep on this and nothing is being done other than balancing which doesn t make sense because the little content that has been released is blatantly op they tried hitting 3 different birds with one stone and missed all three it s obvious they do not care they are doing little to nothing to fix it the lads and i who have over 3000 hours from the other franchise installments have almost entirely remapped out game nights with playing call to arms ostfront this is just sad to say the least that this is the state of coh2
