2014 early access review for some reason many of the negative reviews seem to have been voted most helpful but if you look at the gameplay hours on the negatives compared to the hours people have on the positive reviews it s clear that this game has a very loyal dedicated fanbase and oodles of replay value in a crowded field of zombie survival games or just plain survival games this one stands out for several reasons first off is the fact that the enemies pose so much of a threat that it really encourages cooperation this game is a must to play with friends there s something really satisfying about building up your defenses setting up traps and then fighting together to survive the night it s something that minecraft hints at and fortnite promises if it ever gets released but this game delivers the pvp features are a bit lacking and being an early access alpha title there are quite a few missing features bugs glitches and security issues cheats and hacks are still a problem on public servers however as a co op base building tower defense horde survival type game this one is tough to beat 7 days to die is a genuinely fun game blending the crafting building and destructibility aspects of minecraft with the over the top frenzied action of serious sam or dungeon defenders where the enemies come at you in almost overwhelming numbers it s already a blast to play and continues to get better and better with each new patch if this is what they ve managed to come up with for an alpha release i can t wait to find out what the finished product will look like don t let the haters fool you look at how much time the positive reviewers have put into this game pick it up make friends play it with them and go nuts building and killing zombies you won t regret it
