2022 i ll admit fallout 4 is a downgrade entry to the franchise compared to the classics and 3 nv as much as it offers an enjoyable gameplay experience and a mildly gripping story it is far from the rpg elements satiric and political storytelling that has made fallout what it is over the years it is a great game for sure but it s an average rpg i honestly would have loved it if bethesda had given the game s interactivity the effort they put into insignificant details that are not even remotely related to fallout such as construction and settlement management if you re like me and you like to completely devour an rpg in your first playthrough you re gonna need more interactivity than fallout 4 offers otherwise the vanilla game won t satisfy your expectations and you ll end up installing quest mods after quest mods i d offer fallout 4 to anyone it s honestly a fun experience that i m sure you will enjoy regardless of its errors and rough edges but if you are as into fallout lore and universe as i was you might find it a bit disappointing
