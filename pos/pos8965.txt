2016 first thing first the game works flawlessly on linux the graphics are beautiful and the game runs smooth even on my laptop which has an intel graphic card using the open source intel driver second this is paradox game with the best tutorial i ve ever seen it also helps that the ui design is way way better than their other titles also last but not least the gameplay oh man it was ridiculously addictive and deep playing for just 2 hours i ran into all kinds of anomalies while exploring the galaxy making the task of sending a ship to explore unknown stars feel like an episode of star treks from space whales to long lost civilizations and we haven t even got to other factions yet in short think moo2 but with all the goodies you expected from paradox grand strategy game each government has its own unique mechanics each ship is commanded by a captain that has attributes a la ck2 lite hell even your goverment is run by a politician who also has attributes and gained experiences each planet has pops that works factories or labs and these pops would also influence how your government is run hell this game is basically the culmination of paradox grand strategy games and a very refined one at that i d write more but i need to get back to my empire i feel like i barely scratch the surface of what this game has to offer so tl dr is game is good really really good from the gameplay to graphics to sounds paradox really hit the homerun with this one
