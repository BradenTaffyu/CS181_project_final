2020 ori and the will of the wisps wotw is a long awaited sequel to the wonderful 2015 title ori and the blind forest a game that captured my heart with its smooth platforming beautiful visuals and emotionally powerful soundtrack in a developer interview moon studios stated that its goals for ori and the will of the wisps was to truly realize those points in a game that would truly take our breath away how did they do spoiler they nailed it they nailed it in almost every possible way visual design the visual design of wotw is truly an example of what the unity engine can produce when pushed by a team that really knows what it s doing opting for a more child like storybook flavor of highly saturated colors the game still manages to keep a level of maturity that bleeds from every nook and cranny foreground elements are crisp detailed and dynamic background elements provide plenty of richness and the out of focus elements in front of the play space and in the background provide wonderful visuals to convince the player that this world is 3d i especially love the use of silhouetted elements in front of the play space as the faster moving objects closer to the camera convey a sense of speed and agility that wouldn t be present otherwise each of the areas uses a distinct color palette to provide clear distinction when moving from one zone to the next it s hard to fault the visual design of ori as the number of dynamic elements is the perfect blend between living and cluttered i would like to draw special attention here to the camera work its sometimes subtle and other times less so movements and zooms really push the cinematic angle to a new level here utilizing real world camera techniques such as soft focuses and caddie zooms to draw the player s attention in a similar method as would be used in film sound design and score soundtrack in short i was blown away gareth coker should absolutely be listed as one of the greats when it comes to score and soundtrack this game s music simultaneously sounds like no other game but is somehow familiar for those that have played the first game gareth coker s direction here was to modernize the sound a little bit adding more pads soft bass elements to really help glue tracks together once again providing that cinema feel and the mixing is expertly handled with the music providing as strong a backdrop as the visuals special attention here goes to the boss themes each phase of a boss fight has a perfectly handcrafted progression that really showcases the flow of battle with the unique music for a given boss starting the fight and providing the thematic elements and as the player progresses through the fight the song incorporates various versions of ori s new theme the end effect is a very subliminal motivation to the player to really feel like they are overcoming a challenge and are on the cusp of victory as ori s theme strikes loud and true while maintaining the elements introduced by the particular boss fight the final boss fight really hammers this home as the fight enters its final phase and provides a beautiful heart pounding climax to the gameplay sound design sound design is also handled with care and the different weapons surfaces and enemies all have unique feels no complaints here directional sound is also handled really well and doesn t feel overly panned gameplay platforming and movement much like its predecessor s mechanics the movement systems of ori 2 are extremely fluid in fact even moreso than the first game the introduction of some new mechanics and movement abilities really allow the player to effectively fly through the maps at breakneck speeds by the end ledge detection is also really solid and ori properly mantles a ledge about 95 of the time the new abilities also work really well with the old ones not overshadowing them in anyway but augmenting their usefulness instead this is especially evident when running spirit trials a new feature in the game that uses various sections of the map as asynchronous racing between players these time trials were quite fun to go back and try to shave off hundredths of a second as a mini speedrunning challenge this may actually be the first game where water combat feels nearly as fluid as airborne land based combat and speaking of which combat combat is probably the single area in which ori improved the most from first game to second game taking cues from games like hollow knight ori 2 ditches the old spam a single button until things die method instead opting for an arsenal to choose from providing varied combat options where although some feel stronger than others none of the options are flat out non viable and you can store 3 abilities on your hotbar giving you quick access to multiple options personal note it s not the best option out there but the yeet hammer as my friends call it is immensely satisfying to use the game also introduces an interchangeable upgrade system called shards once again taking cues from hollow knight s charm system that allow you to augment your combat and or movement at will giving you multiple ways to play and succeed some builds are extremely tanky others are glass cannon both are capable of winning you can beat the entire game without ever using a shard and there s an achievement for doing as such and playing against your more comfortable builds can make for some interesting challenges the game will probably take around 12 18 hours for first playthrough doing 100 completion a non completionist run will obviously significantly shorten down the time required i consider myself pretty competent at platformers and my first run which was a 100 run took 16 hours on the dot this game also has difficulty settings which modify enemy health enemy damage and the cost of upgrades if a boss fight or escape sequence is giving you a particularly hard time the game offers you the option to abandon the challenge as well story the story of wotw picks up where the first game left off so if you haven t either beaten or watched a full playthrough of the first game i would highly recommend doing so first avoiding spoilers here i ll say that the story was decent i think that the game introduced certain characters that could have had much more impact on the story and progression and they did feel like they were just kind of there but otherwise inconsequential it still takes you on an emotional rollercoaster a la blind forest and serves its purpose well but i do think there could be a couple major improvements here overall rating visual design 10 10 sound design and score 10 10 gameplay 9 5 10 story 9 10 overall rating 9 7 10 highly recommended at asking price the game also goes on sale somewhat often and is a steal at anything below normal price edit formatting
