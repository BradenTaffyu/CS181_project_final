2017 started game chased by wolves into the darkness i died new game got hungry tried to steal tallbird egg tallbird didn t like that i died new game getting the hang of things tried to pick a harmless eyeball shaped plant plant wasn t harmless i died new game found touchstone learned to abuse savestate mechanics dying becomes nearly impossible winter came i died don t starve is a creepy cute survival game in which you re made to learn through mistakes and in which the slightest mistake can kill you and erase all your progress i m currently 74 days into a run but not without a little abuse of the game mechanics don t stave is a hard rogue like in that the instant you die your entire world and all your progress is erased but there are a couple resurrection items in each world that let you respawn once after death and i ve found that there s a few seconds between dying and resurrection in which you can safely quit the game without it saving over your file basically it s the old pokemon trick if you accidentally kill the legendary just reboot your save file and everything s fine is this cheating probably kind of not as much as the time i played through this game s entire adventure mode with god mode turned on because i so badly wanted the character you unlock at the end i know i m that kind of player in my defense the adventure mode of this game is just absurd i ve put more hours into this game than into all my other games combined and i think that fact alone should show how fun it is it s a sandbox game in that there are no set objectives but there are so many things to do in the game that forming your own objectives is easy and natural it s pretty obvious when you run across something you haven t accomplished yet surviving through winter unlocking the magic tab collecting the parts to the teleportato and in order to accomplish it you usually have to master some new aspect of the game in my current save file i have survived two winters walked around the entire overworld map hunted down mactusk survived and slain the mighty deerclops and built a base with six farms two bee boxes and a nearby spider den which i m pretty sure could sustain me indefinitely without me having to move beyond my line of berry bushes all this and i ve still only scratched the surface literally there s a whole cave world below the surface world and a ruin world below that which i ve only read about so far the only downside to this game is the roguelike element in that every time you die you have to start over but the randomly generated world makes starting over kind of fun especially with the option to try new characters and once you have the basic survival tools there s a million directions you can go in most of which you won t have touched in previous playthroughs i will say however that the dying does get annoying especially when so many of your deaths feel like like those eyeball plants that attacked and killed me before i could figure out what they were or the wolves which will never stop chasing you or even give you time to craft something to defend yourself or all those times a monster attacked my campsite at night forcing me to run in circles around my fire as the light slowly burned out basically if at any moment you aren t prepared for everything it probably means you re about to die the only reason i can ignore this is that i would quickly quit my game whenever i was about to die but without cheats the permadeath mechanic makes progress in this game infuriatingly difficult but incredibly rewarding when it does happen i d give it an 8 10 10 10 if savestate abuse is counted as a game mechanic
