2022 early access review by far one of the most complete early access titles to date yes the main content is locked for the official title release but the amount of extra side content blows it out of the water hehe see what i did there compared to other early access titles a lot of side content to enjoy after you ve caught up on all the main content i m 17 hours in maxed out on several upgrades but have not hit the content ceiling just had a few additional contents unlock for approx 25 30 even at early access you are getting your money s worth
