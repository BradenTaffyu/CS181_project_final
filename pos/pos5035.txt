2022 in my opinion gameplay wise the best fallout game out there tho the story isnt the best it still tackles some interesting topics the gunplay is the best out there and you can customize and modify any piece of armor and each weapon you find the dlc s are also pretty fun to play far harbor has the best story by far and ofcource as is tradition with each bethesda installment you can mod the out of it
