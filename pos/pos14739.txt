2018 there really should be a maybe button do not spend more than 20 on this game for any reason i was hesitant at first and then just bought it at full price because my need for instant gratification wouldn t allow for the patience needed to wait for the game to be discounted seriously no more than 20 or you ll be dissapointed and yes i am dissapointed nearly everything i loved about my favorite civ game civ iii is totally gone civ 4 changed alot but the game was so much of a challenge and had so many different and new ways to go about a victory i ended up falling in love civ 5 kept that tradition of change but still kept me loving the new civ civ 666 just doesn t do that at all what they have managed to do is change everything that i had come to like about civ 3 5 and now we are left with an empty shell of what used to be a great strategy game my first thoughts during my first runthrough was the mechanics of it all seem almost like they wanted to make this a mobile app and changed their minds at the last minute all that being said i did end up getting used to it and tollerating the game as a new strategy game not as a new civ installment because i don t care what the title says it isn t so spend 20 on it and be confident that that is a fair price to pay for a new nation building strategy game that was inspired by the best but isn t a civ game just looks like one
