2018 this review was written as of version 1 05 on september 30 2018 two point hospital is the successor to theme hospital in fact two point studios is actually comprised of former bullfrog employees if you have played theme hospital then you know what you re getting into if you re jumping into tph under the impression that this game is a hardcore hospital management game you will be disappointed this is not a deep management game like cities skylines prison architect or transport tycoon deluxe the management side of the game is fairly shallow comprised of little more than hiring training and paying staff the staff training is probably the deepest system in the game and it is little more than picking the right skills for staff based on where they work for example having a nurse train in ward management if they re assigned to wards or a doctor train in surgery if they re assigned to an operating theater with that being said let me detail a bit more about the game the game runs on the unity engine unlike theme hospital which was limited to one camera angle and 2d sprites looking at a hospital from an isometric perspective tph allows full 360 degree rotation and pretty generous zoom to allow you an up close look or a well zoomed out view all models are 3d models with a cartoony design i also enjoy the diversity of staff in th all doctors and janitors were male while all nurses and assistants were female in tph all staff can be either gender on the audio side of things the tannoy returns and while not the same voice actress from th she sounds identical to me for those of you who do not remember the tannoy she s the announcer on the pa with little quips as you play the hospital the radio also has a nice selection of suitable music and jingles interspersed with one of three different radio djs these djs have their own unique personality and oftentimes expand on the lore of two point county other sound effects in the game are suitably comedic and or whimsical unlike true management games you do not have free reign to build a hospital from scratch each level gives you a footprint that you re limited to so you must build as effeciently as you can i never really saw this as a hinderance as the smaller levels have a limited selection of illnesses you must treat there and the later levels are large enough to give you plenty of space to build everything you need to meet what comes your way for those who want a more sandbox y type of hospital the last level will send every illness your way and you have a large uniform build area to work with many people have claimed that the game is far too easy and boring most of these reviews have less than three or four hours in the game which means they ve barely had time to get past the tutorial levels the first four levels are simple to complete taking about forty five minutes to two hours to reach three stars in they re meant to be easy as they ease you into each of the systems the game has by level five mitton university you re now tasked with training your staff and the requirements for hospital stars are no longer as simple as they were by the last levels you re looking at spending hours in one level to reach a three star rating i ve also seen people compare the ingame kudosh currency to mobile phone game currency let me be clear that there are no microtransactions in this game kudosh is a secondary currency that allows you to permanently unlock new decorations and objects to place in your hospital you get kudosh by completing tasks that you can view from the map screen or researching it in a research department you can also get it for completing in level challenges and emergencies i found that i had already unlocked almost every item with kudosh by the end of the fifth level it s like a county wide currency whereas actual funds used to build your hosptal are on a per level basis the number of illnesses is astounding i do not have an exact number but i would guess in the realm of fifty or so many of them are pharmacuetical physchological surgical dna lab or ward based in nature while the remainder have their own treatment clinics light headed 8 bitten animal magnetism cubism grey anatomy jest infection pandemic premature mummification shock horror and turtle head all have their own specific treatment rooms the current downside to all of this is that many of these rooms don t have enough decor to make that room visually stand out cryptology clinic premature mummification and clown clinic jest infection have dedicated decor to increase room attractiveness and prestige and make it visually different the others tend to be pretty bland in comparison requiring you to spam decor that doesn t match the theme of the room to reach a higher room rating that being said higher room ratings are not necessarilly better the better a room is the higher your hospital s level the higher your hospital s level the more patients you get if your hospital is too high of a level you ll be unable to handle the stream of patients coming in so maximizing every room is not really a good idea in the final level i ended up having eight reception desks and eight gp offices just to handle new patients i then had another two to four gp offices in my diagnosis wing to send patients to the proper treatment room after being dignosed elsewhere this is where most of the complaints i see come from people who ve expanded their hospital before they were ready and suddenly being inundated with queues they could not manage there are some bugs in the game such as less than ideal ai for example when a patient leaves to use the bathroom he keeps his place in the queue holding up the whole line things like that can compound queueing issues so for the time being it s betetr to build hospitals without food drink or bathroom access to patients i know it s not how the game is meant to be played if you re going for realism but it s also not a game breaking bug there are a couple other issues but nothing i ever felt broke the game for me and the more serious bugs have already been fixed in the multiple patches that have come out since the game released will update this for 1 08 soon
