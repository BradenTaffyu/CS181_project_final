2016 coming from fallout 3 with the positives and negatives that resided there i was wary of new vegas i came in expecting to be bias against it and instead came out with one of my favorite games of all time new vegas offers a unique experience with nods to prior entries in the series and adds affecting quests and intriguing choices its strengths however come in the form of its dlc the main plot of vegas is interesting and allows you a large amount of ways to go about the end but what stands out is the story behind the sierre madre dead money finding out who randall clark is honest hearts learning what s really going on in the big mt old world blues and figuring out a part of your past and what you left behind in the divide lonesome road obsidian tells stories that stay with you and nothing does it better than new vegas
