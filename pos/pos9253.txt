2016 love this game paradox makes the best strategy games and they support their products akin to an mmo so many free content updates updates extremely replay able exploration is interesting and feels fun and mysterious multiplayer with friends works great technology research is varied and interesting seems more educated advised than most space games i have played tons of customization tons of randomization empire creation is fun and thematic choices affect entire playthrough random events add flavor to the game fun diplomacy is lacking in complexity winning conditions seems tacked on you have to ignore winning to rp if you aren t militaristic combat wars are a little dull sector ai is minimal in a bad way ship designer is a cool idea however the implementation leaves little flexibility or imagination as you grow in size minor tasks can become tedious potential to very easilly systematically steamroll other empires if you know what you are doing planet habbitability could be handled better not enough solar system diversity e g haven t seen multiple stars in a system too many habbitable planets they should be more rare and more special and hold more value all in all it is a very fun game great to play with a friend and a lot of my cons are currently being improved on for the next patch most of the cons may be gone by the time you read this you can be certain that paradox will improve the game already a fun game as is and only will be getting better highly recomend paradox and stellaris
