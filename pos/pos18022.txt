2023 recommended only with divide et impera mod available through steam workshop without this mod rome ii even with all its updates remains mediocre and less interesting than some of the other total war titles i e shogun 2 with the divide et impera mod this game is highly recommended for those that are interested in this time period lots of historical context is provided in the event location and unit descriptions note that most of the dlc add value by unlocking more factions and campaigns in the divide et impera mod
