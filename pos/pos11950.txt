2021 i m a bit late to the game here tried it out once on the xbox did not like it but i ve just come off a run of playing a bunch of card builders and rogue like s and this really hit a sweet spot for me didn t want to post until i had beat the game which really i didn t beat but got to the final boss and loved all the 50 hours i put into it easily some of the best hours of gaming i ve ever had never felt like i was being beat by the game every death failure decision was mine great design great random layouts for the levels great shopping music graphics story loved every minute of it i ll keep going back to play it to unlock as much as i can much like hades but probably won t be dedicating as much time to it now that i ve defeated the final boss worth every penny
