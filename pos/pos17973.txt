2023 i like it but i have some misgivings this isn t helped by the fact it took me a good 80 hours just to finish one campaign that length of time can make one grow irritated at certain features so bear that in mind it s a bit rinse and repeat y fight the battle form your lines send cavalry off to fight ranges units or into the backs of the enemy s lines when they collapse play the fun game of selecting cavalry units and trying to click on the routing enemies to mop them up the battles are good and this is an oversimplified look at them but sadly this is more or less how it goes no matter your opponent no matter where you are admittedly it may be very different if you play as different factions as not everyone has the heavy infantry of rome i may find out one day but for now i need a break the army structure is too strict and this causes problems you make an army by starting with a general who then spawns an army with 19 additional slots which you recruit units to you recruit units into this army you do not recruit units from settlements despite the fact that it s your infrastructure that dictates which units you can have your units cannot leave your armies except from being disbanded or by being handed over to another army standing right next to their current armythe number of armies you can raise is driven directly by how your imperium level which is an artificial difficulty system meant to make the game harder to manage the further you progress on the plus side it means there s less scrappy armies bumbling around like you d see in other tw games you and the ai are forced to build big tall armies so why is this a problem you have no flexibility you conquer a settlement you move forward an enemy army can just walk out of the fog of war and walk into your settlement without even fighting you and take it off you this is relentlessly frustrating your settlements have no garrison until you ve rebuilt their buildings which can take a handful of turns even if you don t sack the settlement you need to rebuild the whole lot because it s the wrong culture so it doesn t work for you so you re supposed to just have your army squat there until it s ready to go before moving on how incredibly dull oh well i ll just leave behind a token force who can catch up later right that s how it works in other tw games right wrong as i said your units cannot leave your army you can t leave any of them behind it s your whole army or sweet fa guarding that town until a garrison appears after you ve rebuilt it it essentially increases the amount of armies you need in order to go forth and conquer and those garrisons are incredibly small the garrison is almost the same between a basic city and a level 5 one but even a fully developed city can have fewer units than a half stack army and half of those are basically unarmoured useless plebs mob there s no point to them basically if the ai shows up with one large army with a reasonable arrangement of units they ll outnumber you 2 1 with better units and you don t stand a chance if we had access to a middleweight tier militia arrangement it might be a lot better at the moment your garrison is one strong unit 2 3 decent units and the rest is rabble so why the thumb up it is a good game there s lots of unit variety and some of my issues look like they can be fixed with mods i ve only tried vanilla so far and i know this is an old game that ll never get patched and for all i know more recent titles in the series fix a lot of this but here s what i d do with this game to fix it 1 allow garrison recruitment on a city level i m making 60k a turn i ll happily spend a few thousand on the odd garrison near my borders i m not even talking about troops that i can order to leave the city or wander around just troops who form a garrison and stay there until i disband them 2 bring back the man of the hour mechanic i know this doesn t work in a game where armies aren t allowed to exist without a general but if cities can build their own garrisons see point 1 then maybe at the moment you have to play the family sim minigame and make sure everyone gets married asap and starts having kids this wasn t impressed upon with such importance in the tutorial so i ignored it for the first 60 turns of my first campaign as the menu was confusing regretted it because my political party ran low on generals meaning the other parties had more generals which allowed them to become quite influential it s better if this doesn t happen anyway i digress 3 rework some of the other types of battles earlier i mentioned that the battles can be repetitive this is true but there are a multitude of types of battles in this game which is a welcome innovation you could be storming a makeshift fort camp you could be ambushing your enemy who are in a disorganised marching column but 99 of the time you re just sieging a city or fighting on the plains in a standard lineup perhaps that s just me but there is still room for variety i think it would certainly help the tedium if city garrisons could be more varied and just bigger as stated 4 i know this one s literally me saying do more work but i think that s acceptable here please this game needs more battle maps uncanny that every settlement of a given type happens to look the same it makes the fights all the more repetitive when not only is the town the same shape layout and size but so is the surrounding terrain i can probably count the number of different town fighting maps i recall fighting on on one hand that s kinda bad guys because you need to conquer nearly a hundred of these things to win a standard game earlier titles had cool features like being able to see other cities or islands in the distance depending on the nearby geography compared to that this just feels a bit rushed it s a good game i d say get it on sale if you re interested
