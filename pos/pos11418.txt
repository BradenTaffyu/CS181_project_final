2021 early access review difficulty my 90 year old grandma could play it easy normal hard dark souls graphics ms paint bad meh if turned to full quality graphics i would give it a good graphics don t matter in this game good beautiful masterpiece music bad not special good beautiful price free underpriced perfect price could be cheaper overpriced complete waste of money requirements you can run it on a microwave average high end nasa computer length very short 0 3 hours short 3 15 hours average 15 50 hours long 50 90 hours extremely long 90 110 hours no ending fun i d rather watch paint dry hard to enjoy repetitive actually pretty amusing ride of your life replayability it s a one time experience only for achievements if you wait a few months years definitely aside from rimworld this is the most played game in my library infinitely replayable worth buying no wait for sale yes when explaining it to friends i usually say it s creepy minecraft there s a lot of similarities especially with the bountiful options for base building and harvesting resources it s just got more guns and zombies running this game uses a huge amount of your working memory so make sure to close as many programs as possible when playing if you play for long periods of time exiting both the game and steam after a few hours and then restarting it will free up the working memory you need to make it run smoothly again the community is fantastic and there s some really great mods available online that are easy to install most people turn down graphics quality and turn off voice chat in the settings in order to help with it running tldr if my pc could more easily run the game i would say it s 110 worth it however performance issues do bring it down and i would recommend buying it on sale
