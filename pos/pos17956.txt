2018 i have not left a review because the rocky beginning this game had i tried to get into it many times and yes had some good campaigns but nothing that really brought me in before i knew it attila had come out and i was hooked being an eastern roman empire fan along with dark age buff attila in it s own way is still my favorite total war destructible environment fire that spreads civilians in cities however they come back in late 2017 early 2018 and give a massive update and woah thank you ca for my most interactive enjoyable and balanced campaign yet i did something i have not done since rome 1 and played a full on roman campaign the successions the government options everything political is redone and a bit harder to manage battles in my opinion have improved and last a good amount of time with reasonable moral breaks in most mods they try to improve battle time but the result is 10 20 guys standing against several hundered sieges are much more interesting as the ai will defend in the stages providing inner city street fighting and falling back to inner strongholds something i have not seen since medieval 2 tbh warhammer cities didnt even have inner cities so it had the illusion that the ai was defending correctly just overall a much better fighting experience on the campaign i enjoy the land being broken up into political parties and having to monitor who is supporting what family and if that family is loyal or not enemy empires become surprisingly powerful and provide good enemies i have had struggles on all fronts which has made the experience enjoyable and forcing me to have standing legions stationed at all fronts at all times this limits me from steamrolling which usually happens in total war games when i grow too large i am now 250 turns in on a 4tpy game and still struggling with unloyal parties large foreign empires and threats from smaller local tribes all and all i can say i fully recommend looking into this game as it stands today i feel the emperor edition was what they truely wanted to release back in the day the update that first got me back into rome 2 but were forced into an early release due to deadlines they came back and did a great rebuild of the game and made it the rome 2 we always wanted since rome 1 i ve played total war since shogun 1 and feel rome 2 now holds the seat for their historical series until maybe three kingdoms arrives not the biggest warhammer fan so will not include those 2 games hope this helps in any late rome 2 decision making
