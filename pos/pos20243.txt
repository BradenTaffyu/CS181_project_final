annoying bugs broken builds make a mockery of boss fights plotlines that go nowhere yes this game is guilty of all those things yet i very much enjoyed it and will replay it when dlc s and bug fixes come out i love this rouge trader not only because it s the most 40k experience i had but because under all the bugs broken builds which let s be honest we all enjoy and abruptly ending storylines looking at you sister argenta there is a genuinely good game it doesn t do anything new or tries to redefine genre if you played narrative rpg s ou now the drill but the whole package is thoroughly enjoyably also opticon 22 slowly crawling away is the cutest thing ever
