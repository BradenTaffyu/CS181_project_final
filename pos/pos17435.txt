2019 the diplomacy is epic in this aspect this game is basically crusader kings lite the character centric system is a breath of fresh air in the tw series and in hindsight an excellent design decision it s hilarious to recruit former enemies and force them to fight side by side with people who killed their friends this scale of three kingdoms is absolutely intimidating in land area and gameplay mechanics i was not expecting this learning curve from a aaa title since the trend these days is for video games to hold my hands and avoid hurting my feelings if you want to figure out how a mechanic works exactly be prepared to search online as for map size i thought five provinces ten hours in was decent progress until i zoomed out no sh t china s huge it s awesome if you re into tw games must buy at any price if you re on the fence must try because the game is worth your money maybe wait a while for a discount if you feel 70 bucks is too steep great job creative assembly
