2020 as we all know the news surrounding bethesda and their recent tactics and shady moves with fallout yes i completely understand and get it but we re here to review a game and not the company the worst company for lying is ubisoft but people still buy their stuff so yeah let s move on and review the game so i bought f76 for a massive discount but was a bethesda launcher key so not really much of a loss i do not like the bethesda launcher and i have uninstalled the launcher when i seen it was coming to steam and will never go back so my review is more than valid considering how many hours i have on the other platform graphics the graphics are basically the same as fallout 4 if you ve played and seen that then you understand how these are they are decent enough with the usual bethesda feeling art style not bad at all audio the audio is basic fallout audio with the usual radiation clicking monster noises footsteps it s fallout 4 sounds controls super easy to control and get used too pickup and go lots of key binds to use and not needing them all the menu option is weird when in game you press esc and then z to bring up the menu why i press esc to show the menu in the firstplace if i wanted the map i would press m but okay gameplay and everything else you know the game it s fallout you know how it plays you ve seen the videos you ve seen the gameplays it is f4 made into coop and to be honest i think it is enjoyable the recent update adding npc s is amazing and brought back a lot more fun to the game you can go off with your friends and explore the huge world making bases and camps setting off nukes fighting massive world bosses with friends raiding looting and overall increasing your level with a small grind to xp and cards the game itself has pvp and pve built into one but other players cannot engage in a battle if you do not shoot back yes it can become trolling but you can easily ignore them or just enable passive mode in the settings and you are good to go the dungeons remind me of elder scrolls online where you enter an instance because it seems bethesda cannot make a full open world without loading somewhere all the guns and enemies are different on each region with a decent amount of skill cards to choose from making you improve in certain area s there are private servers but it does cost and i feel this is a little sad brought in yes normally servers cost to run unless dedicated but it s down to the developers so no need to smash and hate the team for that offering a private server at a charge lots of companies charge to run servers i got the game with a friend and he also enjoys the game leveling up exploring looting and raiding we often play this together and do not see all the fuss about it most likely the recent stuff made people angry and i get it but the game it not bad you can build a decent base and even move your base around materials are easy enough to farm with in game events ranging from bosses to inside killing there is always something to do and where to go the level system is based around cards which each card does a different thing so you pay attention to what you what in end game content you ll be overcumbered a lot with the amount of things you pick plus the stash is not big enough and the game has some areas to improve but it s early days and a lot to do like most game s but it s heading in the right direction admittedly there is no other game like this around and makes it a good deep dive into yes the anticheat is not the best right now but it should improve with time and the recent update adding npc s is a game changer like no man sky i believe they ve won back a lot would i recommend the game yes it is a good open world exploring multiplayer game with levelling and i look forward to the future updates now the game is on steam
