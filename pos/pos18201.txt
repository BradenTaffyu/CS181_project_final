absolutely fantastic sequel performance is near flawless even late game with lots of units multiplayer connectivity has been perfect for me and my friends literally zero issues so far visuals are great and everything feels familiar but fresh honestly i am extremely happy with my purchase highly recommended especially if you enjoyed the originals
