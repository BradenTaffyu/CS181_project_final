2016 i grew up playing harvest moon with my mom and it is one of my fondest memories she would always buy me the new one for christmas and we would play it all day filling notebooks full of recipes and discussing which person we hoped to marry although stardew valley has unmistakable similarities to harvest moon it is a masterpiece in it s own right one that is very dear to my heart after all those years playing with my mum stardew valley is complex and simple heartwarming and detailed it s complicated enough that so many hours later i still haven t completed most of the achievements or befriended most of the townsfolk but it s simple and easy enough that i play it almost every night on the couch after work concerned ape has programmed a masterpiece his story is just as heartwarming as the story he created i anticipate each new release and i can t wait to see how far he takes this wonderful game i rarely give games a perfect score but this certainly deserves a ten out of ten
