2015 early access review don t starve is a fun survival sim thing is it even i sim maybe not anyways the single player game got so much hype for multi player boom here it is crazy crap can go on at the same time but you can get trolled if you don t have the server on friends only adding a person makes the game 10x better the downside is that you need to worry about another person food can run out quickly unlike the single player food is everywhere on multi player food is no where near you heck it can be all gone some tips find beffolos grab poop farm traps every hole food traps are hard to make too everyone will take anything my friend and i cut down a whole green area in 10 mintues while in single player it will take some hours or days to do that i m not saying that low food and low materials makes this game bad it makes this game harder the sudden spike of difficulty makes the game better or worst depending if you like hard games you can survive together or die together but you will screw up somewhere in this game soory for the misspells i don t have time to fix jelloapocalypse and blueberrymuffin
