2018 my son and i enjoy plaing this game it funny and kinda trippy too it s all about staying alive and learning survival skills you craft different items such as your axe and hammer and build fire pits but it s not as easy as it sounds it s a point and click game online with friends too and fun for the whole family highly recommended
