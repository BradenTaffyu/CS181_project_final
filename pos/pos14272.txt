2023 early access review i m an old gamer my first pc games were on radio shack trs 80 back in about 1979 so i have witnessed the entire pc gaming evolutionary history after building my first few dyson swarm guns i sat back and watched it populate the night sky i was awestruck thinking back to how much the very simple games of the late 70 s and early 80 s has progressed i could sit back and watch the swarm forming in the night sky while standing on my planet beautiful sight it has been awhile since i have had such a wow moment in a game but i have had a few such moments over the course of gaming in the past 4 decades those games become unforgettable this game is of course very similar to factorio so if you liked factorio as i did you will like this but the scale of the game puts it above factorio in my opinion very addicting there is a combat update coming later this year 2023 which will complete the experience i think it is promised you can toggle combat off if it is not your cup of tea
