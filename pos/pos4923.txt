2016 bugs yes memory leaks yes after you play for 2 or more hours but is it worth it yes it s fallout it s fun it s huge modding community is fantastic story is great so far 75 hours in side quests are interesting companions are cool too they have depth and so far i really like the game i m playing vanilla not far harbour and i use some mods like caliente s beautiful bodies and some home building improvements recommended graphics sound gameplay music overall
