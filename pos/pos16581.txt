2016 early access review oh my where do i start i love this game the car building is so immersive and rewarding and requires either a lot of time or real world car knowledge the less you know the more you ll learn and the more fun you will have the store and money in the game makes upgrading and doing jobs have purpose the game is full of soul and sillyness highly entertaining you should not take this game seriously but you will things will bug out or go wrong and you will lose your eventually though things will go just right and you will feel so rewarded when you turn the key for the first time and the fan belt screeches engine ticks coolant shoots everywhere and so on your heart will race and you will shout with joy then and only then will you begin to realize the depth and love put into the game tweaking and tuning will feel so rewarding and eventually you will have a car you re proud of you ll want to suck so you can get those new wheels and tires you will be terrified to stop on the main road you will hate going to the sauna the game is far from perfect and that is exactly what makes the game so good i have not been so captivated by a game since first playing minecraft back in early alpha this game will get better but don t wait this game is well worth the price and even if you only play it for a few hours you will love it just for the silly fin that it introduces turns up and slams 3 beers for finland viikkkttaaaa sataaannaaaa
