2022 early access review for me projekt zomboid is probably one of the if not actually the best zombie survival game out there so let me tell you why you probably know that already or have read it on the store page projekt zomboid is an isometric zombie survival game with a large open map with multiple smaller and bigger settlements and a lot of nature in between to start you ll need to create your character choose your looks out of a few options and then choose your occopation and traits your occupation will grant you a few skills the burglar is good at stealth lightfooted and can hotwire cars the fireman is proficient with an axe and has quite some strength so each occupation will have it s positives and it s for you and your playstyle to decide what you want to choose additionally there are a lot of traits you can choose from you start with a certain amount of points to spend on traits and once they re spent or you don t have enough anymore to get any additional traits that s it well not exactly there are also negative traits smoker clumsy asthmatic etc that will grant you additional points but they obviously come with a cost you might make more sound can t sprint long distances or you ll need to smoke often otherwise your character might become unhappy if you don t seeing that i already mentioned skills there are quite a lot of them ranging from sprinting to carpentry mechanics trapping foraging and so on each one can be leveled up the more you do that thing so sprinting often will slowly increase your sprinting skill building or disassembling furniture will level your carpentry skill you can also find books throughout the world that once read will help you level up your skills quicker you can also find other readables that ll help you or give you recipes i mentioned happiness of my character what s that about you ask well as with most survival games you need to manage the needs of your character shown as little moodles in game hunger thirst health are the most obvious ones but you can also become unhappy bored too warm too cold or you panic among others these moodles can influence your actions making you slower decreasing your damage slow down healing and so on each moodle can be countered by certain actions obviously so if you re unhappy you can read stuff that makes you happy drink though that can come with it s own downsides or eat chocolate just like in real life dbut enough of traits moodles the bigger threat are the zombies they re the slow type but they re relentless and can become a big issue in larger numbers you can either fight them with melee weapons find ranged weapons like pistols or rifles or you can try sneaking around and avoid them wherever you can but you can t do that all the time and you probably want a safe space so you can either build one your own though that s probably not an option right away or you can break into any of the houses around you and prepare it first thing should probably ber to close the curtains you don t want to be seen by outside zombies right you can also board up the doors and windows which will make it harder for zombies to just break in cause if they bang too long on a window it ll break you found a house with multiple storeys how about setting up a climbing rope out of a window in the upper storey as a safety exit as you can see the amount of things you can do in projekt zomboid are quite big and at first it can be intimidating especially when you don t know yet what to prioritize and where to focus the game also doesn t tell you what to do you do have a survival guide that gives you the most basic tipps but apart from that you re thrown into the world and you re left on your own which isn t necessarily a negative it s great to find things out your own but it can be tough as well there is a great pzwiki though if you want to look up certain things as you might already have guessed the game is pretty complex and detailed but it never feels unfair or illogical i once smashed a window open to a house that was locked and immediately cut myself bleeding i jumped through the window cutting myself even worse through the broken window glassleft in the window and also laying on the ground leaving a bloodtrail i frantically searched the house for bandages took off some sheets from the windows ripped them apart and made a makeshift bandage that stopped the bleeding and my health from going down my noise attracted zombies though so i fled exhausting myself from sprinting i could barely walk now and was very slow trying to get into any car i found though most of them were either locked or out of gas finally i found one drove away to a farmhouse that looked like a nice spot for a base i was so happy i got careless rummaging through the house i opened a door and a zombie jumped me bit my neck and that was basically my death sentence i killed the zombie found a shotgun with some ammo and went outside going down with guns blazing my next character certainly lived longer and was more cautious but it s these things that make the game great the details the love and care put into the game these game it s fantastic every item and clothing is showing on your character it gets dirty you see if your clothes has holes in them oyu leave blood trails if you re wounded you can disassemble a whole car from windows to tires the radio inside brakes engine the music is fantastic too all the little sound effects are great from hearing all kinds of animals in the wild to the scuffling zombies all around you some banging on doors and windows the little scary sound effects playing when a zombie jumps you or turns up around the corner i could probably go on and on about the agme and it s details gameplay etc but if you re even remotely interested in zombie survival games you might want to give this one a chance yeah it might not have state of the art shiny 3d graphics and it can be quite tough at times but that s not to it s detriment on the contrary it has charme fantastic gameplay lots of details and a love and care put into it that you can almost feel
