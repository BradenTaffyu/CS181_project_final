2021 early access review this game is hard but in a good way early on you ll die a lot basically every death will be a learning experience and oh boy is there a lot to learn even now before full release caves of qud has incredible amount of content and replayability it has so many amazing features that i don t want to spoil and different ways to play each character with unique build or playstyle and so so so many secrets that you probably won t ever find or at least not easily ok now for a story time of many things that can happen in caves of qud very mild spoilers ahead one of my latest characters was venturing into cryogenic prisoner cells deep underground in one of mid game dungeons i ve been there once before so i kind of knew what i was getting into making this build very beefy so that i don t die easily i ve reached the cells walked up to one with a prisoner i wanted to kill for loot and to do so i broke a glass wall that was keeping the cryogenic mist inside freezing the prisoner to not get frozen i started blasting into him with my guns and couple turns later even though the cell was still half full of the mist the prisoner managed to break free from the ice trapping him i didn t notice immediately and that was a big mistake since the prisoner was a giant capable of unique skill that causes him to charge and push destroy everything in his way he rammed right into me through the hole i made in his cell and since i was standing right next to another cell full of freezing mist his charge took both me and him through the glass wall into it in a single turn so me him and a 3rd prisoner were now all frozen inside i had a lot of hp even after getting hit by the charge attack but the mist was slowly killing me and i had no idea if my hp will last long enough until the mist empties enough if it even will from the cell so that i can unfreeze and get out of there worse yet the other 2 guys frozen with me could unfreeze sooner then me and kill me while i m frozen my health was almost depleted but luckily i was the one to unfreeze first so i instantly took a healing item and bolted out of there to recuperate and take vengeance later this is one of my most memorable coolest moments i ve had in caves of qud among many if you can get over the tough beginnings this game is a gem that is absolutely worth playing
