early access review update there is now a fail safe for new game 3this game is a good time killer and brain numbing in a good way i lost myself to 10 hours without realizing it and really enjoy the game so far however there are a few things that the devs should consider implementing 1 adding a fail safe are you sure you want to start a new game cause i accidentally clicked new game and lost all my progress 2 adding save files so that you can have multiple stores at once 3 having carts where you can put 6 boxes onto it and pull the cart around the store to stock would help tremendously 4 implementing an inventory count system onto the in game computer 5 adding co op so i can hire my friends to help would be so much fun i think the devs are focused on unnecessary additions like expiration dates theft and competition vendors when really some basic foundation work would be nice to see first
