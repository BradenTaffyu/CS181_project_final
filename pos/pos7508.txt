2022 in anno 1800 you play as a city planner and must build and manage your own city the game is set in the 19th century during the industrial revolution and you must use your resources wisely to grow your city and become a successful leader one of the things i loved about this game is the attention to detail in the graphics the buildings and landscapes are beautifully rendered and really bring the world to life as you progress through the game you ll have to manage a variety of different resources including food goods and workers this can be challenging at times especially as your city grows and your needs become more complex you ll have to make tough decisions about how to allocate your resources and which buildings to construct in order to keep your city running smoothly in addition to managing your own city you ll also have the opportunity to trade with other players this adds an extra layer of strategy to the game as you ll have to decide which goods to produce and trade in order to maximize your profits the multiplayer aspect of the game is well implemented and adds a lot of replayability overall i thoroughly enjoyed my time with anno1800 the graphics are beautiful the gameplay is complex and engaging and the multiplayer aspect adds a whole new dimension to the game i would highly recommend it to anyone who loves city building games
