2017 early access review klei you are officiallly my favorite developer this game is stupid entertaining and difficult it s not that different from don t starve but your way of exploring is mining what kills you here is the environment more than creatures there are too many factors to take into account before expanding like oxygen levels germs air pressure getting stuck stress this is not bad i wanna be a plumber now
