2016 total war warhammer is by far my favorite purchase of this year the factions are incredibly diverse and each have a unique play style the monstrous creatures are very satisfying to use magic could still use a little work though the ai could also use some work but that s been a problem with almost every strategy game ever the post release support is has been amazing creative assembly pledged to release a slew of free dlc and have even added more free additions than originally intended the paid dlc is also quite amazing and done a great job adding some diversity to the campaign
