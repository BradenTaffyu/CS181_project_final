2018 i don t normally tend to write reviews but a recent 48 rating is just unfair in this case it really is impressive how people start about nice changes noone is even forced to use simply use steam beta to play a old version regarding eu4 i m of the same opinion the original game was much better but in stellaris once you take in some mods the expericence is great also most balancing issues 90 until midgame haven t played endgame since the last patch reuslting from the 2 0 patch are fixed by now consider adding some mods if something they changed annoys you regarding the game itself very good price playtime ratio tons of features no two playthroughs felt the same for me so far highly moddable great steam workshop content immersive somehow nice graphics compared with other paradox titles dlcs are like sure to get into sale at some day but you really don t need them to enjoy the game iself
