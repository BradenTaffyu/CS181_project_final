early access review 9 5 10 actual best zombie survival sandbox simulation hidden behind a clunky ui crazy lore unlocks below project zomboid is one of those titles that will remain in early access forever but it is that way for a reason it is one of the oldest ea titles alongside minecraft which has since graduated from ea to still be in development today started by four people and a dream pz is known for its authentic sandbox experience if you play with default settings electricity and water will eventually shut off loot across the vast map will run out to get to the endgame you must plan for all eventualities by setting up rain barrels farms and discover renewable resources methods to sustain yourself while dealing with the growing zombie threat npcs aren t in yet but vehicles have been delivered and have completely changed the game i expect npcs to also make a similar lasting impact or maybe they end up becoming convenient loot boxes who knows pz allows you to fully customize your experience you can set zombies as traditional shamblers fast movers etc loot can be set to replenish over time there s a lot of settings to choose from if you re into that kind of thing there s even an ai director to keep the pacing just right no matter what kind of emergent gameplay or roleplaying experience you want to have pz will make it possible for you pz has great modding support and a greater modding community extending the game in every direction indie stone also incorporates some of them into the base game which is very pragmatic because of the sheer scope it s trying to achieve some modders even get hired which is what valve does a powerful move when used correctly that s not to say that everything is perfect because mods can just as quickly fall apart when the game inevitably changes the biggest drawback is the clunky ui as the learning curve is frustrating especially when you re being chased by zombies with permadeath enabled this issue cannot be solved until there is a major overhaul along with good keybindings but this won t be easy because of the simulation aspect and there is no point until the game is feature complete you can play around the bad ui to some extent by re organizing your inventory and using other tricks to get by but all of it always goes out the window once you re being chased with permadeath on now let s talk about the troubled development of pz or rather how indie stone has pulled through some of the most difficult setbacks in the indie business their sheer resilience cannot be overstated because indie stone is not some aaa studio and never has been it s four ordinary humans starting out with barely any money and only passion before pz was first released as a tech demo on june 2011 under patch 0 1 4c paypal limited their account permanently stopping withdrawals for 180 days to protect against chargebacks otherwise paypal was liable for refunds so indie stone tried google checkout but google became suspicious of them selling donations there was no pay what you want option on google checkout at the time so indie stone had used a list of pre order options where you could also add 5 10 and 15 donations alongside the base game this might not sound like a big deal but indie stone had all of their development funds hereafter referred to as war chest tied up in an uncertain state held hostage by google and paypal having most of their war chest and rent money locked up in an uncertain state made pz s future very uncertain google also waited a month into the pre orders before doing this and there were zero guarantees that indie stone would ever see those funds again google was obviously contacted a herculean feat as there wasn t any reliable way to get a hold of them because they were actively avoiding getting into end user support but only gave this vague reply we advise buyers to contact sellers directly to resolve any order related issues can you see how screwed indie stone was now it was insane and their forums were on fire the situation was solved via legal loopholes but at the time it could have been the end of pz next pz was leaked and copies started spreading as the game received attention not a bad thing right but pirates created an auto updating version using indie stone s cloud based servers and it always re downloaded the latest version even if you had it a massive hole was now burning through their war chest as indie stone needed to pay for bandwidth used by each individual download and end user pirates were spamming it to check for updates indie stone is the gigachad archetype recommending users to try out their game via piracy before buying it and until it became an actual roadblock to delivering their product they had no issues turning a blind eye to it this was solved swiftly by going full manual and eventually selling pz through steam and gog now you may be thinking so what s the problem there was no such thing as early access titles on steam in 2011 because the greenlight initiative started in 2012 any of you guys remember that so until then they had to deal with it slowing sales and growth in 2011 games selling in the ea state wasn t common yet because there weren t any reliable platforms to distribute them on october 15 2011 they experienced a devastating break in chris simpson and andy hodgetts had moved into a new apartment and had personal possessions and their laptops containing six weeks of code stolen this almost broke them and the player base because the current and next update no longer existed what about backups as i understand it their isp virgin hadn t set anything up yet so they were using mobile internet to get online for now which makes regular online backups not feasible they backed up data across all of their pcs which is the next best thing imagine being a team of four who had finally climbed various hurdles towards success and then getting all of your legs taken out instantly again they re ordinary people like you and i not some aaa studio it was their great depression and sentiments were at an all time low across the board because it would greatly extend development times while online comments humiliated them despite all of this and the constant negative feedback indie stone never gave up it s now 2024 and they re still going strong haters often don t realize how small the team was or they re used to the fast asset flips unreal engine is capable of but this is all indie and the main ingredient is love and in its current state i m ready to write the review while giving you some crazy lore unlocks in the process i wouldn t say i m a pz loremaster i m just a degen gamer who bought it back in feb 2014 before then i pirated this game to try it i was one of the end user pirates spamming the update button i ve been there when multiplayer and vehicles were just a promise so i get it if you don t believe in the game but i do and i seriously think this is the best zombie survival sandbox simulation on the market because i was there when it was a mere public tech demo i ve gifted several copies to my friends indie stone has the special type of resilience that will get them through anything their process is slow but the result is good despite the sheer epic scope they re trying to deliver since then there have been games like dayz but pz is the only one that offers the most authentic zombie survival sandbox simulation experience you can watch their presentation on their woes back when they were still a team of four and not the thirty or so today youtube video
