2020 winter salei was unfortunate enough to buy this game at full price mere days before the winter sale went off and the game dropped by 67 however i still don t feel scammed i have only gotten to play about 13 hours but for now i m loving it the gameplay is pretty good the soundtrack is amazing and despite what you might have heard its quite solo friendly i have run into some minor bugs but nothing game breaking just small annoying and sometimes amusing things the visuals are not extraordinary but it makes for an ok performance fps wise on my athlon 3000g and gtx 1650 pc on medium settings and i m really digging the color palette note that i haven t played any other fallout games prior to playing fallout 76 so i have no point of reference for what a fallout game should be like my point is that the game isn t as bad as its reputation and that if you can you should check it out now that it is on sale
