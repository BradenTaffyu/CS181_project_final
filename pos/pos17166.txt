2017 simply awesome 9 10 this is my new favourite total war to date and i have played them all for at least 300 hours and must of spent about 1000 in rome 1 new to total war total war warhammer 2 is like every other total war game you build up your settlements and armies in a turn based strategy map then take to the battle map to control your armies in real time battles where you can zoom right in and watch each elf fight to the bitter end or zoom out for mass control just moving icons across the map the goodok lets start this review by comparing it to warhammer 1if you played warhammer 1 this game is alot like it in almost every way but it improved on everything slightly so that the over all the game is alot better the improvments across the board are all small and nice like the improvments to the user interface a better tutorial for new players and so on but all those litle things add up and take the game to a whole new level there is slight improvements to the graphics and optimisation over total war 1 but the maps both battle and campaign are so detailed they feel vastly superior even things that i thought warhammer 1 did an outstanding job on such as the faction diversity has been taken to a whole new level with this game magic feels powerful this time around with my mage being the top killer in some of my battles lords and heroes have alot more skills to pick from and i am not just wanting to spam the red skills for the army wide buffs with the increased level cap you also have more points to spend and really flesh out and customize you characters there is also a new skill to make you high level lords come back just like named characters so no more greiving when you lose that hero that has been with you since the start the vortex campaign is pure bliss you can play it sandbox like all good old fashoned total wars or a hybrid sandbox story where you are fighting to take control of the vortex in a race with the other main factions to complete your rituals and claim victory in an epic ultimate battle to win the campaign the new cinematic style is epic it really works with the warhammer world as its always been full of top notch art work and the cinematics here really bring it to life and tell a story unlike anything we have seen in a total war before the badthere was slight improvments to sieges but i would still say that there have been better siege battles in older historical total war games this is the only reason i give this game a 9 instead of a 10want to see gameplay before you buy pop over to my channel here here is the first part of my current lets play s youtube video lets play total war warhammer 2 lizardmen part 1 views 607 lets play total war warhammer 2 lizardmen part 1 hay everyone and welcome to my warhammer 2 lets play lizardmen series with our ll the almighty kroq gar hope yous all enjoy youtube video lets play total war warhammer 2 skaven part 1 views 500 lets play total war warhammer 2 skaven part 1 hay everyone and welcome to my warhammer 2 lets play skaven series with our ll the almighty lord skrolk
