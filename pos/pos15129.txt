2017 product received for free okay so i ve been playing don t starve since the beginning i was one of the very first people to recieve a copy via google chrome and steam as a beta tester so i have some devent grounds to review the game on can it run on your computer like always i pretty much only create reviews for games that are remarkably easy to run while still being a great game at the same time if you 2 gb of ram you re good to go for the most part any laptop that is new enough to be windows 7 or above will most definately be able to run it gameplay 8 10 this game is very very fun but be warned playing with your friends can be much more fun but also make the game much more difficult if you don t know what you re doing a few youtube tutorials might be needed but this game is mostly trial and error replayability 10 10 this game is all about replayability in fact i can almost garentee you will need to do many rounds of dying to first get the hang of it there are so many ways to die and curiosity can reward you and punish you in various ways the developers 3 these guys deffinately deserve some credit throughout the entire journey they have done nothing but listen to the community about how the game should change they didn t do things the way they wanted to they listened to us a prime example of this is the game itself becoming multiplayer right from the start they stated they would make the don t starve the best single player game they could make it and had absolutely no intention of adding multiplayer but due to extremely popular demand these guys basically redesigned the entire game so they could fufil the requests of the audience firm hand shakes
