2023 early access review this game is infinitely better than the original yes it needs some optimization for fps but other than that this game blew me away with the small changes i experienced audio changes ui changes drop crate animations etc and the visuals are just stunning i myself am running a 3080 fe with a i9 10900k oc at 5 0ghz with 32g of ram i was getting 70 fps on medium settings on the beach and a little inland flying through the redwood forest and into the volcano i was getting around 40 50 i understand people are a little upset about this but it can only get better in all honesty i was surprised i was getting that good of fps out of the box couple months and this game will be smooth as butter some testing i did just to see how the game looks and feels compared to the first were as follows i built a 3x3 thatch hut and upgraded it to stone thatch looks honestly not horrible the outside not showing the supports is nice and soft looking as it should since its just woven fiber the ceiling has a realistic feel to it by letting some sun in again because its woven fiber its not airtight like wood or stone nice change of pace for thatch changing to wood was also a nice change the inside supports felt real and necessary rather than just there for the visuals stone however was by far my favorite i can say wholeheartedly builders who focus on aesthetics are going to love the changes stone has a very medieval castle vibe to it unfortunately the ceiling looks like minimal changes were made to it and looks very similar to the original i also want to say the new mechanic where you can have a wall and that wall is a window and door and secret door wall that turns like a secret bookcase is amazing and no longer do you have to unlock every wall like the old game they re all tied into one engram makes building a lot more user friendly i feel like i also wanted to go see how caves looked so i explored the south side easy cave to my surprise it wasn t overly dark it was actually quite lit with the mushrooms and foliage added inside also a very nice change i like was the addition of mineable crystals i always hated having to find some mountain to get crystal from so this was a nice change unless i m stupid and that was always there while exploring the cave as per ark the stuttering walking in the cave was large but once you walk in the stuttering subsided completely again as per ark but to my surprise walking out of the cave had only a 1 2 second stutter until all was fine again this game has fps issues yes but comparing it to its predecessor this game is a lot better the map changes are also amazing just the small addition to more trees and rocks makes the game feel a lot more real and not bland like the old game also the animations for cutting trees and the cracks that appear in a rock when you mine it are very nice and looks a lot better than the old game my favorite feature thus far is easily the visual of picking a plant and the leaves being picked rather than spamming interact then the bush just randomly breaks i also wanted to see how raptors looked since the picture looks so good they look great and i had this amazing terrifying experience i went to knock one out after hitting it with a bola as i was knocking the one out that i had tied up from the trees i hear the jurassic park sound the calling for help raptor sound and i look up to see a raptor charging me while he was charging me the tied up raptor started to respond with the same call i don t know if the raptors were communicating or if it was just some crazy coincidence but nonetheless super cool interaction this game is way scarier than the original i also want to add my night experience and simply say the game is not darker than a black hole like the original it s actually very well lit but not to much the darkest it was for me during night was when it was late night and a storm rolled in even then i could still see the obelisks at night are so gorgeous its unreal red ob looks terrifying off in the distance with its red glow green looks inviting blue unfortunately was covered in clouds so i couldn t see it i ended my single player experience with a journey to carno island to find a rex to look at as usual there were a lot of argentavis at the island i can confirm they definitely looked at color variations and color combinations the argies there were gorgeous i saw a black and teal one an all black one i know that s not new but it looked nice and another that i think was all teal but died before i could find it i died by finding a rex and to my pleasant surprise when the rex roared at me it kicked my off my pt and then proceeded to murder myself and my tame again i don t think that feature was in the base game i think only yuties can do the roar fear affect if they are and this feature is new then it makes rexs somewhat more viable in a pvp sense the changes that have been made in this game makes me confidently rate this game a 8 10 the fps issue will be resolved the visuals are amazing as is the water physics ui and audio changes make the game feel so much smoother and user friendly compared to the old game the map additions changes make the map feel more real and less empty overall 40 dollars for a remaster may seem steep and maybe even ridiculous but i can assure you it ll be worth it it can only get better
