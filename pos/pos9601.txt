2013 early access review this is it assetto corsa is simply put the best racing sim i ve ever played right out of the box it has the best most naturally feeling and pleasing physics out there do you want to drive slowly for the first time ever you can do you want to drive over the limit that works too it s also the first sim to officially support drifting without adding weird mode specific physics and the fact that i had to watch several real life instructional videos to get the hang of it speaks volumes of how good this is the most important thing though it just feels good the force feedback on this thing is simply way ahead of the competition cars feel real you can feel every bump and elevation change on the road you can feel weight shifting not only lateral but also longitudinal forces too somehow it s just bananas let s also add the fact that it looks gorgeous and has fantastic performance plus official mod support not yet imlemented but there s plenty of awesome mods already in the works and great developer support and you got yourself a great sim that s bound to last the fact alone that i ve played this for over 15 hours already and it doesnt even have ai or multiplayer support yet it s an early access after all speaks for itself it s good if you got a wheel then get this thing it s kickass
