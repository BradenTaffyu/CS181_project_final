2016 early access review one of the most original games i have played in some time frustrating at times but very enjoyable the car building aspect is top notch there is no game that is as complete and detailed about building a car as this one blows car mechanic simulator out of the water with complexity comes a steep learning curve expect to spend a lot of time on forums youtube to understand the game mechanics details game explains little to nothing about how to actually play it driving mechanics are very good playing with clutch is highly recommended driving with keyboard is not recommended perma death takes an already great game and adds a unique factor to it really ramps up the intensity game still needs some refinement too easy to damage car with tools still but is complete enough to highly recommend
