2023 it has some balance issues and a few bugs but it s better in many ways compared to coh2 i have thousands of hours of coh1 2 combined and play tons of 1v1 and 2v2 online allies vs axis balance keeps shifting heavily to one side but the game is still fun coh2 had the same growing pains and the devs are actively working on ironing them out this game does not deserve the hate it is getting yes i do wish sounds were punchier graphics are great it runs great i have yet to experience a single crash
