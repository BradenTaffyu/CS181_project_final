2020 i did not expect to like this game nearly as much as i did on first glance this game has absolutely blown all of my expectations out of the water and it just keeps going and going the game centers around albus bernstein leader of a group of low tier superheroes who work for profit with helping police fight crime as well as helping out merchants and private clients it s centered in a unique world where magic exists in the modern day specifically the city of valhalla a city state brought into being by the major world powers with the stipulation that it cannot have a military the game plays like xcom with superhero units though it outdoes xcom in its methods of making the hit or miss attack percentage gameplay exciting and open to a number of alternative options characters have skills called masteries which can be as basic as stat percentage increases to unique character actions and abilities that change what the character excels at dramatically masteries are achieved either through leveling character classes or doing things during missions and can then be researched feeding junk masteries into better masteries and applied to your characters as well each character has a single unique mastery you choose when starting which can dramatically change what situation they excel in further each character gets two additional classes each with their own masteries and new abilities to use in combat all of this can be a little overwhelming at first but with time and experience the system becomes easy to understand both characters and enemies will have masteries that impact combat which keeps engagements varied and exciting without veering into frustration the cast is lively and exciting their designs are stylish in a way that lends to both practicality and aesthetic while avoiding conspicuous sexualization and the side missions which expand on their characters are well written and varied in their tactical demands the only thing i can say this game could use work in is the localization however this is a known area that the developers are working to improve upon and judging by the frequent update schedule this issue will be resolved over time on the whole troubleshooter is exactly my brand of superhero anime mixed lovingly into an xcom gameplay format the story is told creatively the characters are fun and stylish and the combat is equally just so i wholeheartedly recommend this title
