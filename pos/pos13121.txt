2014 early access review some say the main character isn t afraid of anything except small insects and that he once made it to the mun with his eyes closed all we know is he s not the stig but he is jebediah kerman this game has exerything you want in a space race game you have explosions the ability to build the best spacecraft you can comprehend and best of all you have raw power you may first get it and think what was i thinking when i got this it s more difficult than becoming friends with piers morgan with that you would be correct but what you need is to practice with many many crafts to get the right ideas the controls are like some kind of madness that would drive you away but it s very easy to understand after you play for a bit all in all i must say this is one of the best games in the world and even out of it if you wanted to pick this up for a mere 27 dollars 17 quid you would have to be mentaly insane to not get it and on that bombshell back to the studio
