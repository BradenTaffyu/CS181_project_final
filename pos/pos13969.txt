2017 early access review another awesome game by klei creator of don t starve mark of the ninja for those who like base building simulation this definitely worth a try be aware that it is still in early access state so the content is not final and have bug performance issue in some cases but looking at klei s history i can assure you that you won t be disappointed it s a space colony game where you break build stuff mainly you have to deal with gas food temperature and stress you aren t controling the character dupe directly instead they are control by ai and you are just giving them a list of orders job that they have to do complete for more info about what this game is about it s better if you read the game description and see some screenshots or gameplay video below are my thoughts about the game pros worth the price already offers lots of contents to play for early access they have plan and roadmap for future update their target for new update is every 4 6weeks bug balancing patch in between very active developers community can be played casually hardcore or tryhard mode awesome sound art can improve your chemistry grade maybe or perhaps make it worst cons i can t take back my 200 hours this game is so addictive it s like crack probably illegal in some country be careful stop reading here if you don t want to get spoiled tips for new player 1 nobody like sleeping with snooring people so avoid those loud sleeper negative trait except they got awesome stat you know what you are doing 2 watch their expected decor try to get the lowest decor when you start picking your first 3 dupes 3 learning digging and construction are pretty useful for early game another good attribute to consider are athletics they move faster can easily be trained but still useful if they are high from the start strength currently you can t train this so definitely has its own value 4 stress response try to avoid binge eater if you still learning and you know you won t do well 5 start digging shortcut g get those sandstone algae copper metal 6 at early in the game you might think you have enough algae but no you don t 7 the first thing you need to build is restroom outhouse your dupes need a place to pee and poop or they will make a mess 8 build research station asap research farming first it need to be connected with electricity so enjoy looking at your dupes running on the hamster wheel9 dupes breath oxygen in and emit carbon dioxide they can fart too o2 are light blue a bit transparant co2 are black co2 can stack up pretty fast be careful with it they are heavier than o2 so they will fall at the bottom of your colony base they also tend to go right 10 oxylite produce oxygen try to open area that have them you don t need to dig them 11 watch for warning notification dupes are not the smartest creature in the asteroid sometime they can kill themselves in the most unpredictable stupid scenario 12 exploring is good but be careful not to expand too much or open a big vacuum area when your oxygen production is still low 13 there is priority tools in the bottom right panel 1 lowest 9 highest avoid using 9 for all your job order setting all to 9 means no 9 you should probably check the other tools too and overlay top right they are useful 14 hatch puff are useful rule of thumbs just don t kill any creature before you actually know what they do good or bad 15 taking new dupe is okay but be very careful with your oxygen food supply 16 you might think mealwood will be your stable food supply but no it is not17 don t freak out with unfriendly toxic gases but you should start worrying when they are getting out of control 18 electrolizer spit out lots of oxygen but they also spitting out hydrogen they are lighter than o2 so they ll go upward 19 some resource are more scarce than the other be very careful some example algae clean water and metal copper gold at early game sands and coal at mid late game 20 dupeslivesmatter remember to take care of your dupe when stress hit you hard it will be a snowball effect and your colony is doom before you realize it21 watch your decor some building have bad decor and it is bad for your dupes use decor overlay 22 watch your building temperature some building emits heat and can be overheated break need repair cost time resource again use overlay to check 23 watch your own necessity like dupe your life matter too you need food drink and sleep
