2022 if like me you always wanted to know a little more about auto repair and have a basic understanding of how things are put together you may find this to be a real rabbit hole between leveling up so you can move wrench repair faster to upgrading your garage to fit more vehicles and tools for specific operations you start small and work on basic repairs building to full engine swaps and performance rebuilds this was a diamond in rough for me plenty of licensed dlc too
