2021 troubleshooter is a beautiful and engaging turn based strategy rpg all the characters are well written and have interesting personalities and backstories from the main cast to the enemies the music is great the energetic mission tunes really get you fired up and the more emotional ones can bring you to tears especially combined with this story that is so engaging and truly makes you care about everything that s going on in it the dev team is absolutely incredible and deserves all the praise in the world they truly care about this game and its players to this day they re still working hard on the game adding new content and paying attention to what players are saying to fix any problem as fast as possible troubleshooter is a game that will keep you entertained for a very long time at around 85 hours when writing this i m just now getting close to the end of the main storyline in normal mode with some side missions and violent cases sort of challenge mode missions left as well the game is far from over after that though as the free dlc adds many hours worth of new missions and violent cases i also intend to replay it on a harder difficulty there are incentives to do so besides the challenge like achievements and exclusive loot i haven t noticed any bug during my playthrough and those i ve heard about were usually fixed within a few hours of being reported the freedom to customize builds was a big part of what makes me enjoy this game so much i love how stimulating it is to think about which masteries skills and equipments would be best without having to abide by the perfect build there s probably one but it s not needed and much more rewarding to figure out which playstyle you d like each character to have by yourself i think this is key in finding out if you ll enjoy this game there is a lot in it that you ll need to think through the mastery system the crafting of items masteries and machines the raising of pets and of course the main gameplay that i personally find challenging even in normal mode in order to enjoy this game to the fullest you ll have to engage yourself in it and experiment with everything it has to offer troubleshooter is not a simple and easy game that will hold your hand and guide you to victory troubleshooter abandoned children is definitely one of my favourite games and i will enjoy playing it for a very long time i think i ve said most of what i had to say here i purposefully didn t go into too much details as i think one of the best part of trying out a game is to slowly discover it i hope i could make you interested though this game truly deserves it if you love strategy and challenging yourself don t hesitate to give troubleshooter a try it really is a great game
