2021 early access review i ve spent thousands of hours playing pc games frankly it s embarrassing i probably could have built a house or something with all that time so after 20 years playing games this is my first steam review why because even someone as lazy as me has to stop give this game a thumbs up it s got some glitches and oddities but the dev team is all over it with constant improvements to the game as it comes through early access it has beautiful graphics good physics dynamics and engaging content i have played through a ton of rpg open world type games as well as the entire mount and blade series and easily put this near the top of the list even at this stage v1 5 7 it has a ton of depth i am sixty something hours deep and have quite happily barely moved along the main quests as i build out my character and his army battle fighting takes time to master but is extremely fun and the campaign map is pretty and true to m b style it can be a bit of a grind for cash early in the game that s about my only complaint of any significance it s a well executed game 10 10
