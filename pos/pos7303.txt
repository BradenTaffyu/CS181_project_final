2021 amazing game as someone who played the original 18 wheels of steel it s amazing to see how far the trucking games have gone and how it still has the same charm the dlc can get quite pricy but the base game is enough to get you started and soon you ll get so hooked that you won t mind getting extra content not to mention mods and multiplayer if i had any complaints it would simply be with the traveling portion some extra warning signs at certain locations would help prevent unexpected crashes and the traffic ai is actually pretty bad barely any different than it was back in 2002 map itself is beautiful and the game mechanics are all nice it s not perfect but it s definitely still fun and i recommend
