2021 this game is amazing the combat is great the replayabilty is super high character customization is an a the story is pretty good a great rpg version of x com i would say it is everything that x com chimera squad wanted to be but wasn t pro the story is very varied with lot of different character point of viewsa lot of different systems that are optional i played a few hundred hours without really using crafting farming or food buffs and did just fine excellent scaling of difficulty you can make the game as easy or as challenging as you want i play on the highest difficulty and the game does not feel unfair which a difficult thing to achieve sometimes but this game does accomplish that feat the game allows for a lot of experimentation with your character builds there is no one set way to build your characters conversely there are a lot of different ways you can approach each map there is a lot of good character development and a lot of back story for each of the characters the bond system between the characters is very good and most of the characters have distinct personalities production values are good you can make out all your characters the sound quality and design are very good i have not run into any bugs i have never had the game crash or freeze the check point system is very fair consi can t really think of any cons other than i can t wait for more content and maybe a level increase it is very much the game x com chimera wanted to be but wasn t this game has outstanding combat excellent characters a good story excellent sub systems like crafting food buffs team bonding systems so if you wanted an rpg version of x com this is 100 the game for you the game is an absolute bargain for the price it s flat out a great game
