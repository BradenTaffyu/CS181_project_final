2023 tl dr game is good do not buy cartel coins it s a coin flip if your purchases actually are applied to your account will not resub based on customer service run arounds as an old man who was born a year after the original star wars a new hope was released i grew up with this world read the books comics watched the movies the works i enjoy playing sw tor i like the new patches that add new content to explore which for a free to play game is nice i like that they still add things such as new armor weapons and mounts it has a world of warcraft feel to the animation and world as if it were a wow mod if such things were possible so that is kind of comforting for someone who has played wow since day 1 i like how you have what is essentially a single player story mode and there are eight or so different classes and each class has it s own story line you can share unlocked weapons armor mounts companions between your characters you can change from a story mode with weaker enemies to allow you to go through the story lines as a solo to a veteran mode that gives you the story mode but forces you to team up with other players in a more traditional mmorpg they have a pvp setting for the story mode that allows you to have a little spice in your travels or have a more laid back tired from a day of working and just want to relax pve mode they have a pvp arena if you are into owning other players the solo space combat missions are a switch and nice change of the game the pvp space fighter mode is pretty good too they have user and guild purchasable housing and that you can fully customize the interiors this is something that wow still in 2023 hasn t been able to figure out how to do i guess the only downsides i have with sw tor is that the graphics haven t really had much in the way of an upgrade also do not buy cartel coins the premium money used to buy special mounts decorations pets armor weapons sw tor has an issue with actually applying what you purchase to your account i made purchases for their coins and in two weeks i ve had to open two seperate tickets with their customer service to get my purchases actually added to my account their customer service seems to be based in india given the names of the reps and the time of the day they answer the emails the issue with that is there is a huge delay in resolving issues as you mention the problem you are having in an email and wait 12 hours or more to get a reply which often needs you to reply then they will reply the following day and this can drag out for days of back and forth they are inconsistant with their requests one sentence in their email will say we will need the screenshot taken from your computer and they should not be cropped we will need to see the address bar and the url which will include your steam id and steam profile name on the steam transaction history page without cropping but then in the same email just a few lines down you ll see go to your steam purchase history find your purchase in the list and click on it take a screenshot of the details page please make sure it is not cropped too much and the steam username is visible in the top right corner which is it no cropping or make sure it is not cropped too much one rep refused to accept screenshots because my task bar in windows is set to autohide they didn t care all the information needed to resolve the issue was available in the screenshots because since my task bar was hidden the screen shots were not considered a full screen screenshot it almost seems like they know the purchase was made and that you can t charge back through steam so if they make it difficult enough they hope you will just stop bothing them game is fun for star wars fans but don t buy cartel coins unless you are willing to gamble over if they will apply those to your account or just keep the money and make you deal with their customer service run around
