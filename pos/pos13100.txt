2014 early access review think of kerbal as a do it yourself nasa albeit less successful because you haven t a clue what you re supposed to be doing it s all fun though as you ll learn quite quickly and by the end of the week along with some scott manley youtube schooling you ll be on the right track you ll probably spend 95 of your time exploding but that slim 5 that you actually manage to get into orbit dock two craft together to make a space station or land on another body such as the mun will become some of the most memorable experiences in your video gaming life as close to a solid space simulation as you ll ever get and extremely mod friendly too
