2016 reminiscent of the harvest moon games i ve really enjoyed this one i ve put in too many hours lost a lot of sleep and messed up my social life up more than it already was with no end in sight there s different kinds of farming in the game including ranching you can make your own artisanal goods including wine beer jellies jams cheeses etc and eat them yourself give them as gifts or sell them for a profit you can forage for different types of plants in the wild you can fish all you want in rivers lakes and the ocean you can go deep into the mines for ores needed to upgrade your farming equipment just be careful of monsters and bring a sword there s even an experience system so you can level up and choose professions that better fit your playstyle be it for livestock or for your fields fishing or trapping and so on and if all that wasn t enough there s close to 30 people in town you can interact with each with their own little events and stories marriage is an option too with 5 bachelors and 5 bachelorettes to choose from each with their own unique personalities there s so much more and it s just amazing to me that this game was made by 1 guy and not a team for me this game came out of nowhere and has become a surprise hit i recommend it for everyone even if you don t think it s your kind of game try it anyway you can always refund it within 2 hours provided you don t lose track of time
