2021 arma is now my new 1 favourite shooter you can play arma however you want it can be a survival game like rust shooter like cod or battlefield openworld like gta with mods support but the game mode i liked the most is invade and annex which as per my opinion is the way arma should be played because of its realism arma showed me horrors of war and how messed up loosing a squad mate can be it taught me how difficult it is to ride a aircraft or a tank and how hard it is to snipe a target at range having team mates that specialize in different role can make stuff and things easier sometimes this does not even feel like a game it is not a kill focused game like csgo and cod this is where your teamplay skills and coordination will be tested i like how the game community is trying its best to make it more realistic day by day and how the tides of war keep switching so no mission ever turns out the same way whitch further provides near endless playability one simple mistake can negate your 30 min preparation and mission deplyment phase if you are not paying attention do remember arma 3 is not your pick up and play kind of game it is like a skill that you will get you use to by practice training and time there is so much more that arma has to offer that i can express in a review welcome to the dark souls equivalent of shooter gamessee you in arma peace out
