2019 early access review watched a streamer stop at a sobriety checkpoint pee on a cop beam him with a beer bottle then wrap his car into a tree after the resultant police chase figured why not and got the game what i got instead of police chases was being spawned into a world where i can t understand anything said to me nor can i read anything my parents have left on holiday and don t appear to be in a hurry to return probably due to the shame of their son being 20 years old and hopelessly illiterate walking out to the driveway i see the rusted out shell of a car just the body i open the garage and find most of the rest of it in pieces there is a toolkit here nary a tire in sight wonderful i commence to building and discover an indentation on the engine block to indicate where the camshaft should be rotated to avoid the heartbreak of a destroyed valve train surely the game is not that in depth i said to myself incorrectly i notice the distributor can be turned surely the game doesn t allow you to advance and the timing i said to myself incorrectly i notice valve adjustments on the rocker arm assembly said something roughly similar about that also incorrectly note in the real world where i am not an illiterate living on beer and sausages i restore autos as a hobbyafter an adventure to get tires spark plugs fluids food beer and an alternator belt that involved a sledgehammer a boat a tractor a wagon and nearly dying of fatigue hunger and thirst i had an assembled car it started i heard squealing belts and clacking noises black smoke issued from the exhaust then it backfired and stopped surely the carb isn t adjustable it is surely the belt tension doesn t have to be adjusted it did to make a long review less so i eventually had a running car which i promptly drove into a ditch it made a sickening noise when i tried to restart it i saw an oil pan and muffler laying behind the car was run over killed by some jerk in a green car as i walked back to get the tractor i think i am in love with this game
