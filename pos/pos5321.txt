2017 early access review got both of my arms and my face sliced off by a bitey worm before mind dominating it ate my own arms and face as rations on the way back home tongue rotted away luckily i m a psionic with telepathy who don t need no arms face or tongue to communicate or fight people still charge 2x the price in shops now because everyone s a superficial in qud no arms no way to hold light source completely blind in dungeons and caves and at night stumbled into fungus forest one mushroom spore bukkake later a glowing mushroom grows on my back and illuminates my surroundings everything s better with shrooms tongueless faceless armless glowing mushroom psi person now roams the lands looking for a way to restore all those lost body parts while mind crushing psi burning and enslaving the hordes of extradimensional crabs and goatpeople who want to absorb all the crazy psionic powers for themselves averageday
