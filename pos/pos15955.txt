2016 warning if you are thinking of buying this make sure you understand this is not a game it is a tool for playing board games i have seen some people in discussions who are frustrated because they didn t know what they were buying so what is it tts is a platform for playing board games there are no ai or rules coded into the game just like a real table and board game you can pick up your playing pieces and do whatever you want with them if you pick up your chess pawn and move it all the way across the board in one move or try to balance it on top of another piece or throw it off the table the game won t care the other player might the games it comes included with some classic games such as chess checkers backgammon jigsaw add your own picture pick no of pieces etc but the main meat of the game is the workshop it s reasonably easy to add your own custom cards or dice tokens and boards and if you can do 3d modelling you can make more complicated things too the result is that there are thousands of mods on the workshop to download some of them are there with the blessing of or created by the creator of the board game version there are also a handful of paid dlc games a few may be prototypes being tested by games designers before they consider making physical versions or homebrewed games created just for tts some are not everything you need for a game but may be additional pieces to use in another board game or for use in rpgs like d d the vast majority though are versions of physical boardgames and these are something of a grey area legally as the copyright holders have generally not given permission for them to be uploaded some may not know about tts or may find it easier to turn a blind eye a few have allowed their products in the hopes that the mods may drive sales of the physical games and some like munchkin seem to be regularly taken down only to be uploaded again by someone else opponents there are a number of gameplay options single player is used for solitaire games setting up tables before taking the save multiplayer or uploading as a workshop mod or just loading up a multiplayer game and loading all the pieces yourself if you want whatever floats your boat multiplayer has options to host a server browse current servers direct connection or hotseat its better to use the proper hotseat mode than single player for hot seat games as you can then each have your own hands of cards turn counter etc there is also a global irc channel which is optionally shown in game as well as text and voice communication generally public games are pretty good there are a few trolls but the mods are good at banning them from global and the host of a game can kick them from games easily if needed you can of course password protect your game so only those you want to join can how easy it is to find a public game of what you want to play really depends on what game it is there seem to always be games of secret hitler for example but if you want a game of heroquest you might have to offer to teach people in the global channel or arrange a meet up through forums or steam friends overall i really recommend tts as long as you realise what you are buying is a an extremely flexible sandbox playing environment not a traditional computer game
