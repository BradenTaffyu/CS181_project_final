2021 looking for a hidden gem of a game you ve never really heard of before to try during this steam holiday sale try this one i m still only about 2 3 through the game it s so long and there s so much more content eventually coming but if you think you are a fan of strategy games and love tons of unique characters with likeable personalities then you have to try this one it plays like a very polished cross between x com and a jrpg with visual novel style segments in between story levels that unravel the story behind the slowly crumbling city and your characters individual stakes in the plot every character has a reason to be doing what they are doing and the lines between friend and foe are quite blurred to the point that i wouldn t be surprised if several enemies turn out to eventually join your team in the future as well in between this is also a complex and fun customization segment where you mix and match thematic passive skills made available to characters based on their background personal skills class skills race etc and slot them together to unlock powerful set bonus passives that enhance the characters combat skills according to your personal playstyle i love this part although this is almost arguably too complex in that you can constantly fiddle and fiddle with it in between every level if you want to in order to squeeze out maximum efficiency from your characters but you don t actually have to even on advanced difficulty levels just every now and then is fine i love the background music in the game as well it s a really well put together package some drawbacks the game has have to do with minor improvements that could be made to the ui like being able to see all new skill notifications in the clickable items in your base with one click instead of having to go into the book and looking through all the categories to find them each time or translation issues although it s apparently gotten better over time i didn t find a way to contribute corrections though though there apparently is was one some skill categories are also a bit underused like i d like to see more character background plot related skills available for most of the characters some barely have any at all the ones that are there are cool though my dream is to be a hero starry night i love the characters very much and hope they will keep on continuing the story in future seasons after they are done this one i want to be anne s best friend and i want to hang out with irene on a rooftop somewhere chilling out after a long day of fighting crime
