2015 early access review take don t starve now add in pillaging with friends braving the harsh winters together fending off hostile wolves and other limitless fun honestly i wasn t that into the original don t starve i found it fun but didn t really have the drive to survive as long as i could which is the point of the game with don t starve together having a friend or two join you makes it not only thrilling but gives the boost i needed into making this my favorite co op game of all time deciding on day to day duties collaborating on making items that are pertinent to survival adapting to different climates and just messing around when the struggles of staying alive becomes too harsh seriously causing chaos as a ghost is really fun i highly recommend this game and my only advice to you is don t starve or freeze to death get killed by shadowy figments of your imagination blow up from a trap mauled by walking trees anger mother animals and anything else don t starve together decides to throw your way
