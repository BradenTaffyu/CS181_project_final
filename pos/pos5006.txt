2016 fallout 4 is more of an exploration shooter with minor rpg elements than a pure rpg because bethesda have simplified a lot of the mechanics which has refined some mechanics like shooting and general gearing but it has also harmed some mechanics like the rpg elements such as the level up perk system some perks are nothing but boring stat boosts and offer nothing new and exciting mechanically and almost feel mandatory to continue to survive in the world eg generic weapon type damage increases storywise the game is lacking the main story was quite rudimentary even spawning a myriad of memes about it that said some of the side quests and the general background atmosphere and characters you meet more than make up for the lack of character in the main story some of the different vault stories you read about and experience exploring the various vaults spread across the game world are far more interesting than the main story fallout 4 introduces a few new mechanics to the series such as crafting modding weapons and armour and settlement building both of which are conceptually great but awkwardly implemented for example swapping mods out requires you to craft new mods to replace the original ones rather than just being able to break the weapon down for parts albeit you can break down weapons into crafting materials with certain perks as with all recent bethesda games the ui and control scheme is horrible on pc and suffering terribly of consolitis speak of which the game looks relatively dated even on max settings overall though i still enjoyed this game and would recommend it tldr buy if you like exploring and shooting don t buy if you were expecting a story that didn t seem like it was written by someone on the spectrum
