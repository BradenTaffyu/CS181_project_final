2021 the mastery system may be confusing during the beginning of the game but that s what makes troubleshooter a unique experience the mastery system allows players to choose what perks are available for each character and allows for very powerful builds with some creativity you can spending several hours just playing around with the masteries decent story lots of questions that is left answered but the game is still being updated soundtracks are pretty awesome especially the ones from the white lion and black witch dlc which is free sooo much content took me around 80 hours to finish the base game only down sides that i can think of is you need to be patient with the game think i put troubleshooter down for a bit due to the slow beginning and confusing mastery system if you give the game a chance you ll truly find a fantastic experience would definitely pay way more than its currently listed more
