2019 i hate to admit it but i was one of those who had put off buying this game in part because i didn t like the cartoony graphics yesterday i was looking at a game called dominions and it hit me like a brick in the head that normally i m the one getting on my high horse saying graphics shouldn t matter it s how the game plays needless to say i was soon on the civ 6 store page again to see how far it had come with the expansions and noticed that now 90 of the reviews in the past 30 days were positive a few hours later i jumped in blind and was playing it which leads me to my next point i was also concerned after hearing it lacked depth i m not sure what it was like before the expansions but i certainly think it has a huge amount to offer now there s more to it than that though it s difficult to explain but this game feels a lot more organic in how it plays out compared to the other strategy games i play for example i love all all paradox games to bits but they feel more clinical for want of a better word with the exception of maybe crusader kings 2 back to the graphics although i don t think i ll ever get used to way the maps are presented the ui itself is one of the crispest and cleanest i ve seen in a while furthermore everything just makes sense i fumbled through to religious victory on prince simply by doing whatever seemed sensible at the time without the need to look anything up now i m sure some people will be thinking oh but you can t do that on harder difficulties and they would be missing the point entirely the point is that this game is laid out well enough and is accessible enough to be beaten on default settings by the average joe there is no need to spend tonnes of time reading wikis and watching tutorial videos trying to figure out what something does or how to do it and that to me is great design in short i m very pleasantly surprised and the game also runs perfectly on a linux pc
