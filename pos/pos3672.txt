2021 i just finished this game about 30 minutes before posting this review before i bought omori i d sat staring at the store page rewatching the trailer and tearing up every time needless to say i was not ready this game is the best game i have ever played the characters are extremely loveable and it made me cry a total of 7 times i m not very good at writing things so let me just say this if you re thinking of buying omori do it you will not regret it i really wish i could experience this game again that feeling of wanting to replay a game is much stronger with this one compared to others i ve played oh and the ending had me hands on my face sobbing for 5 minutes straight the good ending at least so be prepared for that anyway i again strongly recommend playing omori it truly is an experience
