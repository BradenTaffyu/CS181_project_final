2015 fallout 4 is a game that s good but not great i love the changes to power armor and although i think they shouldn t have put your first set of armor so early in the game the jet pack which unfortunately takes way too long to unlock is an absolute blast to use and really highlights the more vertical nature of the commonwealth over fallout 3 s map the enemies are much more fun to fight both because of the shooting being significantly improved and because of the enemies new animations and attacks like mole rats tunneling under the ground and ghouls dodging out of your aim i love the new companions and the inclusion of romance and a few companion quests even though the ai pathing is still kind of awful and they still have too much trouble entering elevators the main campaign is generally a lot more interesting than in 3 and feels more original and the 4 different faction branches make it feel like it s going to be a lot more replayable than most bethesda games are even though it does lose a lot of momentum near the end even the removal of skills surprised me since despite being obvious oversimplification the perk chart is actually fairly balanced and even after 152 hours of playing i still hadn t maxed out every skill i wanted despite maxing out every skill period in fallout 3 within 40 or so the graphics are good enough that i don t think i ll be needing any mods for that any time soon and the new vault suits make my butt look just fantastic it s not without its problems though fallout 4 is a great shooter and a great adventuring game but it s not much for roleplaying the dialogue system is extremely limited and even with the mod that makes each choice more than one word you re still typically limited to yes yes with more dialogue no ask a question as your 4 choices and you never get more than 4 the character being voiced makes it hard to keep your own character in mind because of how overly soft spoken they tend to be even in the mean choices and skills that added flavor in the past like black widow no longer have any special dialogue or events instead being reduced to generic percentage bonuses there are no dialogue checks for anything except speech anymore and speech is just one of three difficulty levels based on your charisma skills save scumming has been revolutionized with the ability to quick save in the middle of dialogue and even just turn to the side and shove a bunch of chems and beer down your throat to pass skill checks the dialogue system as a whole feels very simplified and makes the game feel more like borderlands with light rpg elements instead of fallout the legendary monsters add on to this feeling essentially functioning as the equivalent of badass enemies from borderlands instead of being the rare one of a kind enemies that you found in special areas that were fun to encounter like in the previous games the ui is awful and aside from the fact that it looks like a unity placeholder it s just generally not very functional and the changes to the pip boy navigation seem to have no purpose other than to annoy you such as making it so that you can t see all five inventory buttons at once anymore instead having to scroll between them not that it matters since my pip boy disappeared due to a glitch and never came back around halfway in but still the weapon customization comes at the price of there not being very much actual weapon variety and most of the unique weapons are just renamed versions of the generic ones with a stat buff removing the thrill of finding a cool unique weapon in some random building while exploring the weapon balance is also somewhat off and you can mod pistols to do more damage than the most highly modified 50 caliber sniper rifle or tommy guns that do more damage than miniguns repeating quests are still unfortunately a thing and they still don t actually tell you which ones are repeating and you ll likely always have at least two clogging your quest list because of the minutemen whining at you 24 7 the settlement building system feels like a half finished mod that somehow accidentally got included in the finished game and even if it had a tutorial the system barely works at times and the buttons are all mapped to the same things for no explainable reason other than consoles so if you want to press e to choose something from the building menu to build you have to make sure you re not looking at literally anything else in the settlement or you ll just end up moving it around instead overall i think fallout 4 is a massive step up from fallout 3 in almost every way possible and definitely the best time i ve had playing an unmodded bethesda game but as far as being a roleplaying game i think new vegas is still much better bethesda did a great job with fallout 4 but in the end i m still left hoping that obsidian will come back and do a new game with these improved mechanics
