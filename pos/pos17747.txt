2023 this game is gaining a lot of negative traction within the total war community for a couple reasons entirely unrelated to the game poor state of warhammer 3 longstanding community desire for a more popular time period frankly awful business decisions on ca s end one very valid point about the game is it s price which definitely beggars more thought before you purchase that said tw pharaoh is a very standout entry to the total war series with over 800 hours in tw troy across steam epic i can very confidently say this is not a troy reskin in the slightest every campaign mechanic has been built from the ground up and even mechanics that also exist in troy such as the multi resource economy are greatly expanded upon and are balanced entirely differently battles are much longer bloodier affairs with fluid unit movement and more options to ensure formations are held the impending collapse of the bronze age world is captured exceptional well by all aspects of the game from visuals to pacing the game is exceptionally smooth and bug free with about 20 hours across the ea release i ve yet to encounter any bugs or persistent performance issues pharaoh s main downside is the ai which can be utterly stupid if you ve enjoyed previous total war entries you ll enjoy pharaoh
