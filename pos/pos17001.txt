2021 so i m going to be honest when the first total war warhammer came out i was thinking total war with magic and fantasy creatures that never should of happened what is this nonsense it looks like a lotr rip off but one day i started to get bored of the history total war games and decided to look into the first game and boy was i wrong then after watching some gameplay i decided to get the first game even though i knew absolutely nothing about the warhammer franchise but after barely playing the first game i started reading and watching lore videos on youtube and haven t looked back sense now i own both games and all but one of the dlc s and have already preordered the third game this game definitely improves on some of the areas that the first game needed work on the warhammer total war games have easily became my favorite two total war games and i would highly recommend them whether you know anything about the warhammer series or absolutely nothing about them
