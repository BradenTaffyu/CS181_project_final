2023 great game just disappointing that they ve decided to paywall the heck out of it with dlc running out of content 10 20 hours into the game and having to buy over 150 of dlc to get further content is pathetic when the game costs the same as similar games that easily have 200 300h of content without getting into replayable content thumbs up for the concept recommend it can be played in sandbox for many more hours but if you re a gamer that wants some structure or refuses to play games that lock away what should have been included with the launch as dlc then pass on it
