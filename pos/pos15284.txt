2014 early access review don t starve is a fantastic game and don t starve together just builds on that personally playing with people i know i found it no easier than the standard game it takes a lot of time to get into a rhythmn of surviving together you need so much more food supplies and fires i can not recommend this enough especially being that it s still in beta this game is fantastic and will only get better as they re proving with updates they re adding quite a few dst exclusive things which makes it exciting and the various game modes are awesome love wilderness game mode if you re on the fence consider getting it you will most likely sink a lot of time into this cruel unforgiving wonderful world
