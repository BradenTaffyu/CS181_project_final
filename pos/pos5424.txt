2020 early access review when i was younger i heard stories about a game called world of warcraft and how people would sit in a basement and play for hours and hours completely addicted i was terrified and never tried it because i didn t want to end up like that i didn t want to end up addicted of course nowadays i recognize that the mmo genre isn t for me and i would ve gotten bored in a few days but i still was so hesitant to try anything addicting i never even touched it but this game this game is addicting i have played a truly ungodly amount of caves of qud i m not sure what it is about it that enamors me so but within a few weeks of buying it i ve played it for over 100 hours no more than 15 of which could ve been me just leaving it open it s not healthy make no mistake this isn t a joke i don t have a punchline at the end of this this is a genuine honest to god warning to not play this game because caves of qud will suck you in you will be enamored by the bizarre world the slow realization that it s actually sci fi not fantasy the little jokes hidden everywhere but more than anything you ll get attached to your character don t get attached to your character if you must play this game you must be prepared to lose everything caves of qud is the most abusive relationship i ve ever had with a video game it lures you in with its sweet promises and spends the entire playtime of one session reeling back for a punch ready to blast you into the opposite wall so hard that your spine breaks and you are paralyzed for the rest of your life i love it 10 10
