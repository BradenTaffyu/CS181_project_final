what an incredible turn based rpg i ve spent just less than one thousand hours on this masterpiece which means its my most played singleplayer game in my adult life admittedly some hours were playing multiplayer with friends but still now there s no way that i m going to be able to list all the good things about this game in one review but i ll try my best and highlight some really good aspects to hopefully encourage anyone reading this to give it a go pros firstly the music in this game is amazing it either sounds completely badass for fights or incomparably elegant for exploring the world there were so many times during my many playthroughs that i had to make the decision of either humming along to the music or letting my ears fully embrace those beautiful instruments visually this game is stunning the details in the world and the particle effects of abilities spells look so well done and make it feel so satisfying when you cast them i also really appreciate that this games movement is very freeing for a turn based rpg i ve always disliked those games where movement is restricted to like a chess board with squares having your characters quite literally being able to move anywhere feels so much better next up the story everything has lore in this game if you love reading and want to read pages and pages of lore character backgrounds and potentially hundreds of books scattered across the game then you can most definitely do so but its not forced onto you most books that you find throughout the game aren t necessary to progress and a lot of the time there will be an option to resolve problems by fighting if you prefer a little more action its completely up to you how you want to play lastly i want to talk about the character creation the character creation in divinity is phenomenal obviously you can change the look of your character to how you want but more importantly there are 10 skill categories that you can allocate points to you can mix and match them together and pair them with mostly any type of weapon in the game the combinations you can make are endless for example want to be a persuasive fire wizard that uses daggers instead of the usual staff wands want to be a non confrontational thief that escapes his enemies by turning the floor to ice causing them to slip want to be an archer that fires love arrows to temporarily make his enemies fight for him want to be a cleric wielding a giant axe who can explode corpses well you can have all 4 in the same party i could talk about this game for hours but at the time of writing this these are the aspects of the game that came to mind now i ll talk a little bit about some very minor cons that don t put the game in any bad light but i feel are good to know anyways very minor cons gift bags if you don t care about achievements then move onto the next con gift bags are the developers way of giving their own made mods for divinity they are free little game mechanics that you can choose whether to enable in your game or not i highly recommend that you do not enable any of these for your first playthrough as some make the game considerably harder easier some of these settings are incredibly useful but the issue is since these are acted like mods achievements are disabled if you enable them so you will need to replay the game without them in order to gain any i wish the devs would have actually implemented some of these into the base game rather than adding them as mod like settings after inventory inventory management in this game could be a liiiiiiittle better there s nothing necessarily wrong with the inventory system but there are definitely a few qol changes that they could have added one example being the ability to name bags throughout the game you will pick up individual bags that you can place in your inventory and put any item inside they are incredibly useful in tidying up your inventory and reducing clutter but these bags cannot be named so you will end up having to repeatedly look inside each bag to find out which bags have which items additionally when crafting stuff if an ingredient is inside one of these bags the crafted item may appear in the bag of the ingredient instead of just appearing at the bottom of your inventory for you to sort out again not exactly a game breaking problem but definitely slightly frustrating when you have lots of items in a bag and now need to find a random crafted item amongst them all other than whats listed above i just wish the game never ended honestly i want more cool spells more races more talents more fights more of everything truly a really incredible game please give it a go because the developers deserve it thanks for reading 3
