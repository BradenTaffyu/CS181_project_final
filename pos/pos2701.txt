2019 i d recommend this game with all my heart as this game is possibly one of the most free form games i ve played in a long long time no class restrictions or anything you want to be a warrior that uses fire spells and smacks people with a staff to do magic damage sure you want to be a necromancer archer why not or create yourself an avatar that uses wind earth water and fire magic the list just goes on and on the game is almost the perfect turnbased rpg as you build play and talk your own way you can talk yourself out ve quite a few things stealing fights anything really going even further with the roleplay theme you can choose preset characters that have a history in your world and have characters that know them and love or hate or are friends or work with your character on the other hand if you choose to make a brand new character not one of the preset you create that history and change how people interact with you entirely based on your decisions throughout the game a decision in act 1 can change stuff much later in the game the combat is beautiful actually a work of art with combo systems for example if they re shocked by electricity throw a water balloon at em or make it rain on them stunned or if they re on fire throw a spell that creates an oil field below them poof big explosion this is just the bare bones use of these things some of the combos people have done on youtube and such are absolutely crazy i can t help but to give this game a huge positive review and say this game if you re a fan of turn based rpg s is entirely worth even its full price tag without a doubt in my mind this game shines so bright if played with friends but also does really well as a single player experience the combos friends and you can pull off are insane but sometimes it s fun to have complete contradicting builds and have you guys mess each other up some times i ve lost so many hours to this game just having fun with friends doing stupid builds or messing around the story is really well crafted too it s hard not to stay interested the majority of the time or even if you re not the game quite literally rewards you for exploring there are tons of hidden quests throughout the game and tons of ways to do anything in the entire game for example your first real goal is to escape a place and there are like 6 ways to do so having entirely different routes for a turn based rpg this game is in my honest opinion a 10 10 thanks for taking the time to read my review hush
