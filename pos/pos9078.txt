2020 there is a plenty of games lots of good ones and even more of well not so good ones but for many years i still found only a few games to where i always return age of empires ii master of magic dominions conquest of elysium and stellaris from my point of view right now stellaris might be considered as some sort of golden standard for grand scale strategic games by one side stellaris is fairly friendly to newcomers it is easy to understand its basics of course if you are ready to spend some time to learn from guides and tutorials such games can not be played without some period of learning i guess that it is clear and understandable after just a single view of screenshots with interface by other hand mechanics of game are deep and cleverly intertwined so even after a hundred hours of playing there still are new things to see new tricks to learn and new possibilites to use at this current moment i played stellaris for 85 hours for most games it is enough to make me feel that i had seen everything but in stellars i still feel like i am doing just a very first steps at long road to the stars stellaris is a complex game with lots of mechanics and of course it is possible to find games where certain mechanics has better implementation polaris sector has better constructor of ships and better tactical battles distant worlds has more complex resource management galactic civilizations probably has better implementation of diplomacy aurora 4x has much much more complex and interesting system of science master of orion is perfect for brief skirmish game however stellaris has everything and while its mechanics are more or less easy to understand they are deep enough to keep player entertained for many hours maybe certain things in stellaris are not as good as in other games but stellaris has a main thing that makes this game my favorite it has harmonious complexity where all elements are on right places linked and intertwined and whole construction works perfectly there are lots of micromanagement and as your interstellar empire grows it will inevitably comes to the point when constant management of economy of every planet turns into a heavy tedious burden fortunately some of routine actions may be delegated to ai and you may leave management of planets to it ai will not be as efficient as player could be but at least it does the job so player may focus on more interesting aspects such as exploration diplomacy and wars last but not least dignity of stellaris is that game is beautiful while visual part is not that important for strategic genre it is always good to play a beautiful and visually attractive game is not it most time you will look at simplified strategic map and tables with countless numbers this is perfectly normal for grand scale strategic game but you may always zoom in and see the beauty of space admire magnificient planets and stars feel awe before mighty fleet of starships and music oh my i truly love stellaris soundtrack what a beautiful and powerful compositions it has they fit perfectly into mood of the game of course there are no perfect things in our universe so stellaris is not free from flaws lets see first and foremost lets be clear about dlc situation which is a very common thing for games from paradox interactive stellaris receives frequent and well developed updates and patches game continues to develop and get bigger and better with every year by other hand developers need to receive profit so lots of new content is released as dlc i am not happy about that but alright it is fine i really want to see stellaris getting even bigger and even better but you must be ready that if you purchased basic game then you need to get dlc as they add really interesting and important content it makes stellaris fairly expensive game there are bugs and lags yet again it is understandable the more complex system is the more difficult it is to balance and maintain it as stellaris is a very complex game there are technical issues as well as imbalance in gameplay personally for me the most annoying issue is a constant desynchronisations at late stage of multiplayer games while i got tons and tons of pure pleasure from playing with friends it is really exciting to enjoy together all this simple joys of interstellar empires such as plotting betraying backstabbing mutual extermination et cetera but stellaris showed terrible performance at late stages of game some certain combinations of builds are giving player lots of advantanges well as for me i never felt a desire to play stellaris as efficiently as possible as i mentioned before stellaris is a true space opera which is perfect for roleplay yeah it is much more efficient to pick certain perks and traits for your empire so what i value stellaris for its ability to create a long and exciting story not for its competative part if you want to play a brief competetive game there are much better choices around i must warn you that game is slow stellaris is not a brief game for a couple of hours oh it is not even a small map with minimal content might take a several days to finish it stellaris is a game that encourages player to delve deep constantly analyze and calculate situation it just could not be played in a hurry so if you have only an half of hour then do not try when it comes to free time stellaris is a very demanding it literally devours hours and hours of time summa summarum if you want a huge diverse and beautiful space opera with excellent replayability if you are ready for not very steep but still inevitable learning curve if you are ready that each game will be a long marathon that may easily take a couple weeks to finish well welcome then
