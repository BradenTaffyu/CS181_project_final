2017 edit 26 6game is in a good state atm and it gets still good support i can totally recommend it i only wish they would improve the ki and make it more realistic old release review the game is in beta status atm i would like to give a neutral rating if that would be possible i had and have fun with the game but there are tons of bugs and problems atm on the other side this game has so much potential if u like the hunter and hunting aka slow paced gameplay overall and have a good pc and can live with a not perfect game you can buy it especially its not expensive the devs can turn this into a hunter primal 2 0 fail game or they can make the best hunting game out there lets see and hope the second thing happens
