2016 this is my favorite total war game to date i am relatively new to the franchine however i started with shogun 2 but did not really get into the game untill rome 2 i think the the warhammer fantasy setting is a perfect fit for total war each of the factions feels unique unlike most of the previous total war games making it a joy to play all of them it also makes diplomacy more interesting because instead of just dealing with a lot of humans you get to deal with fantastical creatures the hero units are great too they feel more impactful compared to previous generals in total war upgrading them with new skills and giving them new weapons feels more satisfying when you see them in action the game is not perfect though it lacks mouth movement during diplomacy and many factions do not even have voice lines for trade all of the empire factions look the same except for their troosp are a different color pallet all of their leaders use the same two or three models however so they don t feel distinct overall i would highly reccomend this game
