2023 very much an improvement from cs1 much more depth and lots of new ways and options to build cities only scratched the surface as i m still getting to know the mechanics but in my second city and it s very fun time just blasts by the road system alone is just amazing it s a new world compared to cs1 sadly we still have the block zoning system which makes using curvy roads a challenge as zoning gets finicky fast would have loved a more organic system that stretched buildings to the curvature but not a major issue performance wise i can t complain much playing in 1440p don t have problems i did disable motion blur i don t like it in any game anyway and also depth of field don t like this either in general if you liked cs1 chances are you love this one sure we are still missing some qol things and some ornamentals but i suppose those will come
