2019 first impressions of the game beautiful map and setting city management is intuitive the battles remind me of shogun 2 the best version of diplomacy in a total war game yet thank you for delaying the release of this game the hard work and extra time clearly payed off addendum i haven t run into any optimization or graphical issues so far but i was one of the lucky few that didn t have problems in past total war games
