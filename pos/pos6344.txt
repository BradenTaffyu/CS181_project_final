2013 looks awesome across the board great performence and lots of options to configure this game to your liking almost no blue print prototype planes sound effects are very nice polished pretty much no bugs match ui is good though there is slight mouse lag inside the menus which is rather annoying easy controls for people without a fly stick 3 game modes something for everyone it s free to play it is currently not pay to win except the reserve plane and premium hangar slots which only affects arcade mode in mid to high tiers this turns into a huge grindfest broken flight and damage models on certain planes that have been added several major patches ago and they keep putting more unfinished planes with placeholder physics in instead of finishing what is already there there have been extremely op premium flavour of the patch planes with each patch who got nerfed some patches later i suspect powercreep stock planes to upgraded planes have a huge performence delta making the level grind painful and hard there has been a lot of remove content to make it pay2get unlock with grind skins decals unlocks etc bombers are having a hard time getting properly balanced in low tier they are bullet sponges while they die like in mid high tier games if you put 5 nations into the game support them all equally or don t bother adding them in the first place power of stalinwood and leninium if you know what i mean this is pretty open to debate though and it s not the case with every plane the whole jet high tier stuff seems fairly unfinished right now in terms of content and balance if you want a real simulator that is equal to rl don t bother sim battles is a nice mode but it still lacks realism and complexity i recommend il 2 battle of stalingrad for ww2 sim nuts and dcs modular free2play too world if you want to play with modern jets if you want some quick action without a huge learning curve realism and arcade mode should be good modes for you tl dri don t recommend buying anything for this game atm due to the amount of big changes especially to premium content but it is worth getting to have some fun
