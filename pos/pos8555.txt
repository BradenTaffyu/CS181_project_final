2018 first of all i have no interest in irl hunting so my perspective is only that of a casual gamer and i m mostly writing this review to address the negativety and mostly false or innacturate criticisms of this game the two big criticisms that i see of this game are in regards to the paid dlc and bugs so let s address those both very quickly the 30 usd base game is a great value you have access to two gigantic beautiful reserves to hunt in a sufficient selection and diversity of weapons to use and enough species to hunt to keep the game fresh and exciting for well over 100 hours of gameplay even if you don t pick up any of the paid dlc most of the dlc they have released has been free and i think the paid stuff is a fair value for the optional content that it provides you don t need the atvs or tents to enjoy this game i seldom even use them those are not features that are core to the gameplay in fact the game is feature complete and perfectly playable without them so the argument that these are core mechanics that you have to pay extra for is just bogus entitlement there are enough fast travel points spread across the reserves that traveling on foot is not a big deal and if you are really going to complain about travel distance in an outdoor hunting game you probably have no business playing it in the first place what do you think hunting is supposed to be a carnival shooting gallery as far as bugs are concerned yes this game has had it s fair share of bugs there have been a few game breaking bugs but the developers have always been timely in providing patches that mostly resolve any issues that i have had as of may 2018 when i am writing this review i haven t experienced any game breaking bugs in months sure the game occasionally crashes and once every 20 30 kills or so the animal tracks disappear or an animal seemingly despawns it can be frustrating but honestly it s not a big deal it hardly ever happens and it will probably be fixed soon the developers have been fairly communicative and have done a sufficiently good job updating and maintaning this game they deserve a lot more credit than the entitled crybabies give them on the discussion board and in some of these reviews tl dri think it s a great game i ve played for 137 hours so far and will play for hundreds more in my opinion most of negative reviews and discussion posts are inaccurate if you are on the fence about purchasing this game i think you ll enjoy it as long as you aren t an entitled brat
