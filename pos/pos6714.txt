2020 not sure why i have not reviewed this yet but i suppose it s because the assumption would be that everyone knows these simulations are the bomb if you are looking for a break from shooting killing and voxel building ets2 is for you it is relaxing interesting and even educational for those who have not traveled the world and with the ton tonne of dlcs and mods available this is your own sim from top to bottom you can drive by keyboard game controller or steering wheel very easily so there is really no other investment needed like in the racing sims if you plan to get serious however a decent steering wheel like a logitech g29 and widescreen monitor really help the immersion and make you feel like you are really in it for the long haul pardon the pun pick this one or american truck simulator the next time you get a chance you won t be disappointed
