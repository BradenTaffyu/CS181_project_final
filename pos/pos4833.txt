2022 fallout 4 is an ok game if you played fallout 3 or fallout new vegas then you will feel familiar with how the game plays already the three major changes with the addition of fallout 4 the first major change is that the main character is fully voiced which some see as a downside and others as an added bonus the player character is referenced to as the sole survivor and the voice only changes based on gender not much depth in that regard but the dialogue is fully voiced even in the dlcs and its all by the same voice actors so it is consistent the second change is the rare loot system they are randomly generated there are some unique weapon drops you get through quests or after defeating a unique enemy but for the most part you get rare loot by defeating legendary enemies who will drop a certain type of weapon but the perks on the item is always random and it is level based so you will always be swapping out old good equipment for higher leveled stuff that may or may not have better enhancements this makes sure that every playthrough isn t exactly the same but also can lead to frustration if you are looking for a specific piece of gear to complete or improve your loadout and the last major update was the settlement system you can gather up junk and materials and create a post apocalyptic base for yourself and there are several locations spread out across the map there are preset building limits where smaller areas have lower build limits and vice versa it s basically fallout trying to be minecraft or any other base building mmo which was what was trendy in this era of gaming it works but its not the greatest and there is a whole meme around this system where preston garvey wants you to save a settlement the biggest gripe with the addition of this is how often settlements get attacked in the game if a player wants to push through the storyline they do not want to be distracted by a settlement raid nor do they want to be punished for wanting to play for the story and ignoring the raid only to lose the colony and all their settlers they acquired at that settlement if you like rpg shooters or are a fan of fallout then you should enjoy this game but nobody will say that fallout 4 was their favorite fallout 3 or fallout new vegas still subjectively better games
