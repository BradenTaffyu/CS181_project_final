2018 it s a casual simulator with a bit of economic gameplay just driving along the roads is pretty relaxing main downside is there s only a few trucks in the game but there s a mod manager where you can easily install trucks made by other people pretty similar in gameplay compared to euro truck simulator 2 better mapping quality but less content available different scenery but basically the same game the map expansions are well worth it too
