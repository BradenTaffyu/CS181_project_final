2018 life is strange is a modern approach over the classic point click adventure genre driven by an emotional storyline you play as max caulfield a teenage girl who can t wait to go back to her hometown arcadia bay but this time to ingress into blackwell academy one of the most prestigious senior high schools in oregon specialized in science and arts going back home is not that easy but max is excited and it s just not because the well known and famous photographer mark jefferson is teaching at blackwell it s also because life in the big city of seattle isn t as special as it sounds max grew up in arcadia bay with her best friend chloe price together they made the little fishing town their own playground but since all good things come to an end so did this too chloe s father died in a car accident and max left soon after it creating an even bigger void in chloe s life now max is back in town and these two forces of nature are inevitably bound to meet again and when they do the whole world changes on her very first semester in blackwell max hasn t yet contacted her old friend chloe but she thinks about her daily yet she keeps being pushed back by her own insecurity life however being strange and all had other plans max does indeed meet her friend but not in the perfect circumstances as she witness chloe being murdered in the school s bathrooms the terrific scene breaks with max waking again just a few moments before the tragic incident occurrence this is the very first time the player can change things through max reverse time and save her best friend life is strange presents a very distinct story driven by two different patterns a crime thriller adventure and a time travel sci fi experience these two factors join together in what is without a doubt one of the most relevant video games of the decade developed by dontnod entertainment remember me vampyr and published by square enix life is strange shines through the rich storytelling fantastic developed characters and detailed setting which sets a small world alive like we rarely see mechanically life is strange plays out as any other point click game but the player has full control over max s real time movements other than just point and click on a specific location it s definitely a more modern approach into the genre and appropriated for new players not used in the classics this also brings a more depth and closed relationship with the environment and its npc s max can look at objects and people talk and act just like traditional and popular games such as day of the tentacle and broken sword time management works really well when interacting with npc s using extra knowledge for information help or just progress through the story however one can use this just for the fun at any point in the game even though its linear path shows limits it s a fantastic implementation of freedom rewinding time is not only used when needed it s an ability that can be used anytime anywhere and that makes it even more special as max rewinds time the world changes around her but objects kept from previous timelines remain so you can imagine some fun happening playing through this emotional adventure one can see some interesting influences surfing up such as the proclaimed us tv show twin peaks and the australian hit top of the lake movies such as 12 monkeys and the butterfly effect come out as references as well but it s the very specific and unique atmosphere that creates a very particular place for this game although linear the world is quite alive as one can learn a lot of things by reading the flyers posters specific objects and interact with different type of people this brings the detective inside of us and max is great at snooping around her diary is filled with clues details and extras allowing the player the browse it every time something interesting catches the eye learning about arcadia bay and its people will lead you to a much more sensitive path as real struggles start to appear along the progress max will face some serious decisions options matter and have a deep meaning across different episodes changes outcomes and may even end up saving lives but overall they have small impacts on characters daily life that become huge eventually it s not extremely complex but it s not random either a cause of action and reaction that influence both max s relationship with chloe and the crime thriller based story line whatever the player chooses it will be stuck with across the five different episodes that s how the save game works and even though it may not sound like it it s for the best artistically life is strange shows a huge different color palette from what we ve used to in unreal engine 3 games going with a much dedicated and customized style for both art and design characters are built aesthetically with small details that brings them alive in their role position style and age everything else however sometimes looks like it s a world painted on canvas with brush effects over walls or random objects in particular objects gain a lot of detail with just shadow play and the variations of colors truth is life is strange would be a very plain and boring game to look at without as many small details covering up every area rust dirt a specific rock in a very peculiar position or even a tree that cuts the sunset bloom it just brings a whole new visual effect into the table small details like these are what saves this game and at the same time end up giving it such a strong atmosphere right from the very first minute we can tell dontnod did a fantastic job portraying the high school life with an attitude in their design from graffiti vandalism the subliminal messages the whole aura surrounding the popular groups from the skaters the nerds remaining aside and all the social effects of sociopathic behavior however life in arcadia bay isn t much different it s not what max remembers it s somehow decaying and it s almost just a shadow of what it used to be to create this effect i deeply believe the studio imagined arcadia bay at its prime and slowly started to corrupt it with abandon sounds pretentious but it s actually an amazing way of understanding how much thought went behind this concept in order to give away such idea as story unveils more and more secrets are uncovered in particular with adult subjects life is strange is definitely an adult themed game with subjects like bullying suicide predatory behavior and many other issues that haunt many teenagers and adults alike it s impossible not to be emotionally touched by this game and its events in particular because the character development is so well made they gain more than just a name and an appearance the directors made sure the engagement with npc s would have the necessary impact to matter and ultimately create even tough decisions for those playing which adds a huge replayability for this title although the characters were built to serve as a realism point of view and the sci fi elements work as a metaphor life is strange is much more than that there are several theories online that everyone is advised to check upon completing the game i still feel this journey as a very intimate one and should be judged based on everyone s perspective in particular since time travel is such a complex subject it s impossible not to bring fantasy into the whole concept life is strange is an adventure of introspect love nostalgia and moments of desperation that can only be saved by friendship a story of overcoming obstacles dealing with each others problems and life itself 9 10
