2019 early access review mixed review so i will list the good and bad good fun to play with friends you have stuff to do for 20 hours exploring and survival is done well in creative you can build a pirate shipbad sometimes lag sometimes trouble locating islands alone this is boring sorry shark you are not enough company my alpaca named marcel keeps dying because he refused to eat fixed now but rip 4 marcels edit new engine and rudder added much control new islands are easily explored by one person lore added finally you can charge your empty batteries finally you can too farm honey on your raft character models to find biofuel consumption and making is a meh for me if you add saltwater too fast to the filter you lose the empty bottle or cup
