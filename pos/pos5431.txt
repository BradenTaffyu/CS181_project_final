2017 early access review create character imur the timesplitting arconaut travel to red rock to kill baddies slaughtering everything with my time bending powers last floor has dozens of enemies in a single room summon a clone of myself through space and time to assist in combat clone has everything i have equiped i have a frag grenade equipped you died killed by imur this game is what a true roguelike should be a procedurally generated adventure that is only limited by your creativity this starts with character creation you can choose to be a true kin a pure human with advanced skills or a mutant with the ability to modify their genes and attain obsurd powers and abilities these mutations can manifest as physical traits such as multiple arms to use more weapons nightvision to see in the dark regeneration to restore lost limbs and hitpoints mutations also add supernatural psychic powers such as creating portals in space time to banish enemies to a random location in the world or yourself pyromancy cryomancy creating barriers or even cloning yourself to assist in combat both mental and physical mutations can be negatives to increase your creation points or challenge yourself you may also choose a background that will buff your stats and start you off with random gear and some skills after character creation the game opens up to you the world of qud is a retro future post human apocalyptic tophet the denizens here struggle everyday and the running currency is precious clean drinkable water the landscape is rife with tunnels wells caves ruins towns holy sites and fallen cities quest specific areas caves are procedural are always the same but the land is dotted with randomized locations so each playthrough offers new exploration every creature belongs to a faction that exists in the world flaura and fauna and you can piss them all off or try and befriend them or instigate war between them you can choose to follow the main questline or just wander the world in search of treasure glory scrap artifacts or forbidden knowledge the first few levels can be difficult the first major quest you can recieve sends you to a low level dungeon to kill a creature and bring its corpse back to town but this can prove difficult when a shotgun weilding upright walking canine beast shoots a hole through your chest i recommend killing creatures outside the starting town to gain a few levels whn you re ready head out into the rust and find yourself and die in increasingly hilarious ways the game offers much more than i have experienced at this point and thats the beauty of it caves of qud is a masterwork roguelike up there with dungeoncrawl and dwarf fortress winning isn t always possible but you ll always have a story after each playthrough all in all for 10 bucks theres no reason this game shouldn t be in your library if you re looking for an endlessly fun roguelike rpg title tl drif you combine fallout dwarf fortress and dungeoncrawl into a single game you get play it
