2013 war thunder is a game that will change your perspective on flying games this game is free to play and does a fairly decent job at staying away from the pay to win aspect that most free to play games have the graphical fidelity in this game is stunning the scenery is beautiful and maps are very well put together and are just incredible to fly around in the planes are a wonder to fly in and make you want to stick with it and learn its strengths and weaknesses the overall gameplay is very good and never gets old and dull with more maps are being added in each new patch to keep the rotation fresh and entertaining and with you learning new tactics and skills to take down your foe there is quite a bit of customisation allowing you to put decals on your plane and change the skin to one of a differnt theatre that the plane fought in or an iconic ace s design depending on how you look at it this could be a good or bad thing and that is the game becomes quite a bit of a grind after a while the business model of this game is fairly good as you really cant pay to win you can buy premium planes with real money but they serve as a way to gain exp and money slightly quicker but arent overpowered as they are just like any other plane in its tier only they are allowing you to gain money and research points quicker there is a premium account which offers bonuses to money and research points and allows you to add more decals to your plane stunning visuals great flying mechanics great with historcal accuracy can be a bit of a grind later on slight bias towards the developers country russia overall i d give this game a 9 10 the graphics are great the flying is fantatic it s definetly worth a try and will most likely change your view on aviation games and hopefully will make you like them
