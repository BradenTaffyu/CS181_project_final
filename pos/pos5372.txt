2022 early access review caves of qud made me rethink how i approach video games before playing i thought i had no patience for video games that require me to learn systems video games that are slower and more methodical i had tried many older games and other traditional rogue likes but bounced off of them extremely hard but when i gave a chance after falling in love with what i had seen of the pixel art and heard of the lore my brain expanded i went into the game expecting to learn and work to understand it and in doing so i fell in love with the game and the act of learning and working to understand the systems and how to play the game after playing qud i ve dived deep into older more obscure more obtuse games and found the weird janky and magical things that hide there i love caves of qud it s a game that changed how i see the medium and plus its fun and stuff too
