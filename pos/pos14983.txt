2014 update this review is severially outdated and it will not be correct sorry for this inconvience when i first got my key i got really exicted to the point where i ve gotten over 400 days on a world w my friends here are some of the basic things you should keep in mind about while playing with your friends starting off once you start off you have 3 choices or gamemodes to play with your friends survival wilderness and endlesssurvival basically same twist as if you payed endless just if everyone on the server is dead a counter goes down for someone to join that is alive or the whole world gets reset with the same generation presets wilderness when you join the server you spawn in a random location sometimes an island if your unlucky and you need to find your group to set up camp once you die or have died you are taken to the change character screen and respawn in a new location with your camera rotated in a different pos and if you look on your map there will be a small circle on where you ve last died keep in mind you die again that circle updates to where you last died so try to get back to your stuff without dying endless ah my favorite of all the gamemodes when you join the server you spawn in from a jury rigged portal and begin surviving if you die you become a ghost with the character traits of your character you can respawn if you haunt one of the following meat effigy life giving amulet touch stone jury rigged portal and tale tell heart if you respawn from the jury rigged portal or tale tell heart you will lose around 20 max health points you can get those lost hit points back from getting a booster shot which requires 3 papyrus 2 healing salves and 1 stinger yes stingers finally have a use once you join the server depending on the size max amount of players you basically play regular don t starve if join a larger server with more people there s a silm chance that you will be able to survive the up coming winter or night which can be difficult depending if pvp is on or not and since armor has now been changed to take less damage i e wood armor 80 reg ds 60 dst marble 95 reg ds 80 dst football helm 80 reg dst 60 dst characters wilson pros grows a beardcons none wilson is a character that i m pretty sure everyone is going to see alot of since he s the first character and really has no downfalls even though it takes 19 days for wilson to get his homeless man beard it will protect you in winter willow pros doesn t take fire damagestarts with a lighter infinte torch cons when on low sanity will cause lots of forest firescan grief other players flamable walls crops willow is a good character for surviving the winter and helping out your friends in dst but she can be used to be the most annoying person in the entire server she can run around starting massive forest fires and buring down vauable resources as well as causing lots of lag wolfgang pros gets stronger on a full stomachhas more hpcons 1 5x the faster hunger drain at full stomachmoves and deals less damage at a smaller stomachloses more sanity in night afternoonah wolfgang more of a fighter than a gardener wolfgang can be useful for tanking spiders nest and killing of those annoying tall birds and getting there eggs the only downfall is if you have a lot of food toghether it s not going to last very long amongest 6 players if you are playing as wolf gang only power up to full stomach when in need don t just waste food to be a full stomache because food will be eaten fast wendy pros has a ghost sisterdoesn t lose much sanity in darkcons does 25 less damage than all charactersloses 50 sanity when spawning abigail inwendy is one of my personal favorite characters just to add a little challange to the game even though she doesn t hit hard she losses no sanity in the afternoon as well she can spawn her sister in after 2 4 days by killing any animal creature near the flower she will lose 50 sanity for spawning he in even if another player kills something near the flower but the fun part is abigail does splash damage to mobs near her if you need to fight something send abigail or your friends to kill it if abilgail dies go pick her flower up if you can t find it theres a minimap icon for it wx78 pros can eat any food that is spoiled stale and take no penalty can be charged by lightningcan eat gears to level up max 400 hp 200 hunger 300 sanity also gears give health hunger and sanity back if eaten cons takes damage in the rainstarts with low stats 100 hp 100 hunger 100 sanity wx78 is a good character if you can get to a supply of gears fast as well your going to need to hunt down a pig village for an umbrella if you don t get an umbrealla right off the bat you will loss 0 25 of 1 hp every 3 5 seconds if your lucky enough and you make an umbrealla you won t have the chance of being struck by lightning which will cause you too lose 33 sanity but not freeze during winter and can glow like a torch the effect only lasts for one day so don t be adventuring in the middle of the night if the radius of light is shrinking but can be benifical if you use if effectively wickerbottom pro starts off with all science machine reciepes unlocked able to craft her own booksstarts off with 2 papyrus cons can t sleeptakes more penalty for eating spoiled or stale foodwickerbottom the walking science machine you can pretty much help your friends by going right to an achlemy engine instead of wasting the time of making an science machine even though you can t sleep there are multiple ways of getting your sanity back up with the abiliy to make your own books you have the power to instantly grow all crows and plants spawn lots of birds and more for the cost of your sanity and yes i know this sounds like wickerbottom is a bad character as long as you know how to get sanity back without murdering the flower population the rest of the characters have no been added while writing this review over all this is a great game and i recommend it to any and all players edit you don t need don t starve to play this you just need a don t starve toghether key please stop adding me
