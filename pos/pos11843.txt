2018 warning if you plan on playing this on the steam deck beware that the input subsystem on the native steamos version is utter garbage it can be overcome on lower difficulty settings but as soon as you go for higher difficulties the game becomes legit unplayable i do not recommend using it until the input code is entirely overhauled for the native steamos version use the windows version via the proton compatibility layer it s so much better coded it feels like lowering the difficulty by one or two cells do i recommend dead cells short answer yes with an if long answer no with a but my review is a positive one because not only most people want a short answer but i also wish to support the indie studio motion twin with their work choices and setting a good example of how video game studios could work dead cells is fun it is extra fun if you like the genre platformer rogue like with unlockables and even more so if you like the style 32bits 2d graphics with modern processing cd quality audio with medieval inspired music but it is also frustrating and it can be very frustrating so short answer if you like rogue likes with unlockables can deal well with frustration do not mind the rather high asking price and possibly like the style by all means go for it now let s get to the longer no with a but part so why would i not recommend dead cells if it is fun assuming it is done without too many bugs well the main reason lies in the way the game is developed the developer is a small french indie studio in which every member is equal while i respect and salute the initiative it shows a clear community oriented mentality which could be a good thing but unfortunately has some pretty important drawbacks while not marked as such dead cells is effectively an early access game the reason for that is very simple the studio listens to the community a lot a real lot again this isn t necessarily a bad trait but it definitely gives the game a much less stable gameplay and much less stable overall experience so if you pick dead cells you can reasonably expect your experience to change sometimes drastically after any update for example the recent update 1 1 aka pimp my ride has angered a lot of players and even if it has imho improved a lot of things it has unquestionably made the game harder some changes that made the game harder were extreme nerfing of the damage reduction items and skills elites are more dangerous they have more skills like beams or shields enemies with a shield cannot be stunned anymore item stat rerolls got more expensive the yolo mutation get a free death once does not allow the player to pick another mutation once used hence making it pretty useless some hp buffs prevent the character from healing in some ways looking at you dead inside those changes are not necessarily all bad but the amount of them coupled with them touching the essence of the gameplay makes the game feel a lot less released as the game is being heavily modified regularly now the other main reason why i would not recommend to buy the game is the fact that while the studio is listening to the community when adding features or re vamping the experience they do much less when it is about fixing bugs there is still no way to adjust the deadzone of a joypad and as a result the character randomly faces the wrong direction which in a game where it is important to kill enemies fast is a huge drawback also when the character is about to die or the explorer trait activates the game laggs by about one second which usually means you take damage in the former case it means you can never dodge if an enemy is about to kill you and you always die anyway so if you want a polished consistent experience with your games i would not recommend it but stay tuned in case the developers eventually chill about modifying the game and start fixing the bugs
