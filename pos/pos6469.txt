2017 i m a 35 year old female who doesn t drive in real life somehow i m addicted to this game i bought this after christmas in the winter sale also bought the dlc scandinavia and going east and already have nearly 200hours of playtime on it and i m ranked 33 ingame with 10 garages and a bunch of drivers working on achievements now so why do i love this game erm well even on the simpliest driving settings i play using keyboard and mouse i ve come a long way and learned so much about driving a truck and actually getting an education about city names in europe lol in my first few days i wasn t using lights half the time cruise control indicating looking left and right at junctions moving lanes in time on the motorways and hitting barriers other vehicles i was getting fined for everything including falling asleep at the wheel keep your fuel tank topped up too or find out the hard way when you run out and need a tow lol i can now do the harder reverse parking and yesterday i finally got the achievement for no fines damage and in time urgent delivery for 1000km lol a real achievement for me this game is fun in many ways i like recruiting new drivers and training them in certain areas kind of in my head give them a backstory like ethan who i recruited and is based at my cambridge branch is most skilled at delivering expensive cargo he comes from a rich family that think hes at uni but hes dropped out to travel europe literally i also love seeing real landmarks in cities like the fortress in salzburg along with the beautiful mountains anyway so even if you re not usually into driving games this might surprise you definately value for money
