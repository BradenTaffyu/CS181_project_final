2016 i ve played enough by now to know that this is a solid and good game it has some interesting things to say about the 4x model and correctly approaches the many pitfalls that other games just like it have failed at in the end it also has a good price point which talks to me about the thought put into addressing it s audience o k the good the bad and the ugly good it has intricate depth to almost all aspects of the game once you think you have figured something out you quickly find out that there is much much more the sound track is really good the ai does not simply focus on kill kill kill they act appropriate to their civ traits and tech levels shocker it s really a very pretty game bad the ai that auto designs your space fleet is terrible and until i figured out what was going on i lost like 4 or 5 games to crazy inferior civs because of it the ui needs some tweeking for example there are moons that you need to click on sometimes that are so small that you have to barely adjust your mouse this way or that in order to click it very dumb the tutorial for the game does a farely decent job at addressing the basics like what one interface or another is for but does nothing for others additionally there are entire aspects of the game that could use some sort of information but has none to offer in some way this lends to an atmosphere of mystery but some people would just call this poor game design the inbetween the tech tree is non existant in lue of this basic 4x concept the game uses a new and interesting mechanic that the game designers call a sort of semi random lottery you draw 3 random techs from the pool of possible techs every time you start a new game or finish researching a technology it s really interesting to be sure but semi frustrating because i have no idea what the technologies are that are possible my initial frustration was that i couldn t make a plan like in civ 5 for example in civ 5 i look at the tech tree and look at what resources are available and make a plan that involves my ersearch path and the units i build to take advantage of available materials around my cities after playin about 15 games now i can tell you that i really like the way stellaris does this i m sure that the developers looked at this and called it a risk but in the end i think it s something unique a risk in game design that has payed off the ugly fleet battles in stellaris are sure pretty but unlike a game like sins of a solar empire that absolutely hit the concept of fleet battles out of the park home run style stellaris really just failed once a battle begins you have no control over it what so ever you can t for example force a singular ship that is being focused by the other fleet to retreat there is only one thing you can all do once combat begins force the entire fleet to retreat and oddly enough there is a random trait that fleet leaders can develop after retreating that disable even that small piece of control so frustrating so all that said i think that if you like games like civ 5 gal civ sins or any 4x like that then you should certainly check this game out i m still having a lot of fun with it
