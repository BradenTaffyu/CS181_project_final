2017 i am giving a quick review because i strongly believe that after what ca did with the game post release it has become one of my favourite tw games the good graphics varied factions new province system gives you mini objectives that add some structure to the campaign army system and traditions great audio and music lots of dlcthe bad performance this game will eat your pc alive agents they are both too powerful and their risk is not satisfying at all diplomacy better than before but still feels random lots of dlcoverall it s easily become my favourite historical total war game i like some of the new systems they have in place and the wonderful setting means you get to fight with against legionnaires war elephants horse archers chariots heavy cavalry ballista so much variety recommended for in its current state every tw player must try this game it is a good starting point for new tw players as it is by far more streamlined than the old games for better or for worse and for those that bought this on release or were turned off by the release problems i ask you to try this game again with the fixes and changes in place and maybe with some mods it is now a great and authentic total war entry
