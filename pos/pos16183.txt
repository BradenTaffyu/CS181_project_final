2014 to clarify this is an engine to play board games you can play almost any game you can think of there have been weekly or at least monthly updates and they keep adding more features the community requests i had one issue with the workshop not syncing and the devs actually worked with valve to get the issue resolved quickly the only problem for new players is finding games to join you need to look for groups that host tts games an easy one is tabletop simulator club look for that group in steam groups once you play a few games you will realize how great this engine sandbox is and if you find a few people to play online with you will have hours of entertainment last comment i had to chance to meet the developers at pax prime and they both seemed extremely nice can t wait to see where they take tts next or their next project
