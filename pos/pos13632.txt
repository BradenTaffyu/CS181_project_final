2017 where do i start with arma 3 1st of all have i played enough of this game no not in the slightest my total playtime see above is pathetic in comparison to those around me i see upwards of 2000 3000 4000 hours just looking at the reviews currently at the time of writing this review i sit on a measly 61 hours of gameplay so i am in no way an expert of this game what i can tell you is that there are moments in that 61 hours of gameplay that i will probably never forget this game makes you feel things you won t feel in any other shooter call of duty thrives on high adrenaline rapid paced combat battlefield slows it down a bit but maintains a good balance of action and spacing between engagements arma 3 is a completely different ballpark there is a lot of spacing between engagements which adds massive suspense and makes every firefight very very meaningful when combat initiates there is definately adrenaline pumping action but it s not fast combat is very slow almost methodical just like real life but very very awesome some things that you ll see in an arma firefight that you will not see anywhere else engagements will be very long distance often hundreds of meters away especially if you re roaming the hills or open wilderness enemies may only be a fleck in your scope on another hill entirely several football fields away from you you often won t know where you re getting shot from if you re taken by surprise you don t get any indicators that say hey someone to your left just shot you instead you ll be forced to take cover and locate the enemy the old fashioned way watching and listening if you get shot you probably wont have time to react one or two shots will kill you without much warning teamplay is crucial medics anti tank heavy gunners all have a part to play in their teams success communication on a whole other level there is a radio audio system in the game that is essential to a squad s success squad leaders will be vocal squadees must be willing to take orders and communicate with their superioirs directions will not be called out like left right but rather with compass bearings such as there s at least 3 of them at 248 stand crouch prone is also at another level entirely you can also hunch over stand up super tall sit down lean on your side bend your body left and right etc manipulating these stances and using them to show as little of you as possible may be a key factor on whether you live or die every move you make has a pro and a con attached to it fire your weapon might kill someone but you might also give your position away or get shot as you peak out of cover forget to look left arma teaches that wherever you don t look there will be something that kills you no hitmarkers you have to make your own call as to whether or not the guy you just shot is dead if you make the wrong call your squad may advance only for one of them to be shot by a very much alive enemy solider tanks and armored vehicles are terrifying it s not like battlefield where a tank shows up everybody continues their daily routines and hopefully somebody with anti tank weaponry deals with the 15 ton chunk of metal armored vehicles are terrifyingly powerful with weapons foot soldiers can only dream of a whole squad of 20 people will immediately hit the deck if one of them shpws up hoping that their at guys can do the job because you don t respawn back into the heat of battle you reaspawn in a base in the middle of nowhere and you either have to take a helicopter to meet with your squad or halo jump which teleports you to an exaxct location but 6000 feet up in the sky forcing you to have to use your parachute to land safely halo jumping back into combat is suicide big shiny glorified baloons make really really good target practice that also means if you lose that aforementioned anti tank guy you re hooped unless someone takes the risk and picks the launcher off his dead body that is unless the tank armored car blows him up before he gets there then 20 people are stranded with very little to do which means every life counts the combat is unreal i remember we had to clear this city of enemies entirely it took us upwards of an hour but we checked every single building room by room until in the center plaza there he stood the last man we had to kill all the other building were checked and i saw a head poking out behind this obstacle in the dead center of the city i found him i yell over the squad s radio central garden straight north i notice he pokes his head around the corner my assault rifle was depleted i knew i should have packed more flipping ammo so i pull out my pistol fire miss fire miss rinse andrepeat i empty my whole clip and the man is not dead so i reload and just start terminator walking my way towards this guy firing every round i have the guy doesn t poke his head out anymore one clip exhausted then another and another this guy will not die i least i m supressing him then he pops around shoots me once dead my squad catches up what the hell was all that shooting the commander expresses they grenade him dead wish i d have thought of that sooner the medic gives me a nice repair i borrow some mags off of him we get on the chopper talking about how wicked that mission was we get a new one something about planting a bomb somewhere at this point the squad has bonded we knew eachothers names at least we just kept talking getting closer to the lz mocking the pilot for driving too low to the ground we land and immediately the chopper comes under fire run spread out the heli blows up before it can leave we all die in a blaze of glory and i left the game after that i cannot recommend this game enough
