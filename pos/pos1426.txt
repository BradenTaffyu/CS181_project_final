2017 early access review time to write an in depth review for this game i m tired of seeing reviews edit apparently many people are downvoting this review and i have no idea why if you downvoted this review please lemme know what mistakes i made while writing this edit 2 tl dr added in the enddisclaimer do not buy this game if you are one of these people who need a constant inflow of new content new content in this game takes time to come but when it does it s a blast and is 99 of the time bug free pros incredibly realistic very in depth cooking system crafting amazing mod community 4 seasons food rots etc map is huge freaking huge in 250 hours i believe i ve explored around 20 of the map some constructions are incredibly atmopsheric very solid soundtrack permadeathneutral slow development some features could have more depth like medicines the tutorial doesn t grab you by the hand and show every feature the game has with the incredibly amount of filthy casuals these days i ve seen some people complaining about the lack of tutorials in many games so there s your heads up negative ui isn t very intuitive and is a bit clunky for new players no npcs but that are being worked on no cars this is about to release but at the time i m writing this review they aren t there yet not many events which might make the endgame a bit boring for some guns are hard to use and aren t very rewarding when used additional informationagain this game has a very slow development some people complain they have been working for 2 years on npcs and they aren t out yet but the developers are incredible patient and like to bugtest everything before releasing you ll hardly see gamebreaking glitches going live however like mentioned above the map is huge and there is a lot of content for you to mess around especially on multiplayer which in my opinion interacting with real players is much better than interacting with npcs if you give this game a try i doubt you ll play less than 50 hours which is amazing considering the price tag tl dr good game with original mechanics almost bug free and that will still have a very long early access new content takes months to come if you buy the game buy for what it is right now and not for what it can be in the future thank you for reading if you need more information found any typos or have any other complaints please comment on this review i ll gladly reply back
