2023 after playing the game for about 400 hours i would like to leave my part among other reviews and tell you a little bit about what i liked and what i didn t like about this work of art i just can t say it any other way first of all i would like to say that i am a very big fan of the harry potter universe and i know most of the details in that world quite well what i really liked about the game was that it allowed me to visualize what i drew from the books or stories speaking of the game itself i d like to mention its diversity in the first few hours i immediately noticed how knowledgeable and hard the developers approached its creation just an incredible amount of small details whether it s a sheaf of bright sparks during intense battles or raindrops in bad weather the game won t let you get bored for a second as there will simply be plenty of both main and side quests each one unique as someone who enjoys collecting items i really liked the fact that there were plenty of opportunities so here i thoroughly enjoyed what i liked speaking of the main component of the game and more specifically the story i would like to note the fact that it is made just incredibly convenient and interesting the game was the first for me in this genre and it was able to leave me with only positive impressions what s worth just the battles each of which is unique and interesting in its own way the soundtrack and the visuals in the game are just masterpieces and allow you to fully immerse yourself in the world of magic and magic
