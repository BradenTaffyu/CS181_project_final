2021 early access review i was watching tv when i realized i was completely alone none of my neighbors seemed to survive i bashed mrs jansen s head the other day i wonder if i should bury the corpse maybe it s better if i drag it into the pile and set everything on fire is it bad that i don t feel sad i mean i ve never ever been this fit also when was the last time i even read a book i don t miss anything from before i am pretty good at this and i m afraid i m having the best time of my life 10 10 would recommend
