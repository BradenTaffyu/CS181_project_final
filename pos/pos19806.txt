2019 with all the honesty even though i considered this to be the best rts of all time most time consuming game it was a stressing nightmare to play before de now with all the small changes not only graphics but sound and mechanics helpers farm refill quees visible on top with villager count on resources this game now is much more friendly to newcomers and it s good incredibly good they even brought tutorials helping you to get into multiplayer games meanwhile it all is lore friendly experience this has the longest campaign series from all rts games i still feel overwhelmed by the game and sometimes villagers still block themself but now aoe2 de is much less stressful i am discovering this game again as a new modern rts milestone sad thing is that multiplayer is sometimes garbage you waste your time to get into lobby because your own is invisible to anyone but your friends after you connect and start you will get constant lag issues no matter the ping spontanious lags are annoying maybe now they solved these issues
