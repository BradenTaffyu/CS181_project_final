2016 early access review so much death and grief in my 43 hours of gametime i can t believe i will actually give this game a thumbs up recommendation i guess it s because the foundation of the game is very well put together and entertaining i keep finding new things in the game all the time even with so many hours put into it being able to build my own summer car from scratch is something i ve missed since the street legal days many many years ago i really hope development continues and that we will see more cars and features in the future
