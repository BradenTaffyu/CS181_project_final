2020 house flipper is a fantastic addictive game there are many days when i feel a twinge of guilt cleaning a virtual home while neglecting the home i live in i find it soothing to paint walls and pick up trash place tiles and pull weeds mow grass and chop down trees there are no time limits and no npcs to bother me while i play just me a belt full of tools and a house to flip 10 10
