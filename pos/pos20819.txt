2023 i have played this game for 24hrs being a fan of the harry potter books and games i can say this is probably one of the greatest pc games i have ever played and enjoyed which i can loose hours of my life in i have not been rushing but going through the quests fast and i am only at 41 completion of the quests and 6 exploration 55 field guides and 23 combat and cant remember the other but this game has hours of play time and this is just through the one house you can do it 4 times jesus what a single player the graphics are outstanding on high now im running a i9 128gb of corsair vengence pro and a old school gtx 1080ti palit and the recommended from the in game bench mark was high which is driven by my old graphics card i have the odd stutter here and there but hey they aint no pvp er gonna get you chill wait for it to dissapear in about 3 seconds and love it again i have had one crash since 7th of feb and this was self inflicted with games being to download in the background etc but to cut a long story short buy it
