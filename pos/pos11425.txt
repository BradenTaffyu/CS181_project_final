2015 early access review as of late 2014 and up i hereby proclaim this a sucessful early access title long have i waited to play a proper zombie survival and this game has filled my ever longing need for a zombie base defence type game when playing this game i have went through 5 major stages so far 1 yeah my gravel hut is amazing 2 r i p gravel hut3 alright i have just built a proper wooden structure with a spike defence that stops them from immediately ruining my base exellent 4 grind it up because my next base is made out of reinforced concrete and has a decent spike defence which will prove to be nearly impenetrable 5 now time to sit back and watch my success unfold before my eyes when hordes of zombies fall before me without having to lift a finger this game will reward your knowledge of the game and challenge you by exploiting your weaknesses then there is multiplayer which i can assume is a significant raise in difficulty to counter player inteligence anyways thanks for reading my not very entertaining funny or in depth review of the game it s just one of those reviews that i aim to help better the name of this developing masterpiece
