2020 its not for everybody but a good game nonetheless bethesda really f ed up the release now it is quite playable there are no more ctds and almost all game breaking glitches are gone the ones that mattered anyway now all i see are headless ghouls infrequently think of this game as singleplayer with other people in it 97 of people play by themselves fyi good gunplay a generous c a m p system and fairly good events and mechanics make this game stand out if you are instant gratification happy gamers this game is not for you there are a lot of quests and 3 4 of them are literally 3 hours long if you are taking your time always explore passionately running from one overlong quest to the next is not how you play this game just leave your camp and walk one way until you trigger miniquests or come across cool locations the beauty in this game is the detail
