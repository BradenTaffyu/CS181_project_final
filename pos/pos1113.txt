2018 early access review an absolutely fantastic game it has so much depth and realism to it that it blows me away playing this with a friend while playing it permadeath style was one of the best gaming experiences i ve ever had if the isometric style doesn t bother you which would be a shame if it did then i d 100 recommend this at full price which is still cheap you deal with so much here are just a few of those things injuries illness temperature hunger thirst tiredness boredom anxiety depressionthere is so much more than just that though you can gain skills and xp in various things such as cooking shooting mechanics carpentry etc you can build your own base or convert another building into one or simply just throw some sheets over your windows have a nice cup of tea and wait for it all to blow over seriously though why are you still reading this click that buy button oh and if you think you re pretty good at the game wait until winter or better yet wait until the second winter when there is more or less no food anywhere enjoy
