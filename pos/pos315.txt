2017 tl dr really fun definitely a 9 10 if you like farming fighting and flirting but aren t too bothered with how deep any of these features go this game is worth a go update the multiplayer and follow up updates made the game even more fun to play and worth returning to updating from a 7 10 to a 9 10 the farming is the biggest lure for me but when you reach mid to late game you will notice that the farm is mostly maintained by itself and you just have to worry about appeasing the locals if you haven t maxed their affection already fighting monsters if you haven t gotten bored of it already or tending to your livestock if you even have any made more interesting is that the end game becomes even more self sufficient when you can start having the farm run itself completely only needing you to plant seeds and the townsfolk do come with their own stories and character developments so there is always some npcs you will end up liking and being nice to them will see you rewarded as you go along and i think they basically keep returning the favours as time goes by however once you max out an npc or marry them that s where the interest stops you had your fun but now they are just doing their usual routines and talking to them no longer feels all that great since they repeat the same lines about how today is or that you re a good buddy but hey more updates are coming and i am certainly excited for them d especially the long awaited multiplayer the game is a pleasant distraction and it s also mod compatible so i can definitely recommend this game if you need to kill some time but don t want to get too enthralled by a story
