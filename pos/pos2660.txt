2023 dropping a positive review not only because i genuinely think the game is good enough but also because there are a lot of whiners who don t nothing about this game is this the weakest current pm game maybe but it s also free so if you play it and get oh so disappointed that s on you this is a game to boost the income of pm so they can work on other games the way i see it is it s a kickstarter that already gave us more benefits than just an empty promise if you don t want to support the company you don t have to simple as that but the current amount of negative reviews are beyond unreasonable
