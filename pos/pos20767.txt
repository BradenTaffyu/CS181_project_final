2023 this game is a dream come true i waited 20 years for this i m every second of this the atention to detail is amazing and sometimes you get the skyrim vibes the ost is amazing and pays tribute to john william s with lots of variations from the og i gotta adress the elephant in the room tho performance is not great it boggles my mind that they chose to go with unreal engine 4 for a game of this magnitude specially when one of wb s own devs have an amazing engine firebird from monolith used in shadow of war which these devs could have borrowed if wb wasn t to give monolith the project for what reason may be maybe because they are doing wonder woman my point is ue4 is dated it used single threaded performance so the 1 lows are disgusting and all over the place 12900k 4090 the hardcoded taa to mask the engine s limits and rough edges is vomit inducing at times 2nd complaint they should have gone further with this project npc colision and interaction specially inside the school day and night cicle is there but there is no mandatory curfew and no eating schedule and classes are not times so it all feels off somehow they should have gone with an aproach l kingdom come deliverance on this imo alas no game is perfect maybe the potterhead in me makes turn a blind eye to all the shortcomings in this game because when at its peak this game really does shine and any fan will have goosebumps the wasted potential may be mitigated with mods as i already seen some mods on nexus and there already a mod loader btw theres a mod to unlock all ps5 exclusive content but requires a new save to get the mission but potion works regardless and there you go im sure im missing a lot of stuff but i recomend this game for all fans and to non fans who like a rpg lite story driven game 9 10
