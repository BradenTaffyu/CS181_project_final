2019 sit down children it s story time august 20th 2019 i was in a squad of 7 men i had the duty of a combat life saver we had to fly oversea s on a helicopter i couldn t tell if my pilot was drunk or my dial up internet was making the helicopter do acrobatics but it was intense about 5 minutes of flying we touch down safely getting out as my ears immediately explode from my sound mod making the helicopter 5000x louder it was awesome we continue down the road for another 200m when a sniper from the treeline blows off one of my boys heads we all scramble for cover behind the hill my boy and i had to kill the mmg who were suppressing our men we take a flank to the left in hopes of gunning this down because the ai are superman me and my boy were immediately spotted and suppressed by sniper fire behind a rock he gets hit in the chest which caused a velocity wound and other medical wounds i sew him up like the god i am and we continue down the hill under all sorts of fire i take a bullet to my arm and leg making me as slow as a 60 year old asthmatic hippo with 3 legs i stitch up my wounds and began limping to some more cover i fix my leg somehow and im mobile again pushing into the objective we were supposed to take an hour ago our nato squad successfully raided the base only 2 men were killed and all csat have been eliminated or so we thought the man on the radio sounds like his balls dropped off mount everest he tells us csat reinforcements will be arriving shortly i was unprepared with only 3 mags of ammunition and only a few medical bandages and morphine left after a few minutes of respite a shot is echoed from the hills and another firefight takes place again these now have armored cars with 50 guns on them 4 of our men are killed within seconds thankfully i brought at rockets with me and i take out the armored car it explodes in a fiery mess leaving that area scorched my boy and i take cover behind a jeep as more and more bullets fly over our heads he gets hit in the chest 2 times and in the leg 3 i m out of ammunition in both weapons and i am forced to drag him behind a tree i take a hit to my chest and start to bleed out medical supplies are running thin a few minutes passed and the csat have stopped firing they probably thought we all died i failed to medic my friend as his cold dead body lay in the grass i scavenge off my dead teammates for ammo leaving my aim in the garbage due to the multiple wounds to the arms just when i thought all was over a nato chopper has came to evacuate me i have a blood pressure of the exact definition of trash my heart rate is 50 and my screen is black and white i m limping up a hill while taking multiple shots from the csat hiding in the thick brush i am able to get into the chopper and escape as the last man in my squad to live from that day on i have diagnosed myself with ptsd only play if your balls are made of titanium
