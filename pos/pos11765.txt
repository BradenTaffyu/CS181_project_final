2021 i played this game for 577 hours by the time i write this you don t play that much a game unless it s gold or you hate yourself a lot but this is not league of legends so trust me it s a good game and they update it constantly even though it was released more than 4 years ago so new characters levels weapons and game mechanics reworks are released quite regularly which explains why didn t i just get bored of it once i beat it
