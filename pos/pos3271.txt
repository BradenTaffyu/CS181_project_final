been playing dos for 3 years now beaten the game 3 times on playstation pc dos is the way to go much more streamlined and graphically appealing if you are a fan of their most recent title baldurs gate 3 then you need to play this it is hands down my favorite turn based combat system and one of my all time favorite games period theres so much freedom with character building and how you can conquer each combat situation its more difficult in some ways than bg3 but much more rewarding you don t have to camp after every combat encounter nuff said
