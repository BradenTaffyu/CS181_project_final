2020 my fave game of all time i ve played through this gem seven times and on my death bed will fondly remember it as the some of the best time i spent on this earth i ve spent about 1800 hours in the fallout 4 world and on my last play through cleared it on survival mode in only underwear and with only pipe weapons and explosives this took just over 300 hours the commonwealth wasteland is an epic sandbox but the real prize is the far harbour dlc with its sombre misty valleys and god rays shining through the haze between the trees the stark beauty of that island is something i ll never forget the creatures of far harbour are fearsome and offer a real challenge i ve started so many other games and have often found myself being drawn back to fallout 4 after a few hours of playing them because most other games seem so lame in comparison do yourself a favour and play on survival mode once you know the game it s the most intense gaming experience i ve ever had
