2019 the best colony town something managment game i ve ever played by far the graphics are simple although everything looks pretty good in general the music is from allright to good in my experience it doesn t get repetitive now the gameplay god the gameplay is just great almost perfect it s a great balance between simplicity and complexity where needed there is an incredible health system that makes every factor very important pawns can get too hot too cold sick and can have multiple wounds on multiple parts of the body affecting their effectiveness on different tasks you can install prosthetics in extreme cases where pawns loose limbs or organs or you can convert your regular lame restricted human into a killing machine made of steel hell even better plasteel pawns also have different personalities which makes each unique in their own way i will never forget when the old medic who saved multiple lifes through his career was killed by a robot everyone was sad and although he never married he was loved by everyone he was soooo slow at walking that i had to put the medicine directly in front of the medical beds so that he didn t have to walk to get them i also had to make him a special room with an automated door leading to the hospital when he was killed i sent my best constructor to build him a sarcophagus out of emerald my point is many characters will have flaws that may not compensate for their usefulness but that just adds more spice to an already spiced game the different biomes ensure that you can always replay the game on different conditions making a colony on the woods will be a totally different experience than making it in the middle of a hot dessert or making it on a swamp or the frozen poles this way it s hard to get bored in the game finally you can always download mods from the steam workshop the modding community is great so there are many mods that will fit the game as if were vanilla but also tons of mods that will make your game utterly ridiculous from gui changes to new weapons to other humanoid races to instakill laserbeams you can find everything you could possibly want and also things that you do not want i added the zerg race to my game and after some time a zerg rush came to my base and annihilated every single one of my colonists it was beautiful all in all truly a great game it isn t buggy is well optimized has good music and graphics that work really nice and excelent gameplay it s worth every single penny and more
