2022 don t listen to the negative reviews i have never played a total war game before let alone rts turn based games and i notice a trend that most of these reviews have far too little hours meaning they didn t even put in the effort to learn the game and actually find what is so fun about it that being said i jumped into this game and thought i would get bored after about an hour but the more i learned about the game the more i wanted to keep playing after a day of watching guides and playing the game i immediately became addicted and now i play this every day if you have a friend and want to play co op i recommend getting warhammer 3 as it has vastly improved multiplayer i ve owned warhammer 2 for a total of 7 days now and i already put 102 hours into the game that should speak for itself also skaven supremacy
