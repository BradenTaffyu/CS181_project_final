2016 this is by far the best board game card game simulator by far and i highly recommend if you love board games or card gamesi know i don t have many hours on this game but i ve been here from the start there s no rules to this game at all so just play however you want to play it s gmod but with board card games invite a friend to play chess or a couple of friends for a night of poker or solve some jigsaw puzzle from an random image you found online flip the table if you lost a game or you re mad play a game underwater hdri panorama images you can use draw all over the table or just whatever you like there s tools you can use ingame that are useful like tablet it s a ingame browser to search around the internet or youtube and play videos and if someone goes to a website video it auto ask you if you want to open that link so if someone went to a site you wouldn t have to deal with itmp3 player it s a music player that you can play all kinds music that the game comes with calculator a calculatorand other objects i just dont want to make this review too long there s also servers you can join if you don t have any friends or if you want to play with some randoms you can also host one yourself with a game any game workshop the game already includes stuff like chess checkers poker backgammon and alot of other things there s also alot of dlc but to buy all of them it does cost you some money with the amount of dlc and dlc releasing to this day but then theres workshop support workshop support is awesome we re talking about thousands of things you can get like monopoly uno random models or whatever you can find on the workshop or anything that even exist in this universe or you can of course make your own board card games or random models if you like there s also sites you can get things from i hope this review was kinda helpful d
