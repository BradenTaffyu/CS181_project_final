2016 unbelievably awesome addition to the total war franchise makes me want to start playing table top again one gripe is the combat mechanics of some of the races played as dwarves and green skins so far dwarves need some balancing because of their inability to deal with mob armies looking forward to playing as the other races and hoping for high elves in an expansion
