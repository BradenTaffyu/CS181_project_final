2022 if you are looking for a racing simulator that is as realistic as it gets than iracing is for you yes it can be expensive with having to maintain a monthly subscription and buy cars and tracks as you move up the more difficult license levels but there is no other sim racing experience like iracing offers there are ways to minimize the costs you can earn money just by racing at least once a week for consecutive weeks which you can use towards you subscription as well as cars and tracks i also recommend just sticking with only one or two different racing series at a time to minimize how many cars and tracks you need to buy and there s plenty of free series that you can race that don t require buying more cars or tracks iracing offers just about every type of auto racing you can think of so there s something for everyone my advice to newcomers just starting out use test sessions to your advantage they allow you to learn a car or a track without the distractions of other racers before hopping into a live practice session or race i always run some tests sessions on the track i m getting ready to race on this is the best way to learn the race car s limits and the tracks you wan t to race on and it s a good way to refresh your skills even if you are experienced in iracing you also have the ability to enter a race as a spectator this allows you to see what racing on the track is like by watching other more experienced drivers from the booth this will give you a good idea of what to expect before you head out on the track yourself this is also a great way to learn new techniques from the more experienced drivers have lots and lots of patience no one first starts out racing like dale earnhardt jr in the daytona 500 like most other fresh rookies you will suck and suck bad at first it takes lots and lots of practice as well as the ability to own up to and learn from your mistakes to get better don t let the big mouths on the radio get you down you know the ones that scream at you for getting lose and crashing them this happens even to the best of race car drivers nobody is perfect not even them it s not a matter of if you are going to make a mistake but when and how bad making mistakes is just as much a part of racing as the green flag and the finish line is it s a never ending learning process and if you are on the other side someone crashing you give them a break because most of the time they didn t mean it and they are still learning too instead of yelling at them try offering some constructive criticism to help them get better so they learn
