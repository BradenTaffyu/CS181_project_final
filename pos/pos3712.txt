omori is an amazing game i ll try to do it spoiler free basically it s a story of acceptance and forgiveness there s so many things in here that you can feel identified with each character portrays complicated ways of dealing with their own problems the game also makes sure to not allow you to forget the psychological horror tag it has the music is catchy fun immersive and overall incredible it s a bit long but it s worth each single minute all of the endings are realist in a way or another so play it honestly and see what you get definitely play it fun and interesting game feels like a very good book or movie depending what you re into great narrating and battle system
