2022 the responsibility of commandfollow our curator page summit reviews to see more high quality reviews regularly symphony of war the nephilim saga is a love letter to classic tactical rpg action you ll see inferences to this end detailed throughout its review page and while this is most assuredly true it s somewhat limiting indeed symphony of war bears or appropriates system and design tenets from shining force fire emblem final fantasy tactics and ogre battle among others still these incorporations manifest something akin to the genre s greatest hits album which is a good thing the designers simply observed what worked about those games and implemented their own version of those systems into symphony of war and the results are outstanding first strategy tactics can wait there are two main arenas of play for symphony of war one strategy one tactics active portions involve the battle maps and how you give commands exercising your overall generalship with the army you ve cultivated passive parts focus on equipping and promoting your soldiers then staggering their troop formations basically your utilization of front middle and back rows within their individual squadrons this is a typical level map detailing the movement range for a unit when not actively attacking or passively defending this is your view a screenshot of symphony of war the nephilim saga by solaire bro both sides of the gameplay work exceedingly well moreover they marry perfectly much of your success on the battlefield is inherently determined by the amount of work you put into the preliminaries ignoring the preparation phase is not an option so if unit management isn t something you relish then this game should be wholly avoided but if you do enjoy it preparing for the next battle may be the most interesting and surprisingly deep content symphony of war has to offer the design works owing primarily to the plethora of upgrade paths and the massive amount of unit types the player can create a young magic scholar may develop into a mage but what kind of mage you choose what about your newly recruited soldier when his time comes for a promotion does he join the vanguard or does he mount a horse and protect the middle row or the back row and do you utilize these upgrade resources now at the expense of potential upgrades later deciding how to develop one of your soldiers is just the beginning because once you have an idea of how you d like to progress the individual you ll have to make calculated determinations about how to mix the collective to maximize their efficiency this game within the game may be the best part of well the game strategy be damned fire players are granted an overhead view of the playscape depending on the story beats or the topography you ll have the option of bringing up to 20 units into battle with you and note if you ve been upgrading your units the squadrons may contain up to nine individual hopefully appropriately leveled soldiers from here that same familiar tactics style gameplay germane to most of the genre s entries begins to unfold once the battle commences you ll move your units around the map setting up choke points flanking enemies and raining down fire with ranged support once you have chosen an attack the camera shifts from the traditional overhead view to a 2 d side angle where you sit back and watch sometimes nervously as the units thrust hack blast heal and fire away at each other there s nothing especially remarkable in how symphony of war conducts its battles if you played one like it and are familiar with the formula you ll have no problem mastering the system after all there s a reason why this formula has endured so long it s not complicated it s fun to experiment with and along with being chock full of variety and quasi disorder it simply works while it may lack some originality it does successfully mask this by sprinkling occasional dynamics into battles as they progress for instance emphasis was placed on not only eliminating enemy armies but also on capturing objectives chapels stables mines etc and you ll want to make sure you re doing this as each objective sacked delivers a corresponding resource to the party like horses gold or iron these resources are necessary for upgrading the army attack defense screens are wonderfully chaotic they also provide the player a chance to see their upgraded troops in action a screenshot of symphony of war the nephilim saga by solaire bro symphony of war keeps battles fresh objectives usually aren t as straightforward as they might appear at the start of a fight instantly an engagement could shift from you trying to defeat the enemy to you trying to escape from the enemy this might happen when a story beat occurs in battle or maybe a party member will be taken hostage suddenly adding a rescue to your list of objectives or most frustratingly enemy reinforcements may arrive right when you re about to win and you find yourself abruptly flanked nuances like these keep the player engaged and paranoid all in there are 30 main battles divided by chapters throughout the campaign with additional side quests that become available when around 70 of the main story is complete if you re looking to beef up your ranks the side quests are imperative as some of the most significant upgrades and most challenging battles are only accessed through their completion lastly the game does offer a perma death mode to increase anxiety should you desire i actually wish i had enabled it i completed symphony of war on its medium difficulty and eventually regretted making that choice veterans tend to prefer tactics games built with high acuity determinations in mind this means that tactics games also tend to be hard symphony of war is not hard if you re a tactics strategy veteran i d strongly consider playing on the most challenging mode offered why we fight symphony of war places a surprising amount of emphasis on its story seeing this level of commitment on the narrative side of an indie tactical rpg was unusual and refreshing that doesn t mean the story is necessarily good it s serviceable if not overly generic there are old gods good god and bad god and they ve been fighting a war for millennia the game s plot represents the conclusion of that struggle more or less sound bland unoriginal yes and yes but lack of intrigue doesn t deter the game from pressing forward and commanding your attention or attempting to there are a lot of fast forwardable cut scenes perhaps too many especially if one takes advantage of the optional dialogues between chapters to be clear it is recommended that you watch these optional conversations aside from being beneficial to raising your army s stats they feature good narrative content and solid worthwhile characterization that is otherwise lacking in the main plot some characters are drunken rogues some are resolute paladins and others are potential romance options you get the idea it s just a shame that most of the fun is in optional selections between chapters cut scenes use different aesthetics and there s a lot of them while the game s story is never great it s still a decent effort a screenshot of symphony of war the nephilim saga by solaire bro while these conversations aren t necessarily deep they do add welcomed nuance frankly the game could have used more of these with perhaps less linearity and dispensed with some of the generic fantasy plotting conclusion symphony of war is an excellent alternative for fans of the genre seeking a new entry to scratch their itch the story isn t fantastic but it s adequate for a tactics game the surprisingly deep systems allow players to actively recruit manage and equip their armies the battles while not wholly innovative manage to sustain their delightfulness through all 30 chapters once more unto the breach dear friends with symphony of war yes once more gladly with perma death turned on overall 8 10 great
