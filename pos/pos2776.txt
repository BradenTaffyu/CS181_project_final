2018 as a former black isle designer i m rather critical when it comes to games i have very high expectations and i m rarely satisfied with games today it would be more appropriate to say that i ve been content with the games i play now and leave it at that well that is not the case with divinity original sin 2 i m quite envious of the fact that i was not involved with the design of this game it has exceeded my expectations and provided me with many hours of gaming pleasure i can only hope and pray that future sequels please let there be more to come are of equal or greater quality thank you larian for the many hours of gaming pleasure i have received from this game please keep up the good work my sincere compliments to you and your staff
