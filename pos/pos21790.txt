2018 i thought that i would not like souls games but i am now a fan for life the difficulty is sometimes unfair but 99 of my deaths are my fault i got too greedy trying to get another swing in and it cost me patience and memorization are important here it s like a puzzle almost you learn the level what enemies are where enemies attack patterns find shortcuts then it becomes almost trivial the enemies and bosses you had such a hard time with before one caveat is that i could never get overconfident despite knowing what to do i could still screw up so when i die or take a large amount of damage it s my fault always respect your opponent no matter how confident you think you are enemies can and will punish your mistakes
