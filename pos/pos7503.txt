2023 this review is for newbies no dlc s don t buy them until you get to grips with playing the game you have plenty to do believe me i ve played anno 1404 but anno 1800 is a big challenge for me in comparison first this is one of the most beautiful games i ve played it is sheer joy visually and i recommend zooming in to look at the detail as you expand your cities i particularly like to see the wake as the ships move superb second i play on the don t hurt me easiest mode because i really need to do that to learn as much as possible without too many distractions as a beginner there is a lot to take in and you will make mistakes if you make mistakes which is making things more difficult playing the game then erase and start again at the start you need income or you will face bankruptcy do the quests good sellers to get money are potatoes at the start next soap next plantain in the new world along with cannon imported from the old world keep a supply line of cotton going to the old world so you can sell fur coats by that time you should have all the money you need third the economy and balancing supply and demand is the biggest challenge in the game it can be frustrating if you are the type of player who has little patience then this is not the game for you fourth check your supply lines regularly what seemed essential when you got that ship to move wood may be just going to and fro for no purpose or gain fifth leave space as you build and choose your siting carefully this is a big frustration for me at the moment and i ll give you an example so you are forewarned because ubisoft don t it is time for me to install electricity there is plenty of oil in the new world so i built what i needed only to find i could neither install electricity in the new world nor transport the oil to the old world okay lesson learned so i look for oil in the old world which is one island and the one i was trying to keep attractive for visitors great i build what i need after a lot of correcting mistakes to get a power station up and working now i could install the shipbuilding so i could get tankers built no i found not only does it need electricity it needs to be in the actual harbor not where the oil terminal is based that means i will have to rip out a sizable amount of infrastructure to get a power station with a rail link to connect the shipyard to build tankers no warning in game at all until you see the icon floating above the shipyard getting the picture sixth don t be too ambitious there is a temptation to grab as many islands as you can which is prudent to get raw materials but developing them to get that missing raw material can be a headache it might be better to trade at times there can just be to many balls in the air for a juggler to catch this is another lesson learned seventh watch your influence count i have had to juggle things around a lot to get sufficient means to do what i need to do this is certainly important when you build a zoo and museum another lesson learned now i have to find out how to accumulate the influence i need more on that later think ahead watch you tube videos to get an idea what you are letting yourself in for the game is a non stop challenge and i m glad a reminder comes up to get a cup of coffee it is an absorbing game which easily passes the time good luck
