2018 i very much enjoy this game it adds to the original don t starve without straying too far from the source as some multiplayer interpretations have in the past even without anyone to play with creating an alone world is very fun and the present drops every now and then are always a treat the limited time special events are also enjoyable and it s nice that you can disable them at any time if you don t want to participate this game will always be one of my favorites and with the low price many people can give it a try
