2019 i was never hyped for a game as much as i was for fallout 4 and while i think it s a great game i don t feel as attached to it as i was to fallout 3 or new vegas it doesn t look like a huge leap forward like i wanted it to be story side missions characters and humor are as good as expected from a bethesda game same as the bugs nothing game breaking for me more like funny stuff i didn t care much for the building system but i see the appeal for some fallout fans good thing is that the game doesn t force you to focus on that game looks and play better with the addition of few mods if your pc can handle it highly recommended for fallout fans fps fans please keep in mind this isn t a pure shooter that you also need to read and reply to conversation if you just want to shoot people go buy another game
