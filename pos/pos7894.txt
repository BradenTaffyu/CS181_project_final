2020 early access review this game is for you if you re looking for the ultimate physics based driving game you want the honest truth about how good of a driver you are hint drifting racing etc is even harder than real life you want destruction fun and more destructionas it stands this game is great a little lacking on any story of any kind but with a great community already beefing up cars and making their own mods that you won t run out of scenarios to doif for some reason you are a physics teacher looking at this use this to do demonstrations in class and your students will love it came for the driving stayed for the realistic driving 10 10
