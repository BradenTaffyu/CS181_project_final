2020 i ve got 100 hours at the time of review and i ve had the game for a year or two so i m not a crazy superfan who can afford the time to put in 1000 hours in a year so that they re on the military level of audie murphy lauri torni the entire u s navy all wrapped into one like most of this game s reviewers but at the same time i know what i m doing i understand all the mechanics and i ve got experience in every facet of this game from playing zeus to being a ground soldier alongside a large force playing as an exotic fellow such as some form of fire support and even the games amazing campaign i m not skilled in any of them and usually get creamed by the aforementioned giga seals but i know how to play them and i can hold my own usually this game does not require the infinite experience some people will say it does start with the campaign to get a sense of what the game is put like 10 20 hours in then if you have apex which is quite cheap and spends more time on sale then off what the hell is your business model bohemia you should get an experienced friend or even just someone willing to help check reddit s lfg subs ask for someone willing to play apex with a newbie get some co op experience in objective play there play 3 or 4 missions then find a zeus server play as infantry and understand what the game really is this should be like anywhere from 15 50 hours just infantry will be a blast from there you could play however you want join some pvp servers and really get in but i always end up returning to zeus mainly as drones aircraft scout snipers or the most fun imo a combat lifesaver in semi close range city combat and apex with a friend or two also give the scenarios a try most are just single missions but some like vindicta are incredibly experiences that will last ages can t recommend vindicta enough and i can t stress enough it does not require you to drop all your time into it it takes time to learn the game but it s not as unfriendly to noobs as it may seem
