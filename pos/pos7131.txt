2016 murica here i comei play ets2 to relax and i have sunken more than 150 hours into that game and still am coming back to it ats is practically the same game with new trucks and scenery if you played ets2 you know exactly what to expect it s literally the same even the menu is the same but i don t consider that a negative thing though some things could ve been improved after the ets2 graphics upgrade the game looks gorgeous ats is no different it looks great developers put a lot more work into scenery and cities the american environments never gets old and is always nice to look at and the cities feels alive and real the game core didn t change you must drive from pont a to point b and deliver various goods there are only three trucks in game so far but it s enough for the start and they re badass american trucks there s only two states for now nevada and california you will drive through them in no time but it feels developers have put more work into them than ets2 europe map scandinavia dlc looks much better than default eu map and ats looks even better than scandinavia so i d rather have less but quality content than more but shallow and bland the game is only 20 on steam so you kinda get what you pay for the more content will be added through dlc and this is one of those rare games when i wait for dlc because i know these developers will not disappoint they want to make the game better and are always looking for ways to improve their games after ats was released the steam workshop was added to both games people were asking for it for years and finally these amazing developers done it thank you now applying mods is as simple as clcking the mouse button what i think should be improved is physics and force feedback the physics feels too arcadey i know developers are doing their best but for a new game they could ve improved physics also force feedback could use some improvements but overall driving feel is good graphics are nice and all but not having anti aliasing in this day seems a bit stupid huh i know maybe it s because engine limitations or something but it s really not my problem aa is a must other than that performance is inconsistent i d say the game runs worse than ets2 but it also looks more detailed there s nothing more to say if you liked ets2 you ll like this one just start the engine open a beer and drive trough beautiful american scenery pros beautiful to look atcities are big and feel realsame relaxing gameplaycons no anti aliasing performance issuesmy curator page
