2016 after 19 hours i can say this game is pretty awesome there are 3 different scenarios to choose from the standard of 3 people crashing on a planet and trying to survive the rich explorer on his own looking for adventure or 5 surviving tribe members trying to rebuild after a catastrophe if none of those tickle your fancy they have added an editor and you can make up your own scenario it is pretty epic what you can do once you get everthing set up then you choose a map size and a location on a planet make sure to pay attention to the times you can grow crops you don t want to be stuck somewhere you can only grow crops for a limited amount of time and also pay attention to the average temps as some people like certain temperatures after you selcect your planet is when you get to pick your crew of people i suggest trying to find people without any injuries scars included and make sure to be diversified in the peoples abilites it s funny some of the quirks these peopel have launch your game and immediately pause so you can scope it out plan how you want to build and set your people to working i recommend watching some videos before hand as there is a learning curve but once you get the basics down it s a ton of fun i can see me investing a lot more time into this one for sure good luck and have fun
