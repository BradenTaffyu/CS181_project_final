2017 after a slew of somewhat mediocre action games featuring licensed tv properties platinum games has finally hit the jackpot once again with this collaboration with yoko taro nier drakengard 3 fans will know who he is but for those of you who don t know that s totally fine too because oh boy does this game go places compliment that convoluted plot with awesome gameplay stunning visuals plus an exhilarating soundtrack and you ll get what may be the least overrated game of 2017 if you re not playing this you re missing out on quite a lot this is all assuming the game runs well on pc which it does not in my case at least without some in game tweaking but can that really take away the experience overall i don t think so still it s worth your money
