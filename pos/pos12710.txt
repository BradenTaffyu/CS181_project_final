2023 early access review early access review single player prospective to start the game is early access there be bugs the game also instead of what i call an import into from original ark into unreal 5 the games share a lot of similarity and that s where that ends also the requirements for the game are a lot higher then original ark maps have been rebuilt there s a lot of details that where not there compared to the original ark mountains are exactly what you d expect they are hilly and rocky and mining metal with out a flyer will take you some time they are not like the past version where you could get to every node with a anky and be fine grass now exist and good luck trying to find that death bag or small dino you knocked out with out a lawn mower caves fallow the same they are in the same locations but and fallow the same map if drawn but traverse completely different the sea has been redone completely though you will not be able to view it all due to fog unless you turn it off will i recomend the game to people eh the game is fun and looks great but there are some things you need to know before you get into this one wild card cant keep a schedule no matter how much they promise they either over promise or put in things late for approval to both pc console so things get delayed dont look at the road map and expect the game or dlc to be out when they original said it will not happen all events at least at current time of this post are mods you need to download this is a good and a bad change but is what it is i guess
