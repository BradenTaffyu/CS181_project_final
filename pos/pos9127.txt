2016 great game don t let metacritic tell you otherwise a solid grand strategy that took the paradox development team to a place they had never tried to make a game out of before the expansions are a bit pricey but add depth to the game the game is solid and only has a few quality of life issues which have been fixed as the game recieves updats and expansions
