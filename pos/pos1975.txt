2022 product received for free if you are interested in star wars themes or even fancy sci fi but with your own twist to a character well then this is in my opinion one of the best on the market and at face value its free so there is a lot the game offers initially in its free to play version which i must say i have spent over 330 hours without spending a penny in addition to its free to play version there is a subscription based version where more high tier items abilities and cosmetics become available and much much more including monthly rewards based on your subscription and allowing you to reach higher levels in game for example i have two lvl 60 imperial characters but if you subscribe i believe you can go to upwards of 70 so if you are looking to try out a story mode game with combat and dialogue options like never before i would say give it a try it doesn t cost a dollar and you can get a real feel of the game within i would say an hour or two and anything longer than that i would suggest finding a guide on youtube a reddit page or some in game advice for how to progress further and really handle the game like others do that being said this is a game with public servers you will meet people of different opinions and it may not be the most welcoming when its comes to new players there are still a ton of people who can and are willing to help you put your right foot forward don t take my word for it but there is a part of the community that is going to help and others will well do their own thing i guess hope this helps and may the force be with you
