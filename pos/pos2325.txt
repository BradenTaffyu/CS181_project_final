2020 product received for free i ve played nearly 400 hours on bethesda launcher prior to this game launching on steam i dropped the game a year ago due to bugs and patches that barely did anything is this game perfect no is this game great no is it better than when it launched yes very much so the newly added npc s breathe life into the game and the dialogue options are better than fallout 4 and i must say i m pretty sure the voice acting for some of these npc s may be the best in the series best bethesda s ever done the game still has plenty of bugs and servers can lag a bit at times but compared to what the game was a year ago this is a vast improvement and the fact that bethesda s still supporting the game when they could have just as easily abandoned it due to the overwhelming negative press is something to be commended the game as it stands right now is a solid 7 10 for me compared to a year ago when it was a frail 4 10
