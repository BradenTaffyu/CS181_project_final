2016 this is the best total war ever created units and building have distinct purposes like in shogun 2 no more choosing between 15 varieties of the same and looking through dozens of small buffs and debuffs it is as hectic as atilla and it has hordes it has a theme which is as great as rome let s forget rome 2 ever existed combat makes sense like in medieval 2 before the synced animations were introduced i wish i could say something about empire maybe when naval battles come for the first time factions play very different from each other and it runs well and diplomacy makes sense kinda most of the time anyway finally ca after few years of experimentation and blunders you made a game that is awesome as a complete package
