2020 slay the spire is one of the most fun deck building games i ve played in a while and personally felt a bit like deep sky derelicts just a lot better and more fleshed out the mechanics allow for very different and well balanced playstyles the randomization keeps things interesting and the ascension levels prove a real challenge with a significant amount of replayability value by unlocking more and more relics with very unique special effects if they ever release a multiplayer version of this i m pretty sure games like heartstone or gwent might lose quite a few players
