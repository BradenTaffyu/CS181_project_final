2021 product received for free early access review while i love playing competitive first person shooters like r6 getting good at them takes a lot of time and effort when i m serious about clawing my way into the next rank bracket i can spend just as much time training as i do actually playing the game in the past i ve been spoilt for choice when searching for training exercises for r6 the steam workshop is brimming with prefire courses on the most popular maps exercises that teach you about specific weapon recoil and basic reflex and aim training these tools meticulously crafted and shared by the steam workshop community have been incredibly useful for focusing on improving specific skills however they heavily rely on already knowing which areas we want to target in our training sessions if like me you re a bit unsure what your weaknesses are i recommend trying out aim lab aim lab has been free in early access since 2018 and it features a range of exercises that are perfect for warming up for a competitive game what sets it apart from other aim training programs is that it gives you a detailed breakdown of your performance after each task highlighting specific strengths and weaknesses
