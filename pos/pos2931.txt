2016 early access review the more you play d os 2 the more fun it becomes for instance find a hard boss thats way over your level a build a box fort and snipe it to death find some hard enemies and you re all out of boxes a lure them to some nearby guards and sit back and reap the rewards find a hard mini boss in a dungeon a teleport his ass into a cell that you ve blocked off with a box and run away so he doesn t think it was you then snipe his ass ambushed by skeletons a reload and aproach slowly with box fort find some nasty boxes crates blocking your path a harvest them for boxfort
