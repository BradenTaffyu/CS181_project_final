2023 it feels more like coh1 than coh2 when it comes to the tactical battles units have been given meaningful roles for example there are reasons why you want a light recon vehicle on your map for their abilities whereas i found them to be next to useless in the previous titles the strategic map is engaging enough to be a fun part of the game and i like the customisation of companies through skill point upgrades it s not perfect but it is heaps of fun
