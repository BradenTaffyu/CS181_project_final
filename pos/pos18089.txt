2021 whatever award the no man s sky devs deserve for turning their game around after launch is probably more deserved by ca with the copious amount of patches and updates rome 2 eventually got it s a completely solid if still divisive total war entry at this point and worth any strategy tactics gamer s time if they like the classical european historical setting that said there s still a lot of bs in rome 2 to be aware of just know that about 50 of its issues can be resolved with some simple modding which is easy to do on steam thankfully all of ca s worst business practices are present you re going to have to buy blood and unit packs and faction packs wait for a sale and get a complete edition upgrade at this point and you re probably safe skipping the campaign packs unless any particular sub setting really appeals to you this game s auto resolve favors sword infantry immensely which doesn t seem like an issue except this means gallic tribes who also favor sword infantry end up dominating the campaign map 90 of the time due to this because there are like 50 of them at the start and only one rome dan carlin had a podcast about caesar s conquest of gaul called the celtic holocaust but i think that s a better subtitle for rome 2 since you ll probably spend 75 of any game killing celtics instead of any other faction there are several half baked systems introduced in rome 2 that were done better in later games the most noticeable being the politics system which is like the skeleton of a paradox game stapled onto total war with the emperor edition update they jammed a lot of stuff from attila into this which did make it better but it s still a system that needs more love to be made actually good so far no modders seem interested in fixing this part of the game so it remains a swollen pimple on rome 2 s visage the weird video game political correctness push of 2014 18 caused ca to jam in a bunch of female generals into the game and it just comes off as bizarre playing it now especially because they only modeled two female faces so you end up looking at 10 000 copies of the angriest woman in the diplomacy and family tree menus all that said as someone who likes total war games and likes the classical republic era of rome a lot this game still has its charms and i still find myself coming back to rome 2 often enough compared to other entries in the franchise at the very least this game has the series second best naval combat system going for it because you have to give empire that spot which is nice
