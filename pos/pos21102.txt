2016 early access review i absolutely adore this game this is my go to game for when i m overly stressed out or upset and need a mood booster the mechanics are easy to pick up and you get started right away you see the world around you right away is cute you even hear the cute right away it s cute dang it i love the graphics the look of the world and the creatures that inhabit it are slightly cartoonish but still amazing the free roam exploration is fun you can go through the process of collecting things to unlock areas finding new slimes and vegetation you can unlock areas in whatever order you want as well i also love the lack of real violence sure you can be knocked out and there definitely is danger but the fact that this is a family friendly game draws me in even more i also adore that you can choose your way of playing focusing more on exploring tending to your ranch slime science etc and the developers are very active in adding more content all the time only a couple things i see as downfalls firstly i wish there was a bit more story background you learn more about the other characters you interact with through the range exchange by reading what they have to say when they initiate a trade i ve had a few good laughs from some of them and reading the random facts that appear on your loading screens but still there s not much known on anyone especially the main character that you play secondly is that as of this point it s unknown at least to my knowledge if there is an endgame or not if you re the type of gamer that quickly beats a game and wants to move on i d say this probably isn t for you but for me it s a leisurely game relaxing this game makes me happy seriously it makes me smile on bad days so i will keep exploring and playing with my adorable slimes because dang it they re too cute
