2016 how many times can someone destroy the world before it gets boring i ve successfully doomed the human race 50 times and the game is still as fun as it was the first time there are so many different diseases genetic upgrades and scenarios available that the game keeps fresh after dozens of iterations the co op version is also a lot of fun but it requires very good communication with your partner if you want to successfully obliterate mankind together pro tip watch out for the island nations iceland greenland and new zealand are the worst offenders but madagascar and the caribbean have also proven problematic in the past if you pull trigger too soon those nations will spook and close up their harbors essentially locking you out of the country unless you get lucky with a mutation or special ability oh and get ready for some bs when it comes to the nano virus i ve started in japan makes sense right and within 3 to 5 days bolivia has grown concerned and started to work on a cure because of one infected japanese scientist on the opposite side of the planet still the game is loads of fun and i highly recommend it
