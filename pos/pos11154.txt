2018 this game is killing me i m losing my life to this game hours upon hours are lost every time i start this game it s just so darn addicting building a hospital from the ground up i m gonna have to shelf it though i really struggle with stepping away from the game if they could change one thing to make the game better imo let us carry over our trained doctors to the next map it s such a pain in the arese to juggle staff that you re force to hire that either have conflicting traits or bad habits or whatever let us take our a team second opinion let me pick who upgrades machines and who repairs them it s always the worst maintenance person that automatically gets picked for eiher job third opinion let us save rooms to a template format that carries over to each hospital it s so time consuming building the rooms from scratch when i move yeah i m addicted but i can t say i had fun idk why it s more or less a grind but i haven t played a game that kept my attention like this in a long time five stars it s new it s addictive but is it fun
