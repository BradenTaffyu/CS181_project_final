2015 i m 12 hours in and here a few things i haven t seen mentioned in other reviews things i love it s not necessary to click on anything to see what is inside just hover over it this might be the best improvement from previous bethesda games magazines give a permanent unique perk a perk that is not in the perk chart thingy movement speed seems faster than previous bethesda games i might be wrong about it though it feels just right not too fast that combat is too difficult yet not so slow that it feels like you re dragging your feet many places are so filled with environmental stuff that i have to treat them like real places rather than places that requires every nook and cranny be explored they feel like real places things i hate you can t have dogmeat and another companion simultaneously the map feels too small it feels way too constricted such that i keep trying to zoom out farther than it will let me every single time i open it things that could be better but i don t really care character animation is still lacking but it s not really detrimental it is better than i expected it to be after watching the release trailer at times the graphics do not feel much improved from fallout 3 or new vegas but they are definitely better a few other things right click when in the pipboy to zoom it in a bit the companion mobile pipboy app works quite well the console command for changing carry weight is the same as skyrim my system is an older intel core i7 2600k with 8 gb of ram a gtx 970 and an ssd i am running at 2560x1440 on ultra settings and i have only encountered a noticeable drop in frame rate twice and neither time lasted long loading times are normally so fast that it is noticeable when it takes a couple of seconds to load i have yet to experience a single crash and i have only encountered one bug thus far an inconsequential door that i could walk right through
