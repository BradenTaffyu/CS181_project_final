2023 i was beginning to suspect that i ve lost all interest in the isometric rpg genre completely but then dos2 came along sure its setting is much more comedic than that of the other titles but that is maybe the game s strongest suit unburdened with the requirement to tell a completely serious epic heart wrenching story it opts for a more light hearted adventure still epic with gods and everything but also featuring talking animals due to that the game is relatively laconic with its dialogue and due to that larian had the budget to voice it all making it more accessible and easier to digest it s a small thing but it changes the perception of the game completely but of course it s not the voice acting that dos2 is famous for but rather the unparalleled freedom of action it s probably the only game that will make you feel like an actual pen and paper rpg with many quests having up to a dozen resolutions either through dialogue combat or various skills the game s systems are all intertwined if you need to light a torch you don t get an e light a torch prompt just cast a fire spell nearby if you want to get on top of a mountain go ahead and learn flying or teleport you can kill anyone you can kill everyone you can make friends with most of your enemies you can talk to philosophy bears the result is far from perfect of course but is it fun the tactical combat is not insanely difficult but the impressive variance of interactions and hazards can create very interesting situations oil burns water conducts electricity and so on i also strongly suggest teaching the cheap polymorph skill that grants wings to everyone it s invaluable divinity original sin 2 is an incredibly good old school rpg that doesn t take itself too seriously and focuses more on the player s freedom of action you won t wake up at night having dreams about its setting and plot but you might reload one of its quests several times just to see all possible options and that in my book is the sign of a great game
