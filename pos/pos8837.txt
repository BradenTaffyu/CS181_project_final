2018 stellaris is a game about ruling a galactic empire you get as much out as you put in most of the negative reviews disparage the game s shallowness or how it misses the mark while getting close or it isnt really a very deep game and many of the mechanics can simply be ignored these things are partially true it s a nice selling point to say your empire has factions and you will need to manage them but you don t actually you can do fine by completely ignoring factions the game likes to say it features complex trade and diplomacy but in reality you can largely ignore your neighbors unless they don t like you and if that is the case you can simply try to maintain parity or conquer them if they get weak many of the mechanics are like this largely shallow through the most objective lenses however is it still one of my favorite games because of the way i play it this may sound weird but try playing the game without the goal to win but instead as a roleplaying game do you want to be the isolationist focused exclusively on inward development the sprawling galactic empire everyone must kneel to or face their wrath the tiny empire consisting of only a few planets but ridiculously efficent and strong on defense you can be nearly any type of empire you can imagine you can also play as nearly any scifi empire you know of wanna be the borg the centauri the goa uld the damn necromongers you can create it i play stellaris to relax and roleplay not to win i had over 200 hours before i won my first game the mod community is extremely dedicated and dowloading a fresh slew of mods is one of the things that keeps me coming back there are some seriously passionate modders working on this game and many of their ideas get adapted into regular major game updates by the devs who are constantly working to improve the game the game is not without its frustrations once the map has filled in and nothing is left to explore it can be really frustrating if you get boxed in by powerful neighbors some mods can help with this you can sometimes get completely annihilated by the endgame crisis simply because you focused in the wrong type of weaponry the crisis can also start in your empire and ruin you or on the other side of the galaxy so you never evern get to participate or worse it grows too strong for you to deal with once it consumes your neighbors getting attacked or ganged up on by the good guys because your despotic empire got unlucky and your neighbors formed a federation against you alone there are others but even still i love this game this review is kind of a rant but it is difficult for me to write a really objective review take the negative reviews seriously some of the issues they bring up are totally justified but also realize that not every game is for everyone and if thie game looks appealing to you it just might be one of your favorites too
