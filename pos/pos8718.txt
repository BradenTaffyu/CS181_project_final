2017 the hunter was and is still the most realistic hunting sim with the release of call of the wild you can start in one of the two gigantuous reserves in the 2 hours i ve played so far i ve just seen a very small part of it the whole game is about waiting for that right moment to take your shot and is very zen like to play overall since you have such beautifull surroundings i was really hyped when i saw the upgrade in the graphics compartment and even more important no more licenses where is this review coming from you wonder well i used to play the original and really enjoyed it with many hundreds of hours don t be alarmed by all the negative reviews since the game is still under development the game is surely no arcade shooter do not be silly everyone the ingame helpers are great for newer hunters and can be turned off accordingly under the gameplay menu for 30 euros you cannot go wrong here since you have full access to all the species and stuff you need to hunt them 9 10
