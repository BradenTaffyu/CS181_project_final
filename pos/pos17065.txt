2019 tl dr version the most intuitive and use friendly total war to ever have been released warhammer 2 is easily worth the asking price alone based on its 4 starting races which all play differently with further customisation coming in with different leader perks and play styles the vortex campaign is easily the best single player mode in any total war game ever with a much faster tempo to alleviate the late game fatigue felt in all other games the dlc races are all worth it and generally play completely differently tomb kings being a fan favourite unquestionably this is one of the best total war games to date it is highly advisable to purchase tw warhammer 1 in which case you will have access to all races from the first game not counting dlc races and will be able to play them in the new mega campaign mortal empires elaborated version it s typical for each total war game to be followed by a smaller sibling a high quality standalone expansion as attila allegedly was to rome 2 or fall of the samurai was to shogun 2 this doesn t really feel like the case this time in almost every respect wh2 apes its predecessor we had one large scale strategy game of turn based campaigning and real time battles in the fantasy setting of the old world and now a year later we get another bigger one with promise of a third still to come where the first game gave us a fantastical analogue of europe total war warhammer 2 includes additional geographical analogues of the americas africa and britain as well as ulthuan a spherical continent surrounded by water and dark elves speaking of at first glance the four factions of warhammer 2 seem less distinct from each other than the first game before we had factions of the old world all with very very distinct advantages and disadvantages vampire counts mobilised the fear inducing undead but had no missile troops to speak of dwarfs had no spellcasters but could give the 300 spartans a run for their money in tankiness and greenskins and chaos well they re the raiding factions comparitively this games races are all relatively well equipped in all departments there are two flavours of elves high and dark and two kinds of animal people the dinosaur riding lizardmen and the mad science rats called skaventhe two flavours of elves high and dark both of which love to spam arrows to the point that its unlikely your troops will even see the sky at times additionally the dinosaur riding lizardmen and the mad science rats called skaven play foil to one another with lm holding the incredibly tanky saurus warriors one of the best early mid game units in the game and the skaven cave dwelling rats with unlimited numbers and unlimited ways to frustrate you when they run away blasting you with corrosive magic and corrupting your lands speaking of all are relatively good at magic all have a mix of melee and ranged specialists in play they re more different than expected like the armies added to the first game as dlc extra care has been made to make them mechanically distinct in both battles and campaign there are so many tiny improvements in warhammer 2 it s hard to list them all the notifications when you press end turn without doing something the computer expects you to do aren t as obnoxious heroes are less essential and the ai relies on them less the map seamlessly zooms up into the tactical level high level rogue armies made of mixes of different factions roam around to add a little flavour to your battles instead of constructing buildings that unlock another building s ability to produce a specific elite troop you are often constructing buildings that unlock parts of the tech tree these are all individually small tweaks but definite improvements nonetheless one negative that i think most of people have is the ai it s just as inconsistant and childish as ever too often you will find yourself in impossible situations where the ai has shed any semblence of trying to hide the fact its out for your blood and will simply rush through other allied factions lands to get to you on harder difficulties the ai will simply hate you on principle and will subsitutes its usual broken diplomacy for a hyper aggressive warmonger ai that will never let you rest and will cheat out doom stack after doom stack until your lands are barren wastelands and i love it the ai is great for those cinematic no holds barred moments to the dlc this game has had multiple pieces of paid dlc released in its life cycles with more planned here is my succinct feelings each of them the prophet the warlock great if you like skaven don t buy otherwise curse of the vampire coast good new faction not designed for campaign conquests but smaller campaigns the queen the crone only worth if you if you love the elf factions a few new units i wouldn t bother worst race pack rise of the tomb kings the best race pack in the entire series tk are the most fun in any wh yet weak early game but steam roll in mid to late game mortal empires worth buying both wh and wh2 just for this alone blood for the blood god ii not essential by any means i will not condone anti consumer practices avoid
