2015 early access review i raided a tallbird nest and got an egg on a whim i decided to see if i could hatch it instead of cooking and eating it what began was a heartwarming tale of raising a bird in this dark world it took a long time to hatch and there were many difficulties the dangers of the night and keeping it nice and cozy when it did hatch it was dark night and i had just began building the walls of our happy home it began by cowering in the corner i finished the walls thinking it would try to escape instead it began to follow me but it backed away when i tried to feed it i soon became fond of my new companion unfortunately it became fond of me it was a dark night when the hound nation attacked they broke down my walls and forced their way into my camp the baby died trying to protect me i would like to say i avenged it but i died soon after r i p my unnamed baby gr8 m8 8 8edit i later learned that after full growth they kill you so that was a hopeless situation no matter what
