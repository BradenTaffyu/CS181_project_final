2023 read this don t let the reviews fool you it is a good game half of the negative reviews are people who review bombed it after the servers weren t functional for an entire week the rest are people who either think that payday 3 should have a decade s worth of content right off the bat or are generally just angry hateful people who are continuing this trend of hating on the game which stemmed from one of the most horrible launches ever seen the reality of the situation is that starbreeze has everything riding on this game if anyone was to take a look at their track record with payday 2 you d quickly find that they do listen to their community always have however there are some negative reviews that aren t filled with ignorance ones that mention the way you level up through challenges issues with the party system at times the fact that only 2 4 equipment is rlly useful there are real issues that need to be addressed and that will be addressed as the dev team has pointed directly to some of these in their livestreams moral of the story here is it s not as bad as it looks servers have since been fixed small party system issues don t follow the trend of hating the game just cause you ll miss out negative things aside it s a fun game to play with friends the game is polished not only has dlcs coming but some seasonal content in between as well just like payday 2 had i wrote this small essay cuz this review bomb got out of hand
