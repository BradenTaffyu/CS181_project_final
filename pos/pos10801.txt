2023 oh dear reader prepare to embark on a journey that s more epic than a penguin s quest for the perfect tuxedo hearts of iron 4 is the game where you can rewrite history or in my case hilariously mess it up beyond recognition from the moment you boot up the game you re greeted with a map that looks like someone spilled a jar of colourful jellybeans all over europe but fear not for you are the mastermind behind this candy coated chaos you re like a kid in a candy store and the candy happens to be tanks air planes and political ideologies now let s talk about the ai it s like having a chess match with a rubber chicken you ll often find yourself thinking did the ai just send its entire army to invade russia in the middle of winter but that s okay because you ll be too busy trying to figure out how to invade france without accidentally conquering luxembourg the tech tree is like a mad scientist s dream you can research things like improved dank memes or tea brewing efficiency not really and somehow it all affects your war effort you ll spend hours optimising your divisions creating the perfect recipe for the world s most formidable sandwich i mean the army and let s not forget the diplomacy it s like trying to make friends at a middle school dance except the dance floor is a battlefield and your dance partner may declare war on you at any moment speaking of war the battles are intense you ll watch your troops charge into battle only to realise they re all holding baguettes or sausages instead of guns because you forgot to equip them but don t worry it s all part of the learning experience the multiplayer aspect of hearts of iron 4 is for you and your friends to enjoy together unfortunately due to the amount of time i ve played this game i no longer have friends so let s move on in conclusion hearts of iron 4 is a game that will have you laughing crying and screaming at your screen in equal measure it s a grand strategy game that s grand in every way from its world spanning conflicts to its ludicrous ai antics so grab your tinfoil hat and prepare for a journey through time and space that s more unpredictable than a squirrel on a caffeine binge
