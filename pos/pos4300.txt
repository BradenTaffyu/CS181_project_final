2020 still an amazing and underrated game while it doesn t have the best graphics or barely any voice acting this game is rich in gameplay mechanics and the game world negatives i would list would be things like lack of unique and interesting quests quests are all the same visuals are outdated mods can help sometimes world of the game feels too empty you just can t believe in these wooden npcs gameplay can become very repetitive but combat is very skill based and incredibly deep this combat system though makes skyrim s look like complete garbage at times the combat can be clunky and a little too difficult to learn the only thing i don t like about this game s online multiplayer is there s no voip or voice chat also the fact you can t play the main campaign in coop is also a hugely missed opportunity the ai itself can be quite bad at times especially during sieges in this game which are absolute garbage game feels very outdated and very aged compared to the sequel mount and blade ii bannerlord i much prefer and easily recommend the sequel over this to be completely honest this game is still full of bugs like enemy ghost parties and glitches they still have not fixed any of this over a decade later all this did was waste my time so thanks for that you dumb turks
