2020 early access review a completionists opinionlook at this stupid zombie game i probably won t play it much over 100 hours later i must reinforce my base before the horde comes once more turrets are my only friends value for money well i got well over 100 hours out of it so story um i have no idea the world ended so try to survive art style very basic sound track it s there i think i can t really remember glitches many but it s still ea difficulty of gameplay from easy to impossible up to you enjoyable gameplay it s a very rewarding gameplay loop would i replay it i have several times with friends controller needed no time to complete 100 hours guide needed for some achievements as they are very odd can be completed in singeplayer yes and no at the moment it can be done solo can be completed in one playthrough yes i think it could difficulty based achievements not specifically random achievements no they can all be earned completion advice it s very grindy and will take a long time playing on harder difficulty does speed up the level based achievements but makes the game very difficult the killing player s achievement can actually be done solo for now but needs you to load an older version of the game look up a guide on killing bandits
