2021 i have to say i actually really love this game i was really on the fence when buying it i do see how some people say wait for a sale i completely understand but if you looked over the amount of content already in the game and still feel really eager to get it might as well i am really enjoying what they have here yes it does feel lacking but what is there does feel really good i haven t noticed any imbalanced stuff yet but i did fight against all the nations maybe war elephants being ridiculously strong but that s all i ve noticed the graphics does seem a bit of a mix of last gen and new gen i don t know i really can t put my finger on it maybe how other games make their games to run better on older hardware that sort of feel either way it s still pretty in it s own way not really cartoony yet a tad bit hard to describe anyways i completely recommend if you are a hardcore fan of relic and age of empires here s hoping they don t milk this game s player base dry with dlc though
