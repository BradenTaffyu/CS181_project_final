2016 probably the closest fps that i consider a rpg mostly i am not a big fan of fps first person shooters mainly due to my disabilities from my hands and excremities on my body these effect my way of playing games and is really one of my main reasons i do not like playing fps sanyways the story is very similar to the other fallout series games where you have to look for someone related to your mc main character the story itself is quite long but i must comment on 2 of the dlc s that i found qutie fun the 1st one is far harbour which adds additional storyline for some of your companions and really fits into the storyline of the main game the other dlc i wish to mention is the vault tec workshop that it lets you build a vault underground in quite a big space i would mention about nuka world dlc but i found it to be mostly one sided dlc the problem with that is if you play a good character the missions and quests in nuka world will be limited in what you can do on the other end if you are a evil aligned character there is alot you can do in nuka world as for the rest of the dlc s most are not that great for this game other than the ones i mentoned above there are also quite a few bugs found in this game as most bethsda games so if there is a unofficial patch i suggest looking for one and downloading it right away recommened for fun questing and great stories in the game
