aoe4 pulls off the very rarely seen in modern competitive games being more than the sum of its parts i played aoe1 as a child 2 3 as a teenager and now i primarily play solo ranked and i m around the average player skill level plat that is the lens i look at the game through unlike most all rts s in the last 20 years practicing and bettering oneself in aoe4 results in developing your own unique playstyle getting better is a fun personal and rewarding journey regardless of where you start on ladder there is and will continue to be a large playerbase so it is easy to find competitive games wherever your skill level lays wins are rarely determined by who ran the most efficient meta build instead a win loss can usually come down to critical mistake or exploiting a niche weakness found in your opponent 1v1 feels like a sparing match game knowledge and experience is king even those who top out at 150actions minute can still remain competitive there is so much variation in regards to maps civs and playstyle that it is simply impossible to account for everything thanks to this each game develops into its own unique story ending at a small skirmish route a massive epic battle across all the map or anything in between i came back 3 years after launch and the devs have greatly improved the competitive aspect of pvp at all skill levels i couldn t be more impressed by the changes back in the day the game was much more defensive orientated and more often than not created imperial age games that went on for an hour and had massive armies clashing over and over until resources ran out that sounds epic but it was mentally draining and honestly the frequency of those games took the epic and fun out of them now 90 of games end in or before castle and it feels so much better water gameplay is still meh and i hope they do a whole rework of it but even if left as is it is serviceable and you can always downvote water maps and never play them siege units could also use some balance attention in regards to the late late game but those games are few and far between i m not a single player pve kind of gamer but i have played through the english campaign and it is well done interesting and better than most singleplayer rts offerings certainly worth the price of admission on sale single player has wonderful history documentary like videos between each mission and i am absolutely enthralled watching them more awesome stuff the civs are all unique some more than others lul and create great immersion multiple voices per unit then per civ and then per age super impressive starting up a new round the action is slow the music is slow the game is pretty and soft it builds up quickly and it is fun to play that transition almost like the game plays differently each age and you have to be ready for the transition from microing one critical dood in age1 to carelessly throwing 20 expendable horsemans into your opponents farms in imperial the unique units and techs and play style of each civ incredible every sound award in 2021 including music should have been given to this game graphics are great game runs great always ui made with console in mind but still great on pc lots of keybind and ui control customization no microtransactions not being sold anything when i boot up the game refreshing game was made with love clearly more stuff to comethe game has a magic about it and it isn t just nostalgia is good game
