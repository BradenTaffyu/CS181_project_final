2023 i don t think i can praise this game highly enough you don t even need to start playing to see the flavor and style that permeates every bit of the game it s beautiful and silly and every bit of text and art keeps that feeling whether you re reading one of the many text logs that build the world s lore taming one of the many creatures present in the game s universe or dealing with a disaster befalling your base and disaster will fall but it never feels random unpredictable or unfair while some survival games start tough as nails but eventually allow the player to reach a point where they are invincible even 300 in game days into a save i ve found myself facing a new dilemma frequently of my own creation progressing well with your technology and have machines manufacturing everything your characters need now you re generating heat that can kill off nearby crops leading to a food shortage find a vent that generates unlimited water it might also be too hot or cold and damage your characters accidentally create a web of piping for your colony s multiple toilets sinks and showers that causes a backup of polluted water and renders all that plumbing unusable your colonists will drown in their own filth and become ill there are no random earthquakes invasions or other disasters that cause your colony to fall to the winds of chance you are always the disaster and overcoming each of the trials that befall your colony feels immensely rewarding and gratifying oni never holds your hand but it gives you all the information and tools you need to solve the many dangers that can befall your colony there s no one size fits all solution to any problem need to generate oxygen so your characters don t suffocate you can use algae to convert small amounts of carbon dioxide to oxygen or use electrolyzers to convert water to oxygen and hydrogen which can be used to generate power need to deal with the carbon dioxide your characters are exhaling you can use algae find creatures that breathe it and produce oil or pump it right out to space nearly every problem has multiple solutions and the signs of impending disasters are always there giving the player ample time to come up with their own solution once they see it coming this game is the gold standard of the survival colony sim genre the actions of the characters are predictable and if they do something stupid there was always something the player could have done to avoid it there are many many things that can go wrong but none of them are ever random or unpredictable the tech tree is massive and there are plenty of things for your characters to build and do i feel like even after playing the game for nearly 300 hours i m still making new discoveries and learning new things to do to make my colonies thrive or bring them to ruin it s a game that would easily be worth it at a aaa price point but it s less than half the price and frequently on sale for under 10
