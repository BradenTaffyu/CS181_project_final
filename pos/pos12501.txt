2018 as someone who has wasted a week of their life playing this game i can assure you that this game is worth every second let me try and run you through what will happen when you purchase this game first you will spawn in a brand new world and have a wander around then you might spawn a few npc s non playable characters bots and kill them this will keep you entertained for a good few minutes many hours after that you will have a proper rummage through all the tools weapons vehicles ragdolls and other useless crap within your menu eventually you will tire of this and download some addons from the workshop just to liven things up a bit again you will have a good look at all the garbage you have downloaded at this point you will be thinking about making your own addons to contribute to the amazing workshop you have many ideas and plans but in the end you end up posing a female ragdoll bent over while they are being thrusted in the ass by a male ragdoll you will be proud of your creation and so upload it to the workshop naming it gmod sex lol xd 18 after a few more hours of loitering around in singleplayer you will discover multiplayer you join many servers only to discover that they are full of little russian kids screaming at you because you knocked over one of their props not all hope is lost because you will then find amazing servers full of awesome people and this is where you will waste many hours of your life well it s where i did eventually you will get bored and abandon this game for many months one day you will be scrolling through your library of games and stumble upon gmod you ll remember all the good times you had and start playing again in short this game is brilliant just play it you will need counter strike source for some textures have fun edit it s been five years since i wrote this review and it s still on point i have amassed many more hours of playtime and i still believe this has been the most worthwhile purchase made on my steam account an absolute gem 3
