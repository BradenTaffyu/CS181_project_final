2020 early access review i was a warband fan so this was something i have been waiting a long time for and i love it even thought its in early access its so much game ive at this time spent 24 hours on the game and i am still very far from end game so excited to see what the devs will come up with so far the mechanics are mostly the same as warband would like to see new mechanics and improved ai the ai is probably the weakest part of the game at this point not the battle ai but the map movement and decision ai anyhow great great game love it
