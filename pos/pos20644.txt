2023 i ve never given a game a perfect score before and i thought long and hard about whether or not god of war deserves it no matter how much i enjoy a game typically there are at least a few moments where i get frustrated or bored but not with this one the graphics sound combat world and plot all come together to make an exquisite package that is a prime example of why games are art and god of war is right up there with the best films and novels when it comes to storytelling
