2018 so i ve never really wrote a review but with this game i really feel a need to i d like to first open up with that i am a gamer that loves survival type or rpg games like ark wurm skyrim banished you name it but i am also a hunter irl i have been out there hunting in the real world so that being said i d just like to point out that so far i am loving this game ya did not think i d say that about a game this review is with no dlc i ll be getting it soon though 1 as a female myself i m very pleased to see female hunter options and to see there is a female warden in game no big deal but it s nice to see in games 2 as a gamer the controls are very easy to pick up and little explination is needed 3 as an irl hunter i typically rely on sound one of my favorite things to do was sit and listen and this game really picks up on that you don t just rely on your eyes like most games it makes it feel so much more realistic while you re hunkered down in a bunch of brush and you can hear an animal around you but you can t see it the suspence before a big buck walks out from behind a tree and the wind direction is great too the amount of detail they put into this game makes it feel extremley realistic and i love it tbh more games should be like this 4 i got that same adrenalline rush i do irl when taking down an animal if your a hunter you ll know what i mean and most importantly 5 scenery my god the level of scenery in this game i keep it on medium settings but even if i don t see any animals i m constantly awed by the amount of realistic scenery in the game and detail the way the sunlight changes the wind blowing the different colored leaves and the grass swaying in the wind this is how a game should be another neat little detail i noticed was how the grass pressed down when you walked through it you don t just phase through like most games through the grass it actually moves and the sound effects crickets chirping birds and depnding which way you re facing you can hear where they are even bats chirping at night i just can t get enough of that so to conclude my review i would like to say that my husband and i are enjoying the game together that s also fun considering we had trouble finding a game we clicked together on we both have dif prefrences i was hesitent on getting the game bc of the price but after this i feel the money was well spent and theres a lot of games i ve wasted money on and was mad after if you know someone who may love hunting and physically can t get out to do so anymore and knows how to use a computer i would highly recomend this game for them or if you just don t have the time money to so so yourself i do as well if you enjoy hunting irl i highly recommend this game they got it right i m still fairly new but i really felt the need to write a review for this game and to let others know it s money well spent if you get it the only issue i ve found is sometimes tracks doubleback and disapear rare but it has happened i look forward to seeing what they have in the future to add and the only thing i d like to see is maybe a little more survival like items such as maybe more interactions with things like the campfires it be cool to make a campfire or cook some food or build your own cabin kinda stuff just suggestions but as of right now i m enjoying the game great job thehunter team
