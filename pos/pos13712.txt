2016 i was just cruisin down the street until i came across some russians broken on the side of the road we couldn t unstderstand eachother and they had guns decided i would be nice come to a complete stop get in my passenger seat and say hop in it took them a few seconds to realize my idea because we could not understand eachother at all i taught them english for a few things on our adventures they took me to get me a gun we went to the bank and robbed it we did drugs we even killed the police cheif after holding him hostage for 30 minutes it was a great time i have to say my favorite part of it all was i the fact they called me charlie and spoke a language i did not understand and i would guess what they wanted me to do until i got it correct and when i taught them things like shots fired they used it to explain things like shots fired police cheif charlie and that meant shoot the police cheif charlie i hope one day we meet again 10 10 would take a adventure on a russian server with the russian mafia again
