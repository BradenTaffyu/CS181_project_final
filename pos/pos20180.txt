2023 the first two acts are really good and kept me engaged and immersed i never thought i would enjoy the warhammer 40k setting however from act 3 the game starts falling apart in all areas battle balance progression companions dialogs choice reactivity story colony management and on top of that there are lots of bugs i don t even want to start on some design decisions sometimes it feels like the devs hate the player objectively it deserves a negative review for being so unfinished i m giving it a positive one just because two good acts are still a lot compared to what other games offer nowadays i will however think twice before buying an owlcat game on day one next time
