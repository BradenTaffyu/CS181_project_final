2022 an amazing game to just escape and take your mind off things i like the attention to detail the game reminds me of test drive unlimited but with trucks the map is huge there is so many different places to see and explore the trucks are amazing and the game offers various customisation options and upgrades to enhance their looks and performance etc the game even includes the steam workshop for the addition of mods which is always good if you want to add cool lights fancy wheels or adjust the engine sounds etc which is fun the gameplay is what you would expect its prity much a case of performing deliveries to and from random locations to make money then earn xp become a better driver and eventually build up your truck collection the game allows you to hire trucks and trailers for deliveries which is how you start out and eventually you can hire and assign your own drivers to work for you garages are also required for storing various trucks throughout the map etc the menus can be a bit confusing at times because there are so many different accessibility options the game kinda goes all out with how you want the trucks to look and feel whilst driving the camera hud and position etc can all be adjusted changing the various keybindings can take a bit of time and is sometimes tricky to get it the way you prefer but it is great once its all setup i really do like this game its a lot of fun and very enjoyable to play awesome game
