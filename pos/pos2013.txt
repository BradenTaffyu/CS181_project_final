2020 i ve put a lot of time into the game in the other version before steam launch throughout a lot of my childhood and even now i d say this is one of the best star wars experiences you can have in a game there are 8 character classes all with their own campaign main stories with each being very unique and enjoyable if you like star wars or if you like mmos then i encourage you to try the game i d recommend that if you enjoy the game and want to spend more time in it you get a 1 month subscription to get sub benefits and when the sub is over you remain a preferred status account it ll make your experience better for the rest of your accounts lifetime
