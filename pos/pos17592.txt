2016 this game is amazing yes with game all dlcs its an expensive game but the amount of content is massive and you do not need the dlcs to enjoy playing it would rate it a 9 10 the biggest issue i have with this game is the fact that autoresolve is so strong even at high difficulty there should be big insentive to fight the battles as that is the best part of this game
