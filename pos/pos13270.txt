2016 kerbal space program is my 2nd most favourite game of all time i always have loved building things i love realism and i love the idea of space travel it covers all these aspects and more better yet you can mod the game to make it even more amazing there is many hundreds of hours of gameplay to be had here the kerbal space program ksp game community is massive with so many mods available the game can easily be surpassed with more gameplay experiences such as mechjeb or far ferram aerospace so when game updates it can break your ship builds if the mod isn t updated some mods are not updated for months that s about the only downer really i would have liked multiplayer as a feature but it may be added in the future only time will tell pros building your own space ships realistic stock physics can be upgraded with a mod called far exploration game can be played in sandbox mode a bit like minecraft game actually teaches you orbital mechanics nasa use this game to teach people about space uses a recent build of the unity engine so graphics are pretty decent sound track is good for an indie game many many hours of gameplay to be had flight controls are good once you get accustomed to them you can use joystics too interface is useful ie navball fast forward setting waypoints etc the ksp forums are helpful where people share designs and talk about mods etc cons saving and loading is a bit confusing could use a better navigation system ie hard to locate runway when landing or locating a waypoint on the map takes away a lot of your real life time you could spend 8 hours on this game and not even realise the time had gone by some mods are so damn awesome that you become dependent on them recommended mods b9 aerospace parts pack b9 procedural wingsengineer redux to show you more info as to what s going on ferram aerospace research adds advanced simulated flight physics mechjebi bet there are hundreds of other amazing mods out there for this gamei give this game 9 5 out of 10
