2015 i ve seen some overwhelmingly critical reviews of fallout 4 and wanted to step into here to throw my hat into the lot the overwhelmingly negative reviews are misguided and misplaced this is especially true on metacritic where it seems a battalion of armed and dangerous gamers who were ready to review the game to hell and beyond on review day to me it s clear many haven t played fo beyond fo3 that s a core issue in how people respond to fo 4 let s start with the first and most important aspect of a game fallout 4 is fun let me add to that fallout 4 is beautiful and fallout 4 is interesting that s not to say that fallout 4 doesn t have its areas that need improvements i have a list of areas that need definite improvement and i ve tried to mix these with those overwhelmingly negative comments so that you can see where people step out of rational criticism and into raging mouth frothing gamer the conversation wheel the conversation wheel is a downgrade from previous fallouts this is the biggest and most negative change away from previous fallouts it s a change that glorifies a game that i can t stand mass effect and stands in the face of the role playing genre in that sense i agree in how frustrating it is to have a significant lack of choices and responses examples here include choosing sarcasm which almost always appears on the radial menu human speech and conversation is more caveated than just a single word and displaying sarcasm as an option omits the fact that sarcasm itself takes on varying forms in human communication when i m sarcastic to my boss it s significantly different than if i m sarcastic to my loved ones or friends that s because sarcasm is nuanced just as human speech is and fallout 4 is definitely missing out here i feel like bethesda could take a chapter from fallout s past fallout was originally an isometric rpg similar to baldur s gate icewind dale or even more closely feeling arcanum a more recent example would be pillars or eternity which has a near novelization of story and writing and this is something directly in fallout s own history and past it s a fair critique to want to return to that this game isn t an rpg anymore this is the extreme statement from someone upset about the above conversation wheel and they are to be completely honest wrong fallout 4 is as much of an rpg as any other game labeled as such final fantasy 7 valkyria chronicals or skyrim you might not have as much choice in fallout 4 but it is absolutely a role playing game in which you play the role of a father or a mother looking for their lost child there are many who feel shoehorned into who their character is and yet i m sure those same individuals aren t upset that they were shoehorned into the role of the neravar in morrowind games have been giving a jolt to their story and characters from the get go with many but not all characters having a past before their introduction as a character fallout 4 s system here reminds me very much of deus ex human revolution in that capacity the character existed before the events of the story and has plot points based on those events this isn t something new and it certainly isn t even new to fallout your character in fallout 1 while unnamed still had his own back story of sorts it s not new to rpgs either alex from lunar chrono from chrono trigger jc denton the list goes on many variants of the rpg genre exist and many of them have characters that have a limited scope or previous history this isn t new it s not a big deal the conversation wheel is combat in the wastes the combat systems of bethesda games has always been frustrating for me i was originally going into melee stealth but quickly found this to be an exercise in frustration i m still happy i dumped points into strength but i m frustrated with the lack of stealthing innovation and game play deus ex human revolution did this much better melee stealth in fallout 4 is clunky and awkward for me it seems thrown together in the last minute many times i will successfully stealth and kill one person only to alert everyone in the area that i m around apparently despite instantly dying people are able to give off enough of a death scream to make everyone else aware of what s going on it would be nice if i had to drag bodies or more game play around the stealth elements thus far 20 25 hours in i haven t found any gear worthy of wearing for stealthing the game says that light and heavier gear makes you seen faster but i often get seen in just long johns in the complete dead of night they also fill areas with lights making stealth an exceptionally difficult choice and option suppressors are gated behind crafting skill gates or higher levels so i haven t obtained anything to shoot lights out it makes the early game for a stealther frustrating guns feel very wastelander ish which is cool they ve done a much better job of weapons being pieced together from scrap and garbage it feels like i m in a post apocalyptic world melee combat out of stealth is pretty bad i spent one fight stunned by rad roaches early in i realized my dreams of being purely melee were misplaced i don t have much to say about vats i don t use it much because it doesn t offer much of a reprieve for me at the current moment outside of melee kills you can thwak the heck out of someone in a vats melee session questing and gameplay i think the questing and game play aspects of fallout 4 are fun i m having a lot of fun doing the varying quests around the wasteland i like fighting and finding legendary creatures which drop better items i like modifying my weapons and armor types and i like the feel of downtown boston there are some who are bothered by the minutemen quest series it doesn t bother me at all in the long scheme of things the minutemen are a small time militia attempting to secure a single town it doesn t surprise me or seem weird that the only real remaining member of the militia group wants you to take charge a bit early possibly although i did massacre several groups of bandits beforehand so why not other than that i like the boston feel to the take one npc called me a re todd 10 10 would bash skull in again crafting towns i really really like this addition to fallout but i m frustrated it wasn t taken to the hole by bethesda i cannot wait for the mods to be released for this section bonuses it s awesome that i can level by the crafting alone i spent a good hour on building my own workshop complete with setting up areas for my settlers to sell weapons and armor and other goods it s this cool little hub in the sky for people to come trade i like that a lot i think the town setting system allows for a unique perspective in setting up a thriving area for boston being a force for positive change for the settlers of the world there s a brotherhood of steel member who mentions that people aren t aware of what the world is doing for the species the town system answers that it s humans trying to make a living and working together to survive negatives here are some crafting needs needs a flip orientation option needs to be able to turn on other axes besides left and right let me increase the proportion or decrease it see wildstar s building options here if i want a giant wrench let me let me place items where i want limiting me to the ground sucks let me salvage everything give me tools or robots that i can use to salvage entire facilities so i don t have to drag everything around fallout 4 is fun but has areas to improve on what game doesn t
