2019 early access review this is a great game with loads of potential but i also see many issues with it pro s great world building and setting hint listen to the radio engaging gameplay rpg elements a always existing air of tension that damn helicoptercon s lack of events and props to invest me in the world for example no police barricades from what i ve seen i may not have found them yet so i may be wrong cdc or fema vehicles or sites no mass graves ect lack of clothing which is getting fixed in the update but even then i don t think it is enough i would prefer a load more of clothing like fbi special cdc hazmat suits special forces and stuff like hats and the ability to mix and match though idk if that will be included or not so once again take it with a grain of salt lack of npc s which i do know is being worked on so until added will be counted as a con lack of vehicle variety for example fbi cars police vans swat vehicles more army vehicles cdc and fema vehicles no tractor trailers lack of weapon models this is being fixed so it will be removed as soon as they patch it in while i put more negatives the game is very fun and is well deserving of your money to the devs i hear how your updates are slow and i think that you should focus on smaller updates that add things over time not massive overhauls that take time of course there are times for this for example npc s animations ect but for smaller things like adding new clothes and vehicles i think you should put those out as small updates if you ever need someone to come up with ideas for you i d love to help you out sincerly a new fan
