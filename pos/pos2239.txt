gotta say i am about to rage quit it is getting really really really frustrating to do a long ass mission that you gotta solo get to the last boss and have the server disconnect you or how about taking the trouble to capture a resource farm thing and then build it up so you can collect the stuff and having the server disconnect you i cannot recommend at this build because i get tired of farming for ammo or resources to be able to do this crap use it all up and then have an error happen and you lose everything and don t get it back but have to do the whole forking thing over again because you didn t get the reward seriously hour long mission soloed because it is hard to find a group that wants to do the same things at the same time you do down to my last gun down to my last 5 stimpacks almost had the damn boss dead and error gah old review still stands but it does get maddening at times after 542 hours of playtime i think i am finally ready to review this game it has the good the bad and the ugly the good so much to do so much to see so may to kill these are all good things seriously over time i have taken lengthy breaks gone back to old characters created new ones and every time i play there is something new that has been added this has been ongoing since launch and they really do seem to try and listen to the player base wants considering this game had one of the worst launches i can remember and no i did not purchase this game at launch i came in after they fixed it but i know about it the team that works on this game works hard to fix what is wrong they proved that by recovering from the rocky start and their continued addition of content for players sure everything breaks for a while after a new release but honestly when hasn t a new software launch screwed things up good god at work every time it says there s going to be an update there is a collective groan from the staff because a new launch always comes with a few bugs the champions rise above and fix the issues fallout 76 is a champ one of the best things in the game to me anyway is the c a m p system that now allows you multiple camps across the map if you are strategic about placement you can have easily accessible travel and resource points that are so easy to switch between on the fly making travel and resource gathering easier premium members also get the tent that is amazingly helpful but it is possible to play this game and have fun without being a premium member to go a little further on that premium coins can be earned in game it is a slower grind for sure than getting a monthly deposit but the fact that they make premium content able to be earned as well as purchased goes a long way in my book i have been a first member can t afford it right now so i currently am not but i can still enjoy the game and all the content it offers i just have to be a little more discerning about my resource management without the plus membership that being said the bonuses offered by being a member i think are pretty fair and once my financial situation clears up i plan on re subscribing my point is you can play this and have fun either way and still have access to most of the cool loot available in the premium shop the bad and the ugly the bad is that some of the events can get repetitive i mean everyone is usually up for a good blast zone battle i am still working on being able to launch but some of the events are empty every time every time and to try and solo an event is an effort in futility unless you are perhaps maxed out on everything which i am not and never have been since you need the rewards from those events to afford the gear that will let you solo it people need to be there to help so it is my hope that on some of the updates maybe the developers will take a look at some of the less popular ones and modify or replace them cough cough hint hint resource management can be difficult i am constantly struggling for ammo to the point i can t participate in events that are popular because i don t have enough bullets to help scavenging for resources uses even more ammo up so it seems to be a vicious cycle this is with maxed ammo smith level 2 legendary ammo perk i just don t have great aim we can t all be sharpshooters but some of us that aren t the best still really like to play currently at the time of this review i am pretty sure the second expedition has just dropped and the game is still a little buggy again enemy ai hasn t always been the best but there is some instances of sticking lagging and general weirdness at times that can be frustrating the game has crashed on me several times once after taking the time to secure a workshop and set up all the collectors ran out of ammo and still defended it and then bam the server crashed it wasn t me and when i logged back in all of it was gone the camp was full of super mutants but my ammo was gone and so were my resources i almost rage quit right then but i reminded myself that this game is buggy and stuff like this will happen so bottom line yes this game has it s share of issues there are bugs it happens sometimes a lot but it is so much fun there is so much to do so many ways to play your character so many weapons to shoot heavy guns or pistols power armor or no raiders or settlers junkie or bloodied what perks are important to you follow the quests or hang out with people at events or daily ops chill by yourself and work on your camp s the choices are plentiful the post apocalyptic setting is immersive and the stories and lore surrounding pretty much everything is deeper than expected i heart this game
