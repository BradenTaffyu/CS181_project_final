troubleshooter abandoned children tac from now on is a mission based like x com games squad level tactical strategy game with rpg elements and a ton of game systems to give the player plenty to do if you like the jrpg tropes such as ultra powerful teens wielding incredible abilities with no explanation as to why or how armies of faceless evil minions for the heroes to mow down led by powerful bosses that always seem to survive escape resurrect and plenty of angry girls that want to bite your head off then this is your game seriously though the game is a lot of fun and not something you ll blow through in record time expect this one to last as you work your way through it
