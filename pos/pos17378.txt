2019 i have been playing total war since the first rome in 2004 and this new game make it to my top 3 of all total war games they took the right decision to delay the game 3 times and fix the bugs it feels super polished as the way it should be at first there doesn t seems to be much to it but as you progress you find a lot of intricacies they basically took the best parts of the previous total war games and cemented it top 3 total war games1 rome i2 shogun ii3 three kingdoms
