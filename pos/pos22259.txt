2016 i like the game there is no denying that especially since i m close to finishing my fourth playthorugh yet i can t be ignorant just because of that the greatness of every component that makes dark souls iii is crippled by its poor technical execution and i m afraid this is a result of the fans and journalists attitude towards the game praising without questioning has given the developers a free pass with the end result being countless bugs and problems that went unfixed throughout an entire series making their way into its finale dark souls iii is a good game that combines most of the great elements of its predecessors into one final blow the impact of the finale is subject to each gamer perception towards the series in my case i said that the best way to improve on the series is to find the balance between its two predecessors while focusing on fixing the problems of the past and dark souls iii did only half of that how important each half is i guess the time spent playing the game can be interpreted as an answer to that pros impressive artistic design epic soundtrack mysterious and captivating story good level design refined combat system greatest roster of boss battles and the best difficulty curve in the series atmospheric good itemization fun pvpcons bugs from the previous games made it into this one with new additions some issues with mouse keyboard linear world design with a few exceptions perhaps too much fan service the graphics quality and graphics related problems little incentive to continue with ng and onwards weapons balance issues due to poise stat having no effect the lack of proper support for the online component annoying lag in online playread the full review at
