2020 i recommend this game but i don t know if i can in good conscience recommend the pc version of the game if you can get this on ps4 if not get this but know what you re getting into first this game has issues running on pc and requires a mod to run it at 1920x1080 60 fps even with the mod the cutscenes were encoded in 30 fps and stutter during playback the only way to fix the cutscenes is to download a program that re encodes all the game s cutscenes a process which took me more than 24 hours to complete play this wonderful game save yourself the agony and get it on ps4 if you can if that s not possible for you well it s still worth it vigilance
