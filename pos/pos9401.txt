2014 i love this game assetto corsa dawns a new era of the racing simulator assetto corsa is a simulator that brings the revered true to life racing experience to the casual gamer this game bridges the two worlds together without losing rigidity as a racing simulator this is a simulator that will punish you for entering a corner too fast or giving too much gas in a corner but at the same time it is so delightfully simplistic and intuitive that it is easily playable by almost anyone assetto corsa is one of the few racing simulators that is fun and still encourages you to make mistakes and learn from them if you are coming from console games like forza or gt and are looking for something more then this is the game for you assetto corsa is truly the best racing simulator there is however this game is by no means perfect one of the biggest problems that i have for this game is the lack of awareness of speed this leads to the driver entering the corner much too fast and creates an inorganic driving experience this problem is mostly notable in the interior driving view other reviewers have mentioned this as a flaw and it certainly is one i found the best way to correct this is to adjust the fov or go to either the bonnet cam or the bumper cam if you are someone that can get used to the inside cam where it occurs the most then this might not be a problem for you
