2016 overview stardew valley is a game that borrows heavily from similar titles in the harvest moon series you start out in a rural town with nothing but a dilapidated house and crop fields that are more akin to the wilderness than a place to grow vegetables the game is simple in its understanding build a farm make profits live your life what the game allows you to do makes it so much more layered you re left with the freedom to explore the town its residence mold your farm into whatever you want it to be and on your own time sure there are events to attend festivals to see men women to romance and marry kids to have buildings to construct fish to catch and weird little slimes to slay dragon warrior anyone but how and when you do those things is up to you in essence the game offers you very similar things to do as a harvest moon game does build and upgrade your farm plant crops upgrade tools mine in the never ending dungeon for precious ore go fishing romance and get married etc while some of your old favorites are back new aspects have been introduced as well but i won t spoil those in this review let s just say there s a nice story that evolves over time the freedom to do as you please is what makes this game and harvest moon in general so enjoyable it s a chance to mellow out play at your own pace and still enjoy everything the game has to offer what stardew valley does it does right it s charming cute and feels rewarding even when all you re doing is cuttings weeds it doesn t pull any punches or try to be something its not the developer had a goal in mind and stardew valley is a reflection of just that you can feel the effort the time and the devotion that went into this game over the years stardew valley is a gem and worth looking at if you loved harvest moon you ll love stardew valley to date stardew valley is a single player game though the developer as mentioned some form of co op or multiplayer availability in the future pros character customization always good always wanted visuals in the style of the snes they re colorful detailed and a delight game pace fast slow or somewhere in the middle it s your call to make content there is a lot more to do than i first imagined there are many hidden layers inside the game as you progress the storyline cons combat it s a tad basic since that isn t the core of the gameplay a single hack n slash mechanic citizens i d love to see more citizens even temporary ones during the year come and go to make the town feel more alive overall stardew valley is a pleasure i haven t put a ton of time into it yet but i easily see that happening it s fun lighthearted and addictive as i said earlier in this review if you ve ever played harvest moon you ll enjoy stardew valley it s worth checking out and i highly recommend it this will easily become one of my most played games on my list you won t be disappointed so check it out
