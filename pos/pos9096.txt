2022 very expensive single player game with near unlimited replay if you like the core mechanics of game honestly my best advice is to start out w the amount of dlcs that you re willing to pay for play the out of the game and every time you gets a little stale buy 1 more dlc you ll be more familiar with each component and you extend your replay extremely cheap multiplayer game with more depth than 9 out of ten multiplayer games some nerd is gonna have all the dlcs doesn t have to be you
