2018 with the sale on i decided to check back on this game to see what the prices are for dlc and was shocked to see the recent mixed reviews i m a big total war fan and have played the series since the original rome total war this is a good game and i would reccomend it to anyone the dlc is a bit high priced though if your considering purchasing the game i d recommend holding off on most dlc for a bit i only really like the stuff the grim and the grave offers anyway with that said though the nice thing about this game is that all of the dlc is intergrated into the game for free so its not as if you wont be able to fight against vlad voncarstain or the beastmen you just wont be able to play those factions yourself tldr solid game good deal when on sale for 14 99 dont buy dlc without playing the game for a bit first
