2022 10 10 as far as i m concerned this is the best turn based fantasy rpg ever made between the pc and switch versions i have played through the game maybe 4 times at this point and i m always finding something brand new this last play through i was able to link my switch and steam games and can seamlessly jump from one to the other on the same play through the visuals are stunning with story deep and vast i really can t recommend this enough for people who are into this style of game sure it s probably not for everyone because it s extremely involved and almost tedious but not more than to be expected from an rpg of this style it could even be a great game for beginners into the genera when on exploration mode i hope dos3 is somewhere in the works
