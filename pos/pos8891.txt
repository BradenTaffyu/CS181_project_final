2019 i m barely writing any reviews but i can t let the i dislike any change reviews overwhelm this game 1 you can play all the different big versions all the time by just changing the version you play on 2 the game is at it s best state right now planet building was a nice mini game for the first 3 4 planets and then you would create sectors and let the ai manage anything else because it was just a mindless chore clicking 20 25 times to set up a power generator click 20 25 times to upgrade them now you need to balance and change districs and buildings through the whole game and tweak things here and there all the time yes it s confusing the first time playing with the new system but the learning curve is great when the patch came out the ai was a little weak and couldn t handle the planet development part but that got improved by a lot with the latest patch 100 recommendation
