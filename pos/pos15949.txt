2020 i have been highly sceptical of tts for a long time i m an avid irl table top gamer and having played a few board games online web based i felt that clicking on a screen cannot compare in the slightest to sitting around a table moving cards tokens and rolling dice hanging around with friends thanks but no thanks i thought boy i was wrong wen the corona crisis came and i was forced into tts to keep playing with my mates i realised how tts is not what i thought it was it is not a collection of games whose rules have been coded in an algorithm it is a physics simulator for the top of a table the fact you use that table to play games on it is almost incidental that means that playing in tts feels a lot like playing irl you still get to roll dice shuffle cards moving tokens around all while chatting merrily with your friends so this brings me to the top 3 pros of this game for me 1 it retains 83 of what makes a board games night with friends irl a great experience 2 the fact some games are scripted cuts down on the tedious tasks e g setup cleanup scoring 3 the availability of thousands of games allow you to get to know a lot more games than you d discover if you had to purchase them irl moreover for the last point i was worried that playing games for free online would have disincentivised me from buying the physical ones the game designers get their livelihood from i was wrong on that account too while i played some games that i did not like and would not buy irl i discovered many more games that i fell in love with and of which i have now ordered the physical copy that i would have never bought of my own accord otherwise so i feel like to endorse tts completely on a side note i am also very grateful the devs chose to release the linux version too as that is the only computing platform i use
