2015 early access review best survival game i have played so far if crafting is your thing then this has it all take over a building and make it your own or build your own stronghold the hordes can be nasty but that s what it s all about surviving with the newly implemented skill system you can cater to all your needs there simply isn t anything you can t do really can even find a poop in toilets now that is in depth highly recommended over dayz and h1z1 so much fun to be had see you in game
