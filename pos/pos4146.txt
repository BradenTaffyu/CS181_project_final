2020 where to start i have never gotten this engrossed in a game before it s simple enough on the surface but once you start digging into the core mechanics a little deeper it is apparent that it is an incredibly complex game which rewards you for contemplating and understanding risk reward and how to build the perfect deck it is a perfect game to pick up and just play 10 15 minutes but i often found myself saying just one more game whatever you do do not hesitate to pick this game up it is totally worth it and it is honestly one of my favorite games of all time
