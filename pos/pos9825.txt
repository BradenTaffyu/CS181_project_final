2019 rimworldrating 9 10what is rimworld rimworld is a survival colony builder game you have stranded on a strange planet and your goal is to survive as long as possible so you can build a space ship and get the hell out of here why should you buy this game why explanation small size this game offers enormous amounts of content with only a size of 300 mb for years i haven t seen a game this small and soak so many hours of my life optimized rimworld is very optimized i could play this on a 5 year old laptop and it still ran smoothly price time value this game is 30 euro and is worth every single penny these days there are hundreds of indie and early access games that youll play for 10 20 hours or even less and be done with them this game offers hours of content and stays fresh with mods coming out fun content rimworld is a game than can soak hours of your life without you even realising theres loads to do and many challanges in the way like infestations and aliens i don t want to go to in depth since i think you should see it for your selfs and i dont want to ruin your fun developers the developers of rimworld definitaly deserve some credit in here the developers dont only listen to the comunity they are actively trying to improve the game with the community by implementing developed mods made by the community into their core game also how many indie early access games these days have cash grabing developers that dont even care about the things they release any con s 200 hours in didnt find any so far why a 9 10 and not a 10 10 in my oppinion theres always room for improvement and more content to add thanks for reading my review
