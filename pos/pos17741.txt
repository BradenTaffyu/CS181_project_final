2023 i ve been playing total war since shogun 1 in 2000 seen it all at this point this is a pretty good game not the best tw but not as bad as the brigaders and bandwagon haters with 0 9 hours of gameplay are saying the game shares a lot of dna with troy but it s tremendously expanded from troy mechanically think napoleon to empire or atilla to rome 2 the core is there and you ll feel it but this is bigger and better in every way the campaign strategy mechanics are robust and deep layering on with each successive year of game time passing the number of plates to spin as you balance your strategies is exciting and much more than total warhammer troy or most other recent games although three kingdoms still has it beat there each faction feels distinct each culture feels very distinct there s lots of unit variety people who complain about floaty and light units in battle are only commenting on early game because light tier 1 units do move fast and shift positions quickly once you get to the slower heavier more orderly tier 2 and tier 3 troops the weight changes significantly battles are a tad too fast for my taste but that s been a problem with every tw since shogun 2 at least battle maps are very interesting terrain and topography vary greatly the battlefields are far more technically complex and interesting to fight on than warhammer and the changing battlefield states weather etc are very cool presentation of the game is top notch it s a beautiful and crisp game the art and ui are top notch the audio design is fantastic and the music is enthralling in battles you hear the thrum and stampede of your troops moreso than any other recent title things have weight and bass to them on the campaign map the hissing cicadas squawking flamingos creaking fishing boats and tinking sounds of blacksmiths at work on bronze is so crisp and immersive the setting is super well explored too as a fan of ancient egypt the land of pharaohs and the story of their flashpoint at the end of the bronze age is super flavorful and ca sophia did a spot on job representing the era and getting the flavor rounded out the game s biggest drawbacks imo battles are too fast the resource trade system is a bit cumbersome but still a nice evolution on generic trade agreements the battle graphics don t do a whole lot to help you distinguish between masses of fleshy shirtless dudes so you can t see battle lines clearly or tell who is who and the campaign is linked to immortal hero characters who can only ever be wounded i don t love that shogun 2 focused on a tight and specific period of time the rise of tokugawa but it let people die and it let alternate stories get told overall i agree with ign s 80 100 score personally this is a very good tw game and a very good strategy game it s not the greatest and it s a far cry from three kingdoms medieval 2 or atilla rome 2 after 3 years of patching lol but it s still worth playing for total war fans a lot of people are conditioned by their favorite youtuber streamer to hate this game and the typical talking points are mostly hollow a lot of criticism just comes from people angry about warhammer 3 s dlc pricing or people upset that this game wasn t medieval 3 empire 2 or they think this is a saga title despite this game being far larger and more varied than shogun 2 this game won t redefine tw for you but it s a robust strategy game with fantastic mechanics good pacing great presentation and plenty of reasons to come back it s immersive it ll get you interested in ancient egyptian hittite history and i m also excited to see what modders do with it the steam workshop is already active with no wait delay the battles are flawed in some ways and the focus on each faction s main character make this feel smaller in scope than it actually is i m sure once they start adding dlc factions and flc content people will stop crying about breadth hopefully folks enjoy if you re the type of person like so many others here who spend more time trying not to enjoy games trying to find flaws in games or are someone who falls for bandwagon groupthink easily then don t bother if you re a chad video game enjoyer then you re going to feel this is money well spent edit just like i said this is a good game you ll see the reviews taking a dramatic turn for the positive these days now that the bandwagon reddit mafia have stopped their hit job on this game go have fun with it
