2021 tl drdo i recommend forza horizon 5 yes and no play it on xbox game pass instead of buying it full price right now anyway the game is equally fun there and maybe even runs better the game is good it s really just a re skin of fh4 but that was a breakthrough game and there is nothing wrong with reusing the base of what made it so good physics are the same the game plays the same there is just more to fh5 in terms of gameplay it is almost 100 the same bot opponents have become a little harder but that is okay i m sure they ll look into that and tweak it some i hope so anyway there is more available in terms of racing arcade like events challenges etc events can be made by the players too i haven t fully looked into that but the possibilities are definitely there and seemingly endless the game has a good variety of racing available dirt racing street racing drags rallying it s all there and it s done well drifting is also an option although that was never really my favorite graphically it lacks impact while the xbox game looks stunning with its highly optimized graphics its pc counterpart has made little if any improvements over fh4 textures are blurry and not as good as could be and i have experienced that over longer periods of time 30m 1h the game starts dropping in frames it feels like the game is incredibly poorly optimized for pc experience once again i hope that over time the devs put in some work to make it look as good as the xbox version because that looks incredible there is huge potential there when the game initially came out more issues became clear they are slowly working on fixing those with some bugs already eliminated given the work done so far i do have fairly high hopes that more bugs get squashed and other issues are looked into as well i have thoroughly enjoyed my every minute spent so far and i look forward to playing again the next time feel free to ask questions i ll gladly answer anything i can about the game
