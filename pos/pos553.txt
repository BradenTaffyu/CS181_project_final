2019 what can i say i thought it was a boring game about farming and gifting things to people what nobody told me it was actually a time management business simulation with dungeon delving and monster slaying and by the end of year two i actually found the time for the gift giving and making friends portion of the game worst of all it even made me want to do it with all its quests i really like the game and it was so not what i expected it to be i expected harvest moon and not a more involved version of recettear
