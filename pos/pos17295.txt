2019 what an epic game very fun and challenging with an interesting lore in both campaign and battles you have to be mindful of every action you take or you will be conquered razed murdered i would recommend playing campaigns on very hard difficulty for a good challenge and battles on normal difficulty steam achievements here really work well and can make the game more entertaining as you shape new campaigns to achieve the achievements there s many things you can do in the campaign it s an adventure the only problem with this game is the campaign turn time it takes very long especially in mortal empires campaign
