2019 coming from civ v i was hesitant to get 6 because of the art style etc but now that i ve had some time to play it i actually really enjoy it it has a lot of improvements over v but each game has their ups and downs civ v is more rigid but on a grander scale the maps are bigger etc it s also familiar and relatively simple to grasp civ vi feels more streamlined and scaled down but with more attention to detail and playstyles and things you can do overall the maps are smaller the earth map isn t anywhere near as big as it was in civ v which was a huge bummer to me but apparently that s just because of the way gathering storm works and it would cause too many issues on a larger scale the ai is a lot better compared to civ v there s a lot more diplomatic options you can use like asking civs to join in current conflicts and wars and you can make alliances which level up the longer you have them most importantly though is the nukes they re beautiful i thought they were great in 5 but in 6 they are absolutely devastating the fallout they leave behind damages units if they end their turn in it and it also prevents absolutely any activity on the tiles they infect including cities so if fallout contaminates a city it s pretty much unable to do anything useful until it gets cleaned up
