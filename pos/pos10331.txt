2023 when i first started playing i thought great i ve got the coordination of a drunk giraffe and now i have to learn how to control a car in a game that s more realistic than my actual driving skills i mean seriously it was like trying to tame a wild beast but hey who doesn t love a challenge right after countless hours of spinning out crashing into barriers and probably causing more virtual damage than a demolition derby i finally started to get the hang of it and let me tell you it was like discovering fire for the first time suddenly i was in control and it was amazing i m still not winning any races but who needs to win when you can have the time of your life just trying to keep your car on the track it s like being a contestant on a game show where the prize is not dying in a fiery crash and honestly that s good enough for me so if you re looking for a racing game that ll make you feel like you re actually behind the wheel of a high performance race car assetto corsa competizione is the one for you
