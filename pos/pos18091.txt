2014 after purchasing the game on it s release date and playing since i can say that i have thouroughly enjoyed the experience as of patch 15 beta i e emperor edition bugs seem to be much more scarce and battle siege a i appears to be at a whole new level after playing every title since rome total war i personally feel that this game is now on par with shogun 2 if not more enjoyable if you enjoy the total war series and this time period interests you then i would recommend adding this to your collection
