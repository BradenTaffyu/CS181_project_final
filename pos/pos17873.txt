2023 big fan of the coh franchise have 820 hrs of coh2 on record the coh3 has great units but still has a long way to go feels more like an early release faaaar from being finished the game still has way to many bugs that eventually will be fixed but have high hopes the game is fun with problems and all still recommend it if you like the coh franchise not better than coh2 but still worth it update major bugs have been fixed with the last updates
