early access review played the game a lot on blacksmith before it came to steam and what is very promising about it are the developers they are very hardworking and will keep pushing the game even further when i look back to last year the game changed completely and it will be the same story for next year there are big updates with lots of content at the start of the wipes which happen periodically throughout the year and the game has a lot of potential so it s definitely a thumbs up from me
