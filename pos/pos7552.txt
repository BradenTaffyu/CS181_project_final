like many i picked this game up with the steam winter sale for those who say its a relaxing game it inst you have to constantly manage your city do challenges and the learning curve is steep but i recommend it because its a beautiful game and you can go total sandbox in creative if you want learn about stamps do the campaign first its more like a tutorial taker meryll out of the game at first check out videos by taka and mr incompetent and you will catch on quickly
