this game is broken in many ways i mean you break it yourself with some outrageous characters that win every encounter in the first turn making combat encounters a joke the story also breaks into the later act in the kind of way where you re walking along a bridge and it s all crumbled to ruins into an unexpected exit and despite all that and its numerous bugs where quests or triggers did not deploy properly i could not put the game down until i had played it to completion for every thing that s off there s things that just click and work the setting is very well made proper warhammer 40k and despite combat being broken being overpowered is fun and you feel really clever about yourself
