early access review first playthrough i was busy getting my bearings and didn t address the issue of there being bandit camps on the map very early on things went alright didn t grow population super fast or expand quickly but was managing to survive food was looking low for winter but manageable especially with the wheat harvest starting made bread with all the flour and my food stocks were looking good until late spring at least then the moment i hit winter those bandits i d been neglecting all raided me and took a bunch of bread and firewood definitely was gonna make surviving the winter harder but i wanted to try first thing i had to do was take those damn camps out before another raid started so i rallied my 18 militia spearmen and marched out the first fight was easy with no casualties although we did lose 2 people at the 2nd camp as i had not figured out fatigue yet things were still looking manageable with the extra funds i received from the camp to order more food but then a bandit camp spawned in the region my militia were marching through and i had them running home the bandits were within sight and destroyed my exhausted militia at this point i decided it was time to start again and use what i learned in my 2nd game second game went alot better stayed on top of bandit camps the whole time and claimed most of the lands was still struggling with food production and my population growth was still limited due to that plus my camp started in an odd area so i first build a small area for a staging ground before slowly moving everything to a better area nearer resources so that took 3 4 months of extra time nothing major happened this playthrough did learn some things like you get a free retinue when you build your manor which i neglected to do until hitting a medium village mainly used mercenary brigands to fight the bandit camps cheap and a pair of brigand units can defeat several bandit camps if used properly just kept them in service and filled my treasury regional wealth set up trading on a small scale to begin learning that process got my people chicken coops goats another ox and some horses along with sheep so we have a more sustainable source for clothing things were going well and i survived winter have this save still but wanted to move on to a 3rd to implement what i learned from this playthrough on a new one currently the new one is going great population is continuously growing right now currently have 18 19 families which is alot for me and still have food for 24 months saved up the first harvest was amazing got over 100 bread from it now trying to grow a patch of barley to make ale so i can get a tavern going when i start upgrading burgage plots to lvl 3 producing weapons currently and soon will be making shields to fill out the rest of my spear militia company and then bows when another family or 2 move in have 8 12 retinue members and 3 of them are upgraded with good armor 1 year from first attack and have 4 pieces of land but only the main village still saving up treasury for some mercenaries for the raid upgrading my retinue things seem to be going well but that can all change pretty quick
