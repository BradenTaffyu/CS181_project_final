rogue trader is a game best summarized as what can be accomplished when a studio actually retains staff and internalizes feedback rogue trader brings what owlcat does best in spades while significantly although not totally improving on their weakpoints this is the first owlcat game where i felt no need to install mods or any desire to google guides at least for the first 70 of the game some of the later quests have single decisions with hugely different outcomes and sometimes it was hard to resist the urge to cheat a bit after recieving several waves of patches the game played extremely stably with some visual and minor gameplay bugs the space combat still has some quirks if you turn up the animation speed with your ship randomly rotating 90 degrees after finishing its movement the narrative was extremely strong and cohesive throughout character motivations always made sense dialogue was always engaging a good story driven 40k game almost requires one to have a theusaurus at hand and this game provides that in spades my biggest story gripes were that chapter 3 sometimes felt a bit too forced and could ve done with a couple more player choices and that argenta was woefully flat as a character although some of that might ve come from ip limitiations combat and subsequently encounter design has always been owlcat s achilles heel but rogue trader proves that the studio is strongly progressing in this area with their next title the combat system might actually hold up the entire way through rogue trader felt brilliant to play at daring difficulty for the first 2 chapters which is the majority of the content but at the start of chapter 3 the sheer number of passives and the like that are picked up every level start to snowball unless you seriously bump up the difficulty half of your party won t even have time to act in most late game combats as arch militants turn anything they look at into swiss cheese tldr this game bussin
