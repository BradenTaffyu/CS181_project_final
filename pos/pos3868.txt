2019 early access review deservingly nominated for the labor of love steam award the devs are too hard on themselves by agreeing to what s being said in negative reviews the simple fact is that you can t please everyone and that negative review with a lot of upvotes clearly shows that that person is simply not cut out for this type of game the pacing isn t slow to the point of unfun at all it lets you appreciate the characters more how often do you disconnect with characters in a movie because their personalities aren t fleshed out due to the entire plot being crammed into 90 minutes resulting in you not caring what happens to them the translation is also not that bad certainly not to the point of not being able to understand anything it needs to be worked on yes but that s why it s still ea it doesn t warrant a negative review certainly not when you look at all the positive points that this game has to offer there s a good amount of strategic depth the mastery system shows great potential once you get past the learning curve and the women are sexy lookin at you giselle on that note it d be great if y all could add costumes which change the hairstyle of a character like oh i don t know giselle with her natural long hair like in that one cutscene not the towel as an outfit though this isn t the type of game for unrealistic fanservice like a woman moving through the battlefield with nothing but a towel on lol that s another part to like about this game it s solely focused on the story and gameplay to drive it forward you d be hard pressed to find a real negative about it but if i had to think of 1 thing then i d point at the current crafting system as the weakest link some of the materials take way too long to find compared to what you re getting for them in return so i do hope that gets improved over time the method i had to use in order to obtain the maxed out legendary item achievement was unconventional to say the least last but not least i d be interested in hearing why the development team for this game is small when you ve got a good concept which is the case here then it s my opinion that you should recruit more people in order to fulfill all those ambitions that you have costs for hiring them shouldn t be a problem go to platforms like gofundme patreon kickstarter and present said concept the future additions that you wish to add to it hire more people with the funds gained from that keep your dev team monarchic with a clear direction and voila watch the whole project become actually doable i m telling you this because i ve seen some of the ideas and future additions that you have in store for this game and i can tell you already that a small dev team isn t going to cut it to make all of that happen this point will be extremely important for the future of troubleshooter so please take note of it other than that i applaud what you ve achieved so far and would gladly recommend this game to my few friends already
