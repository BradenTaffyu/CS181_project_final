2023 i m gonna try to be genuinely honest here the situation for the game is pretty nuanced and that can be difficult to express in a time when everything needs to be a meme and or the worst best thing to ever happen in short you can buy the game right now and have a heck of a lot of fun but the game might have gotten off to a better initial reception had it been delayed for another 6 months or so pros the game is a lot of fun at this stage and i am so happy we already get to play it whenever we want 1 what is here now is definitely enough to call this a full release 2 you can do a lot and you have much better tools out the gate compared to the first game it s less finicky while also more powerful so it s a heck of a lot easier to reach a higher baseline of cool looking cities can t overstate how much of an evolution this is examples road tool is insane zoning and the way assets are categorized gives you much more control as well as more types of zoning 3 performance issues aside the game is an insane visual upgrade the game can look frankly shockingly impressive this ties into the first point to make cities better looking by default in the first you d need several mods to start making cool cities not here 4 the simulation is really hecking cool there are some bugs but in general the way the city works with individually simulated agents makes for a city that has sort of its own life independent of your decisions all of a sudden you might notice a lot of people have educated themselves and consequently want different places to work and live so you now have a bunch of other options to build different stuff cool so it needs a little bit of work but it s absolutely mostly there 5 since everything is simulated traffic is a lot better mostly you re fine and at rush hour you get some backup that s pretty much it now cons there are pretty good arguments it could have been a delayed for like 6 months or b released as an early access product 1 quite a lot of small bugs whether it s education being unbalanced commercial having weird import export stuff or garbage being handled oddly there s stuff in the simulation that isn t working as intended or is in need of further balancing most of the stuff is simply down to not having played the game enough before to notice or not having enough time to fix it i guess it s annoying if you sit and think about it but not a single one of the bugs have really bothered me in a meaningful way 2 performance is bad but colossal order have been very upfront about that from before the game was released some of the reporting on it post release however makes it seem like they just didn t have enough time to finish all the work for instance the reports on wild amounts of polygons being rendered the acknowledge more or less by colossal order about lod work simply not being finished or the broken effects you pretty much need to turn some of them off you can absolutely run the game just check out the posted performance guides on which effects to turn off 3 compared to a very kitted up cities skylines 1 with all dlc and mods you might feel a little restricted if you ve played it a lot you ll come across situations where you go what a great spot this would be for a custom park or whatever feature from the first game s 10 year life cycle if you ve never played that version of the first game you might come across situations where you re like so i just build more of mostly the same type of district and both yes and no there is some challenge to be creative but on the other hand that forces you to familiarize yourself with the tools at hand to get the most creativity out of what is here your mileage may vary 4 bluntly some things just make it seem like the game is like 3 4 finished why are there no unlocks past the half way point of the development roadmap small city big city etc room for future expansions or planned but cut features who knows don t get me wrong these are non essential things but the feeling is there after almost 70 hours in the game taken as it is you could argue they should ve delayed 6 months or released into early access instead but you can also argue that releasing it will ultimately make the game much better much faster by both a making the developers accountable to the players rather than some arbitrary release date and b giving them more feedback than they could ever need to improve the game is it a little cynical maybe did they coldly calculate that the short term reputation loss would be offset by the longer term improvements of both what the bottom line looks like for the fiscal quarter as well as the game itself also maybe but don t they have a right to do that and do we need to be maximally dramatic about it if that is what they decide to do looking at it coolly it is a complicated situation for a company and either way they would have gone there would have been pros and cons i won t presume i d know so perfectly well what would be the right thing to do for players employees publisher and the company itself furthermore you could argue that the early access label brings with it certain connotations a never ending cycle of waiting for when the game is no longer almost finished and developers who just abuse the concept to avoid accountability or expectations of quality also is it maybe not allowed to release something as early access when it s already been marketed as a full release sort of thing heck if i know i m not a lawyer to sum it up issues notwithstanding i m super glad i m playing the game now rather than in 6 months i m glad i get to play it in a state where i can expect what is there to be enough for a release and don t have to think about what s a month or two down the line as for the rest of it i might feel a way about it but ultimately i ll leave up to colossal order because it s their product in the end
