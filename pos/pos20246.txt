2023 first review and i have to give it to owlcat games for their work done for 40k great for 40k fans lore is abundant also great for new people to 40k the game takes its time to explain the fascinating lore through highlighted texts and dialogue options so that makes it this game half video game half book there is alot of reading highly recommended if you like a deep turn based games with depth and a franchise with decades of rich lore also very happy with the voice acting especially for space wolf as they are my favourite chapter there are unfortunately quite some amount of bugs for a game of this length it might burn hours of gameplay from a bugged playthrough
