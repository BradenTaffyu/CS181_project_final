owlcat s usual a sprawling game that might have been a bit too ambitious for its own good at times this time with turn based combat so you don t have to gaslight yourself into thinking that rtwp is enjoyable the story is very good and fit for the setting but you might need some time after finishing it to fully understand what happened the combat is quite entertaining if not a tad too easy character progression will make your head hurt at first due to the sheer amount of options available but it s not as bad as pathfinder s 1000 feats and somehow 990 of them are worse than a flat 1 the soundtrack is absolutely stellar with its sacral techno vibe and as usual with crpgs you ve got a colorful cast of characters really amusing and well written characters accompanying you such as a good father figure a woman with exclusively bad ideas a sister of battle there is no joke their lore is weaponized schizophrenia anyway sadly unromanceable a socially inept cinnamon roll romanceable a really funny toaster the worst inquisitor in the galaxy romanceable a wet cat of a bi woman romanceable a noble space elf who can t ever stop being racist romanceable a severely bullied space marine a wet feral cat of a space dark elf who can actually stop being racist if you ask him romanceable summary 10 10 game recruit marazhai and put him on a leash he s really funny i swear
