2020 wanna hear a story boy i swear everything i tell you is true oh my boy let me begin it was a quiet night when we traveled through orion 3 guess what the quiet night usually tends to be not so quiet at all we were hit by an object and our ship ran out of oxygen we had to be fast and escaped in our pods just to crashland seconds later on the surface of this very planet you were born on no quiet let me continue before you ask any questions there were 3 of us we managed to survive and built up our little homes we had comforting beds and food and yeah also energy to run our air conditioning outside 35 c and inside just right with 21 c oh boy just this one damn guy forgot to fire our generators and all the food got lost but guess again we managed to find another survivor and with the 4 of us we rebuilt our farms and killed some bandits quiet calm it was for a long time i went outside the other day to wash myself in the river and some insect stung me nothing unusual at that time of year but then i got sick oh boy i was so tired the whole day just stood up to get myself some food and went straight back to bed one of the others got ill too must be the damn mosquitos out there and exactly at that time we saw one of our friends stealing portions of some found drugs oh man he was so high he began raging and nearly killed everyone we could isolate him in our new built cell but with 2 of us completely ill one in prison and only one on his feet it was nearly impossible to keep the colony up and running oh boy we survived we managed to get back on our feet we put the guy in rehab and thank fill in your prefered god he was clean and a valuable member of our community i mean h boy until we had to kill him because he messed with this other drugs again and startet raging again this game is crazy it s like in the old days with it s let me finish just this step let me built just this building attitude you completely forget about time and space prepare to set your alarm to be not surprised by sunrise
