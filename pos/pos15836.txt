2021 early access review exactly what i wanted out of this game i m hoping that they ll eventually allow steam workshop to allow people to make their own maps as that would potentially make playability infinite but really enjoying this so far if you like house flipper or viscera cleanup detail you ll like this very satisfying edit the game currently has about 20 hours of play in it at a leisurely pace quite well polished and well thought through for early access developers seem to be active and responsive to the community looking forward to more content
