2022 early access review played this game multiplayer with two friends for the first time today i had played a bit of single player and neither of my friends had played yet this all took place over the course of a roughly 5 1 2 hour play session dawn of the first day friend 1 s first character jonny johnson dies in the time it takes me to make my character i find friend 2 being chased by a horde we go to jump a fence but i m tired and carrying too much to climb it big fence so i run through a house and lose the horde before walking all the way around the big fence this takes about 5 minutes real time i finally get to the other side and don t see friend 2 apparently she jumped back over the fence to stick with me and is now corned by the same horde i had lost i go all the way back another 5 minute walk and find her hiding in a house most of zombies had wandered away friend 2 had been scratched by a zombie 7 chance of her turning lacerated by a zombie 25 chance of turning and had a deep wound on her hand from climbing through a broken window she had removed the glass shard but had no bandages and was bleeding i bandaged her and we went to meet up with friend 1 who i had found before friend 2 and was sitting locked in an upstairs bathroom reading a book while all this was happening we walked for a full day before finding a house we were gonna call home but we discovered it didn t have a medicine cabinet so we left can t live without one shortly after sundown we arrived at a trailer park where we killed a single zombie inside a trailer and stayed there for the night friends 1 and 2 spent all night doing push ups and squats while i read and cooked us some stir fry in the morning we exited the trailer to discover a horde of 15 zombies in the front yard we ran back inside and climbed out a window on the back of the trailer to lose them but friend 2 had dropped most of her stuff to not be overweight while exercising so we circled around to the front of the trailer and attacked the zombies from behind we managed to take them all down without any of us getting hurt and retrieved friend 2 s loot from inside the trailer we had reached the edge of civilization so we headed back north into the suburbs by noon we had found a safe house to settle in that night i decide to loot the rest of the neighborhood before it gets dark friends 1 and 2 stay at the house i loot the first house without issue clearing out the few zombies inside i approach the second house on the street and open one of the windows i set off a house alarm i stand in the front yard to see if any zombies heard the alarm and are coming after 30 seconds i see 3 round the corner of the fence i breathe a sigh of relief and begin to fight the zombies after i take out the first one a group of 5 more zombies come around the corner then another 5 i think this is more than i can handle i should lead them away so they don t corner friends 1 and 2 as i run past the zombies in the direction they came from i pass the fence to see another 10 to 15 zombies shambling towards the alarm i get their attention and attempt to lead them into the woods to the north east after a few minutes of running in the woods i lose them i had been attempting to type to friends 1 and 2 during this time but was unknowingly on proximity text chat i walk through the woods to the fence behind our house and climb over into our backyard the next day me and friend 1 decide to go loot a storage facility we passed on day 2 but didn t loot because friend 2 was in agony from combined injuries and exercise fatigue and friend 1 was a bit sore half way to the storage facility we come across a group of 6 zombies only double what i had cleared on my own the previous day and far less than what we had taken out as a group so we engage only one of the zombies agro onto me and the other 5 go for friend 1 he gets overwhelmed and hit 3 times by the zombies i had knocked the one i was fighting to the ground so i shift my attention to helping friend 1 i pull 2 of them off him and get them to go after me but i back up into the first zombie and get hit from behind we then take out the zombies without any further injuries i perform a medical check on friend 1 and see he s hemorrhaging blood from a laceration on his throat i bandage his 3 lacerations before he bleeds out i then perform a check on myself and discover that the one and only injury i have sustained is a bite 100 chance of zombification knowing i have no hope for survival i soldier on to the storage facility hoping to at least find some useful supplies for my group before i inevitably die while friend 1 turns around to return home i arrive at the storage facility at the edge of the parking lot is a group of about 8 zombies they spot me i run past and book it to the first storage unit and attempt to open the door it s locked i go to the second locked the third locked as well i try the door of every unit on the outside of the building but they re all locked by this point i had attracted the attention of several other zombies and probably had 20 or more trailing behind me i try the front door of the building hoping that the storage units on the inside would be open the door is locked i circle the building and find another door it s also locked i spot on the other side of the small parking lot an office surely this will have something of value i open the window and climb in the only containers in the office are two filing cabinets with nothing in them a trash can with a garbage bag and a cockroach and a mini fridge i open the fridge and inside i find only 2 items a ham and some lard i climb out the back window with these spoils tucked safely away in a duffel bag i picked off one of the zombies i run all the way home and share what i found with friends 1 and 2 i leave all the items i found on the floor and set off into the woods in search of the zombies i had led out there i step on a stick and cut open the bottom of my bare foot i find the horde wandering through the thicket and stomp two of them to death with my bare bleeding disgusting dirt covered foot i m quickly overcome by the horde and consumed after racking up a total of 70 zombie kills in my short short life i die and that s the story of my first life in the game s multiplayer we continued playing after this but nothing else of interest happened apart from 2 occasions on my way back to the group i found a pair of zombies shambling along the side of a small gravel road i took them out with a frying pan i had found in my spawn house nothing seemed out of the ordinary about this encounter until i looted the corpses one of the corpses had nothing on them but several books a pen a keychain and the clothes on their back a name on the keychain identified this poor lost soul jonny johnson after i made it back to the group i returned the keychain to friend 1 so he would always have something to remember dear jonny by upon my return i discovered that friend 1 had taken my duffel bag from the floor of my bedroom where i left it and then as if without a second thought as to the value of it s contents discarded it upon the floor of the dining room i rescued the ham and lard and transported them safely to the fridge in conclusion this game is a lot of fun singleplayer and easily worth the 20 asking price although in my case it was bought for me by friend 2 but if you have friends willing to play it with you this game is truly magical and no other game in it s class can compare to level of drama and storytelling it provides i hope this review has encouraged you to buy this game or at least brought you some entertainment thank you for coming to my zedtalk
