2020 product received for free this is an mmorpg that doesn t really do a whole lot different than most other mmos where it shines is that it is fully voiced each class and gender has a unique voice and you get to experience them throughout the entire game the voice is continued into the expansions and each npc with a quest has their own fully voiced conversation it really pulls you into the game unfortunately the early campaign is dated the narrative is simple with choices that hardly matter except the imperial agent the first expansion isn t great but the farther you get the greater it gets the current quests are amazing it can be a bit of a trap to keep playing all the class stories level 1 50 but the game can feel extremely dull as you redo planets if you stick to one character and play through the whole game its much more fun you can get the direction the class story is going in the first few levels and can play around until you feel like dedicating to a character in short you have to get to newer content for the most fun and it can take a while to do so early levels are fun and the modern leveling system lets you be a high enough level just by completing main planetary and class based quests
