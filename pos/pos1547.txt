2019 update no 3 lolfor people who already own standard 2017 version you will be locked out from the new additional dlc that comes with 2019 game of the yohra edition valve character accessory retro red pot skin cardboard pod skin grimoire weiss pod retro grey pod skin machine mask accessoryand 2 wallpapers if you own only the game 2017 and didn t purchase dlc 3c3c1d119440927 for some reason and planning to buy dlc 3c3c1d119440927 for your game 2017 don t expect to get new additional content as i mentioned above that comes with 2019 game of the yohra edition it s a different build you will probably never receive new dlc for free even you have paid for the previous dlc 3c3c1d119440927 right now there is no way you can buy that new dlc that comes with 2019 version unless you find a way to delete nier automata from your library and re buy the game 2019 again classic square enix square enix didn t bother to separate the game to 2 version so it is still shown as nier automata the only thing that changed is banner or picture of this game on the right of the main page on steam try to add new 2019 in your cart it should be mentioned that you already own game of the yohra edition but not completely it s sad to see the lack of support from square enix disclaimer this is my experience as an owner of 2017 version as far as i know they are the same game that just got renamed and reduced the price so that means no performance and bugs fixing patch from 2017 to 2019 version update it seems that if you are already owned a 2017 version it s will automatically upgrade to 2019 game of the yohra edition not sure if this is a correct term anymore update 2 buying at your own risk it s 2019 yohra edition and everything stays the same since day one also the game isn t working properly i wish they could release a single patch that can improve performance issue on this game especially a game that is 2 years old after release around march 2017 it s like square enix doesn t know how to handle their pc port ff13 for example was a joke i like the game btw d i mean metal gear rising bayonetta and vanquish used similar or probably the same engine and they all run very smooth on my pc and to be honest platinum s engine isn t really well known for pushing your pc so hard like this game sega and konami did a great job on their pc ports the game itself is also full of bugs i have to save and restart the game frequently for instance resolution problem some enemies items npcs and your vehicle didn t show up during the mission at all you can fix those bugs by complete side quests in the same area to force the game to reset its main mission reload your previous save or even close the game you can complete the game for sure right now i m already unlocked all main ending but you might encounter with bugs while playing the game and i mean a lot lol do you really need to deal with this kind of stuff with this very high price game from 2017 i m from thailand and it s cost me 2190 and plus 490 bath on dlc or about 70 15 dollar i wish i live in america update 2019 yohra version cost about 39 9 us dollar all and all i really enjoy playing it with far mod at 1024x768 a great deal lol it s like the only resolution that can hit high 50 60 fps pls send help oh well let s see what they will do with the 2019 yohra edition update as far as i know it s the same game with a cheaper price and all dlcs were included if you have a high end pc you shouldn t have any problem at all except for bugs if you are a type of person who doesn t want to associate with installing mod to boost game performance or willing to deal with this extremely buggy game by running around the maps or closing it so many times then i m not sure whether i would recommend this game for you either upgrade your pc and dealing with bugs get a ps4 or xbox one version instead for people who are looking to buy 2019 game of the yohra edition i think you should be fine everything was included bugs as well if you are really planning to play this game on pc i highly recommend installing far mod to increase your frame rate and reduce a lot of issues significantly i not sure square enix will give platinum dev any budget to fix this port anymore it s been 2 years already they must move to a new project right just people from se who are working on this pc port it s like they run on their pc company like i9 gtx 2080ti and think the game runs smoothly no need further improvement at all lol i don t think console player would have any problem like this at all it s just pc port that i m sure you can decide whether you gonna buy this pc port or noti would recommend this game if you are a fan of yoko taro s works for me this pc port is barely functional but i want to support yoko taro his team as well as platinum game to create this masterpiece anyway so i will let it slide but too bad it s a square enix port t t sorry for my english
