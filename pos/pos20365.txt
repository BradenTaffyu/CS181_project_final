jesus this is good i mean up there playing with the big boys good perhaps the poker theme you don t need to know anything about poker helps the simplicity of playing but it s the amount of variables all cleverly and carefully delivered at exactly the right moment and how they keep progressing the game and your will to play just another game to be clear there is no actual gambling and it s not really poker either your addiction to this game will be to the mechanics so perfectly drip fed and the sheer playability and it is very very playable more ish like all the best deck builder games and arguably fighting to be the very best of them all
