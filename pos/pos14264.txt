2023 early access review this game is the video game embodiment of crystal meth i m not even kidding the first time you try to play you have no idea what the is happening but the more you play the more you get locked onto it minutes turn into hours that just disappear in the blink of an eye you start focusing on conveyor belts you start thinking of ways to set up massive space factories then as soon as you think you re done you unlock the next step and do it all over again and again and again you re going to get scattered like a junkie scratching at the furniture as your home planet looks like an absolute mess then you re going to look back and hate yourself you ll tear it all down and promise to do it properly next time so you do you ll spend 5 hours pulling apart everything you ve done and you start again what was previously a mish mash of conveyor belts everywhere now turns into carefully and meticulously planned logistic systems your planet has sections dedicated to individual materials you have become the alpha crystal meth addict and you will love it
