early access review stardew walked so fields of mistria could run i have over 300 hours on stardew and i consider it one of the best farming rpgs to date everything from bug catching tons of quests leveling up the town crafting armor or weapons tons of things to find for the museum character development is here my personal favourite thing is the customization you do not need to keep new clothes hairstyles etc in your inventory you just unlock it so you can access it everywhere without wasting chests etc trees and stumps respawn withen a day unless on your farm so you always have wood things unlock at a good pace oh and if you are not sold you can swim dive and jump i have played 68 9 hours in the last 2 weeks without getting bored or feeling like i hit a wall and the price is amazing
