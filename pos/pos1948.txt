i ve been playing this mmo though it s more like a co op rpg since launch on and off most of my hours aren t logged on steam and over the years i lost my original account i can safely say its a pretty good game honestly more people should give it a go the original eight storylines range from decent to insanely good mostly the sith empire duh and you can experience them for free with some restrictions on mechanics also if you re simply a star wars fan and want to experience probably the last piece of franchise lore that wasn t adapted for modern audiences this is it i need to add a disclaimer for new returning like myself players specifically to avoid any toxicity towards you dont ask me how i know it just look up gearing guides on youtube before going arena same for end game pve content like operations also check out stasie s guide if you re interested in gsf
