2016 overview utterly fantastic space simulation game i cannot recommend this game enough it has brought me hours of fun and has really managed to enable me to rediscover my personal passion for space exploration there are three main game modes career science and sandbox in career mode you take control of your own space program and must manage administrative financial and logistical aspects of your space program there is a detailed research system for unlocking new technologies to use in your spacecraft you will take contracts from various organizations earning money upon completion these contracts will get progressively more challenging and rewarding as you advance your space program in science mode you are free from the financial and administative burdens of career mode but are still faced with having to research technology for your spacecraft you progress along the tech tree by performing various science experiments on your home planet and various other celestial bodies with experiments performed in more distant and challenging environments granting more beneficial rewards in sandbox mode you are free to build and explore whatever you like and are not limited by any tech tree or financial limits positive aspects in dept and accurate space simulation with realistic physics and particularly noteworthy orbital mechanics very challenging and rewarding gameplay wide variety of celestial bodies to explore ability for player to choose from a selection of pre built spacecraft or construct their own using a very intricate construction system featuring a large variety of parts to choose from features unmanned probes aswell as spacecraft piloted by kerbals optional communications system for unmanned probes which require them to have a connection to mission control this adds an additional layer or difficulty and realism to the unmanned space program allowing for the construction of satellite communication networks around the star system excellent community large amounts of superb mods available very large explosions new features are still being added by the developers neutral aspects planets although very large are not realistically large celestial bodies are somewhat accurately extemely empty and desolate with few surface features apart from a few rocks or trees and a few easter eggs here and there does not feature any real form of pre made story though the player is free to make their own does not feature any online functionality or multiplayer has a very steep learning curve particularly for players with no previous knowledge of orbital mechanics or astrophysics though a wide variety of excellent tutorials easily available unfortunatley lacks steam workshop support as of the time of writing negative aspects not a particullarly good looking game personally i use a variety of mods which make the game look utterly beautiful forum kerbalspaceprogram com can have some performance issues when dealing with extremely large spacecraft significatly improved as of the 1 2 update some may consider the game to be a bit too expensive conclusion overall i would thoroughly recommend this game to anyone with an interest in space adventure or very large explosions in my opinion no other game can give you the same amazing feeling as when you first land kerbals on the moon mun this game has brought me so much fun and i simply love it
