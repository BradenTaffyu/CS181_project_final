2016 i ve owned this game since early access and enjoyed it however i was a bit disappointed in the lack of multiplayer i recently checked back in to see the progress in the game development and they now have a very stable and fleshed out co op and pvp mode the developers continue to update the game at a steady pace plague inc evolved and the original mobile version are good time killers for casual players but also very in depth for those who have a passion for strategy games i haven t played a rts game quite like it highly recommend
