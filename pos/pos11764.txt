2020 early access review 7 days to die is perfect in 7 different ways rivalling minecraft in a few categories and i m a diehard minecraft fan 1 it s got a of creation world options with the ability to create whole worlds prefabricated think age of empires world editing 2 it has a very interesting and unique crafting system incredibly expansive going toe to toe with minecraft in terms of science behind it and definitely in terms of individuality the paintbrush is a creative maniac s dream tool have the sturdiness of concrete blocks with the aesthetic of reinforced wood have fun 3 you have the ability to edit your world after you ve created it and spent time in it unlike minecraft where once you ve created it that s it no changes 4 there s a multitude of zombies to fend off obviously and you know how we all felt when left 4 dead 2 came out right f k the first one throw it in a volcano because 2 came in hot with brand new zombies and weapons and so does 7 days to die heaps of different zombies some standard some on fire some that spit goo at you and zombie animals you ve got zombie vultures wolves mountain lions boars and bears oh my and your average deer here and there 5 theydies and gentlethems the tool and weapons system i cannot stress how cool this whole shebang is get it it melds into the crafting system beautifully and you can repair both using different resources found throughout the world you want to build weapons from scratch you can want to make your own ammo you can want to knock down entire trees with a single swing you can are you ready for one of the most underrated bits of this whole game 6 modifications for your weapons and tools this is its own category because there s so much to unpack just in modifications first off there s certain groups of mods and you can t have more than 1 of the same mod on any tool or weapon no stacking up but on most tools and weapons you can add up to 4 modifications and you can remove them just as easily you can also dye your weapons and tools with any of the available dye colours found on the map have i mentioned clothing options i know it s the zombie apocalypse but don t you wanna look your damn finest when you finally eat there s clothing options for weather protection and standard armour protection you can dye these items too 7 vehicles and electricity errybody what a find this was for me had no idea until i was messing around in creative but the you can do with electricity you can stay alive for yonks and with the help of a workbench and a forge you can craft your very own 4x4 truck with it s own giant storage area travel faster than the speed of zombies in this stylish apocalypse beaut but if trucks aren t your style no fear they have motorcycles slightly faster than the truck smaller storage but easier to come and go and can fit most anywhere vehicles will not kill the zombie by itself but they will run them over and stun them temporarily edited to add as of 23 12 2023 truck will kill most single zombies not hordes drive away if you think your computer is beefy enough to handle it try ultra settings but be warned this game dummy thicc so if your teeth and ambition are bared be prepaaaaaaared i hope i ve helped make your decision making process at least 5 percent easier gib dis gaem monie gud gaem 10 10
