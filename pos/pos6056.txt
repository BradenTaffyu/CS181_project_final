2020 it s been difficult for me to express the joy this game has brought me my brother played a couple of the first ones way back in the day and the idea of micro managing toiletries and doing household chores never appealed to me i watched a let s play of a team of people seeing who can kill their sims the quickest and while i never really plan to be that cruel it still gave me a good look at the interface and it was the first time i thought hey that actually looks kind of fun sure enough i would go on to dump almost 90 hours on it within a week my back going out and having to stay home from work helped this endeavor it s still hard for me to explain why i love it so much in one way it caters to my inner character creation my mind has always been a character generator and i ve blogged and done short stories about my various characters throughout the years this game allows me to get into their heads a bit more and live their daily lives i have a powerful witch a naturalist islander a famous painter and dj a couple of adorable aliens and one character whom is essentially my self insert a woman i wish i could be she s a writer and made a surprisingly decent living dumping out blog posts reviews and a children s book about my childhood teddy bear if only it were all this easy in real life that really is the appeal isn t it i never thought of sims as a lifestyle simulator but here we are i wish i could go review each and every pack but i got a good chunk of them on sale through humble bundle but it went directly to origin so i can t directly review some of them i will say that if you re reading this and wondering seasons and magic are probably my top two favorite season adds weekly dynamic events that really help shuffle up your daily routine and get you out into the world properly strangerville adds a more point and click adventure style type game but act 3 brought in an irritating mechanic that forced me to rush through it i could go on all day about the packs but i ll save that for my actual blog i ll do a short dive into the gameplay as you might be aware you can create a sim or multiple i believe the max is eight i had trouble just managing four so most of my households stop at 3 and maybe a pet or two you can indeed manage their daily toiletries but i honestly cheat in some reward store perks that shut down the needs to eat and sleep and that has paid dividends into making the gameplay more enjoyable for me personally regardless i ve done non cheaty characters in solo or duo households and it can be managed once you get some of the basics down my aforementioned writer made a small living off of publishing her books and thus lacked a proper job for a while which in turn gave me a lot more time to manage her usual bodily functions i will admit i don t build any damn thing from scratch but thankfully there is an online in game gallery where you can sift through some of your favorite creations and just plop them instantly funds allowing the most i do is combine and slap together premade rooms and then just work on the decor and upgrade i never build anything myself because i just do not have the mind of an interior decorator one quick point of contention loading up the gallery destroys my bandwidth it freezes most of my computer s functions as it s loading it hasn t caused any crashes but my podcasts and youtube videos start having hiccups like an old skipping cd and it s very annoying beyond that everything else is a nitpick you can go on all day about ea s general business practices some of the packs can be seen as simple cash grabs and the upcoming star wars pack looks fun but i think it breaks the flow of the game somewhat all the same i ve adored this game and will be playing it for several weeks to come or at least until cyberpunk 2077 comes out i have more to say but as i mentioned i ll save it for my blog
