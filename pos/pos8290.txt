2022 many reviews are salty because it seems p2w but actually it s play to win you re not supposed to own every card in the game just focus on a few deck archtypes collect as many cards as you can by playing and getting the in game currency deconstruct the excess cards and craft the ones you are missing from the archtypes you re aiming for easy this is actually the best konami made yu gi oh game that focuses solely on dueling the minor flaws will be fixed in time but the game has solid potential and overall worth the time i wish to see more solo scenarios and events added to the game as well not only pvp also looking forward to tag duels and other special formats
