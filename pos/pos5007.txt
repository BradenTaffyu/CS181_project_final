2016 short version extremely broad at the cost of being very shalloware you a completionist if yes i insist you read this before purchasing if not you may want to read someone else s review like many others i feel that there should be a third option between thumbs up and down is it a bad game no absolutely not the world is well designed with lots and lots to explore nearly every building location has some mini story you can delve into it does have its charm for say the first 25 50 hours of gaming which to some is more than sufficient in reality though within that timespan you can only grasp the surface of everything fallout 4 offers attempting to experience as much of the world as possible will eventually lead to a lot of frustration and boredom you will start to notice how any choices you make have little to no impact on the world nothing remotely close to blowing up megaton in f3 dialogue is very bland with every option practically leading to the same outcome on top of that doing too many missions raises your level so high the game becomes obnoxiously simple starting from lvl 30 i played on survival not dying once besides the very rare surprise mini nuke finally i feel there s too little variety in monsters weapons environment and quests 95 involving fetch this or kill that why do i still recommend it you may ask well there s no denying i still managed to waste 230 hours on this game and enjoy myself from time to time ps that is the time it took for me to experience all endings and complete all side quests also again it is not a bad game per se if fallout 4 were a burger it would be a royale with cheese but no matter how tasty the burger may be eating it every day would get boring fast just like fallout 4 all in all it is too much of the same which limits the enjoyment and unmotivates you to try and complete the game in its entirety rating 6 5 10halwin s 100 completion recommendationdifficulty 1 10time 75 hours 40 extra for dlcs considering that all achievements can be earned while playing on the easiest difficulty setting and using console commands cheats does not disable them there is no difficulty what so ever in acquiring any of the achievements in fallout 4 most achievements are unlocked by completing the game in three of the four different endings saving at the right point in the main story will save you a lot of time the remaining may require certain perks or simply consume a lot of time to complete but overall it s a straightforward 100 edit updated for dlc
