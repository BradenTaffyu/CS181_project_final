2016 awesome world war ii strategy game it takes everything i loved about hearts of iron 3 and adds a bit more it took a while to get used to but it was totally worth investing the effort pros complete sandbox experience with optional historical focus play history as it was meant to go down or change it how you see fit any country is capable of adopting one of the 3 ideologies facism communism democracy in depth economy that cannot be ignored civilian population in every province that contribute to your total manpower you can t just keep recruiting troops to infinity eventually you run out if you re not careful tradable goods are vital for production diplomacy is vital being a big bully will get a huge coalition breathing down your neck at some point battlefield strategy is incredible there are so many ways you can either crush your enemy or get crushed stays true to the core concept the series was built on cons provincial supply system is sometimes really confusing the ai is probably a little bit stupid they tend to make very suicidal charges and will happily charge over a river into a mountain with a lvl 10 fort and fight to the death with their attack defense stat reduced to 0 they rarely realise when they re about to get surrounded and make little effort to surround your forces overall i love the game i give it 9 10 needs more boobs though
