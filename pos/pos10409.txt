2021 as a relative newcomer to sim racing i played about 110 hrs of f1 2020 and got a g29 wheel about halfway through that which was a game changer i had acc in my library for a while and finally tried it out it isn t nearly as beginner friendly as f1 but once you get in to it it is head and shoulders better even on the g29 the ffb is on another level i think a few big tips with this game are pick a car you like and a track you like and start slow the game will punish you for overcooking and once you start getting a feel for it know that tyre pressure is soooo important maintain it between 27 5 28 for gt3 and it will transform your car you dont need to fiddle with setups too much just use safe to start then aggressive once comfortable then build up to playing with it using youtube for racing line learning to trail brake and to feather the brake to shift the weight forward for tighter turn sheds seconds off your lap times i have recently started playing online and i am hooked consistency is everything online especially when you are new just make sure you build that safety rating up as much as possible before you begin this game is incredible immersive and with amazing sound and visuals of the driving games i have played it is by far the most realistic and satisfying when you piece together an awesome lap i would safely give it a 10 10
