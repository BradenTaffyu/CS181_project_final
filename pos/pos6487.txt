2017 a quick introductioni will start by adressing the elephant in the room yes the game has 2 steam awards and yes they are well deserverd by the game for being the amazing simulator that it is euro truck simulator 2 is not only a great experience that everyone can enjoy but also a masterpiece in its own right with such a large and active fanbase the game grew with the help of its community mods multiplayer new skins trucks etc besides the huge amount of content it has been given from the developers official content is still being added to the game to the current day be it in the form of patches expansions or bug fixes this makes my first point buying ets2 is a smart investment since the developers truly care about the game and continue to update it and listen to their fanbase i can make a quick prediction and say that ets2 will still have updates or expansions coming out for at least a year or two more after the writing of this review what exactly is euro truck simulator 2 gameplay ets2 is a truck driving simulator but not only that it places you into the position of the manager of an entire international delivery company the goal of the game even though most players will just say it s to relax or to have fun which is also true is actually to expand your company hire more drivers buy more trucks more garages and obtain the monopoly for deliveries in europe the game takes this simple concept and manages to add an astonishing complexity to it at first sight only because after the first 20 hours or less in game you ll realize that the gameplay is actually simple and enjoyable as the manager you can also make deliveries yourself which is how you will get your company up and running before you have the money to hire drivers to do that for you you will start by doing quick jobs for various employers with a truck given by them for the specific delivery and your first objective is to buy your own truck so you can start taking jobs from the freight market which get you more income once you get your own truck it s all yours you need to take good care of it repairing it refuelling it being careful not to get fined for your actions on the road and so on from that point onward it is your job to build a strong and succesful business as you do more deliveries and manage to get more experience both literally for leveling up and figuratively because you will learn the mechanics of the game better and better you will earn skill points with each level up there are a variety of skills to choose from including getting better pay for different types of jobs fragile cargo urgent deliveries adr deliveries valuable cargo less consumption of fuel or being able to deliver cargo across longer distances your employees also have skills a feature that on its own opens lots of possibilities for company management if the information here or on the store page doesn t quite answer all of your questions i ll tell you that there is also a demo for this game available to download on steam so you can try the game out but is it accurate driving mechanics before i start explaining the mechanics of the game please take note that i m not a truck driver and have never driven a truck before so excuse me if i don t have all of my facts straight from my 90 hours of playing the game at the time of writing this review i d say that the driving in this game is absolutely beautiful first of all the complexity of the mechanics is fully customizable so everyone from the newest player to the veteran trucker are able to enjoy the game the driving is relaxing be it day or night rain or sun highway or forest road because it doesn t require that much focusing but only as much as to not pass the speed limit to avoid other people in traffic and to not come tumbling off the road that gives you time to enjoy the wonderful scenes you ll pass by which i ll be talking about in the next section on board the truck you have every switch you need meaning headlights wipers the horns air regular light the handbrake the toggle for high beams for the beacon and the turning signals it has everything you would want and need from a proper simulator of real life driving so don t expect a truck racing game the only thing that is a tiny bit more difficult is the parking but there s also a solution for that the parking is skippable in every delivery while denying you a small amount of experience but as you gather more knowledge and start learning what s what parking should immediately become a breeze after a few hours of gameplay also going a little off topic you also have a radio you can upload your own playlist of music into the game and listen to it while on the road genius genius i say that s all well and good but how does it look graphics do not go into the game expecting it to look like it was made with unreal engine 32 the game came out a good amount of time ago i d even go as far as to call it a classic now heh and i can say it still looks decent to this day the in game world still is wonderful if you re willing to sit for a bit and think about how old the game is even if it doesn t have the latest graphics ets2 doesn t fail to impress making up for raw graphical power in great world design the landscapes in the game are beautiful and the vehicle models still manage to look good and blend into the environment perfectly giving the game a really special ambiance and relaxing potential it is easy to get immersed into the massive world and if you re not careful you can lose hours driving your virtual truck around as it happens to me quite often but if i were honest the question here is how good you can make it look as i have said before the game has such an active community and modders are no exception there are a variety of graphic mods to choose from both in the steam workshop and outside of it that do a wonderful job at enhancing your visual experience making the game not only graphically impressing but also making you want to get into the photo mode and snap some shots of your journey through ets2 s europe so did you enjoy it my personal experience the short answer would be yes absolutely but the answer worthy of this review is that i just spent so many hours into this game in which everything you basically do if we were to dumb it down to an extreme level is drive around and turn left or right at some points and i can t even explain why exactly ets2 just has a mesmerizing atmosphere to it making the game beautiful in its own way and being one of the most relaxing games i have and will ever play other simulators can t even get near its level except american truck simulator made by the same developers and based on the same concept because for me ets2 will always have that je ne sais quois that something which always makes me come back to it and do yet another delivery over and over again in other words everything about the game is enjoyable from the relaxing driving to the sweet feeling of getting another truck or further customzing your current one to the trance induced by the exquisite feeling of being alone with the road and for that euro truck simulator 2 wil always and forever have a special place in my heart conclusionif you are looking for a relaxing driving experience with various customization options a variety of trucks perfect world design mesmerizing atmosphere and most of all a detailed company management gameplay component then i am sure you will not regret buying this game if you need further convincing please do download the demo which is available on steam
