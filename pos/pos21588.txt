2021 forza horizon 5 is not a leap over the previous horizon game but considering that horizon 4 was already an excellent game it doesn t need to be it takes nearly everything that worked about horizon 4 and introduces a much larger more varied and overall better world to explore and some semblance of structure to its campaign progression the racing is as good as it s ever been the new horizon stories have some fun conceits and the expeditions while small in number and easily finished off in the opening hours of the game do sometimes slow down in ways the game doesn t usually foster it does carry over some ui issues from 4 however and as of the time of writng there are many issues regarding servers and performance still this is an excellent game that i m confident will keep me coming back for the next few years
