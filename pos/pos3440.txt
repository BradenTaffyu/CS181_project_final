2016 product received for free to be honest when i started to play undertale i had zero expectations and was sceptical for its hype friends whom played the game were like zomg when you re gonna play undertale you must do it 1 11 and when i replied dunno if i even want to oh man that was almost cardinal crime in their eyes however i never judging games before playing them hence adventure started and after beating probably all endings daaaamn i haven t been so impressed for ages but first things first let s analyze the game undertale is indie rpg more or less made just by one guy which is really impressive story isn t linear it changes by your playing decisions you made actually matters for every action there s consequences and that s why i love it battles are interesting basically it s bullet hell where you try to survive but worry not it s not so hard as it sounds well there are few exceptions but after learning pattern and with dose of determination you can do it the characters are so well written and have strong unique personalities makes you questioning moral principes not just in the game but in real life as well the best thing atleast in my opinion is soundtrack it s perfect for every situation which you encounter summary pros story decisions characters soundtrack battles morals within storycons only found one spoilers in genocide run some bosses died after one hit it s epic sure but c mon i expecting to had hard time with mettaton atleast also wish it could be a little longer my final verdict is 10 10 legendary game explenation there s no thing such as perfect game however this is closest thing what i found the story worthy of replaying it brutally changing by your action so you feel like you re playing totally different game and i love this concept so yea i finally understand why my friends were so obsessed thanks for checking the review stay determined
