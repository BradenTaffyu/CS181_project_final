2018 once upon a time stellaris was a simple game explore expand and exterminate if you wanted you had a lot of options when it came to designing your own race their government and their interaction with other races then came 2 0 there were a lot of broken mechanics were fixed and a lot of perfectly working mechanics were broken i think a lot of people lost interest in the game at that point including myself to some degree lots of people were upset about the complete overhaul of the war mechanics which still make no sense to this day along with the influence nerf that more or less removed the exponential feel of the game but it was also around this time that people discovered a new way to play the game instead of expanding as far as they could playing wide they built up what they had as much as they could playing tall the devs noticed this just recently 2 2 was released and stellaris is just as complicated and in depth as ever i still think the war system is unintuitive and difficult to work with but everything else has never been better stellaris is now more than the mindless build and conquer game that it used to be you now have more options than ever and the decisons you make have real consequences through its ups and downs this game is now higher than i ve ever seen it and i can only see it going even higher just remember if the devs make a mistake give them a little grace and just wait a couple months for them to flesh out the new system also if you re new look up online tutorials this game is amazing i promise
