2018 bottom line up front if you re willing to spend the effort on mods fallout 4 is one of the most atmospheric replayable and immersive role playing games available first let me note that your experience in this game will depend greatly on how you decide to arrange your toybox i play fallout 4 with all the downloadable content about two dozen mods in first person and on survival mode i ll explain below of the mods i use only about two or three are really necessary in my opinion so i ll touch briefly on those at the end fallout 4 is a single player role playing game set in an anachronistic alternate future in 2077 tense relations between china and the united states devolve into an apocalyptic nuclear exchange which has apparently destroyed all organized governments around the world this version of 2077 isn t a projection of 2018 rather it s more as if you d asked scientists in 1955 to describe a future 120 years ahead nuclear power reigns robots serve every house computers are essentially clunky 1980s machines rather than the slick items we have now and social ethics are definitely in the drive in movie and soda jerk era rather than the rich multicultural 21st century we experience today your player emerges from a vault a self sustaining fallout shelter 200 years after the war into a fragmented society gradually emerging from the ubiquitous chaos of the pre war era it s dangerous filled with mutated roaches and rodents bandit gangs and irradiated craters quickly you start to meet the inhabitants of boston and become involved in their lives and interactions you can travel with one of several companion npcs who will provide another perspective and some strong opinions on the world you re exploring in survival mode you ll need to eat drink and rest regularly or suffer increasing debility and you can only save your game when you sleep of course eating food lying around in the wasteland can be a bad idea so you ll need to be at least a decent cook and figure out a method of getting fresh water or you could find yourself with an infection or radiation poisoning exploration is exhilarating and daunting there are essentially no limits on where you can go the map is huge and contains a scaled down version of boston and its surrounding towns but you ll want to take it slowly at least on survival mode because the farther south you go the more deadly the creatures traps and automated defenses you can only save the game when you rest in a bed so haring off unprepared into the woods looking for loot will likely get you killed and lose that most precious commodity time but the good news is that as you go you discover settlements so you can build your own safe spots by breaking down all that junk you find in the wasteland and repurposing it into beds and lights and crops and generators and even better you can attract followers to your settlements who can help secure your precious safe zones and even act as vendors and doctors to assist you directly but you re always the protagonist you meet with multiple factions such as the noble but underfunded minutemen or the technophilic brotherhood of steel and they will test you and then eventually come to rely on you to advance their respective agendas there s real choices to be made however as all of the factions have competing goals which eventually put them in conflict with each other you can play as an ally of any of them or none gear and crafting are a major part of the game yes you have the usual paper doll figure that you can play dress up with various armor pieces guns and hats but each of those items comes in a very large variety and each particular weapon or armor fragment can be modified at settlement workbenches to improve or specialize them do you want an accurate sniper rifle which is slow heavy and hits like a truck or would you rather sacrifice some of the above for a multiround clip and better hipfire accuracy maybe you just want to hit them with a baseball bat if you can imagine it you can probably make it combat uses the unique system found only in the fallout series vats this allows you to pause in the middle of a fight and aim your weapon at specific body parts which in turns allows you to potentially disable your opponent or if you don t like the deliberate method then just hold down the trigger on your automatic rifle and shoot like a loon again it s your choice melee combat is unpolished and clunky when you re just swinging wildly but becomes satisfying when coupled with the stealth system character advancement uses familiar experience points and levels each level gives you a point to spend either increasing your core attributes strength endurance etc or adding or augmenting a perk perks give a wide variety of increases to abilities allowing you to pick locks more efficiently or shoot more painfully or resist damage the plot is very well paced letting you gradually uncover more of the story in the form of a mystery i refuse to spoil any part of it but i will tell you that the eventual answers are both surprising and satisfying in my opinion and evoke some real emotion what i like best i think is that your character at first appears to emerge during a random time in the post nuclear future but gradually you realize that you are a pivotal component in a time of major social upheaval in the commonwealth yes it s a game with good writing rejoice and be merry graphics are quite good especially if you ve added some selective mods i recommend against the official high resolution dlc which triples the game size and barely alters the look more importantly the arrangement of the game s artwork shines showing burned out urban centers quiet seaside vistas and glowing nuclear hellscapes to impress you when you first crest a hill and get a full viewing little stories emerge in every ruined house where you find a skeleton collapsed in a chair surrounded by cigarettes and beer bottles or a sealed bunker where automated inhabitants are like lost japanese soldiers from ww2 still living out the patterns they established centuries before sound is truly a treat with excellent ambient music diamond city radio plays a large selection of 1940s era music which is surprisingly appropriate for building the setting and there s even a classical station for the more contemplative among you i may review the dlcs separately but let me summarize by saying that the far harbor add on is outstanding in every way and the others add flavor and quirks worth exploring particularly on a second run through mods i ran out of space so please see the comments on mods to the game so after yet another long winded review let me summarize buy this game it s a classic and will introduce you to an alternate world with a rich history perfect for the stories it tells you ll have memories of epic battles disturbing discoveries and touching reunions and you can play it all again with a different character and have a whole new set of experiences
