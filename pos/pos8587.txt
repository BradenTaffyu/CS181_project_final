2021 i was looking for something that felt more on the casual side to play but with the environmental immersion akin to titles like tarkov basically big open environments in an fps context but without the enormous stress and anxiety involved i never thought in all my years i d find myself enamored with a hunting simulator but this really fits the bill for a comfortable game i m actually okay sinking hours into even if ultimately i don t actually end up successfully killing anything that s not what it s about to me i want to be able to get lost in the woods on irl rainy days or otherwise escape from the high energy monotony of city life this does it perfectly i m sure there s some meta gaming aspect if you re looking to min max things but that s not the function of a title like this to me personally i want to get lost in the woods and the hunting element is enough of a purpose driven aside that it holds my attention as a game more than conventional walking simulators it s the environmental immersion with something to do in addition if you need that extra hook great title honestly go for a walk watch animal behavior through binoculars maybe hunt something for a bit of a thrill but mostly just get lost in the woods
