2022 house flipper is a great game lots of content was added to the game during the last year when i first got the game it wasn t possible to place windows and doors wherever you want in the house you can do it now and that allows to improvise in house flipping way more you can modify inside of the houses a lot of course i wish there would be more things added to the game like building half walls from the floor and up adding stairs or modifying it more after flipping several homes i have a need for more diverse items or in a different color prints that aren t so in your face like skull huge flower or green triangle all over the bed sheet or a curtain i would like to see more single color and less flashy patterns so you can combine with more things for example beds and bed coverings pillows doors curtains curtains for big and tiny windows carpets without pattern or calm pattern in white black grey creme and other color workshop is a great place for many small items like for kitchen clothes magazines and books carpets have to say that dlcs are totally worth to buy i have tried hgtv and luxury so far these two are amazing each dlc has its own way of presenting homes and tasks that you have to do to unlock the house for purchase also each dlc adds different new items to the game and tasks sort of expose to you what is new in dlc and how you could use it while renovating house helps you to explore each dlc has different build of homes which adds even more possibilities to renovating houses so worth it didn t disappoint hopefully more homes will be added to those dlcs in the future waiting for house flipper 2 0 but hope that this game will continue to expand as well place for improvement it would be cool if you could place wall tiles just as fast as wallpapers in the game hand motion d cause it can get tedious if you have a big room and you choose to use tiles on the walls and ah it s so long to do that you decide to paint it instead d house flipper is the game where you can spend many hours renovating decorating and trying different styles thanks to the game creators that after completing the very first tasks in the main game it is possible to buy and renovate the rest of the homes without money struggle you can paint and paint over buy stuff and change thing around and in the end buyers will pay well it s not the game where you have to grind to just buy a lamp and you are afraid to play and be creative with renovating because you barely have money this game allows you to play and actually enjoy the process
