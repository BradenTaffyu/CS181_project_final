2023 hogwarts legacyreveliowow avalanche games not to be confused with the more famous avalanche studios really came through as a huge harry potter and wizarding world fan i honestly could not have imagined a more wonderful game based on this beloved property those initial trailers for the game got me really excited but if cyberpunk 2077 taught me anything it was that a heavy dose of scepticism is often required when it comes to these aaa games but gee golly did avalanche deliver you can see that hogwarts legacy was made by a team who really love and appreciate the property as much as any other fan hogwarts castle is massive and when i mean massive it s huge to explore the open world is also really gorgeous and captures the look and feel of the movies perfectly set at hogwarts in the 1800 s your character is a student who holds the key to an ancient secret that threatens to tear the wizarding world apart and for the most part the main plot is downright exciting to experience as a long time fan that end boss fight was one of the most intense fights i have ever had the pleasure of playing the games magical combat turns out to be deep and rewarding and the side quests are really quite brilliant most of them revolve around class mates that you befriend at the academy and some are really sweet while others are really bitter sweet depending on the decisions you make some are downright sad other side quests revolve around the classes you will attend where you will usually learn a valuable spell or two to add to your repertoire from a side quests point of view sebastian sallow s is particularly good i highly encourage any player to complete it as it really tells an emotionally engaging story i even loved poppy sweeting s story arc what a little sweet heart on her crusade to save all creatures from poachers and natsai natty onai who comes from zimbabwe south africa s neighbour and being african myself i could really identify with her proved to be a true friend in the end i was in gryffindor so i never got to see the other character side quests as each house has its own this was honestly one of the most enjoyable games i have ever played and that 150 million warner bros spent on the making of this game was really put to good use i mean hello it made over 850 million in its launch week the only issue is performance is a bit spotty especially in the castle but i got 95 of my field guide complete with lots of exploring of the open world map hence the 121 hours your playtime may vary so please don t let my duration put you off otherwise as a fan hogwarts legacy was an absolute pleasure to play and i highly recommend it one word or phrase to sum up the experiencefan tasticperformance bug related incidentsthe game does suffer from some performance issues especially in hogwarts castle but for the most part the game ran beautifully for me even in the more graphically demanding end game fights similar to gameshorizon zero dawn middle earth shadow of mordor immortals fenyx risingrating essential community created artwork for steam artwork by the dogfather essential games are games i would have normally scored within a range of 9 10 10 10
