2017 an absolutely beautiful experience one of the best games i ve played in a while and i m so happy that i have un earthed this gem the fighting mechanics are easy to use and executed fluidly for intense battles with difficulty levels that range for all players the game has multiple weapons that range from swords katanas power gauntlets spears etc which can be upgraded at your leisure not to mention the range of passive skills that change your character dramatically on your play style along with temporary buffs the music soundtracks are breath taking with each one just as epic as the last giving you the feel for the settings and characters which will touch your heart as you play it s truly a remarkable experience on the feels coaster the enemies are tough and rewarding to kill some stronger than others of course and ranging from multiple sizes each with their own fighting abilities with awesome boss fights which are challenging and fun to play throughout the game you will talk to various characters and their background history personality are all portrayed by great voice acting and plot you ll truly feel the feelings that character is feeling along with their motives there is a total of 26 endings so the replayability is endless and you will try to get as many possible each play through feels like a brand new experience which gives the feeling of playing the first time again besides the main quests there are loads of side quests and secret areas to keep you entertained i know some people love to explore and find there own adventure which is something this game encourages highly as you can get alot of cool items and abilities from the side quests and the hidden areas as you progress through the story more and more side quests will be unlocked you ll never run out of things to do considering my medium rig with a pretty low end processor i only get a few fps drops which mainly stays around the 50 60 area for me so the game is pretty well optimized in my opinion only problem at the moment is the resolution even in 1920x1080p it s not quite 1080p it s been drastically upscaled there are some work arounds like having it in windowed mode and so on but hopefully this is fixed in the next patch if you are struggling to get 60fps alot of the problems are around the anti aliasing option try turning this down or off and enabling vsync i know on alot of games vsync makes the game lag and in somecases un playable but this game does it right i highly recommend this game
