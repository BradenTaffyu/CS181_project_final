2023 the game is very fun but unpolished there s a framework for the best coh game to date but a lot of work is needed to get it there relic took coh2 from a disaster at launch to eventually a great game so i am hopeful it marries a lot of the best gameplay elements of coh1 and coh2 the early multiplayer balance seems ok and there s a lot of content within 4 factions and the campaigns the core gameplay is fundamentally very enjoyable which is what gives this game such large potential visual clarity seems to have improved a lot from the beta and game looks great and runs well for me on high settings however the overall sound design is far worse than previous games balance seems off and even encountered a bug with directional audio being reversed consistent grenade call outs is a step in the right direction but units seem to silently die off screen more regularly the most pressing issues to fix are all fairly minor but most of them are regressions for previous coh games so no excuse for them to still be here at launch the unique player colour palettes are nonsensical especially a close orange and red on opposite teams and the frequent mismatch with the blue red team colours is dumb menu ui seems unfinished and the lobby leader making changes kicks people out of the post game stats screen not being able to return to the stats screen ala coh2 is also strange seemingly there s still no starting position select nor arranged team grouping in automatches which makes queuing without a full team painful pings are too easy to miss yes ping spam in previous games was annoying but now they are actually hard to identify replays and observing not being in launch is concerning even if relic promises it is coming only 1 menu song will surely get very repetitive and devs should have learned not to make this mistake in mp games by now rebinding controls could be a lot more intuitive overall i recommend the game to coh fans as you will enjoy it casuals should maybe wait for a sale and updates
