2020 i had 150 hours before steami bought it for 8 bucks ban then and i can say that it was super worth it wastelanders is a huge upgrade in every aspect they even managed to fix major performance issues the game runs very smoothly now for me and also the graphical upgrade looks fantastic with the new update the game before it even with its big flaws was so entertaining to me the perk builds you can make almost infinite possibilities the interaction with players the community is amazing the building you can make your own home with settlers and customize everything in it the npc interactions are very good i am impressed the story so far is very interesting for me the world is huge and very beautiful something i want to also say is that people complain about the atomic shop but people always forget the game gives you a lot of atoms by just playing there is a lot of missions daily weekly and general that gives you atoms i think it s justified to have the atom shop its a live service game like destiny and other online games we are getting lots of free updates and the game lets you get the premium currency by just playing and yes fallout 1st should be a 3rd of its price or 10 bucks at maximum it costs way too much the stash should be much bigger in the base game mine is filled to the brim with crafting materials and ammo i can only have a handful of weapons because of lack of storage space even though i should probably sell some of the things i have my thoughts are the game is not perfect but its very fun to play still i can only say that one day this game will become great with all the updates coming my recommendation is for whoever got the game free from the steam transfer should play it and give it a shot and who doesn t have it should look for a key to buy for cheaper or wait for a steam sale
