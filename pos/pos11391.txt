2015 early access review this in development little gem really took me by surprise i expected it to be just like every other zombie survival out there in fact while it incorporates many of the features we ve come to expect in zombie and survival games it also introduces us to new features the smell of food attracting zombies zombies using their senses to find you being actively hunted not to mention an array of different zombies bloaters bloated zombies who spit poison ember zombies that catch you on fire if they hit you runners tree climbers etc the playing map is similar to minecraft in that it goes on forever and there are different biomes everything is breakable in game zombies can actually collapse houses by causing enough structural damage which they will do if they sense you but can t find you remember this is still in development so there are a few bugs clipping issues etc however this game has virtually unlimited potential and has won me over already
