2015 review written after completing all 5 episodes tl dr awesome story amazing and likeable characters a surreal emotional rollercoaster if you get attached to the characters would happily pay a lot more for the game coming from a gaming background with years of mostly multiplayer fps and mmorpg games life is strange still managed to be the game with which i identify myself the most with well written characters an interesting story and a lot of though decisions to make along the way the game really struck home to me emotionally life is strange puts you in the shoes of max caulfield a 18 year old aspiring photographer who returns to her hometown of arcadia bay after 5 years to study photography at blackwell academy the story initially appears to be the typical high school drama with pretty much every stereotype character in it but you soon realize that there s a lot more to it as the game progresses you are presented with a series of choices that may or may not alter the course of history personally i immediately resonated with max s personality from the start of ep 1 that made me care even more of what was happening to her throughout the story and urged me to really think through each and every decision that would affect her and her friends and believe me you will probably take a very long time to make up your mind in some of the decisions if you really care about the characters the relationship between max and her bff is heart warming to say the least i really enjoyed seeing their friendship re bloom after max s 5 year absence period in such a meaningful way after both being through all sorts of shenanigans and some horrific moments together the game shows you the pure core of their friendship and how much they really care about one another which i found beautiful probably because it s the type of relationship most of us would actually strive to have in our lives and probably only comes true in movies the story is complimented by amazing hand painted scenery it is clear that the devs put in a lot of effort to get the mood of each scene right from the lighting to the top notch voice acting it all comes into place nicely and don t get me started in the soundtrack i m mostly a hard rock and metal guy but i couldn t imagine a more perfect set of songs for this type of game the most emotionally intense scenes along with the soundtrack can t help but to get me teary eyed one of the minor negative aspects that most people mentions is the lip sync recent patches improved upon this issue and although it s not as good as the lip sync in tlou for example it is still pretty accurate with this all being said the season pass really is a bargain at 20 i would happily pay 3 times as much for it given all that i ve been through with max playing the game if you re still unsure about buying this i hope this review will convince you to do so you can also watch a playthrough of the game but i really advise you to experience the game on your own i watched a playthrough of ep 1 before buying it and it felt much more emmersive to make decisions on my own mention about ep5 ending spoilers ahead after reading a bunch of posts in reddit and the steam discussion forum it appears that there s a lot of people disappointed with the two possible endings the two main reasons are the many questions remaining unaddressed and the lack of actual consequence of all decisions made in the story ending as for the unanswered questions one may argue that it is a bad and lazy writing choice to let the player draw his her own conclusions but as someone on reddit said this game taught me that sometimes the journey is the goal not the destination and for me the journey blew all expectations as it hit me in more ways i would ever imagine with 2 months of waiting for the season finale a lot of speculation and theories on how would it all end probably led to a bigger disappointment when you realize some of the aspects we were all so intrigued about weren t addressed in the end as for the story endings the lack of more possible outcomes may feel like the story ends up being more linear as one would hope for after all the decisions made i m ok with both endings as they at least made sense to me and some people even saw it coming from day 1 however i was hoping the game would reveal what happaned with some of the other characters and hopefully provide a bit more closure nonetheless it was still a great ending as far as i m concerned
