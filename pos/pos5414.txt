2018 early access review for some sadistic reason i came to believe that playing with a character with hemophilia might be fun i mean look at those 4 extra mutation points selecting this negative trait grants you and the bleed will stop at some point right some extra points in endurence will make up for it so i also figured dual wielding is going to be fun carrying a torch in my left hand no thanks so let s spend some points on a extra set of arms actually wait i don t want to wield a torch in those either let s spend another point on night vision and ditch torches completely 4 daggers sound badass let s go cut people up so what do i do with those other poins let s see hmm puttign one in chimera sounds like a good idea the rest in unstable genotype that sounds like fun i mean the good ones are those costing more than 3 points each so every time i manage to roll one i sucessfully earned the difference for free one point left let s go spend it on some unusually thick fur then i can t roll it randomly increasing my chances for regeneration and fun stuff like that as for stats i put them all in strength agility endurance willpower and intelect screw ego who needs that soon i realized that papercuts actually kill people but i m stubborn after retrying 20 times i found some tricks to help survive bleeding trick no 1 meditation for some reason it stops bleeding instantly i just need to make sure i never get a bleed while it is on cooldown it also never states that my bleeding stops it just like vanishes so i kinda believe this is a bug but i found another trick that isn t bugusing trick no 2 cooking some cooking recipes are useful like watervine and any meat can be used for a recipe that gives you bleed resistance 8 12 which esentially cures your hemophilia with it i only bleed for about 5 6 turns instead of until dead so i rush butchery carbide chef harvesting in that order and i m golden there is also this other recipe i found which is useful too thirst at half rate whenever your hp falls below 20 of maxhp you gain 15 20 hpnow whenever i bleed i get healed periodically as that effect triggers each time when i drop below 20 hp i filled a few waterskins with my own blood figured that would be worth something then i realized my low ego won t enable me to sell that for a profit oh well i can pour it on myself if i ever catch fire so i am like lvl 10 and have uuhm 40 maxhp and can t be killed whatsoever they re gonna nerf this right cooking was introduced rather recently after all as i leveled up my unstable genome destabilized a couple of times and i picked up some new mutations likedouble muscled and heightened quickness the former gimps me a bit because i m all about getting a maximum of cuts in in a minimum of time on the other hand the latter mutation makes up for it and each hit i do get a roll to daze em so that might be okay too the extra strength also lets me carry more stuff which i hoard in my personal stash for selling later as i level i even get higher ego so even i might earn my daily water fresh water is the currency in caves of qud it s a pretty salty place i wonder if i can distill my blood for water hmm so i got myself two shiny carbonite daggers from tam s in exchange for some of my loot the two extra hands were using iron ones that i looted of my less fortunate opponents i headed to kyakuya to pick up a pivotal book with the cures for everything you never wanted to contract on my jolly way back i found me some madpoles i think they were called first time i meet those in any playthrough so far so i was thinking of introducing my daggers to them unfortunately those ain t fun fighting they cause me to bleed and the scent of bleed apparently turns them on so i kind of got my arm dismembered one of them four i had not to worry though i picked up regeneration earlier so it will grow back but i did worry about the carbonite dagger it was wielding if was on the floor so i picked it up in the meantime the madpoles continued their blood frenzy and took my other arm well i m stubborn it kinda ended with me killing two of the madpoles somehow and by somehow i mean i smacked them to death with my torso see they dismembered all my four arms my two legs and my beautiful face i then farted some sleeping gas i got another mutation for that to put the remaining madpoles to sleep and gather my belongings that i had dropped i probably lost a ton of blood too but that got dilluted in the water not that i care i have 3 full waterskins in my stash then i walked away i mean crawled away uhhm shuffled away let s call it that i also picked up my right arm how did i pick it up it s not like i had any other arm remaining with my mouth wait my face got dismembered too uh yeah anyway i shuffled back home stashed my loot and spent a few points on new skills dual wielding costs 300 points let s get that i have no arms but i can dual wield they will grow back i m sure i wonder if i can get a faceless discount at tam s
