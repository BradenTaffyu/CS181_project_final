2019 this game is work of bleeping genius perfect for the creative and or technical minded gamer for modders people interested in rockets and outer space and or just for fun playing around with physics and blowing things up basically its a sandbox solar system simulation with no story but rather different game modes the career mode helps to provide direction at first and is the most educational for space novices however soon after that its all up to you what you want to do career missions are optional though will help motivate you to push further and further or you can just do whatever you want in the default sandbox mode with all the technology unlocked the game is highly technical and doesnt hold your hand there are various tutorials and scenarios that can help but be prepared for a learning curve though at your own pace the physics aren t perfect and distances between objects in the games simulated mini solar system is tiny compared to reality but its still massive with plenty to do there are mods to make it more accurate and realistic scale and detail wise or to make it easier its completely up to the player as someone who has always been a casual sci fi fan and earthbound spaceman my whole life i think ksp has single handedly taught me more about how space travel works then school and books movies documentaries etc combined and also given me a far greater appreciation for the efforts of early space pioneers as well as the current space programs and companies by doing things practically you get to see and perform a lot of stuff that may otherwise just be concepts on paper and screen personally it has given me a far better fundamental understanding particularly and especially when it comes to orbits but in many other ways most of the time i enjoy just making ground vehicles planes drones sstos etc and testing them out i could go on about all the ways i enjoy ksp but in a nutshell it s just an awesome game and i honestly have so few criticisms that they seem irrelevant i would happily give it 10 10 and i m looking forward to playing ksp2
