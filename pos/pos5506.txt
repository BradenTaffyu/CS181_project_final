early access review a wonderfully deep and challenging game it has hundreds of meaningfully distinct builds and play styles which is the 1 most important aspect of the game for me a brutally challenging experience that pushes your creativity and planning to its limits if you want to succeed on permadeath while allowing casual players to succeed in the casual game mode the game is excellent at surprising you no matter how experienced you may feel i never feel like i am running out of content even compared to other roguelikes i personally spend a majority of my time modding the game it is extremely modular and the game is fantastic at capturing my imagination when it comes to adding new features
