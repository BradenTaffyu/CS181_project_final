2023 ok lets be clear this game is very good its fun its better than the civ games in my opinion building is very fun and the quests are fun too dont worry about the ubisoft launcher its annoying a little bit but its not a problem it doesnt cause ur pc to run hot or anything i know alot of games that do so if ur on the borderline of buying or not i would buy its worth
