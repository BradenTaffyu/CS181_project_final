2023 marvel snapi personally dislike games that make me feel like i have to spend money or grind a lot to get something that keeps me in the loop and marvel snap has been the only card game besides the early days of gwent that made me feel like spending money is an optional thing rather than a requirement if you want to spend hundreds of euros you can if you don t want to spend money you don t have to hence i think that marvel snap is one of the best card games out there at the moment it has it s ups and downs and certainly can feel a bit unfair at times but so does every card game that being said i ve played marvel snap for more than 400 hours and the somewhat fast paced quick matches is what keeps me hooked the whole process of acquiring cards is alright it s certainly not perfect but i prefer this system over a buying packs type of system when you start playing the game you will face some bots and people on your collection level which makes the whole early and mid game part of marvel snap fairly balanced as you progress through the collection levels you will realize how acquiring cards changes when you reach the mid to late game part of marvel snap there are plenty of guides and youtube videos out there that explain how this system works is marvel snap pay 2 win honestly probably not as much as other card games but if you want to spend money to get some cards quicker there are ways to do so but that doesn t necessarily mean that you will win more often than not just because you spend some money in the shop usually the best way to spend money if you want to spend money is buying the monthly season pass that gives you goodies like currencies cards variants and just has a good value in general besides that though there are regularly good bundles available in the shop as well but it has been harder to plan ahead since datamining upcoming bundles and cards has gotten harder upgrading and splitting cards which is the main way to progress in marvel snap is pretty fun and if you are keen on collecting cards and different variants with unqiue ish splits then this game might be worth to pick up it s free 2 play after all and if you don t try it you will never know if you end up liking it or not is the balancing good well as i ve said there are ups and downs and some cards might be stronger in certain metas but i think that the devs are generally trying to balance cards and metas as good as they can without killing a card entirely the soundtrack is pretty good and usually changes with each season which is a nice touch if you re interested in card games i would suggest you to try out marvel snap especially if you re into marvel in general and if you re not into marvel like me it s still worth to give it a shot because the gameplay is somewhat unique after all if you found this casual review helpful feel free to visit my curator page i usually write more serious reviews but sometimes enjoy writing the more simple or meme y ones
