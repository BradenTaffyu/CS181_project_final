2020 as a long time fan of management games especially industrial production line based management games i thought that there wouldn t be a game that would come close to factorio at least for a long time and how wrong i was oxygen not included had silently passed by my nose throughout it s early access phase so i bought it recently just after the release update of course i had heard of the game a couple of times but never enough to pique my interest i bought the game not knowing much about it which is actually quite unusual for me as i normally do quite extensive research on games i m interest in and boy was i in for a treat through my first 100 hours of playing the game i constantly learned about new stuff my first colony was abandoned after a couple of hours when i noticed my dupes duplicants dupes are the inhabitants of your colony in oni were running around in polluted oxygen totally stressed out with food poisoning germs running wild and important resources starting to run low because i couldn t foresee the coming problems it wasn t before a couple of failed colonies that i finally had a self sustaining base with closed loop bathrooms and showers food of higher grade than mush fry electrolyzer based oxygen production and lastly steel and plastic production nothing was particularly efficient and everything was very messy i poked a hole through the top of the asteroid to look into space and wonder how much more production i would need before i could start to explore this part of the game before quickly shutting the hole as i noticed oxygen was draining towards the vacuum of space and meteor showers threatened my dupes well being my analogies aside there are unbelievable many highly detailed systems that can engage anyone for many hours we got fluid gas simulation we got temperature simulation we got colony simulation including managing when and where your dupes work and when they spend time on recreation and sleeping we got day night cycles plant farming and critter ranching we automation systems with logic gates sensors switches etc the game is a lot like factorio and a lot not like factorio both games utilizes a gameplay loop where you manually start small then you automate which is done automatically in oni because of the dupes but can be expanded upon using the automation system then you expand and after enough expansion you revisit earlier production lines to increase the production so you can fulfill your new requirements where the two games really separate is oni s extremely pretty and cute graphics and humor where factorio takes a more clean and realistic graphic approach another big difference is the scale of production where factorio takes it to another level oni makes up for this with it s many different physics systems and extremely high detail this is not a game that makes factorio not worth playing nor the other way around they compliment each other very well and i am delighted that i have the opportunity to play both these amazing games closing off a pretty long review i would just like to say that i couldn t recommend this game more than i do even though the amazing developers are still working on updates to the game i think it is more or less perfect as it is buy it now 10 10 amazing game
