2022 god of war stands on its own its that good game of the decade the fights are as expected fantastic the attention to detail is unreal map is large enough game play smooth action video audio all near perfect weapons armour talismans etc can keep you mix and matching based on how you prefer to build your character encapsulating however what i particularly enjoyed and will always remember about this game is the character development kratos and atreus s journey is more than a mission to bash in the heads of the gods which there is plenty of it is really a road of self discovery they start off as strangers linked only through blood relation but at the end they are truly father and son it s beautiful i have played it twice once on give me a challenge and then on give me god of war i will play this game again and again in my life time so far its the best game i have ever played
