2022 early access review i got this game expecting ha ha funny destruction sandbox i got a lot more than i bargained for this game is one of the most criminally underrated titles i ve seen it uses it s gameplay medium to its fullest by encouraging you to think outside the box and figure out creative solutions to many problems it oozes style and is rendered in real time raytracing with phenomenal performance for just how gorgeous it is the humor in the plot gets me every time it has so many great things going for it this affordable price almost feels like a steal and that s before even considering the steam workshop i can t recommend this game enough please give it a chance
