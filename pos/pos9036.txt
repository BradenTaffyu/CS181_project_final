stellaris is a complex and deep strategy game that requires patience and the willingness to read the game is fill with humor and hidden gems the sheer amount of content is well beyond that of any game of this type that i have ever played much of it however requires reading and patience else it gets lost in rapid clicking and making random choices that lead the player to miss much of the best content within the graphics are excellent for this genre with high detailed craft species and planets as well as environment and effects with the interactions the audio is calm and relaxing though i do find the voice over to sometimes be annoying while helpful it starts to wear on the nerves to hear someone is attacking something every few seconds during a long war i am glad i am being notified but i wonder if a variance in notification would benefit over the same repeated warning for hundreds of times in that conflict the best part of the game can also be the worst depending on your play style the game can require a significant amount of micromanaging to get things just right while you can automate it and get things good enough from a new player point of view it is both overwhelming and exciting having learned a lot in my short time of 75 hours i am confident that much of the tedious and micromanaging will be far less in my next play through i am still in my first map game in short stellaris is a must have for those that enjoy the genre there is no game that comes to mind that does everything stellaris does nor does it as well this is the complete package for a 4x grand strategy game the more you are patient and willing to read the more you will enjoy this game
