2014 really good tower defence game with a long tutorial damn this game is good i m actually not that big of a fan of tower defence games but this games sucked me in an spat me out some hundred hours later and i still love it most people should know the game bye now but if you don t here is a short explanation what s it all aboutthe zombieapokalypse went down but you have some mutated plants that will protect you so you plant your yawn full of mutated plants which shoot the zombies and by that defend your home form them the first levels function as a tutorial where you protect your front yawn but later the zombies try to eat you bye getting in your back yawn or on your roof and with every level the zombies become more and more and you have to choose which plants to take into the level and where to plant them for max damage and stuff
