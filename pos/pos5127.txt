2016 edit 22 11 2017 still one of my favorite games of all time insanely fun every time i play and more so with content mods and a good enb olympus enb worth every hour i put into it and i suggest that you keep an eye on fallout 4 vr and skyrim vr doom vfr in the future upon ascending to the platform above vault 111 i remember seeing the beautiful world in a state of stupefaction i had expected that like the worlds of other fallout games the commonwealth would be a grotesque world of greys and browns yet i saw at once that this one was utterly different the commonwealth is as beautiful as skyrim the radiation storms of the glowing sea create lightning that dances in the distance as you circumvent deathclaws and supermutants entrenched in battle in the night formidable power armor equipped raiders shine their headlamps on boston s beaches looking out for mirelurks and ghouls and the impressive mass fusion building towers over all the world has true character it has been lovingly hand crafted and it simply feels right whether you are exploring corvega assembly plant various crash sites scattered around the commonwealth or the quincy ruins you ll find that each location seems to fit into the world perfectly bethesda s characters are solid many of them are outfitted with extensive dialogue and many are not but this creates realism players simply do not want every npc who walks by to relate their life stories and engage in a lengthy discussion i ve had characters who aren t members of any faction refuse to talk to me or trade solely because they didn t like me i was fine with that the gun and armor customization systems are truly impressive through them you will create mods that you actually want there is little filler in the game s entirety you can rename guns as well on that note the gunplay is utterly satisfying and is fun power armor is fantastic in this iteration near the beginning of the game you will be handed a set of weak low tech power armor and eventually you will work up to the likes of the x 01 suit and cool paint jobs and accessories for your gear concerning followers i have only played with dogmeat and piper but both have been awesome to work with it s fun to find bandanas and dog armor for dogmeat and piper has tons of dialogue that add to the game s character when we were at the third rail for example piper appeared quite jealous as i was talking to magnolia and would insert awkward comments into the conversation i have heard that other followers are excellent as well the story is phenomenal your actions throughout truly have an impact on the post story commonwealth after destroying the bos s prydwen and massacring everyone in the railroad their soldiers no longer patrol the commonwealth in fact institute coursers man the vertibirds now which is awesome and riding in the vertibirds is out of this world cool inon zur s fallout 4 score is one of my favorite soundtracks but even if you decide to turn off the music fallout 4 has a myriad of ambient insect bird and wind noises that truly make the world come alive what i did not like many of the buildings have incredibly ugly texturesthe inner city is poorly optimizedyou are often expected to play the good guy most of the dlc is not worth the price excluding far harbor mods that you should get war of the commonwealth endless warfare between npcs makes the world feel real vertibird overhaul ride vertibirds even if unaffiliated with bos true storms legendary edition better radiation storms rain snow fog what s more bethesda as of november 2016 is tweaking fallout 4 to make the entire experience available to play on virtual reality devices sometime in 2017 put simply fallout 4 is easily one of the best open world experiences ever created i heartily recommend this game
