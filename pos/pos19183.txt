2017 if i had to choose one game and one game only to play for the rest of my life fallout new vegas might be it this game has endless replay value four major faction storylines with around 5 other faction sidequest lines dozens upon dozens of sidequests dozens of unmarked quests in my hundreds of hours playing this on xbox i still haven t completed all of them over 188 locations not including unmarked locations 316 with the four major dlcs i still haven t discovered every one in a single playthrough as far as choices go this game remains unmatched dialouge gives you a dizzying array of choices and options on how to interect with characters solve problems complete quests etc weapon choice is equally endless and beats both fallout 3 and 4 in variation though admittingly many weapons are useless later in the game on top of that most weapons come with various mods you can collect throughout your exploration there s also dozens of unique weapons to add to your already stocked cabinet of firepower in terms of overall content this game is packed to the brim storywise this game is equally impressive without spoiling anything a simple revenge story turns into a complex 4 way war between the major factions with you at the center factions like caesar s legion new california republic mr house brotherhood of steel boomers great khans powder gangers white glove society and more await for you to meet them and decide their fates and quell their internal stuggles each also come with their own unique and interesting backstories my only real gripe with this game are the bugs this game is notorious for the amount of gamebreaking bugs it had on release the first set of patchnotes even excluded a description of all the quest script bugs it fixed well over 300 however several patches later many of the bugs are gone given how big this game is there are still many remaining but with access to unoffical patches and console commands on pc they aren t really a big problem if at all oh and by the way this game still boasts a big community of people still playing and making mods for this game not just graphics or weapon mods either some of the bigger ones are comparable to full blown dlc ghoulville is my favorite i ve played many rpgs throughout the years fallout 4 may be bigger skyrim more ambitious the witcher 3 more cinematic kotor more innovative but i can say without a shadow of a doubt fallout new vegas is the one you will get the most out of in terms of content storytelling and replayability if you re gonna get a fallout game get this one 10 10
