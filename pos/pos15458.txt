2021 this game is fairly realistic as someone who enjoys working on cars irl but still simplified enough to be enjoyable for a player who is not as mechanically inclined if you love cars made models of cars or even enjoyed playing with legos as a kid you will enjoy yourself playing this game 9 10 my personal rating of this game i work on cars as a hobby side hustle so there are things missing in this experience that you have to deal with in reality that i wish were in this game but i still think should be optional if a player does not wish for all the extra hassle i e wiring transmission parts and fluid magically all one piece differentials covers gears oil and otherwise magically all one piece brake lines and no process of having to bleed air and bad fluid from brake calipers and brake lines torquing the lug nuts once you put wheels back on tie rod alignment just to clarify that means specifically the tie rods more specifically tie rod thread count anyone who has changed a tie rod before will know what i am talking about i am not referring to wheel alignment which is in fact in the current game parking brake cables handles or shifter handles no gaskets no intake manifold gaskets exhaust manifold gaskets no head gaskets metal to metal and somehow everything is magically sealed no interior panels for doors no window motors regulators locks handle rods lock rods no dash instrument cluster no heater cores no hoses or lines for evap related parts cooling system or fuel no ball jointsand the interior stuff is kinda lackluster there is more to the interior of a car than seats benches and steering wheels in the future this game should let us customize the dashes the shifter the gauges the radio stereo the carpet floor material and color just a few ideas i had if the game had a bit more of these realistic aspects to it i would give it a rating closer to 10 as it stands it is an excellent game i ve put several hours into it within these last couple of weeks as of writing this review and i look forward to logging many more hours in this awesome experience especially if they release more dlc for all the different brands of vehicles out there so much content lotsa sexy cars lotsa fun
