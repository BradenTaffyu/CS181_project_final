2018 a very deep grand strategy game set in the period up to including and following world war 2 highly customisable with support for mods through steam workshop it has very indepth political military and diplomatic systems with the ability to fine tune your chosen nation to your liking you can turn fascist germany into a communist state the united states into a fascist dictatorship etc however clunky implementation of key systems such as military control and what i must argue is the worst tutorial ever does hamper enjoyment of the game for those new to the series and grand strategy in general my recommendation is if you have an interest and patience for a complex grand strategy with very little hand holding pick this up however if you re new to the genre i advise caution and recommend other entries such as paradox s own stellaris as a starting point
