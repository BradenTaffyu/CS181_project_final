2021 it s an alright game but there are still quite a lot of things to fix before it becomes truly amazing add back custom colours playing as the english in blue against the french in red is heresy truces something that allows players to build up before going to war tiered ships remember how in aoe2 ships could be upgraded to different types as you advanced now there s only three types of warship that you use from start to finish while we re on the topic improve performance on water maps optimisation is otherwise good but the difference in fps when panning over water is truly staggering five games into this series and we really need a go away ai partner button i ve already ragequit multiple times when playing a 2v2 against the ai because my partner decided that the best place to found his new city was in the middle of mine i am guessing a lot of these features are absent because of the multiplayer focus you can t pick colours because anything than the basic ones would confuse shoutcasters ranked players don t often play water maps so that aspect could be skimmed on and neglected and truces where no fighting happens for the first ten minutes of a game don t get many views on twitch or mixer i guess this problem extends to the campaigns which all have the battlefield 1 problem or basically being an extended tutorial where the arcade y rock paper scissors counter system is hammered into your skull to prepare you for ranked play it s remarkably cynical overall what holds aoe4 back from being a good game without need for further qualify that statement is the fact they stripped away many features all in the name of astroturfing this game into a big esports player which is a sad fact of life tentative score 6 10
