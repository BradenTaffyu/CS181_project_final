2015 early access review this game will not blow your mind with it s graphics or it s awesome multiplayer that s for sure however when it comes to survival project zomboid is the best you can get in no other game is survival so meticulous and so well thought out you ve seen hunger and thirst meters before you say sleep depravation is nothing new sickness exposure well you ve never seen it done right until you play project zomboid pz lets you try to survive in a zombie apocalypse and is even so kind as to let you choose the rules for your game how do you get infected do zombies run shamble or walk how much do they see or smell how long will you have power and water how common is loot and many other quirks that allow you to play how you want to play the map is huge and since the game is so mod friendly you ll never have to worry about growing tired of it while now there aren t many other maps out there there are a few and there will be more crafting professions day and night seasons building all there to help you survive vehicles and npcs on the works soonish this is the story of how you bought the best zombie game ever made
