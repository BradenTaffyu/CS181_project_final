2020 ok so i ll say right off of the bat that i m a big fan of rfactor 2 their tyre model tech physics real road system second to none it s pretty but not too pretty in some places not pretty enough but it s technically very sounds and is only missing a really good system simulation for the likes of gearboxes for example and there is still a couple of things missing from the tyre model when it comes to how the tyre interacts with ambient air but as far as a racing simulation is concerned it s the best their is that said what an absolute experience acc is the visuals the sound the feel the physics it s come a long way where rfactor 2 may give me the best simulation it feel incomplete due to it lacking good ui and tools multiplayer for example is not as simple as it should be to setup and even dealing with setups or tailoring a single player session isn t exactly a breeze to do properly most of the time acc feels more complete it s ui is on par with the likes project car visuals too the sound experience in this sim is definitely a high point the cockpit feels alive the sound sim for outside of the car really give you the information you need to provide position information to work out direction and distance very well and very consistently which is an absolute life saver when going 3 wide turn 1 at monza or perhaps when you run just that little bit wide towards the end of turn 17 at sebring as you decided not to listen to the well above par force feedback going through your hands you are in the car add to that a single player system that while a little lacking on the career side give the racers among us a good number of options for our play time ranging from practice sessions and race weekends all the way up to running your own offline championship there s definitely enough to keep you busy pair that with a mp player system that can run any race on any track in the game for as long as you like supported by day night cycle and pretty epic weather model this pairing does one thing in common though it encourages your to be a better driver whether online or offline whenever you take part in competition session your driving experience and skill is assessed and as you get better and better you unlock certain ratings that become very important to keep in check anyone who has ever had any experience in iracing will know safety rating and irating but in acc there are additional attributes that are scored to give you your friends or anyone on the platform an idea of the skill level of a driver these additional scores include the likes of trust earned by racing close with another racer including ai without making contact and keeping the exchange clean another is car control which is effected by how well you can remain in the control of the car you are driving this is effected also by how hard you are driving as well so being slow and careful not to spin out isn t necessarily encouraged here either there are others but these scores are used to ensure the right racers are getting in to the right competition essentially earning their right of passage to everything acc mp has to offer for those who want to compete it keeps people of similar mind sets and skill levels together pushing each other to race harder and be better something which occasionally and subtly pop up throughout the game while these ratings on the driver profile could easily be gamified it wasn t you have to earn the rating you need to get in to whatever competition you are aiming for but you also have to maintain that standard there s no end game here the feel of the game is very good too i would definitely put it up with the like of rfactor when it comes to the comprehensive force feedback information on hand the upgraded 5 point tyre model has also helped there but it s still not quite as good as rfactor 2 if i were to express this concisely i would say the following rfactor 2 s force feedback gives me everything i need to know from the suspension and the tyre s contact patch and the sheer amount of information coming from the tyre itself makes up the feeling of the tyre and is what makes up any blanks you get from just the road feeling you can really feel the tyre flex in rfactor 2 acc s force feedback does all of that except the feeling of the tyre but it s still sooooo gooood this is just another shining example alongside the likes of iracing rfactor 2 and automobilista of a racing simulator made by people who know racing know simulation and know us there aren t many of them on the market anymore despite how big the simulation market has become but it s almost always the ones that don t have simulator in their name that know how to do it better than the one s that use the word as a marketing tool don t you think this is the officially licenced gt blancpain game too so the latest tyre model information will regularly be added to the game with the annual car the next of which is happening quite soon actually to finish i ll say this this sim made me sweat in every single online race the sound and overall presentation of this sim while your racing hard and balancing on the edge of order and chaos really gets the blood pumping edit writing this for the steam mini game thing p
