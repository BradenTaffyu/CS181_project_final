2017 this game made me excited to play games again i love it 10 10 okay maybe not assigning a number score is useless anyway i will just be critical of this game and probably talk more about the things i dislike as opposed to the things i do everyone has already gushed enough about this game i think it is one the best rpgs of this generation but it s not perfect extremely open ended with lots of possible ways to approach a given objective encounter quest etc which opens up a lot of possible playstyles roleplay choices this however does introduce a lot of broken sh t the quest log being one glaring example and i have broken a few enounters by doing x when i should have done y first for some arcane reason characters are well written although all the fantasy cliches are there they are subversive to those tropes in places and each main character has a nicely rounded theme character arc writing in general is nuanced and mature serious in tone but not lacking in humour a la classic larian main quest has some interesting ideas and dynamics but kinda falls apart by the end of act 3 imo act 3 feels very endgame only for the main villian to pull out a dues ex machina lolz gotcha only played up to the begining of act 4 so who knows might redeem itself in the end combat is a little different from original sin 1 because of the inclusion of the armour system it prevents turn 1 cc deciding battles and i think it makes you think a bit more tactically during the initial turns but overall i think the system needs some improvements as your mindset going into each battle remains mainly the same and it also makes some builds pretty trash tanks phys ele hybrids etc i like saving throws in d d a hybrid system where for example armour values influenced saving throws would work better imo i am not a fan of the character development way too much number creep going to the next levels means each piece of gear is instantly outclassed gear isn t really that intersting just get some stats and maybe a free non unique skill vitality armour damage scale way too high and picking stats comes down picking whatever gives you the damage multipliers for your skills not really engaging or meaningful thankfully these points can be easily solved by using mods but mods don t influence my opinion on the design philosophy of the base game tactician mode is kinda busted maybe i need to git gud maybe my fun nice buildstm do not abuse mechanics enough classic mode gets too easy too quickly woe is me mods pls fix overall though this is on par with some of the best in the genre and larian should be commended for their ethical kickstarter development process the director has alluded to extra content in the future and has admitted to some flaws so thumbs up again
