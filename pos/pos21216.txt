2019 early access review disclaimer please keep in mind that tabs is still in development and gameplay is subject to change one of the most revolutionizing games of 2020 tabs achieves something that no other game can ever dream of the sheer volume of accuracy the battles players create in this game are so immense that not even the units themselves can keep their eyes from boggling around thinking about how much effort went into making a game such a masterpiece to the point where their bodies dance as they are flung into the air as if they are floating on clouds of totality and accuracy landfall has achieved something that a mortal mind cannot bear to imagine as the amount of knowledge received from this game will instantaneously both crush and explode your brain until your mortal self will evaporate from existence and into the heavens where you will look down upon the feeble bodies of mortality and laugh at those who will never stride to play this game and achieve godly power serious review the game is great that is all i can say although there are still numerous bugs within the game itself the developers are working hard to stomp these little annoyances out so thank you devs some upsides of this game would be the variety in unit styles and weapons another upside would be the amount of work dedicated to the updates although these come at a slow rate they are always rewarding in the end if you want more of a treat and this is for some detectives out there on steam you can always search for secret units that add spice to a battle also the way some units are generated are hilarious one will be a cyclops and the other will have 8 eyes some downsides would be the amount of bugs and the replay ability of this game as stated above the bugs are being worked on but they will appear and ruin the game for you which is not for the faint of heart after a handful of games you may get bored which is what the secret units are for but once you obtain all these secret units there really isn t much to play with afterwards overall promising game with a few annoyances but overall great
