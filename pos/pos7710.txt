2019 early access review probably the greatest car driving and crashing simulator ever madepositives large modding community multiplayer games regular updates even 6 years after release easy in game car modifications layout realistic enough to improve your understanding of cars hyper realistic physics enginei could go on these are the substantial pros more minor pros include a technical readout for your active vehicle huge controls list and ui guide and good tutorials both in game and online negatives interface continues to feel annoying and slow fairly demanding specs to run well with ai some of the developer included missions feel unfinished and sloppy seems to have a much bigger problem with fake mods that are trojans viruses online than with other games but this is avoidable using the in game repository takes a long time to perfect the controls especially with a keyboard for what it does have this game is fantastic i want to also re iterate that this is the only car racing car physics based game i actually have it proves to be and always has been a game of the highest echelon 2021 edit was to fix the grammar and make it less unreadable
