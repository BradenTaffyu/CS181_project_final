2013 what can you say about a mod that has about a million servers and infinite replay value with it s own workshop and fanbase well for starters this game has everything to offer due to its unbelieveable amount of mods and mod authors you want to blow things up go download a c4 charge and plant it in a fully destructable building if your computer can handle it want to watch youtube videos in a theatre go to a gmod theatre server want to live a life in a game go to a rp server want to roam around a nuclear wasteland filled with zombies and bandits go to a dayz server or another end of the world server want to play sherlock holmes and find the traitor among the innocent or be said traitor find a ttt server my point is you want something there s probably a mod for that if you have a friend that can play with you on a lan server or just a private server get creative in sandbox you could make something you could create scenarios you could pose some ragdolls for some funny or gruesome screenshots or even just send armies of rebels against two antlion guards the choice is yours overall this game gets an 8 out of ten from methe mod is the limit in this game but unless you have friends the servers can be hostile especially the ttt and darkrp servers you can get pretty paranoid in ttt and singleplayer is only so much fun you really need to be creative to find fun in singleplayer i m a bit on the un creative side so give the game a try yourself just make sure to bring a friend
