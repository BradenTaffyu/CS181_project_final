2019 dead cells have been one of the few games i ve bought unbundled in later years and it s been worth every penny of it and there are few games as original as dead cells it takes two great genres and combines it into a whole new game the deadly approach of rougelite and the open worldness of metroidvania with the ability to save your progress and not having to restart each game it s highly addictive and your first runs will last a few minutes and you ll think just one more and suddenly you re better and it ll last a little longer and suddenly days have gone by since the first time i ve played it they ve maintained the game exceptionally almost every new period i ve played there has been improvements or changes tweaks and a perfect game has become better and better as well as a whole new free expansion that was short but sweat extremely difficult but not actually required to play it unless you wanted more of a challenge if you like platformers rpg elements fighting games metroidvania and rougelites there are no other games that does it as well as dead cells you can play this game in so many ways rushing towards the exit or exploring every nook and cranny for secrets you can rush into enemies and slice them up or just drop two turrets and drink your coffee at the same time even if you find your style to play with you will play a different style each time and discover new ways to beat the game or combine your powers to make maximum damage and i m currently approaching 100 hours and still haven t seen the last two biomes of the game but still beaten the game plenty of times getting there playing with two boss cells out of five so it ll take a few more tries i guess there is no shortness of length in this game it will take you 5 minutes to die the first time and probably lots of hours until you ve properly beaten the game and by then they ve probably released new content to make you come back again nominated for labor of love award for 2019 since they haven t added the game of the century award yet next year not always a valid approach perform at your own risk and make sure to wear protection for coffee burns
