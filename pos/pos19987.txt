2016 summaryobsidian s fallout new vegas is the last good fallout game it features everything good out of fallout 3 features superior writing and a generally better feel reviewfallout new vegas otherwise known as fallout 3 that should have been imagine fallout 3 but with more meat a lot more meat i mean a mega ton more meat that s new vegas basically new vegas features better writing better plot more story better pacing more interesting side quests more weapons more interesting perks the re introduction of traits interesting factions and interesting locations new vegas manages to revive the feel of the classic fallout games by including fun interesting characters grimy locales and choice with consequences in the first few moments of the game you are given a number of choices that can influence how the rest of the introduction will play out for example the starting town of goodsprings is facing a problem with a gang known locally as the powder gangers merciless thugs that use a lot of dynamite you essentially have four choices help goodsprings help the powder gangers help no one or kill everyone but it s not so straight forwards as there are subtle ways to complete the quest without following the most obvious being to complete all the objectives i ll leave the rest for you to find the visuals are improved only slightly from the previous installment but they get the job done and can be easily improved using an enb filter the basic gameplay mechanics are the same but there are some improvements here and there the game shines with its writing proving that fallout isn t about the guns and loot as much as the story and characters new vegas is known for its large modding community and it has more files on nexus mods than fallout 3 they range from small tweaks as in the popular new vegas anti crash or as expansive as project nevada which changes the fundamental gameplay of new vegas adds new weapons and armors that are well balanced adds neat visual effects overhauls the stealth mechanic and more if you are a returning player of new vegas and haven t played in a while but are still looking for an interesting and immersive experience i recommend these following mods project nevada enhanced camera mod makes third person animations visable in first person check the ini nevada skies adds new weather affects like rain and sandstorms works well with interior lighting overhaul which changes the mood of all rooms in new vegas to be more realistic all of vegas uncut especially freeside open and the strip open enemy ai tactics npc healing just generally makes the ai better and more interesting plus optional ai healing eve new effects for explosives and energy weapons mtui and ohud mtui is just a more pc friendly hud set up with small fonts more room in menus etc ohud is a suite that includes imersive hud options hud disappears after a moment adjustable hud options and extra hud options hardcore needs clock etc wmx adds a bunch of new balanced weapon mods classic dialogue options doesn t tell you when you have a skill check in dialogue for immersion etc enhanced blood textures generally better and meatier looking blood pipboy 2500 mod it s not a big ugly pipboy neither a gay readius flashlight nvse adds a host of different flashlights for when nevada skies nights are scaring you away fallout 4 quickloot the only good thing to come out of fallout 4 conclusionwhere fallout 4 failed miserablely to capture the intangible essence of fallout the folks over at obsidian managed to craft a fantastic fallout game that is worthy of being placed alongside the classics
