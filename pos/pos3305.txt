2018 was a struggle start felt overpowered by everything gradually learned the game s secrets from other players through the forums first turn based rpg i ve played and each fight was really interesting a bit like chess because you had to carefully use your turns or the game would kick your sweet patootie the biggest weakness for me was the game didn t seem to keep up with the changing context eg you may have completed a mission in a particular way and characters in the game would still be talking to you about it as if you hadn t done it yet this is probably because the game provides so much freedom that the devs couldn t possibly predict what every player might choose in every instance the final fight was a bit of a fizzer i befriended the main villains so that they helped me fight the prime villain so that ended him relatively quickly and then it was pretty much over i didn t even have to kill the rest of them i don t really get the name of the game the divnity bit is obvious but what was the original sin and how was this different from the first game which i didn t play
