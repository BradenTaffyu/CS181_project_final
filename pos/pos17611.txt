2019 what some overly entitled users are failing to mention in their negative reviews aka the too much dlc babies is the sheer amount of content already available in the base game i bought it at launch and at no point did i feel it was lacking the factions are pompous or brutal and violent and all are full of personality they feel different the play different each one challenges the player to innovate unique strategies each faction has several commanders to choose from with a unique starting retinue choices for miles and content for days combat is fun and engaging and thoroughly entertaining to just watch dragons or giants ragdolling infantry men or orks on boars mowing down zombie hoards and epic lords dueling in the throng of combat the voice acting is spectacular and gives factions heroes that extra depth and robust presentation they deserve everything is completely over the top and i loved every bit of it ca did not withhold content from the base game to scum a few more dollars from us they earned my money by producing a gigantic and quality fantasy game that s staying true to the source material and they deserve what i ve paid
