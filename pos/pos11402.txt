2017 early access review one of the best zombie survival games in my opinion if building and fortifying your base to be zombie proof didn t sell you on this game already let me go ahead and tell ya that this is just the tip of the iceberg there s so many different features in this game that there is never a dull moment between the walking zombies running zombies red moon zombies dogs bears bees and lets not forget the players there is a thousand and one things roaming the wasteland trying to kill you so ya best keep checking your back because it s not safe out there unfortunately you are going to need some supplies if you re going to survive the horde that comes a knocking every seventh night so keep mining and looting abandoned buildings and maybe juuuuust maybe you might feel safe within that tiny little base of yours
