2020 in 2012 i finished f nv for the first time it took me a couple of months and a total of 115 hours to investigate every place complete quests and find rare loot and still i had 17 achievements missing until now i took a second trip to the wasteland this time completing the house questline and a third trip joining caesar s legion and a fourth supporting the republic surprisingly starting all over was not as hard as usual everytime there was so much more to discover there was rare loot there were new sidequests and there was so much well written storytelling every named character has a unique and deep story to tell and it all connects well and makes f nv a true gaming experience definitely worth the price and tons of mods available to make it even more enjoyable
