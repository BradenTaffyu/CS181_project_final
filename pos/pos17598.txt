2017 most of the negative reviews here complain about the dlc model and not the actual base game the base game however is phenomenal with 4 soon to be 5 highly diverse playable factions that are all wonderful to play creative assembly put a lot in the gorgeous unit models the campaign map and all of the lovely lore if you enjoy strategy games at all this is one of the best ever made i got this game for 12 on humble bundle but i would have gladly paid full price as for the dlc model simply put creating content takes a lot of money if you bought the models for tabletop you would easily spend hundreds of dollars on just one race the dlc is very good and more than worth the money in my oppinion and even if you dont get it the factions and new units will still be present for the ai to use in the campaign
