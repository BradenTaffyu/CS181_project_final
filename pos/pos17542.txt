2016 after 133 hours completing legendary greenskin and one week later im on the verge of breaking up with my 2 girlfriends losing my job and getting reported for a missing person this is my first ever steam game review i have been playing total war since shogun 1 i had great time playing rome 1 and shogun 2 im also a huge fan of warhammer since the days of dark omen i was excited when i got to know about this game just 6 months ago hated the fact that they had day 1 dlc every time i play a game on launch day i expect minor hiccups this game gave me black screen for the opening cinematic because i was using nvidia card this has been fixed with the game s hotfix and now game runs fine there were 3 crashes over 133 hours of game play when i tried to swap units between armies it was annoying then i realized one crash every two days for a week old game is not a huge issue at least it was not like rome 2 which was well u know what i like about this game is that all the units from different races are not reskins of each other unlike shogun 2 all the units of different races has their own stats and attributes i learned this the hard way when my armies which gave me decisive victories towards one race suffered crushing defeats at the hands of another race i could not mop the whole map with the same army composition however it could be the legendary setting since we suffer a huge penalty and the ai gains huge advantages even the slightest difference causes major set backs i was forced to go indepth in understanding each races units before creating a spesific army for each of them the economy of races are also done differently which is a cool thing what i didn t like is the multiplayer it is bare bones the set up for multiplayer game feels like it is from the 90s they could learn a lot more from shogun 2 where they had clans conquest map smart auto matchmaking and the coolest of all is creating your own avatar and equipping him with gears which drop after a battle is done each item has it s own stats and completing a particular set would give extra stats i had expected this from day 1 for warhammer since they had it in shogun 2 what surprised me is that the ai seems to be quite smart i had to fight a battle since i got outmanevoured by the ai ai had a huge army with weak warboss orc s general while i had a battered army with experienced warboss i had thought that i could try to win this battle by killing the ai s warboss with mine and the rest of his army would rout when the battle started that warboss did something no greenskin had done he stayed way back and did not engage me in melee that cupking coward my army was wiped out my warboss dead and his gear looted what didn t matter to me is the graphics im running on a budget card while the graphics aren t top notch but still it looked good when i zoomed in using the cinematic mode when you have to fight and command your army on the battlefield things like units details or grass details becomes negligible i switched to cinematic mode two times on battles that i knew i would definately win i wish that i had a high end gpu so i could watch the units in action bottomline this is a fantasy total war there is no history to follow other than from the lore of warhammer there is no tetsudo formation and such however units with shields automatically raise up their shields under missle fire this blocks 30 of incoming fire for orcs boyz while the goblins having smaller body and could cover their limbs better could block 50 of missle fires provided that they are facing the correct direction i think this automation is convinient and done in part so there would be less micomanagement due to the fact that our attention would be shifted to focus on casting magic and activating magical hero gears i believe only players who like both total war and warhammer lore would truly enjoy this game im not sure if i should make amends with my girlfriends or start a dwarf legendary campaign
