2017 i just want to get this out of the way first i had never played a paradox game prior to this now onto the review it took me about 2 days to finally buy this game as i saw it in my steam feed and i decided to watch videos and other types of media to find out about the game as at the time this would be a 40 investment in something i knew little about i decided to pay for it and oh my god was it worth it with 400 hours in the game i have gone back and forth with great times here is a pro and cons list pros plenty of gameplay my 400 hours explains that can be played with friends not necessary though intuitive warfare and gameplay easy to learn very difficult to mastercons plagued with bugs the game goes slower and slower as time goes on strange crashes explained later boring expansion for now the bugs in this game are insane sometimes i am playing with a friend and every minute we both need to re sync sometimes i would be playing by myself and i reach a late date in the game and i am at max speed and yet it feels like it takes years for a single day to pass another very triggering problem is that recently i have tried to play as the soviet union but everytime i select my navy the game crashes like what one last issue is the together for victory dlc is complety useless don t buy it unless you are diehard in the current state of the game i would give it an 8 5 i really wish i could rate it higher but right now the crashes bugs and low content level as of late give it the 8 and a half
