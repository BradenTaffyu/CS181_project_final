early access review having been in the auto industry most of my life and this game is good bolt sizes are well wrong for real cars but it is a fun simulator i got this over wrench and pretty happy i did i love poo cars and loved wrenching in rl but lost the use of hands shoulders so this is my sub i like base aspects of the game but the mods will really flesh it out to feel more at home i would say this game is really a good basics learning tool for cars finnish cursing addiction issues and looking both ways before crossing the street excellent seat belt reminder too i kinda wish they had included more than one car to build bur after looking at some of the files i understand that was alot of work for the dev however if you want to know what it is like to be a car loving teenager with loose restrictions on your life this is great
