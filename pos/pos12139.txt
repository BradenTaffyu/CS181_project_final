2018 iracing is probably one of the best racing simulators out there i have felt the same adrenaline competing in iracing that i have experienced in real life karting it is an incredible racing experience i have shared the tracks in iracing with real life drivers such as rubens barichello stoffel vandoorne among others this simulator is sure to be a remarkable experience in your life it can be quite expensive you have to buy tracks and cars and pay a monthly fee for the service and servers and it is a very difficult simulator however the emotions and pleasure you will find on track especially in events such as indy 500 endurance races 6h 12h and 24h pays it off do not try this simulator without a decent steering wheel with force feedback this is one of the requirments if you love car racing this is definetly a must play simulator all the others will just look like video game after this one d enjoy
