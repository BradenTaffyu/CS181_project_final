2020 medieval simulatormount blade warband is a game in which we create our own character and then appear in a world called calradia from that moment on we are on our own and can choose the path we want to follow we can become a tradesman a mercenary a knight and if we have greater ambitions then even a king the game is divided into two parts the first one is the world map on which we move our whole squad and in a later phase of the game even the whole army thanks to the world map we can move between cities and also meet during our journey the rulers of different kingdoms of course on our way we often meet bandits who will want to rob us and take us prisoner the second is to move only in your own character we can experience this when we get to a town or village we can move there without the army and talk to different characters we will also take part in the fight ourselves although the army will fight with us we will mainly worry about our own lives the game offers us a large arsenal of weapons and a lot of armour of course the better the equipment the more we have to spend on it we can collect the money in different ways the easiest way is to attack the weaker bandits and then sell their equipment we can also buy goods cheaper in one city and then sell them more expensive in another a good way to make a big profit is to gather a large army join one of the kingdoms and then attack other rulers take them into captivity and sell them to an enemy country with a large army we can also deal with the plundering of villages because it also brings a big profit or attacking caravans summarymount blade warband is probably the best medieval simulator i ever played now there is of course a newer version bannerlord but it is in early access phase so it has a lot of bugs i ve spent over 70 hours on steam in this game and the second so much outside steam and i can safely say that the game is really good in addition there are a lot of good mods in the workshop that add variety to the game the big world we can take our own path of development getting to power is difficult it s not a simple game the possibility of creating a great army playability there is no even a short story the graphics are ugly everyone will say that without mods he gets bored quite quicklyrating 8 5 10 follow my curator for more reviews attention please note that this is only my evaluation and opinion of the game if you do not agree with it or think that the game deserves a higher or lower rating please leave a comment and i will be happy to respond
