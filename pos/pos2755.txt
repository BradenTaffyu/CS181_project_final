2019 i have just finished my first run and i don t know what to do with my life anymore this game is this good i wish i could reset my memories just to play again from the beginning and be as amazed as i am now 10 10divinity original sin 2 is a classic turn based rpg in which you play and control a party of up to four characters there are seven different characters available and each of them has its unique background you can play as one of them or have your own build pros great story it is intense and always surprising the personal stories of your companions are beautiful i only did sebille ifan fane and the red prince but will explore the others soon the maps are huuuge very detailed and full of little secrets at some point you gain the ability to redistribute your stat points so you are free to experiment with many different combinations and powers anytime you want the combat system is similar to that of d os 1 so it could help those who have already played it but at the same time it is different enough to feel fresh and new main changes are about the aps the armour the high low position and how characters are affected by different statuses i liked the last one in particular since the success fail is not dermined by a percentage of success anymore and has more sense i appreciate that they were able to give us a complex and detailed story while keeping lighter the reading time i rember that in the first d os there were looong sections of the game in which your character had to listen other characters explain what was going on and on the long run it was a bit boring the ai of your companions is so much better that that of d os 1 and they do not commit suicide in poison or fire puddles anymore arhu and jahan i have spent almost 200 hrs on this game yet i am sure that in my second playthorugh i will discover a lot of new things mixed i think that the soundtrack of the first game was better but this was not bad even if you select a combat formation sometimes your party members go in random places at the beginning of a battle i struggled to keep that squirrel alive for nothing still i love quercus i had to look up at some walkthroughs because at times i could not understand what to do where to go next some battles can be really hard to beat even in classic mode second easiest difficulty setting i also tried to begin the game in tactitian mode but for a first gameplay it was too much for me i ll try again later con the crafting is as confusing as it can be hated it i admit that it may be a personal problem i really wished the inventory management had been improved from d os 1 but it wasn t they only added the possibility to mark all the stuff you don t want to keep in order to sell it in one go and this was a very nice thing to have but for the rest it was almost the same i need to be able to select multiple items at a time so i can give them all to my packmule in one go please god i think i spent hours just dragging one item at a time from one character to another tl dr if you like the genre this game is an absolut must also it is not necessary to play d os 1 but it will help you understand some things and it is a great game as well
