2016 i have spent 3 years playing this game since the alpha release i have over 1500 hours on it arma 3 teaches you a lot of things but the most important one is that anything over 10 fps is considered playable no matter how good gpu you have unless you have an intel i7 somethingx you will be darn lucky if you reach 60 fps on multiplayer be aware that singleplayer performance has a big big difference from the multiplayer one but still aside that i can t describe the amount of fun i had having with this game especially tactical operations with 40 people is just plain perfection if you are into military war games i heavily suggest you to get arma 3 you will not be disappointed
