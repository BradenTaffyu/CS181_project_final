2018 early access review this game is easily one of the best post apocalyptic zombie survival games out there dont be fooled by the cute isometric graphics this game is awesome for the price they are asking it s so damn cheap i bought it twice once for me and another for a friend i play with dthis review is focusing on multiplayer which is awesome rather than sp pros zomboid when combined with the right mods is uber fun to play with friends and has a cool non toxic community i recommend playing with friends as this has way more replay value than sp perma death means you actually care about your character and fear death huge fun crafting and building system with large economy cars to get around the map were added the devs make regular updates i purchased this game last year and in this time i have seen huge improvements the devs are awesome co op play online is my favourite workshop mods mods are really easy and straight forward to install from steam workshop a cool design it yourself sandbox creater build your server with hundreds of settings that can be adjusted to customize your play style and world devs are cool enough to allow modders to help them with development of their game they are community driven cons regular updates although its also a part of the pros it means mods have to be updated by modders and sometimes mods may stop working as a result my game right now runs perfect with little or no performance issues in the past there were issues but they have and continue to correct them visible clothing and armor please i know theres a mod but its outdated d i can t honestly think of any more here are 3 mods i highly reccomend hydrocraft a must for in game items and crafting and much more orgm excellent gun mods cheat menu self explanatory
