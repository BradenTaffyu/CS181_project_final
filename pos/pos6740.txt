2019 this game was completely new territory for me i ve never been tempted by trucks nor lured by logistics and driving is one of life s necessities which brings no great joy to me however curiosity and the winter sale conspired to cause me to try the free demo a week or two ago and since then i ve been moved to buy both games and all the map content for them the driving model is just right to make hauling along a pleasing process there s enough skill involved to reward focus but it s sufficiently accessible to allow relaxing absorption of atmosphere the scale and time compression is tuned to make each delivery an achievable task without tedium setting in i can imagine it would get old fast if your focus was to build your empire as fast as possible but i can recommend the game for those who feel they could enjoy the figurative and literal simulated journey once you get the hang of maneuvering with a trailer it can be very pleasing to steer into a tight spot for a little extra xp i confess though at the moment when there is more than one segment to my trailer i m hopeless the visuals are pretty nice and whilst not cutting edge stuff create an atmospheric experience the game s relative simplicity also leads to good performance even on a modest computer setup my main criticism would be with the way junctions are modelled it feels like far too often that there is no slip road and the inside lane becomes the exit lane causing the carriageway to lose a lane for the duration i sometimes find myself taken by surprise the satnav will exacerbate things a little by telling you to go straight on when it means continue in the current lane and exit a nice touch however is that the traffic does seem to respond to use of indicators some but not all will pay attention and hang back to let you in i m glad that they re not just an aesthetic touch for realism enthusiasts ultimately i d recommend anyone who is curious to try the demo you may be pleasantly surprised
