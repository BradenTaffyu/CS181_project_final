2023 this is my comfort game no matter how hard a day i had at work i always can come home to 76 to vent by punching a radiation zombie in the face with a power fist showering new players in stim packs and supplies or losing myself for hours with the base building the camp building system also allowed me to fairly faithfully recreate my grandmother s house after she passed away in 2021 and has helped me grieve whenever days get really rough i can go to her house and sit down in her living room again no other game has helped me like fallout 76 and i just wish it had a better reputation than it has
