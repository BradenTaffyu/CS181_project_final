2020 iracing is trying to offer a professional grade simulator tool for all levels of drivers to pursue some sort of virtual career their pricing model is aimed towards people who have already spent thousands on a simulator cockpit and can justify spending a few hundred on a service that hopefully will continue to be around for many years to come iracing has problems though safety penalty system isn t perfect the company transparency is very poor and they do not take criticism very well and the community prior to the covid sim racing boom was extremely elitist and all stood by the idea of harder to drive more sim often you ll hear people complain about their tire model which is an extremely ambitious 10 year long project to attempt to create physically modeled tire systems that when completed should function more realistically than the empirical models used in games like ac in some cars their tire model is superior to what else is offered in the market however there are still a lot of cars with very poor characteristics especially in slip angle and regarding heat performance the biggest issue with their tire model is that you ll often find it takes a lot longer to get comfortable with a car than it would in acc because they are harder to drive the reason you buy into iracing and accept their incredibly steep prices is for what they have established in the simracing community they ve been around for 12 years offering the best multiplayer system available and it doesn t seem like anyone is trying to challenge them you don t buy iracing as a hotlap simulator as there are far better offerings available but for online they re completely unrivaled overall iracing is alright lots of room to improve pricing is a total scam but it s good for the hardcore enthusiast who wants a more serious environment with a substantial community and good variety of organized racing disciplines
