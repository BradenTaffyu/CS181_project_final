2018 there was a fallen empire called the hantak protectors that awoke and they were like were gona bring peace to the galaxy no more wars i was like i agree with your ideals awakened empire but i want to be the sheriff of the galaxy i wana take these guys down and be the new big shot in this galaxy im significantly weaker than the empire but the strongest new race in the galaxy there was another fallen empire across the map called the rek thalar forerunners they were just hanging out in their territory minding there own business so i concoted a little scheme i conctacted the forerunners and insulted them a few times i was like suck our nuts my people were squirrels the forerunners were like we dont like acorns and were gona teach you a lesson in humility and they delared war on me so they start traveling across the galaxy to beat my face in they would have before they can get to me the protectors are like we said no wars and the forerunners are like your not the boss of me the protectors declare war on the forerunners and chaos insues stellaris calls it a war in heaven something i thought i would share not out of importance just because it is amazingly badass most of the smaller empires in the galaxy join the conflict on one side or the other it was a long and bloody conflict that destroyes many of these empires proving my tactical genius yet again i took full advantage of this war i ended up in full contol of three previously independent empires and partly in control of the now destroyed forerunner s systems using my conquests i was able to become the most powerful empire in the galaxy within a few years a while after that i was able to defeat the protectors and become the most powerful empire in the galaxy long live the scyldari republic reading this back through i am realizing this was a little more devious than i first thought i tricked a benevolent empire that only wanted peace in the galaxy into protecting me in a war i could not win and actually started not technically though but i told the other guys to frig off i then took adavantage of this to dethrone the benevolent empire and take their place i am pretty good though to my new subjects so it ended well citizens i should say i am a republic for now oh and in another game my people basically became space wizards and i decided to play a smaller game with only a few other empires as race of robots that hated biotic life so i exterminted a few empires of people the last three remaining empires were able to unite an beat me back though and i actually found myself rooting for them in the end lost that one fair and square and i wasnt too mad about it anyway i fully recomend this game
