2022 early access review absolutely amazing game i love the progression and items you and your friends can strive to build as well as expanding your raft the story islands are interesting and i like that the only ai on them are enemies i feel this works best as if there were ai people that you could talk to it would remove that feeling of independent progression and survival knowing that you or you and your friends are the only humanoids on this flooded world really interests me it is such a relaxing and fun game can t wait for the next chapter
