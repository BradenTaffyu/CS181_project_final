2018 your role within the world now serves a different purpose the map design has your character initially descending into the depths of the world instead of ascending higher non player character roles are subverted with initially kind friendly characters not quite what they seem from the start dark souls 3 is all about lulling you into a false sense of security this is carried through in the way the maps are designed initial areas are fairly straightforward to walk through and the game kicks off relatively linear with your character warping from a demon s souls like hub however once you venture from the simplicity and ease of the first few areas the game starts to branch out with unprecedented depth and complexity while dark souls 3 s changes in map design and difficulty spikes play with your expectations the boss phase system in some fights seem incredibly unfair in the latter portions of the game the difficulty in some bosses stops coming from pattern recognition and instead from regenerating health and resurrections thankfully this is limited to just a few bosses in the game rather than the majority which are brilliantly designed while the original dark souls remains a legendary game dark souls 3 is a worthy successor to the name the good rich lore excellent exploration rewarding challenge great level design thrilling combatthe bad framerate inconsistent lock on9 10disaster bad mediocre okay good great amazing masterpiece
