2018 this is the ultimate zen game i can t get my finger on it i do not have any connection with trucks in real life neither with cars highways driving or anything related to the theme of this game but still it s great fun i almost strictly play rogue games and turn based strategy games the gameplay is very rewarding since you can unlock all kind of new parts on your way it s realistic but not so much that the gameplay suffers from it it s diverse since you can explore almost whole europe i really want to see romania in it and you have access to hundreds of ingame or via internet radio stations that you normally won t listen to france hip hop stations polish folklore etc it s just very streamlined looks very beautiful runs on almost every pc cost only 5 euro with steam sales now won multiple rewards and all is perfectly fine for me this is the ultimate relaxing experience for those moments you want to try something else
