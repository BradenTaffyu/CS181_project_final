2020 after getting every achievement in this game beating every scenario on survivor difficulty i can firmly say frostpunk is my favorite strategy game of all time i cannot recommend it enough the reason why it s so good is because the developers found a way to keep each game interesting as it progresses with events with choices how the weather changes requires you to keep up with resource and heat generation and all that each game i play never has a dull moment in other building simulation games i always find that you hit a point in the game where you research everything and the game kind of plateaus and the game gets boring that never happens in frostpunk except in endless of course and that s really the core element of why it s my favorite game
