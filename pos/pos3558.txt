2016 product received for free i decided to go back and give this game a more serious review because it really deserves it i ended up getting this game in november around thanksgiving of last year and ever since i ve still enjoyed it to this day undertale is a game that revolves around a choice system and the choices you make end up varying the game s ending as you might have heard there s 3 main endings a neutral run a pacifist run and a genocide run it follows a sort of puzzle rpg styles while also having a bullet hell style mechanic for combat which i ended up enjoying figuring out how to spare certain characters was a good part of the game for me and it was pretty interesting of course the plot is incredibly well written at the surface it isn t anything too special but going deep into it especially when you do the pacifist genocide runs there s a lot of twists and turns throughout the game that i won t spoil to keep it s integrity with the different runs and endings of the game combined with the fun puzzle rpg bullet hell gameplay i was able to go back to this game plenty of times since getting it and to be quite frank i don t regret it while there are games i still enjoy going back to and playing this is probably the first that s ever had a real impact on me and given me something to follow sure the fanbase can be pretty trashy and the game s pretty much everywhere at this point but if you don t let that spoil the experience for you then i can easily recommend picking this one up it s an easy 10 10 from me with the only real complaint i have being the visuals p s alphys is love alphys is life
