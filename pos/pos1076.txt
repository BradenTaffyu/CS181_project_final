2016 early access review while zomboid is a great game for anyone who likes hardcore survival games one aspect i d like to talk about is the multiplayer this game has something that i ve never seen before in other zombie survival games this game encourages you to team up with others and support eachother sure there are people who will kill you for your stuff but i have never met any i think that this is because of how realistic the game is keep in mind that this is a game where broken bones and injuries take a pretty long time to heal and you don t just bounce back additionally food and weapons are not readily available in multiplayer it gets to the point where the game is so hard that teaming up with others is an obviously wise move compared to murdering them for the rare chance that they have a weapon or food what i m saying is that this game often makes you think like you re in an actual zombie apocalypse situation where people are worth more than just what items they have once i fell out of a two story building s window and ended up breaking a leg remember project zomboid is not a game where mending broken bones and injuries just means slapping on a bandage broken bones are supposed to take weeks to heal in this game and to add insult to literal injury broken bones make you slower than a sloth luckily i was with other people but without them i would have been easily a meal for zombies my point is that if you enjoy realistic and difficult zombie survival games where the emphasis is on surviving and not killing other survivors then by all means do get this game
