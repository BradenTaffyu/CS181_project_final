2018 early access review i m giving it a thumbs up because i think it is worth the money overall but i m really on the fence about that decision i describe some major issues below i m a 30 year old working professional without a ton of time to to throw at games while i ve played this game for 260 hours it is pretty much my most played game close second to mount and blade warband from several years ago i don t have thousands of hours to play games like other steam users do thus i value the quality of my overall gaming experience more and generally stick to sp experiences because of the unpredictible time available to play games that being said 7 days to die is an odd gem it is a decent mix of open world survival sandbox and horror the game takes itself fairly serious as a survival game in default settings materials are scarce and upon death there are semi permanent penalties to the character s health and stamina but the game is maybe too clunky and unsupported by the devs to take itself that seriously this is unfortunate because the game obviously has a lot of potential imagine playing minecraft in survival mode i use minecraft as an example but this can apply to any open world game where every 5 30 minutes a creeper randomly spawns right next to you and blows you up this can happen when you are down in a cave when you are a 20 minute walk from your base etc in some instances you survive with a shred of health remaining but it kills you much of the time and there s just nothing you can do as someone who takes the survival aspect seriously as does the game itself this would be really offputting playing on permadeath or iron man mode which i do in other games just isn t a real option unless you have infinite patience for that sort of thing so how does that apply to 7 days to die well when you go into a house there are often zombies sleeping in corners or on the floor that you want to sneak around or carefully and quickly try to kill fighting zombies in close quarters is not easy in this game so you take out the 3 6 zombies in a house and start to go through it for loot suddenly as you are opening a drawer a you get hit from behind from a zombie you are stunned meaning that you turn and move very slowly by the time you turn around and get 1 2 hits in the zombie has already killed you you drop all your stuff spawn 15 30 minutes away and your stamina and health are reduced by 10 this happens constantly not because you missed a zombie but because there is some ongoing bug where houses randomly reset causing all the zombies you killed to suddenly reappear sometime right next to you when you re facing the other way sometimes you can survive these instances but often it s unavoidable either way it s really frustrating and a downer the game has a lot of replayability so i go back to it every once and a while but then i run into one of these situations sit there staring at the screen for a few seconds and typically just power down the game but it is in alpha and should be fixed right you can t make that assumption with this game some things the devs fix or improve and other things get ignored for years what i can tell you is that in the most recent 15 minute preview for alpha 17 which will come out 1 to 6 months from now who knows really the lead developer was doing a walkthrough to demonstrate some new additions the dev mentioned they haven t played the game in over a year like on survival mode i guess and this happened to them 2 3 times when they were fighting zombies in a basement the dev seemed fairly oblivious to the bug so as of a few weeks ago this bug that has been in the game for over a year still hasn t been fixed the dev video was pretty damning honestly i ve never seen a lead dev so unfamiliar with their own game before he went up to a boar one of 4 5 animals in the game attacked it and was surprised when it fought back and killed him this is really strange my guess is the guy cashed out on this game and hired a few other people to develop the game on his behalf and he just kind of chimes in every once in a while they don t seem to be making a ton of progress as the last update was over a year ago if that this the case what can we really expect for future updates i ll leave that question for you to answer this is one example of many issues that have lingered over the years and have not gotten fixed and is a major reason why many recent reviews are negative if you are okay with annoyances like that and an alpha game that doesn t seem to be well supported this far into development go ahead and buy the game it is still quite enjoyable in my opinion
