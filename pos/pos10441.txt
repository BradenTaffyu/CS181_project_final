2020 i ve only played for so long and completely sold on this sim i ve run project cars 1 2 iracing raceroom and a few others in the past and would always hit a wall be it compatibility ffb frame rate whatever they all get them and the only thing other reviews seem to get right is the optimization for vr i don t crash but i can t do it at 30fps so i ll have to live with the standard the controls are very well thought of similar to what rr has but a bit easier to setup the ffb is very simplified which reminds me of pc2 but it is dialed in to get you what you need for reading the car i can see that being a solid solution for the devs since they would have less to worry about when it comes to fans making ini tweaks controller i haven t tested but i don t really think that makes sense to use since this was easily meant to be a sim and there are many other sources that will state that driving a sim with a controller has no merit or something the visuals are a lot more than what i would have expected unfortunately it is a rather tall order on the hardware i think currently my pc only utilizes 5 gpu peaks with a power draw of 60w and 6gb when it should be 220w i still hit 60fps without too much trouble and i m pretty sure there s potential to be had it s true that people have trouble sitting at the menu but i only recently turned of fullscreen optimization that windows loves to sneak in there easy to forget but very important ai i haven t gotten around to with much time but they seem very smooth there s no obvious point of deliberately running off course or smacking into each other as a catch up logic which most racing games seem to resort to these days it was very refreshing to compete with these guys and given the part where i have no time to look through forums for more dedicated servers this is very promising of all the games i ve played these could well be the best when it comes to situational awareness and competence if there is a catch up i sure can t see it but somehow 505 seemed to crack the secret code on how to make that perfect pace with you it s very niche the physics themselves feel pretty complete i only drove a couple cars for a few hrs but never picked up on anything that would just feel off everything makes sense and feels logical along with the tunes the tips next to the parts you see don t go into detail which i also prefer too often you see a game where multiple people have built but all have their own understanding of what those tunes are supposed to do effectively deceiving you and proving that not the whole developer team was really working together the sound i can t give a solid analogy since i haven t been to a race track in forever i wouldn t know what sounds realistic any better than what you find on youtube but it s definitely solid work i get a hint that it was designed to be accurate not just immersive although there s only one note to be made and that s the backfire from the exhaust i don t suppose it happens as often as this and not quite so loud but it doesn t take away from the rest of the experience so much that s it s a distraction just a tad repetitive almost forgot lmao idk why everyone keeps complaining about the driver animation i ve only just bought this but read many reviews before hand there is nothing wrong with the wheel calibration secondly there is a calibration in the menu for steering range again nothing wrong with it detecting my fanatec neither so stop complaining and get a real rig before you about a game that s meant for one with that note i d like thank you all for going through this ridiculous review hope it helped
