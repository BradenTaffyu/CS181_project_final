2018 you know i had this game sitting in my library for a few months and i paid no attention to it despite all the hype too much time playing mmos going to the movies pretending i have some semblance of a life so on so forth then one day i got really tired of one of said mmos and decided i wanted some me time for a little while and i turned this on and started questioning the meaning of existence this game blew my mind it is quite frankly a work of art from the gorgeous music to the flawless at least on a controller handling to the ecchi android ladies to the passionate characters to the nods to just about every kind of combat action game type that i can think of i don t know i don t want to gush i hate gushing i don t want to spoil anything but i can tell you if i hadn t already owned the game and i caught just a few snippets of what i played and saw over the past few days i would buy it right now it s worth every single penny and then some do you like rpgs get it do you like action adventure games get it do you like side scrollers get it do you like top down shooters get it do you like old school gradius and r type schmups get it do you like dark souls and thrilling moments of panic as you try to dodge ridiculous enemy onslaughts and your recovery items are running desperately low get it if you don t like videogames you probably shouldn t get this sweatdrops otherwise this is the kind of experience i pretty much think every gamer should have at some point it s a fresh reminder of what it means when people say videogames are forms of art and that videogame creators are artists with passion and soul
