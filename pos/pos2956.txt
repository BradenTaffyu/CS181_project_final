2019 enjoy every seconds and worth every pennypros amazingly complicated story totally customizable character you can become anything depth crafting system you can craft potion food armor weapon even spell nice and clear map a lot of quests with good rewards there are multiple approaches to every quest nice puzzle but it s not as difficult as the original we can steal whatever we want and kill whoever we want but somehow we can still progress the addition of physical and magical armor make combat system is more harder and fun very high replay ability value cheapcons can t go back to previous acts trap is a joke you can just purposely got trapped then just rest mediocre soundtrack inventory has better improvements from the original but still bad10 10 one of the best rpglove you lohse
