2020 early access review to be honest i could ve typed this review up years ago when i got this but i never knew how to make a review but i m here now and i m doing this okay here we go the good aka everything cars go crunch here so you don t have to crash irl though i know that won t stop all of you great cars and maps with nice little details an incredible modding community there s and endless supply of content coming out all the time from hard working individuals all so we can take your masterpieces and turn them into heaps of scrap the bad aka what bad this is on me but it can get a little boring as your mostly just crashing cars there are so challenges to do in game and there are so many things you could do but i guess i don t have the imagination to do that like i said this is bad on me no fault of the game game is really graphics heavy so a higher end pc is recommended nothing too fancy but ram and gpu are hardest hit maybe processor too i m not that smart with tech but this isn t truly bad as you probably already have good spec if you re looking to play a physics heavy game load times they used to be bad but they ve gotten considerably better in recent updates but the more mods you get the more it ll have to load a good pc should be able to handle it but just keep this in mind i have 100 s of mods and it s not too bad and well that s it sorry this it so long one of my first reviews after all but this game deserves to looked at in detail if you play it once you ll come back to it here and there to have more fun so in short i highly recommend this game if you read this far thank you so much i tried my best here
