2018 didn t play nor open the game during the redshell sh tshow agreed to nothing decided to wait it out see how stubborn 2k is with redshell redshell removed profit some folks still prefer civ 5 and i get that it is indeed a superb game i for one prefer 6 because of the rise and fall dlc mechanics i am by no means a civ veteran but if you wanna start to get into civ games i would suggest you get civ 5 along with it s dlcs during a sale it gets stupid cheap and a bang for your buck and see if civ games are for you it s not that 6 is harder than 5 but i think 5 is a good introduction to civ games it s a game that made me fall in love with civ or any 4x games in general i give this game my recommendation because coming from civ 5 i find it s gameplay fresh albeit people have been mentioning ai being still broken and call me a f ckboi but i love the more cartoony art style civ 6 has sorry for being rude cos i ve seen plenty of people let down by the fact that firaxis shift their design language for the game again i m no civ veteran you may have your own preference if you are one i m just a friendly dude telling how he enjoys a game
