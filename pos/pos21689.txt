2018 it finally clicked now i get why the dark souls series has such an active enthusiastic and borderline obsessed community although i was hesitant to start dark souls 3 i can now say that it is one of the greatest gaming experiences i have had positive absolutely gorgeous it was clear that a lot of thought and effort was put into designing dark souls 3 each area uniquely beautiful and expertly put together the attention to detail creates a truly immersive experience i especially enjoyed how spectacular the scenery and menacing the bosses are the developers did a great job at incorporating shortcuts since the areas are quite large you often get disoriented as you progress especially during the first playthrough at a certain point you come across unlockable door s or elevator s that connects to a previous area and acts as a shortcut the sudden realization that you went around in one big circle or that you re directly above below a previous area always left me baffled i really wonder how much time was put into the level design amazing combat honestly i ve barely skimmed the surface when it comes to combat but it is enough for me to recognize how incredible it is there are so many weapons movesets spells infusions and more plus the combinations you can put together are only limited by your imagination for the most part there is a reason why several people spend hours putting together the perfect pvp character s exploration is greatly rewarded seriously there are items npcs and interesting rooms hidden everywhere it s gotten so bad that i feel paranoid when i reach a pointless dead end and find nothing there has to be something here finding a secret felt like finding candy on a scavenger hunt and was thrilling from beginning to end keep a look out for fake walls suspicious ledges potential jumps and chests beware of mimics though i really liked the decision to grant the ability to teleport between lit bonfires almost immediately and to include a safe hub firelink shrine where most of the important npcs vendors can be found this made dark souls 3 more user friendly especially for beginners than dark souls 1 although this made dark souls 3 more linnear i found the clarity of knowing more or less what to do and where to go also being able to teleport back in case you went the wrong way more enjoyable than the uncertainty i felt when playing the first dark souls for those who don t know inter player interactions play a large role in the dark souls series you can leave notes to either help or trick others you can summon other players for a co op experience and you can invade other people s worlds for pvp i think this is another reason why the dark souls community holds strong despite being portrayed as a single player game you are rarely alone i found that the online features co op and pvp worked very well most of the time naturally there are some instances of lag or disconnection but it is very easy to set up again initially i hated being invaded but i ve learned to love it for two reasons the excitement fear you get from being invaded is intense it is like a sudden emergence of a mini boss whose only purpose is to hunt you down while the defeats are definitely sour victories are so damn sweet all the pain you receive from getting invaded can be repaid by invading other people it s a sort of s m relationship i know but it adds near infinite extra hours of excitement and replayability to dark souls 3 neutral i m kind of torn about this following point on one hand i still find that dark souls 3 is not very beginner friendly more specifically i had to look up some basic guides before starting the game to understand which stats do what and what sort of build i should go for a lot of information for example stat soft caps is not particularly clear to begin with i find that this steep learning curve in addition to dark souls notoriety for being difficult pushes a lot of beginners away on the other hand the dark souls series has come a long way 3 being the most user friendly and clear game in my experience after playing it i realized that i could have easily learned how to build my character through a little trial and error granted my character would not be perfect but like many veterans say no point in vigor is wasted dark souls is the kind of game that expects you to pour countless hours in to before you git gud such that a veteran with awful equipment will almost always beat a beginner with god tier equipment it should be emphasized that you are expected to make mistakes the complexity of dark souls 3 is exactly what makes it so spectacular i was honestly hesitant to begin playing dark souls 3 but it has quickly become one of the greatest gaming experiences i ve ever had if you are on the fence i urge you to give dark souls 3 a try be patient learn from your mistakes and don t give up only then will you prosper and praise the sun note i m not complaining about combat mechanics difficulty while challenging i honestly believe that the death learn from your mistakes system is the number one selling point of the whole series conclusion exceptionalwould die again if you enjoyed
