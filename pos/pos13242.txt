2016 this game is my favorite ever each new achievement was a huge thrill it was such a rush when i actually achieved orbit for the first time actually managed to land on the mun in one piece for the first time each small victory was a big thrill only downside is there s a big learneidn curve and yes the game is very challenging i d strongly recommend this game
