2017 stellaris may be the best entry point into the universe of paradox games grand strategy on a universal scale might seem illogical considering the catalogue the studio has and yet of all of them this is the one i find the most fun to jump into and play as someone who loves europa universalis 4 and has far too long logged on hearts of iron 4 the increase in scale actually makes this game more to the point than before one of the bigger problems of the earlier games comes with how the player approaches them want to play tall you can do that here want to play expansionist that works too in summary the key selling points to stellaris are as such large choices for customisation your race your ideas how you approach building your ship designs how you view other species in the galaxy etc different diplomatic approaches crush your neighbours vassalise and integrate or follow the path to everlasting peace and galactic federations random happenstance each game of stellaris puts players in a different position to start each time you load it up locations for planets resource centres and colonisation options are all randomised each time as well as potential events that can occur multiplayer compatibility you only have the base version but your friend hosts the game with all of the available content guess what you can play that content you don t even need it for yourself workshop support want some crazy stuff to try there s mods for that the idiom the sky s the limit fails to apply here it s more like the universe is your playground just be very aware the other kids may play rough i thoroughly recommend this title with or without others to play with you edit 18 months on still recommend
