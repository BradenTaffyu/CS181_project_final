2018 pros first if you ever play harvest moon or any other similar game i truly recommend this games and maybe you will like this game if you never play any harvest moon game or any similar game hmm i don t know how to describe it this game is about farming fishing mining take care of your livestock time management socialize with people in village know each of their story helping them etc making friends fall in love with someone fight some monsters etc in other words how to living your life in a village fun enjoyable and addictive game once you know basic mechanic of the game high replayability replay value multiplayer mode is coming soon cons never ever put your horse directly in front of your shipping box chance you can t mount ride your horse again in that day but you can mount ride your horse again in the next day in game day i don t know this is cons or not the in game time goes by a little bit faster 1 hours in game around 45 seconds in real life you can t do or finish multiple task in the same day maybe it s part of the game mechanic time management overall i really recommend this game9 5 10
