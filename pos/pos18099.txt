2013 this game is about strategy huge battles and empire expansion pros good looking great handling great coop workshop huge lifetimecons ai still not good enough dlc s prices yes pay for a blood gore pack seriously this should have been offered for free mutliplayer battles skirmish no ability to join again when you get a disconnection the timer is not loong enough and not usefull at all it should just be allowed for the player to join the game again desyncs making the online coop campaigns corrupted still not fixed you have to make sure you create multiple save points if you can get this game for more or less 25 go for it it s even better if you play with a friend i recommend this game
