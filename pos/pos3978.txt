2021 do you believe in the heart of the cards i sure do there s no other game that still after over 200 hours makes me get out of the chair and fistpump wildly cos i drew exactly the right card i needed to defeat the final boss this game is perfect just the right balance of roguelike misery where you lose 6 times in a row to the first stage boss only to have 2 godlike runs in a row where you crush everything and then one run where you just manage to fly by the seat of your pants to victory with 1hp left 10 10 favourite game would buy again
