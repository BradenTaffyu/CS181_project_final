2023 hogwarts legacy is a game to distract you for a bit you can run through the entire story by itself without other content the game offers probably in a bout 10 15 hours depending on how good you are in combat and how fast you can access the fast travel system that being said i have almost 100 the game achievement wise within the 60 hours i have played it the combat is simple yet complex in it s hidden combos it hints at within the dueling fates system e x being slice a frozen enemy besides helping you perform devastating combos with different spells though there is no real use to the system besides getting a completion bonus for completing a certain amount of them i don t believe this game has much replay ability which is fine for me but if you were curious about a ng mode there is not one the story is great but i wouldn t play through it more than once side quests are fun yet simple and can be summed up like this find person in trouble ask what s going on be told someone else can do it and not to risk your life go however many meters to objective obliterate the enemy or collect the item they need come back and announce you pwned the quest they act shocked then you can extort them for more of a reward or just say lol you re welcome they do have some lore attached but it s only to the side quest that you re doing not much trivia after the fact if you catch my drift one thing i love is the interactions with the npc s after doing certain actions they start speaking of your accomplishments as you continue to do things around the world same goes with enemies an example being releasing a certain enemy type from spider webs and then they start talking about it in battles with that enemy type for the rest of the game very cool the first couple times then they just repeat themselves and never stop mentioning it lol a special feature that became old a bit to fast unfortunately the open world is also filled with various puzzles and activities to do after a while though it almost feels like a chore and loses meaning once you obtain the challenge log s reward for doing a certain amount of whatever lies on the map for you to do speaking of the challenge log that is where a lot of the fun lied for me it s almost like a scavenger hunt that tells you exactly what to do at the start of it there are five different categories each being named after different aspects of the game exploration combat field guides etc each has a said amount of tiers that award you with different things some being inventory space others being cosmetics for your equipment which you can change at any time any where in the game after you complete them there aren t many achievements left to the open world besides doing every single one of the merlin trials littered throughout the region though so for me once i completed it i sort of lost my momentum playing the game there s plenty else in this game that you can explore and discover and if you re curious but not sure to get it or not wait for a sale always a safe bet the game is worth every penny spent although i don t think i d buy the dlc or deluxe edition not really needed in an rpg in my opinion
