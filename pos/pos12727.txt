2022 people playground is one of those experiences that s different for anyone however the experience is never bad there are seemingly infinite projects to tackle people playground has a reputation as a murder simulator it s far from it you can use it that way if you want but there s so much more you can enjoy i have yet to discover a better 2d engineering simulator the sound is crisp clear and degrades with distance there s editable gravity ambient heat and a system for some weather effects there s also mystery and intrigue sandboxes have done this before but this game is great at making you feel like a god that s also helpless would recommend and i have in the past also purchased 2 copies as gifts for friends
