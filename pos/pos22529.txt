hands down the absolute best most addictive game i ve ever played the tension between having to explore in order to learn how to do new things and not wanting to die makes you actually care about each decision you make and dying hurts just don t look up how to do stuff on the internet it will ruin the game for you the whole point is to have to learn how to do things by yourself and die trying and curse a lot and restart with great vengeance and furious anger
