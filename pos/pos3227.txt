2017 early access review my first review ever i usually dont do these but i just have to say if you buy this game you wont be disappointed it s challenging sometimes close to impossible you gotta use your brain to make the fights easier just what i want in a game not just about hacking and slashing you really have to strategise your setup i literally love this game and i just had to write a review thank you 10 10
