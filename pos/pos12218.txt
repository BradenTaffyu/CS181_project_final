2017 at first i was going to make a review about garry s mod and why i ve found it unfun recently but then i had a revalation a eureka moment of sorts at first i joined a militaryrp server waited 10 minutes to be trained then left it wasn t fun i got bored so i decided to join and troll a dark rp server heavy quotes on rp just to laugh at all the bad servers i joined picked the dog job the server had walked up behind someone and said as loudly as i could omae wa mo shinderu and started attacking him this turned into 10 minutes of role playing as a edgy anime character ending with a final duel between me and the guy i tried to kill he pulled out his ultimate werewolf form and defeated me it was fun this is what made me realize what garry s mod is and why it s fun garry s mod isn t really a serious game it s not meant to be taken seriously i mean look at the store pictures for it doesn t it just shout serious military roleplay when you take garry s mod and try to bring seriousness to it it s hard take the militaryrp server for example why did i even need to be trained i ve played those servers before and they all make you go through training all they teach you are meaningless boring stuff like ranks faces and other things that you probably never use when you try to make this game a slog of rules it just ruins it this game shines when silly stuff happens and is encouraged you can do some weird stuff too try it see what weird stuff you can come up with never be serious
