2019 early access review if you re like me and load several games just to get to main menu and realize wow i m really not in the mood for this game either then this game is for you only 20 hours thus far and i m hooked within 5 minutes you ll be sitting there drooling with your eyes glued to the screen watching the hypnotic flop of the characters gait the fall of the first sword a horde steam rolling my units wait a horde steam rolling my units not again anyway once you plow your way through the missions and get a feel for different units capabilities youll find yourself spawning 200 units on each side in sandbox and holding the slow motion button necessary for achieving frame rates of 5 with that many units and watching the clash then you ll proceed to say it and spawn another 400 units just to see what happens for those who want quantative reviews graphics 7 10its all course medium grained mesh models but it suits the vibecontrols 9 10 its basically point and click camera controls and 3 buttons for possessing a unit easy to learngameplay 7 10 the missions are either super easy or f ing brutal unappealing ai formations are used usually sandbox is where its atreplayability 9 10i find myself playing a few quick sandbox hoard battles everyday it gets repetitive after awhile and i stop but it loads fast so its easy to get it on your subconscious mind and give in
