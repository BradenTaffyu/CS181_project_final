2019 today after logging 105 hours in this game on steam i ve finally beat ascension 20 as the defect one hour later i m still thinking about that run how things went how lucky i got how i ve built a near perfect deck how i almost died at the last boss due to being tired and not paying enough attention when i won it was one of the most satisfying moments in my gaming life it s hard to describe this game other than that it s a roguelike and a card game because it s unlike any other roguelike or any other card game i ve played although it already spawned a plethora of clones on mobile platforms it s small in scope but surprisingly deep it s hugely random and sometimes unwinnable but it also has a near limitless skill cap the better you get the less luck you need to win this game is a masterpiece if i could change any one thing about it i would leave everything as it is for me it s 10 10 it s perfect
