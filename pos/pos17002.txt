2020 this is probably my first review on steam i was never interested in this game before and only bought it due to discount then i started playing it and i spent 80 hours straight on lord tyrion now i m playing as shadow king so is this game good i think this is my game of the year strategy real time battle rpg upgradable characters lore that is like lord of the rings i mean what more do you want to really enjoy the game you gotta buy warhammer 1 and 2 so that you can play mortal empires but it s expensive but honestly if a game can provide you hundreds of hours of enjoyment it s worth the money i mean i bought the last of us 2 as well spending 80 bucks but i only played it for 5 hours or less you don t need to buy every dlc thought some dlcs are not worth buying so do check the reviews before purchasing them
