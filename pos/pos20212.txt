amazing game one of the best fleshed out games in the warhammer 40k universe very accurate to the lore as a warhammer 40k fan i m so happy with all the stuff that is in this game the start is a bit slow but opens up relatively fast the game gets addicting as soon as you can warp travel and explore the whole region if you re a warhammer 40k fan this is a must if you like sci fi and haven t delved into 40k give it a try
