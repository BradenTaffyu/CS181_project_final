2020 when i first picked up ats s older brother ets i got it heavily discounted while drunk thinking might be fun to ram cars off the road 5 or so years later i got my class a commercial drivers licence because of these games the first time one of my friends saw me playing this he thought it looked boring as hell i didn t think he was wrong but i told him to try it for himself he got his cdl before me this is a game that has the potential to inspire people due to its deceptive relaxing nature this may be simply a game but it s ramifications can be life changing
