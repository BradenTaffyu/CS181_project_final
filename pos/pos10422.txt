assetto corsa competizione review 100 hours playedafter spending over 100 hours in assetto corsa competizione acc i have mixed feelings about my experience driving and realism acc nails the driving experience the physics are incredibly realistic making each car feel unique and challenging to master the attention to detail in the tracks weather conditions and tire models is exceptional if you re a sim racing enthusiast the driving dynamics will keep you coming back for more graphics and sound visually acc is stunning the cars and tracks are beautifully rendered and the dynamic weather effects add a layer of immersion that few other racing sims can match the sound design is equally impressive with engine notes and environmental sounds that enhance the overall experience content and variety the game offers a decent selection of cars and tracks focusing primarily on gt racing while the content is well crafted the variety can feel limited after a while especially if you re used to other racing sims with a broader range of vehicles and disciplines the dlcs which are meant to expand the game often feel overpriced and lacking in content paying a premium for what should be standard additions can be frustrating and detracts from the overall value of the game community and multiplayer here s where things start to falter the multiplayer experience is often marred by connection problems and server issues frequent disconnects and lag can ruin what should be thrilling online races the ranked matchmaking system while a great concept is often unreliable due to these connectivity issues the community is passionate but can be critical of these ongoing problems and it s clear that many players share the same frustrations updates and support kunos simulazioni has been active in updating the game but the pace and effectiveness of these updates sometimes leave much to be desired while there are improvements the server stability and connection issues remain persistent which is disappointing for a game that shines so brightly in other areas conclusion assetto corsa competizione offers a superb driving experience with top notch realism but it s held back by significant multiplayer and connectivity issues additionally the overpriced and underwhelming dlcs make it hard to justify the ongoing investment if you re looking for a single player or local experience it s hard to find a better sim however if you re hoping for seamless online racing be prepared for some frustration with some crucial fixes acc could be one of the best racing sims out there but as it stands it s a mixed bag rating 6 10
