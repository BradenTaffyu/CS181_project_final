2020 swtor is an amazing mmorpg i highly recommend it to everyone who likes mmorpgs as a free to play player you can play through all the 8 different class stories for free they re all different they also made the first 2 expansions free for everyone so even if you don t plan on spending any money on this game you still get loads of content if you enjoy the game then subbing atleast for 1 month is highly recommended because with that even if your subscription runs out you still keep all the expansions that were available during your subscription time and some of the restrictions are also lifted
