2016 edited after 50 more hours of play time after some 50 now 100 hours i finally felt ready to talk about this game first things first the interface is a little rough on the edges and the tutorial is all but comprehensive what leads to bad first impressions unless you re a long term fan of the series used to the mechanics i m not at least not the latest instalments and at first i felt this was a meh game but i endured in part because the source material is so rich and colorful and i m glad i did for this is actually a very good real time tactical rtt game the game is composed of two parts the tactical real time battles and a turn based strategy 4x macro game the good part is the rtt using the true and tested total war model the total war engine is showing it s age and a lot of times it leads to frustration but warhammer total war works as a charm as i hoped it would the art is colorful the lore is rich watching the armies in action is trully emotional for a warhammer afficionado even without the mandatory blood and gore dlc i m watching your shady business practices sega they managed to create completely distinct experiences for all the races something that fix que one big flaw about the series the almost symmetric factions it also leads to great replayability once you understand the fine tunning about the stats it becomes crystal clear every race is unique here and you should play accordingly on a bad note the 4x aspect of the game is shallow and flawed diplomacy simply makes no sense they didn t even try you have to fight every turn to keep leveling heroes etc it s basically an excuse to build more and more advanced units and keep playing tactical battles that detracts specially from the experience playing less lore wise agressive races like empire and dwarves also the game s 4x mode economy is a blatant lie your income even dominating most of the map will never be enough to support more than 3 full armies they kinda fix it with cash from the nether a fixed ammount you gain because so every turn but that only makes the economic game broken state even more obvious the only plus to the 4x aspect of the game is the asymmetry between the races leading to the only actual strategic choices specifically how agressive you have to do with or against each race all in all this game is a must play for warhammer and total war fans and if you like at least one of them give it a shot can t really recomend it to 4x players tough unless you consider the very simplistic 4x systems in this game acceptable because of the deph those tactical battles offer
