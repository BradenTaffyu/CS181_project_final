2019 this game is poppin but they really really want u to buy their dlc i wasted credits on a vehicle via request support tab tried to drive it and it wouldn t let me a screen popped up telling me to buy the dlc in order to operate it as a crew member why even have it be spawnable if i can t drive it lmao arma 2 had more vehicles and content ai in arma 3 is still ass but improved over arma 2 voice acting is alot better in arma 3 awesome scenery big maps ghillie suits in the game kind of look like nugs of weed seems to be optimized to a point lots of graphics options workshop compatibility immersive sounds just like arma 2 working bipods more command options much better editor faster loading times compared to arma 2 some interesting features and scenarios
