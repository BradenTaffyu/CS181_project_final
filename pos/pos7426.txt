2021 early access review this is a really great casual game for solo or co op with friends raft might look simplistic and boring graphically but the theme fits well animations overall are decent there is a fun story lore to discover and the game meta and controls are pretty easy to learn and fun for all ages the only real con with raft is the community wishes the game developed faster but at the same time the community completely understands that the development team isn t big and are patient to wait for updates why the updates patches that release are substantial they are quality additions and changes that keep the game interesting fresh and offer replay value honestly i could go on in a lot of detail about this game but i won t simply put raft is something best experienced for yourself or with friends conclusion raft is worth a buy
