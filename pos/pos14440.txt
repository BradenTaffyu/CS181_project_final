2023 early access review i first thought that i m not a fan of the factory building genre but i was wrong this game is that good it s beautiful relaxing full of content and possibilities for optimization the ability to move goods and yourself between planets and even stars is awe inspiring to me i wish i d just had this much amount of time to occupy this huge amount of space
