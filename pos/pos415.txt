2017 one of the most detailed and amazing pixelated games i have ever played not only is this game addicting but never seems to get boring with all the quests and constant farming i enjoyed having a relationship with my favorite character and then ending up getting married since i can t seem to do either of those things in real time i enjoyed doing it online through a game d the only thing i didn t like about the game was that i was terrible at fishing sobs so i barely got any of that done might need to work on that when the multiplayer is finally released it will be the best game on the market and even now it is totally worth every penny i spent for it thanks for putting out a fantastic game
