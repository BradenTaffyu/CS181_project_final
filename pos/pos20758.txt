2023 wonderful game the enlarged world around hogwarts is amazing and there are almost endless puzzles and things to accomplish in the huge open world i really loved the beast collecting and managing part of it the only downsides for me were these 1 main story and major side quests are too short and too few 2 there is no record of quests completed i finished the game with over 15 side quests left to do and i had great difficulty finding them i had to consult an online list only i couldn t always remember which i had completed 3 the treasures you find in chests are always clothes and so after you acquire and outfit you like and level everything up all the way collecting these rewards is just boring yes you can sell them but by now you have thousands of galleons which you really can t spend on anything you already have all of the plants potions and beast items so finding chests isn t too rewarding anymore still a spectacular game though
