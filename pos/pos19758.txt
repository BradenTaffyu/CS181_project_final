2019 i have spent thousands of hours of my life playing many versions age of empires ii no joke check my hours counter for the hd edition in my library i grew up with playing age of kings with my friends in grade school procrastinated with the hd edition through high school and even spent friday nights in college playing arabia and cba i know how the game probably better than any other video game and let me say this microsoft has done a near flawless job of keeping the feel of the original game in the remake while managing to improve the game in almost every aspect the first example of major improvement is found in the new orchestral remastering of the soundtrack this alone was worth the 3rd time i had purchased this game in my life the nostalgic beats and rhythms of the classic game ring true after all the years but are brought to new life with incredible vocals room filling sound and surprising depth as soon as you load up the game the music is clean and would fit in any modern game and yet it always stays rooted in the music you remember graphically the game excels the devs definitely had a challenge here playing the game requires you to be able to quickly identify buildings units and terrain at a glance this means that each building and unit on the field need their own graphical representation the graphics also had to be reminiscent of the old game to allow players to jump over without much trouble on top of all this many of the civilizations have their own architecture styles microsoft balanced this perfectly the units and buildings are fresh and look nice from a graphical point of view but are similar enough to the old game that there is no problem jumping from one version to the next a work from microsoft here another great add was the ladder matchmaking system being able to queue up for a 1v1 2v2 3v3 or 4v4 in deathmatch or random map and play a person your rank is huge totally cuts down on the lobby system found in hd the lobby does stick around for those who want to play custom scenarios or play weird setting games with their friend the matchmaking mode tended to get me in a game in as little as 2 minutes not super fast but certainly serviceable great system all around pathfinding was a huge issue in the hd edition units would take inexplicably long paths to get places get caught on each other in big groups and would generally bump into each other making life rough in de the pathfinding is at least slightly better in worst case scenario and in best case it flows smoothly and in a more impressive way there is still the odd villager who wanders out into the middle of nowhere but more often than not units move attack and respond much better to user inputs the quality of life improvements jammed into the game make it so much easier to play and not worry about the button pressing parts of the game being able to queue up upgrades and see what you re producing at a glance is a great it is much easier to manage your economy and military great job here too the game is not perfect i think there needs to be a new player lobby for people brand new to the game perhaps only allow 10 games in the new player lobby to learn the game before being kicked to the wolves in the real lobby i think there are some performance improvements to be had as well the game is somewhat taxing on the hardware but has good settings for both audio and video all in all this game is worth the 15 if you already own the game and the 20 if you didn t the developers clearly worked their butts off to make this game spectacular
