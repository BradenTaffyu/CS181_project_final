cs1 is still the better game in it s current state cs2 is just playable however with it s new inclusion of mods the community is hard at work with making features that s missing this game had a slow and terrible start and we shouldn t exactly forgive co for that but the game is just a couple updates away from being a genuine successor to the cities skylines we all love and the future of the game looks promising
