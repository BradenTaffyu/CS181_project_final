2018 a trading caravan stopped by my colony we were poor so we couldn t buy anything suddenly the trader s camel dropped dead spilling all the goods it was carrying onto the ground the trader and his men got upset and immediately rushed off leaving the dead camel and it s wares behind i couldn t figure out what the hell had just happened i inspected the camel s corpse it was really old and had suffered a major heart attack now we had a whole bunch of free stuff and we ate camel for breakfast all of these crazy random occurances string together throughout the lifetime of your colony creating a rich narrative i m really struggling to write something eloquent here without gushing i can t if you buy this game it will be your favorite
