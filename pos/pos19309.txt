2023 a worthy successor to the age of empires name age iv takes after age ii in its setting and scale allowing you to pit huge medieval armies against each other but is decidedly its own game it features more asymmetric faction design which makes for an excellent variety of strategies and styles the mongols for example can move their buildings around for safety and resource optimisation while delhi pays no resources for research but must train scholars to speed it up the diversity is deepened by the landmarks you build to advance you have a choice of two each time you age up each providing a unique set of bonuses not unlike age of mythology s minor god system after a year and a half the game s competitive side has stood the test of time enjoying a thriving online community and ranked ladders regular updates are still ongoing and there s a frequent rollout of seasonal stuff to enjoy if that s not your thing the campaigns are very good and will actually teach you a fair bit about history my favourite thing about aoeiv though is that amid its focus on being a great strategy game it never forgot to be a great city builder which was always part of the appeal of earlier age games the attention to detail is incredible roads fences and pathways will pop up anywhere you build buildings connecting them together where the english and french will farm wheat the chinese will visibly farm rice instead and the mongols won t harvest grain at all and instead build sheepfolds the appearance of your units and will change for most upgrades you apply to them and defensive buildings will reflect any arrowslits or springald emplacements you add you can pick a biome in game setup that determines the environmental aesthetic all of this is rendered beautifully in colourful 3d which is stylised but never cartoonish on the downside there s no real scenario editor included like there was in earlier games there s an external tool for designing maps and the like with crude representation of terrain but those who enjoyed sinking their teeth into the game s classic editors will be disappointed there s no way of pausing or saving the game in multiplayer this won t matter much in a competitive setting but if you like to play with your friends as i do you ll have to plan your time around the game the ai is very competent and has plenty of difficulty options effectively scouting and countering your army composition on higher settings but does occasionally get hitched if it doesn t like the map generation your soldiers like to wander off if they see an enemy so it s important to manage them carefully instead of letting them walk into ambushes the important thing is that aoeiv can make you feel all the things the great rts games make you feel when your cleverness is rewarded by winning an engagement through superior composition and management or when you find a gap in your opponent s defence and exploit it the pride when you send the huge army you mustered marching across the map the satisfaction when the economy is working just right and has found its sustainable equilibrium the sheer triumph of persistence when you barely survive an early assault and claw your way back to victory after another hour these make aoeiv a great game to rival the big guns and if you have any love for the genre you should buy it
