a large chunk of my family are truck drivers and i spent many summers as a boy on the road with my grandparents it s difficult to put into words how it makes me feel when i m driving the kenworth w900 i can almost smell papaws aftershave and hear nanny telling him to switch lanes or he will miss his turn the hum of the engine and the sight of that big back hood jutting out from the windshield snapped me back into my childhood dreams of following in their footsteps i never thought i d like this game and i certainly never expected a video game to make me pause and reevaluate my life but here i am this is more than just a game to me it s like coming home
