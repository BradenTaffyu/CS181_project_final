2016 early access review i noticed there are a quite a few negative reviews added recently about the game so i was a little reluctant to give it a try that s why i decided to write my first review i do not think the reviews are representative of the game they nearly put me off buying a game that i am enjoying a lot first thing i really like is that you can play this game exactly how you want to you want creative mode for building farming and exploring it s there you re fed up with the zombies you can remove them or reduce their numbers want more of a challenge make more zombies and give them the ability to run day and night or increase their health you can tailor the game exactly to your favourite gameplay as well as the menu options the spawn settings are stored in xml files which you can edit to customise further still the balance of the whole game imo is very good everything has been designed in such a way that you have to get out and explore to begin you can make a few items tools weapons to unlock more you have to read schematics or books which you can only find by looting buildings the better schematics and weapons are mostly found in the cities which is where you find the most dangerous zombies forcing you to take risks if you want to progress a lot of these survival games are all about grinding materials with 7dtd i never really feel like it s a grind especially once you start getting decent tools breaking safes can take a while but you normally get decent rewards for it you can very quickly get enough materials to build a basic house you can farm some of the plants and most of your materials will come from looting buildings and rubbish the zombie types have been chosen well to give a good variety you are mostly safe to walk around during the day but there are dogs and bears that still keep you on your toes at night everything is dangerous some can climb some have a ranged attack some can run faster than others and some crawl around in the grass the entire world is destructible so you can dig into the ground and mine anywhere in the map destroy rebuild or fortify buildings etc the immersion ambient sounds in the game are brilliant the wind the howling of dogs at night and the footsteps of zombies all add up to a really good experience many times i have been caught out by zombies creeping up on me and made me jump the graphics imo are very good considering the size and detail of the maps the only negative i have is the zombies seem to be able to see through walls but the game is still alpha so this may improve in future
