2019 early access review the definitive open world survival sandbox zombie apocalypse simulator the depth in this game is amazing you can spend hours just running around and never feel like it s getting stale not to mention it has mod support which makes it even better the only downside i can think of for this game is the art style which some people might not like seeing as it is not 3d but i personally love it oh and it s freaking hard to survive for long you will die a lot
