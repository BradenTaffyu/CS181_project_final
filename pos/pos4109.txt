2019 extremely addictive roguelike deck builder basically all my favorite genres rolled into one the lengthy gradual progression of difficulty levels just makes it so tempting to keep coming back and so satisfying when you finally clear that level you ve been stuck on for the last 10 attempts and i love the alternating offense defense style of combat and the way it challenges you to build a deck that can handle the unpredictability of each encounter and the way the enemy happens to behave each turn similarly planning your trek through the map and determining how greedy or safe you want to be where despite all the rng in these sorts of games you often only have yourself to blame for skipping that campfire heal or accepting an event deal that sucks a quarter of your hp away just before an elite battle the simple art style music and atmosphere really grew on me too easily worth the 25 price tag for the sheer number of hours and challenge you will get out of it
