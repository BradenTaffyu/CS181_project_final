2021 rating 4 5 despite being a decade old warband has a charm to it that distinguishes it from other similar releases the exact root of that charm is difficult to pinpoint but in many ways it feels like warband was designed with fun mechanics in mind first before any explanation for those mechanics was considered perhaps this development style was a product of limitations scarcity but optically it makes the game seem as though it dismisses the pursuit of realism in favor of good gameplay for example it s insanely fun riding around the battlefield in front of your army like an ape and somehow being rewarded for it too conclusion warband lacks many elements that developers would qualify as necessary but still produces a fun game and memorable experience a lengthy story or meticulously planned world can be great but warband does just as well without one while the graphics and mechanics certainly have not held up well i still believe this game has a worthwhile experience to offer and so i d recommend it
