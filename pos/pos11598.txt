2023 early access review the ultimate 3d zombies survival tower defense and sandbox game my honest review that is not biased at all this amazing game is the ultimate 3d zombies survival tower defense and sandbox game that you can have there is no other game at the writing of this review that has a vast default open world that can be explored in every single way that can be built on or destroyed entirely with the exceptions of the traders that has so many items that you can choose to build the perfect horde base or even a luxurious house a lot of items to create a lot weapons to survive and several ways to play this game things that is worth to mention again at the writing of this review you can change game builds older or experimental versions through the betas option in the game properties window you can play many versions behind the current one it s an interesting thing for those that are curious about testing older versions or for those that didn t enjoy some recent update random world generation there is also a nice random world generator it s so good it has so many things for the world generation to tweak the experience the random world generation has options like increasing number of cities mountains terrain things you can also change very important settings like spawn rates difficulty loot abundance xp etc grinding there is a lot of grinding but i think it s kinda of necessary of course some things are just too slow but you don t have to have everything otherwise the game would become too easy for newcomers the game is not going to be easy until you understand the mechanics about crafting buffs debuffs it s well documented in the game and progression system speaking of items with the latest update alpha 21 you have to read a bunch of books to unlock stuff some books seems to be easier to find than others now while that seems boring you shouldn t bother that much it is kinda natural because you explore a building to get resources and then you find books as well so it s natural progression i can t think of enough words to describe how amazing this game is in terms of sandbox with zombies it s just an amazing experience
