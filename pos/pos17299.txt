2018 so i have almost 100 hours in this game and 40 hours on warhammer i easily my favorite out of all the total war games which i own most of awesome graphics great units nice battles and great immersion one thing that could discourage you from buying it is the dlc cost plus the added cost of buying the first one and all it s dlcs to enjoy the me campaign grabbing all of those at discount this game cost me almost 100 euros for me that was worth every penny it only gets better and better
