2020 another dark souls and another 140 hours gone here is my review broken up in different parts as a pc port pretty good although i did experience bsod multiple times i hardly ever get this on other higher end games including past ds games so i suspect that this game was not 100 optimized for pc overall it played well and i was able to get 4k 60fps pretty easily as a game i absolutely recommend this game to anyone interested in action adventure rpgs or metroidvania type games it s totally good often intense and very engaging i think the fighting mechanics are top notch and there s so much variety in bosses enemies weapons that you can be entertained for a very long time whether you get it on sale or not you won t be disappointed it s absolutely worth the money as a dark souls game this is supposedly the last in the souls series i d say overall it s the best but only marginally in fact the innovation from 1 to 2 and 2 to 3 is pretty lacking don t expect a major shakeup in the ds formula this is both good and bad for veterans of the series it s pretty much the same game you played before maybe with a few qol improvements upgraded graphics and marginally better play mechanics unfortunately they seemed to have streamlined the formula to the point where the only good weapons are swords and done away with ds2 dual wield function which wasn t great but at least it was there so in total this is probably the best ds but honestly not that much of an evolution over the series criticism and praise having played the series back to back in a relatively short time span i can say that what makes ds great isn t really the fighting or the lore but the levels the levels and the level design are a feature all to themselves the masterful design and detail that made ds1 so great and was lacking in ds2 is back in full force in ds3 i absolutely love when levels open up with interesting nooks and crannies and eventually double back on to themselves with clever shortcuts and secret passages that make your progression worth the danger and risk ds3 is at its finest in these moments also the detail given to each level all the little features that you can interact with i e break are excellent and give the levels a life of their own some levels in this game are done better than others but overall all they are beautiful and fun to play through i would have preferred a little bit more variety you play through no less than 4 different graveyards and maybe some totally different locations from past games just like the past 2 you visit churches castles a swamp and a run down village but i guess that is what ds is about the worst criticism i have with this game is that there is a very thin story that i found uninteresting and uninspired yes ds has always been about digging deep to learn the lore and finding story details sprinkled in item descriptions or cryptic dialogue but you d think by the 3rd entry they d at least be able to build on the past games to give some semblance of a coherent story that s just not the case here in fact it got to the point where i was running from boss to boss not knowing or even caring who they were are why i was doing this hell i don t even know why i was killing most of the bosses in the game was it to the light the fire at the end was it to stop a curse i still don t know it s a shame that they couldn t build on what happened in the past games to make a story that answers all the questions and gives some finality to the series instead you basically end this game just like you did with the other two again this is a good port a good game and a good ds game i just wish they did a lot more than make a dark souls 3 0 because that is what it feels like
