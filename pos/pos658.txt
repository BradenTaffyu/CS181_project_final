2016 i cannot even express how much i love this game nor can i easily define why i love it it took me by surprise really with the bright colours and pixel art i expected i don t know what i expected but i surely didn t expect to sink 70 waht hours in the first week playing it i m trying to pace myself but whatever else i do i m thinking about stardew valley it s charming funny and has a bit of everything story combat family life collections unlockable areas fishing making friends mining and let s not forget farming every season is different so you have to pay very close attention to the calendar i e how many days until the change of season if i plant these crops will they mature before the change of season kills them the calender is also vital for keeping track of whose birthday is next every villager likes different things so i do lean heavily on the wiki to keep track of the best gifts to give them for maximum relationship gain but i am learning a few favourites there is no combat in the regular areas of the map but when you feel the need for some dungeoneering there is 100 levels of an abandoned mine shaft every 10 levels has a change of environment leafy frosty dark etc in the mines and of course an increase in danger and reward i m only down to level 45 so far and besides the combat one of the greatest dangers is staying out too late and falling asleep it took me a little while to get the hang of the combat system but it starts out easy and once i realised that it s timing based and i learned the rhythm i found it pretty enjoyable fishing is also timing based and starts out hard if fishing is getting you down i recommend just doing it not worrying about catching anything until your character levels up fishing once i gained a few levels and learned the mechanics it s a very fun minigame the save system and many of the random events are tied into the night time sleep so you have to be in bed by 2am if you aren t your character will pass out and will awaken in their own bed or in the hospital but will be moderately penalised for it the game will give you a reason for how you returned to your bed and lost things there are a few variations it s a frustrating mechanic in some ways but it does add to the whole planning aspect so it s not actually a gripe i do have a slight gripe that saving only happens when sleeping but the days are quite short so it s only been a few times when i ve not been able to quit at the time that i wanted my hours are inflated slightly by me leaving the game running if i need to do something and i m not at a point where i can save though stardew valley has so many features and the many many details of all those features are far too many to list i didn t think that i could get into a game with pixel art graphics but i m glad that i gave it a go everything about stardew valley has totally won me over it s even won me over to the idea of pixel art graphics in general that s enough of a review from me i need to go and play some more 100 recommended
