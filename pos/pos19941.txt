2020 i ve played 150 hours and wanted to comment on how this game has changed my life i am now general geo smith patton jr now i have never been a junior before but as of this writing that is okay with me the game brings back great memories of standing at the kasserine pass and looking over armies that had fallen over the ages past those were the memories that came back to me as i stood on the mount of the town center and took up the task to take over the known world now unlike when patton played the game crashes just when you re getting in the middle of battle that s unacceptable but also an additional fog of war concept that i think the developers were very wise beyond their 18 years to add to the challenge of the game standard i can beat all 7 enemies on random map when i bump it up it evades the patton model and crushes me even with less enemies and yes i have studied all online guides on economy and have a thriving one with 100 villagers when i am crushed standard i do well and utterly destroy the enemy anything above and i feel i have to call over omar b to finish the job crushing monty yes i would turn against allies just to see their buildings burn summary crashes sometimes but the autosave feature resets to a minute or two before a fun blast from the past that lets you re live the fun from twenty years ago man i m old great game and i recommend it
