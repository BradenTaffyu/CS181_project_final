2018 early access review pros great cast of characters alisa nuff said good combat system good stage design very active dev teamcons most are gameplay related accuracy should be tweaked the fact that i can t hit an enemy from point blank makes no sense ex some enemies have better accuracy on overwatch from a distance than my characters attacking at point blank the only way to get items is to open chests on the battlefield which becomes repetitive and tedious can we get a character that can open a chest from a distance super grindy not to mention how long some battles take a lack of reward after a battle which makes the grind unappealing a 20 30 min battle for 2 useless items and a couple of potions no thanks updated april 2020 this game has made most of the changes to my cons with the addition of item crafting rare treasure chest increased battle speed etc a fantastic game and highly recommended if you enjoy tactical rpgs with awesome progression message for devs alisa when
