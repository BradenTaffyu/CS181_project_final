edit as of 27th of february 2024 patch 1 1 28 has landed and most of the issues below have now been fixed this is a truly great rpg it still has bugs to be sorted out but the first 3 chapters are pretty bug free now first 70 hours of gameplay when you get to chapter 4 atleast as heretic some rather big bugs start rearing their face though its not game breaking bugs but there are characters and events that seem to jump timelines as people you have personally murdered might show up certain places as innert npc s and there is a companion character that completely bugs out and cant wear any equipment the bugs are more immersion breaking and are distracting more than anything so far patching bugs like this has been happening at an okay pace and on dogmatic and iconoclast runs i am hearing from friends that it isnt quite as bad so if you want to wait for a few months till these issues are ironed out to get the best experience that can be recommended
