2017 early access review 10 10 would fall into a poop hole again in gta finlandi really love this game it is so novel and different that it definitely catches the attention it is also quite a learning curve the point of this game as stated is to build up your satsuma however the game is about so much more i often find that aspect getting pushed aside whilst i attempt to do something else this game is in early access so it does have some weird bugs etc however they aren t game breaking and make up part of the charm of the game when you start a new game just make sure to head straight for the shop first to buy supplies food beer essential and fan belt after that you can start building the car up without any worry ish be warned though doing silly things in this game will in most cases kill you but that is part of the fun isn t it and you will most likely spend all weekend trying to assemble the car only to crash and die 2 minutes later pros get pissed on beer and homebrews without consequence irl swear in finnish drive around the countryside die in horrible car accidents a lot runs on bad pcscons only one buildable car ai is suicidal
