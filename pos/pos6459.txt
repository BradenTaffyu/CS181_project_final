2020 the best relaxing gamescs software is my most favourite gaming company on 18 oct 2012 they release this game euro truck simulator 2 now you probably said whaaat yes in 2012 and the game still looks awesome but most important thing is the game is still alive and getting new big updates during the year scs didn t make the third version and don t plan to do it in near future they want to keep updated their simulators ets2 and younger brother american truck simulator scs is not like other big aaa studios or some indie studios which every year or every two years release a new version of their games that s why scs is my most favourite gaming company they just keep updated both games and every update makes both games better and better they made big steps from 2012 to 2020 and they have plans for the next years ok maybe if you check store page you will say they have too many dlcs yes you are right but let me explain it for new players i recommend to buy not the only basic game but choose from one of the bundles for example the essentials bundle you will get a lot of content for a very good price new heavy cargos new parts of europe to explore scandinavia poland slovakia and a small part of hungary wheel tuning pack and cabin accessories you can individually buy basic game plus one of the map expansions and choose dlcs packs which you want but like i said for new players is better to buy a bundle everyone can build their own version of the game ets2 has many sales during the year so don t be afraid of the price scs need to make money from something so that s why they have many dlcs for the game and then they can keep the game updated and improve it by every new update now i should say something about gameplay it s very simple at the start you can t have your own truck first you need to make money by driving for other companies choose a job from quick jobs later when you make some money you can buy your first truck now you can take cargos with your lorry and make more money from deliveries you can borrow money from a bank if you need it when your capital will be big enough you can buy more trucks and employ drivers to drive for you and they will help you make you even more bucks there is a levelling system too after every delivery you get experiences the amount depends on how good you drove from a to b cargo category how long was your trip and from your level every new level you get one point which you can spend on one of the skills for example if you want to take adr dangerous cargos you will need use point to unlock this a new level will unlock new customizations and trucks too if you afraid of grinding don t worry when you start driving you will see it isn t annoying you can take a shortcut by using mods or cheats did i say mods yeah you can download cars trucks graphics mods maps etc from steam workshop or various modding websites i prefer to play with stock version but during christmas i like frosty winter weather mod grimesmods wordpress com ok back to gameplay maybe it sounds quite boring just driving around a map but trust me it s really relaxing you don t have any table with a score where you compare your stats with friends or other players turn on your favourite radio station or listen to your favourite music playlist just sit back and relax you can clear your mind and feel more positive if you are a hardcore simulator player like me you can set many things to be more realistic you can have realistic air brakes sequential or manual gearbox more realistic physics and so on i play the game with xbox one gamepad i made guide how to set it up do you need gamepad or steering wheel to enjoy the game no you don t you can play only on a keyboard but i recommend you use mouse for steering and maybe for acceleration and braking too depends what you prefer steam community tab offers many guides about how to set up things if you will need help with it scs makes during the year some giveaways where you can get free dlcs don t forget to make an account on world of trucks www worldoftrucks com it isn t necessary to have it but i recommend it because you will be able to take external contracts external contracts are jobs which you must finish in time not in game time but real time so if you have 24 hours to finish the job you have 1 day to finish it in real life external contracts offer more jobs to choose from if you didn t find cargo which you want in normal jobs you can find it in external contracts the best part of the world of trucks is events during the year scs makes a few events for example at christmas you will deliver a special christmas trailer with gifts after completion you get some items to your steam inventory which you can sell on the steam market or use it in the game to customize your lorry graphics look very good and you can enjoy the game on low end and high end pcs too everyone can play this awesome game ok that s all now a few end words i definitely recommend euro truck simulator 2 for everyone who likes driving and want the best relaxing game community is nice friendly and devs keep the game updated if you want to drive in the usa try american truck simulator
