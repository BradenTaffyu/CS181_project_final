2020 i played the game at launch for about 5 hours and did not touch it again until just recently i never thought it was a bad game but it was missing somethings that made it forgettable recently i have started playing it and really diving into the game and i can not stop playing the rng the grind the multiplayer aspect reminds me of destiny 1 in a way it just keeps pulling me back in wanting to play more is the game perfect no far from it is it fun and worth it to me absolutely 1 thing i will say is the fallout 1st subscription and limited stash space is stupid and needs to be changed i bought the game there should be no subscription to make it better atleast let me buy the stash space outright
