2020 best game i have ever played hands down 1000 hrs on xbox the quest line has so many paths you can take that have their own logical reasoning making it more interesting to play along with apart from caesar s legion who just want to kill and enslave everyone the factions in the game are vastly different in how they operate and how they the map is fairly large with so many side quests that take you down so many routes that are separate or even related to the main quest in some sense there are tons of weapons and builds that you can use that are viable and loads of perks that can help with making your build the obvious downside to this game is the fact that it is one of the glitchiest buggiest games i have ever played if you don t save constantly or haven t saved in a while since you have been exploring the wastes you will find that you may lose a ton of progress due to a loading crash or just some other inexplicable crash luckily the modding community for this game has done a magnificent job to try and make this game more playable and somehow more fun overall this is one of the best single player games of all time in my eyes hence why i wasted my time writing a review for it 9 years later
