2015 chem addled post apocalyptic hijinks that even after 100hrs is still just as absorbing as the moment you emerge from vault 111 despite the disappointing stability issues and questionable design choices this is no longer high rpg interplay style it s more quasi rpg but it still retains the compelling signature bethesda open world the boston area of the commonwealth is a grand playground with more locations to explore than you and your companions can shake heavily weaponised sticks at so much so it s quite possible you ll largely forget to pursue the main quest line the cherry on this preserved pie is the suberb modding community who as they did with skyrim will elevate the game and pander to the more personal tastes of fallout fans
