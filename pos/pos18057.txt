2014 i really love most of total war games but i have to agree that when the game was released it wasn t acceptable after 9 patches the game have most of bugs fixed however people are still complaining even those who haven t played in months or only think about the issues when it was launched i pre purchased the game and i have no regret from doing so creative assembly gave away some dlc in order to thank fans for their support so is it worth to play if you really enjoy this period and would like to dominate enemies and command an empire this game is for you
