2016 fallout 4 is the fallout 3 bethesda always wanted it to be not every fallout fan will enjoy this game for that reason while new vegas improved player choice and role playing mechanics f4 focuses on improving the fps gameplay mechanics as a fan of nv i should despise the departure of f4 s role playing mechanics the exclusion of level caps weapon armor degradation unique traits with gameplay changes and above all choices takes away a lot of the replay value from f3 and nv however if you can accept the direction of f4 you ll love the feeling of exploration the only problem with relying solely on discoveries is once you find everything there s little reason to return fallout for potatoes edition bethesda botched it again i ve been fortunate to be exposed to as few issues if i did i would find it hard to complain because my computer shouldn t be able to play this game for whatever reason bethesda has limited graphics options for low end users i had to install five performance mods to be able to play in a smooth state i also had to modify the configuration file for custom fov options i don t understand why the options are so sparse for low end users when they can play this game i find it more ridiculous how bethesda considers any mod to be cheating so you will not earn any achievements i honestly don t care for achievements but 70k people cared to mod out the problem it s rather fitting for a game that devalues player choices to have an options menu to reflect the same idea bethesda you have trust issuesthe lacking number of choices in f4 is staggering not because it s a fallout game but because it s a game from bethesda to give you some idea how sparse and insignificant choices are it took me 26 hours to come across my first skill check aside from dialogue to jury rig a fuse or install new cables i was given this area wasn t even part of the main storyline for perspective new vegas and even f3 had personality tests and objects to interact with certain skills in the very first room you had to specialize in specific skills to use the chem set repair the submachine gun or use an energy weapon efficiently f4 begins with a huge design change s p e c i a l s used to have a baseline of five meaning you had to sacrifice one stat to make yourself better all stats in f4 begin at one and only improve as shown in the perk chart you start with fewer points yes but their design is all about improving your character it s indicative of how much f4 deviates from past games f4 is not however entirely devoid of player choices choices in both story and gameplay are more macro in scale rather than the micro decisions f4 s storyline acts on rails for the first act of finding more information about your missing son like f3 the narrative hook gets you invested but the character s personality limits your role playing options f4 handles this far worse with a voiced protagonist as s he is treated like a parent figure once you learn about the factions the story begins to branch out side quests faction intermingling and random events offer the allusion of choice quests are boiled down to do it or don t it s only when you make your faction choice that has adverse effects on the world of f4 i think why so many fans complain about this storyline is because of how on rails it is because the actual story of f4 is one of bethesda s best aside from plot holes and lore mishaps what really gets in the way of the storyline is the amount of unkillable npcs there s no threat in f4 that warrants them which limits any deviation of the plot as for character builds i think many people oversimplify the perks system while it is true that many characters will share perks like cap collector for barter and strength for inventory the game almost encourages you to specialize like f3 enemies scale with you leading to some bullet sponge nonsense in the future especially legendaries i say this system almost encourages specialization the one huge set back is how bethesda limits your perks by arbitrary level caps there is no need for this as leveling up gives you one perk if you want to max out your dr then you ll waste a lot more bullets on enemies again bethesda seems to be untrustworthy of the player it also is an annoying way to gate the crafting system until level forty the other negative aspect of perks is how boring they are they are percentage increases or passive modifiers like being able to ignore radiation when drinking water you ll still want to level up in this game but not because of making characters of your own improved lackluster featuresbefore i talk about the survival mechanics i do want to briefly list changes that i do don t enjoy about f4 improvements radiation now is a threat as it drains your max hp by exposure or hits by radiated enemies environments are distinct by the colorful art style and the expanded enemy variety of f4 the workshop settlements is a very casual role playing option that has no real relevance it s a shame how it means a lot more in survival mode the interface however is janky with its first person camera companions while still simple are fleshed out by their voice acting the interplay with the player and other npcs and companions is very lively perks can be used to specialize lone character builds companions can use some skills you lack most factions are still morally binary but they are a little more complex than f3 except the minutemen power armor while they give it to you way too early and fuel is far from scarce the option of power armor helps builds with low hp or carryweight not have a slow start on harder difficulties lackluster features companion karma system is half baked you have to try to anger them when you have them around many perks feel like name brand recognition than useful bonuses weapon variety is misleading pipe weapons are the most versatile weapons you ll find as many weapons have one specific weapon type offering only an automatic or semi auto option automatic guns are weak until you max out the commando skill the game has a confusing balance between scavenging and bartering you ll need to do both to get anywhere only the railroad gets to be a double agent for factions i feel like bethesda missed an opportunity for fleshing out quests with a more double sided independent character like the courier every survival game of the last ten years is herei don t bemoan the inclusion of the survival mechanics but i wish they weren t so bare bones as previously mentioned there are level caps for the crafting options they don t feel like balancing the game which is what the resources should be used for but rather an arbitrary means to keep the best weapons away from you it s only when you play the survival mode do the settlements become more important for your basic needs and the number of them too diseases preparation of your supplies on hand the amount of damage you and enemies deal and other new features showcases how great f4 can be as a survival game if it was made to be one but then you realize that f4 is not a survival game how can a bethesda game which always has bugs ctds and other technical issues make a mode where you can only save in beds these inclusions are frankly gameplay additions that only pad out the content for the long run or point out an identity crisis of f4 it s a sin to tell a liei think many people are rightfully upset with how f4 is more akin to far cry than fallout it doesn t mean f4 is a bad game it s a great game for 100 hours of content however f4 doesn t do enough to retain old fans with the love for the wasteland
