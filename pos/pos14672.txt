2017 hard to understand some of the negative reviews no at the present time this is not as complete of a game as civ 5 nor as balanced it certainly has some issues but this is the biggest single overhaul of the civ franchise so far they ve introduced a lot of really interesting and innovative concepts that admittedly do need some tweaking but are not inherently flawed and in fact really make it a unique and fun product there are some big cons that need to be addressed but as i will get to all of the negatives are fixable problems the core gameplay is as good as any version of civ and will only be built upon now let s get to the breakdown pros the district system is excellent and makes you think a lot more about how you want every city to play out the concept of builders really removes the tedium of worker management that has plagued every other version of civ no global happiness the worst concept of civ 5 has been thrown out the window in place of a localized amenity happiness system and for the better the return of large empires a lot of people seem to see the fact that you re encouraged to expand more as a negative but to me it s definitely a positive you now feel like you re building large sprawling empires but it s not just settler spam everywhere that said victory paths for building tall are still available for those who wish to play that way the graphics are absolutely gorgeous yeah i know people miss the realistic graphics of civ 5 but i find the graphical style of 6 to be far more aesthetically pleasing i love the colors and the way the maps look better designed maps movement across maps feels more natural and the maps just feel less crowded city states are better in 5 you could get by without significant city state diplomacy unless you were going for a diplomatic victory but they feel like a much more important and impactful part of the game now suzerain bonuses were an excellent addition early game pacing also feels better than in 5 the religious victory is a great addition and religion in general just builds off of what 5 gave us and turns it into a more dynamic impactful feature the most fun games i ve had have usually focused on religion tech tree specialization encourages different play styles and advancement paths splitting of tech tree into science and civics is a cool idea card style civics system to replace social policies is great for adjusting play style to current conditions love the idea of leader agendas although there will be more about this in the cons section spies are so much more useful and flexible than in 5 can combine units into corps and armies in mid late game which is excellent for unit management combination of civics cards tech tree branching and district usage encourages alternative play styles and long term strategic thinking to a greater extent than in any previous version most importantly it still has that great just 1 more turn civ feel cons diplomacy has been nerfed aside from luxury trading and war there s not much reason to contact the ai deals often feel imbalanced as well although the 2 patches so far have helped somewhat there s no world congress or diplomatic victory in general which makes the late game feel a bit empty diplomacy is especially bad when it comes to the leader agendas it s impossible for every civ to like you because i think the diplomatic bonuses penalties are too weighted towards agendas the ai denounces you far too often in 5 when you were denounced it was a big deal in 6 being denounced just happens all the time this is made worse by the overly long diplomatic animations the animations themselves are great but they re too intrusive ai is mostly incompetent when it comes to warfare especially when it comes to taking cities they re too passive cannot use siege ranged units effectively and don t upgrade their units often enough the pacing of the late game doesn t feel right you blow through the tech tree too quickly and production times just get too long in the late game it s possible to advance far along on either the civics or science tree while leaving the other behind and there s far greater tech disparities between civs than ever existed in previous versions i often finish the tech tree before properly utilizing late game units tech tree is too branchy there s too many dead end techs and some missing prerequisites that allow advancement along certain tech paths to be too op simply not make sense missing a few key notifications such as a notification for city bombardment and some of the ui feels incomplete or cluttered city screens need an overhaul for example and trade routes really need to be sortable no team games come on firaxis what are you doing here this is one of those things that feels generally inexcusable no workshop support yet not a huge deal for me personally at the moment but something that is definitely vital for the community that may seem like a long list of cons but the thing about the cons is that they re all fixable problems firaxis has created an excellent base game and a wonderful set of features that gives 6 the potential to be a very deep consistently compelling game i have faith that they can fix the ai to at least reach an enjoyably competent level and that further patches and eventual expansions will add additional diplomatic options some big time balancing is needed in the late game especially but again that s a fixable problem people want to compare it to civ 5 with all of its patches and expansions honestly 6 is a more complete game than 5 was on initial launch and i remember people complaining about a lot of the same things i have no problem with any of the base features of the game the cons all have to do with the ai diplomacy and balance that i have faith will be sorted out with time currently would give an 8 5 10 but there s the potential for a 10 10 game here still would recommend especially if you aren t going to compare every feature to the complete edition of civ 5
