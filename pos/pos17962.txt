2023 after warhammer iii left yet another sour taste in my mouth i decided to revisit rome 2 since i hadn t played it in a while and wanted to see if maybe i was burnt out of total war i started a slightly modded campaign as macedon on vh and decided to do a wc i had an absolute blast playing it and it gave me many nostalgic vibes from the campaigns i ve played across the years personally i believe that rome 2 is the crown jewel of total war as i sit here with about 750 hrs making it the 2 most played game on my 9 year old account it s just a fantastic game and remains one of my all time favorites if you want an indepth explanation of why i think it s so good then i ll leave one below but to sum it up this game is excellent and i highly recommend it to anyone who likes war games it s a very easy to learn game and still remains fun on the harder difficulties that i play on ai 8 10 i didn t realize how much better the ai is in this game than the newer games untii i played warhammer 3 the ai will regularly attempt to fight your armies invade you and likes to put up a fight i couldn t even tell if this game has an anti player bias which is shocking when compared to the egregious way the ai behaves in wh 3 ignoring the 4 stacks bearing down on its country just to raid your settlements i cannot tell you how refreshing it is to not have the ai constantly moving out of your attack range and instead choosing to sack as many undefended settlements as possible of course the ai isn t amazing but it feels more realistic in this game and less manufactured in battles the ai is competent enough to give you a fight they are fairly predictable but a lot harder to cheese which makes the battles so much more enjoyable to play it s just nice to play against an ai that feels fair rather than an ai that is dumb and manufactured to be aggravating empire building economy world map 8 10 my favorite part of the total war series is empire building and developing provinces until you can make a super economy and fund elite armies in rome 2 that aspect of the game feels great you can specialize certain provinces to produce certain types of income and build them accordingly to maximize profits researching specific technologies may help you in one area but delay you in another there are plenty of choices to make when it comes to the economy and what to divert funds to the ai doesn t straight up refuse to make deals with you and is generally open to trading and alliances public order isn t that big of a pain to manage like it is in the newer games and even on the harder difficulties you shouldn t have that much issue managing it i actually like the fact that you can t permanently remove cultures from the game since that is historically accurate the vast majority of regions would never be 100 one religion or culture the food mechanic isn t a massive issue and honestly i kinda like it with all of that said rome 2 has probably the worst mechanic in any total war game which is corruption i have no idea why they designed corruption to function the way it does with your economy getting worse as your empire expands you get to the point where it can actually be harmful to expand because the amount of money you lose to corruption is directly related to the amount of provinces you own it s an awful mechanic that is frustrating to deal with and should have been either tempered or replaced entirely this section would get a 10 if not for that god awful mechanic and the middling politics system it s better than it was at launch but is still largely able to be ignored or bought off all in all still really fun factions 9 10 this game has a very good variety of factions that each play differently the romans will play completely different than the parthians for example and don t function the same at all most nations will end up have a similar build but the unit variety is wide enough to the point where it s not an issue for me the only issue i really have with the factions is the fact that the barbarian factions feel very copy pasted they all field basically the same unit roster with little to no change which makes it feel kinda eh other than that i enjoyed playing the wide variety of factions rome 2 gives you battles 10 10 this might be a slight hot take but i absolutely love the battles in this game i m not sure if its because i m writing this review after playing wh 3 whose battles are so atrocious that it makes anything else seem like a ray of sunlight but the battles in this game are really fun i found myself actively wanting to play battles in this game even if i could autoresolve them i love the roman era unit design and i thought the weather feature was a great touch fighting massive battles in giant rainstorms the desert snow covered forests etc was extremely fun playing differently depending on who i was fighting or fighting as was also fun nomads vs hellenic as an example i just found myself always wanting to fight more and to this day i have not had a total war have that effect on me the unit rosters are massive and there are so many different units you can use and fight against during the course of a campaign graphics performance 9 10 i actually think the graphics for this game have held up pretty well i genuinely would rather look at this game than wh 3 which is shocking considering this game is almost 10 years older the only thing that looks kinda weird are the faces of the units they look like play doh and look really off the game runs beautifully and doesn t suffer from the awful performance issues that plague attila to this day i ve had 1 crash in the past 300 400 hours and 0 glitches it s just nice playing a game that actually feels finished and bug free which is crazy considering the way the game launched instead of the dumb crap ca puts out nowadays music 5 10 eh it s alright i still vastly prefer rome 1 s soundtrack over this one but it isn t the worst in the world it isn t annoying like wh 3s is but it s still rather forgettable dlc 7 10 this will be the first game i ve reviewed that does not get a 0 in the dlc category that is because i actually think the dlc campaigns in this game are extremely good a large amount of the time i ve put into the game was in the dlc campaigns like empire divided ror and the like the unique scenarios that they bring make them in my opinion worth buying you get a good amount of factions even up to 8 10 in some cases and it s like buying a different game the reason it doesn t get a higher grade is because of the existence of faction packs i am of the opinion that faction packs are a cash grab and should not exist other than that i think the dlc is actually worth buying and i find myself enjoying those campaigns even more than the main game at times mod support 10 10 rome 2 has arguably the best mod for the post shogun 2 era total wars which is dei that mod and the amount of work that has gone into it are only truly rivaled by mk 1212 ad for attila it expands or overhauls every single feature in the game and floods it with historically accurate units and extremely cool campaign features besides that the game has plenty of mods that customize units remove bad features corruption create a cleaner ui etc plenty of options to create a customized campaign none of the mods block achievements as well which is a huge added bonus conclusionrome 2 remains my favorite total war of all time and one of the best games i ve ever played i love this period in history and i m glad the game survived it s rough launch 9 10 years ago it s blossomed into a fantastic game that i enjoy far more than ca s newer products final grade 9 10 top tier wargame
