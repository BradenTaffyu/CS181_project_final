2021 early access review i know i havent really played this game in the past two weaks or at all really but i know not much has changed since i last picked it up so in good faith i know what i have to say will cover the basics and give you an idea of what youre getting into to start if youre not one who enjoys realisim and survival mechanics i would say this is a no go this is a game wher eyou can die from a scratch if you dont know whats up every single sound has a source and that includes those made by your own character even walking attracts attention sneaking is only beneficial to a point be it because you set off an alarm or stupidly sprinted past a horde and no longer have stamina you will have to contend with the undead one way or another and thats where we get into the injury system you have to be careful constantly if you break a window clear the glass before you climb through or you will cut yourself and without treatment die if you fight the undead keep a persons distance away from them at all times if you sustain injury from the horde there is a 5 to 70 chance of infection depending on the wound sustained and if you are infected thats it youre dead might not be now but you will be and there is no cure beyond the injury system might i suggest keep your health pannel up at all times we have the hunger system fairly general eat food drink water take meds the catch is there will only be food when you start the world whats there is all there will be and the rot counters begin immediately meaning you may survive for a month or so in your starting location having picked it clean and cooked all th e food available but after that better hope you set up a farm because going to the next town over will only give you slim pickings of canned food which is incredibly valuable and rotted produce and to end off the basic concepts of the game the skill system the biggest time sink of the game near everything you do will have a skill associated with it the exp counters are incredibly long naturally you wont learn how to shoot a gun by popping 10 zombies in the head after all after 10 bullets could you tell me how to handle recoil what blow back is how to clear a malfunction your character is in most ways an ordinary citizen and will need to learn how to survive on the fly books are an amazing way to increase your skills but they take a long time thankfully there is aspeed up option in t he game to pass time faster however noises that might alert you to danger may pass you by while using it and of course you still need to eat you will likely have to carry that book with you and dip into it whenever you have a safe moment and a snack in your pocket now at the end of this you might be thinking this is complicated yeah it is but thats realisim and thats what this game is about if you dont keep your head on straight your senses sharp and your inventory managed you will suffer struggle or die learning and mastering the challenges your world has set for you is the crux of this games fun and my god is it addicting so keep those eyes sharp those ears sharper and try to last one year in the game do that on the default settings and i daresay youve had fun
