2022 very fun and challenging it was longer then i thought at first the elephant scene is just heartbreaking the voice acting is 110 spot on moon baboon is such an awesome character so much variety and so many mini games it s hard to pick a favourite area in the game the snow area i loved it the garden area i loved it ahahahh the frogs the story itself is amazing and it s a blast i have played trough the game 3 times now 100 achievements worth it hellz yeah i would actually want them to make more of this but its hard to somehow justify that with the story we got an ending and its a very satisfying one but i want more
