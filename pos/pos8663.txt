2019 thehunter call of the wild is a good game after 60 hours if you like hunting down targets in a fps or particularly sniper games such as sniper elite then you ll like this i d recommend that 1 you head to the areas on the map where islands or lake shore meet in the reeds marshland in some cases you get loads of tracks and need zones you get most of the animals moving through these areas everything from coyotes to bears in some cases pick an island or raised ground sit under a tree profit 2 get the quad bike dlc it makes traversing the map fun even if it does scare all the wildlife away its also good for rounding up downed animals following the blood trail etc 3 use the correct weapon and ammunition for the target animals this will get you a better score which improves the speed of promotion perks upgrade unlocks etc4 don t buy the hides in layton lake they are in general bad value for money scout the area around for tracks first even then going prone in the marshy areas will get you better chances of successful kills buy better weapons lures and ammo instead 5 review the info on this page stick to one map and visit all the locations on the map don t necessarily do the primary and secondary quests get your skill up first my highest score to date is for shooting a rabbit larger targets so far are not automatic one shot kill even within 30 feet with the best rifle in the game however if you think you are going to one shot kill everything then you need to rethink animals bigger than rabbits may require a long walk to find the carcass even if you hit them in the lungs neck etc even with the best rifle in the game it can be buggy for example spawning wildlife can get stuck in the environment normally trees you can take a picture of the same bear twice for one of the side questsdoes the scoring system actually work the bigger game i have downed with one bullet gives me a poor quick kill score animals can run out of the area and de spawn which means the blood trail will end without a confirmed kill and wasted bullets
