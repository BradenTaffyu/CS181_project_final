2022 a powerful story rich game that almost made me cry the horror element is more passive than active similar to jumpscares in horror games the game s uneasy and anxious atmosphere in one section and the cute and lighthearted segments contrast nicely with how the story is presented in the other the little secrets and hidden easter eggs make the world feel more natural and ready to pique our interest in the world we are presented with omori is like climbing a mountain reaching the peak and then immediately climbing a bigger mountain sure climbing the mountain is a big part of the fun but sometimes you just want to sit back and take in the scenery to see this masterpiece you ll have to play it yourself i went in blind and it was the best experience of my life aside from the severe depression i suffered overall omori is a fantastic and impactful game that i believe everyone should play but be prepared for its excruciating pacing i rate it 10 10 i highly recommend this game
