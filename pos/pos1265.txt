2021 early access review this game has really picked up some steam with the beta of build 41 out i will back up my save this game is certainly quite a fun isometric experience with a rich modding community the gameplay is fully moddable to your preferences you want romero style shamblers like me you can turn them all into slow walkers that have high strength and are fragile if you want you can even turn off respawning and clear the map of zombies personally i like to do both of these things and set it so there are huge hordes of zombies at the start in all i ve owned this game for years and pick it up whenever there is a major update of note are the 1 incredible cooking system that can take account of nutrition in what you are eating or not it can be turned off basically you can make a burger or casserole or bake whatever you have on hand or boil the choices of cooking here are near endless as the ingredients cooked rat and vegetable burgers 6 months into the apocalypse must start looking good of note is also the rather robust fishing system whether you farm fish or forage it s up to you how to feed yourself after all the food runs out item respawns are by default off but can be turned on so you can reloot hoses if you want to customize it that way 2 good crafting system this accounts for a majority of surviving in the late game as gas and water shuts off you need to find a way to deal with cooking and watering yourself and possibly even a base 3 surprisingly well made construction system make a base or build inside a house and take it over the choices are nearly as endless you can even pick up and move furniture including sinks which can be hooked up to rainbarrels within a few tiles and up 1 level i have a full exterior kitchen in case i accidentally leave food in an oven that is turned on fire with running water and hooked up to a generator to power the electric appliances if needed generators inside a building will as expected fill it up with carbon monoxide and eventually kill you and a 3 floor base with all exterior surfaces plastered to look good and painted black i strongly recommend if you do end up getting this game to try out the workshop mods of particular note to me was brita s weapons mod and the car towing mod both of those are quite excellent just make sure you have the ones for your current version as 41 can only be accessed through the betas tab atm at the time of writing this and as a long term owner of the game i have to give it a solid 9 5 10 and once 41 goes multiplayer would give a 10 10 would buy again
