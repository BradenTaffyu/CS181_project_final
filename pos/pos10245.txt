2017 early access review i ve been playing videogames for more years than i will admit here a lot of them through steam but i ve never before felt the urge to write a review well i can t think of a better game for my first one in my humble opinion it is a revolution in the genre yes some can argue that alot of the mechanics and concepts were there before but they are put in such a great way that makes it one of the best games i ve ever played it does have a lot of innovations on its own the depth of the simulation is huge specially regarding everything related to the colonists mood health addictions etc i ve had to face some very interesting ethical dilemmas while trying to make my colonists survive for example should i feed and spend my precious medicines on this prisoner which i may not be able to recruit or do i want his organs to heal my only firefighter some of them even kept me thinking about it hours after playing the game after extrapolating them to real world scenarios that adds a lot to the replayability not to mention the customizable start settings and the different storytellers you can play a peaceful not that easy colony builder or a hardcore survival blood fest game depending on your mood harder difficulties and unfair storytellers are great for epic histories of battles and heroic deeds but also for sad while amazing stories like the colony that was lost after a sinister incident involving serial killing that started when someone s yorkshire terrier died a minor incident can lead through a cascade of disasters that will ruin your settlements if you don t notice and correct it while you can the artwork is simple but great and the music wow seriously spot on one of the few games where i keep the music on after all this time playing edit rimworld was available through the official website years before it was added to steam don t trust the hour record 10 10 definitely recommendedruffus we will always remember you
