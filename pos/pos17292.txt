2019 oh boi never thought i will get myself into a total war game so much before warhammer 2 i have played total war shogun 2 but never finish any campaigns after warhammer 2 i have already beaten several campaigns on very hard and normal difficulty and still going it s probably my one of favorite rts games before this game i have only played shogun 2 in total war series it s addicted there are so many different races and each of them are unique to play when you get bored of one playthrough just start a new one by choosing a different faction or race and bam it s now a brand new feeling it s probably a shame to say but of all the factions in the both games my favorite one is chaos warriors despite of its tedious gameplay mechanic and thanks to this game it got me into warhammer fantasy as well before that i am only similar with warhammer 40k and never interested in the fantasy one never thought i would enjoying watching dinosaurs smashing enemy troopers so much it just felt so enormous and magnificent for me and what s the cons about the game probably your time and money for that amount of dlcs oh well i don t know by sigmar i know i am biased and i don t care try the first game on sale if you are not sure dark god edition for the first game is a pretty good choice main game 2 dlcs and maybe some of the dlcs but it s totally up to you
