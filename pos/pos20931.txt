2015 note i have beat the game and all of the achievements this game is amazing it leaves you with feels for even the worst of the worst characters it s the story of a girl trying to save the world and in so doing fu ing everything up so that she has to keep trying to save it some more the music and voice acting in the game were wonderful and the characters are unique and complex as a female gamer i love seeing a strong female lead or i should perhaps say leads there are times when i look at chloe and max and roll my eyes but trust me they do grow this game has replayability because you can change your choices after beating the game i see several places where i might have done things different had i known the end that in itself gives credit to the game as clever as i think i am i didn t foresee the end i hope they make a life is strange 2 or something similar because this was a true joy to play warning stay off the life is strange forums until you beat this if you do plan on playing it if you have a question google it the forum is full of spoilers in the thread titles alone i also saw a slight spoiler by reading a post in the news section that pops up in the game library
