2023 early access review i ve had this game for over 3 years now and though i always loved the aesthetic i just couldn t get into it it felt like a lot of classic roguelikes something that would be great to learn but i just don t have the time or patience to figure out all these complex systems so i kept trying over those 3 years in 5 minute intervals but it never really stuck until this week when it just suddenly clicked and now its gone up to my become one of my favourite games perhaps even my absolute favourite the best advice i can give to new players who don t really understand what to do is this ignore your instincts read the text i know like me you probably just want to skip over it and get to the actual game but this game relies heavily on it and in fairness to it is nice to read too for example when you collect a quest you ll be told everything you need to know the map doesn t point you to where to go and the quest log only contains some basic information there s so much i could say about this game and i ve barely scratched the surface but i ll leave it here if you like roguelikes and are willing to put in a little effort this is quite possibly the best out there
