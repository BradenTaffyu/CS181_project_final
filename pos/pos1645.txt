2022 10 10 recommended game ever and best game i ve ever playednier automata is no ordinary game this is more than just a game the delivery of a really unusual and unique story is a good important point in this game there are 5 story routes in this game which are actually not suitable to be called routes because i personally think these 5 routes are 1 complete story this is truly a unique and appropriate way of telling the story to explain the complex philosophical elements contained in the story likewise other mechanisms such as the combat system which is very smooth and satisfying there is also another mechanism namely hacking here we as players play a retro shooter minigame and this is very fun spoiler alert the whole game actually interprets the concept of the teachings of nihilism through the various experiences we experience in this game this game questions and discusses humanity science religion and ideology we as humans are a product of our environment not of our own self discovery we are religious we have ideology unconsciously because of environmental influences in the game we are often confronted by places that make us have self reflection such as places that seem very alone long dark alleys here we are given time to question what we have been through why we did it our position as a player kills a lot of enemy robots because this is natural for us we know we have to do that because it s an objective and we never question it especially when we play as 2b continuing the story 9s is an android who first understands the reality of the world and also about yorha because it is told that 9s is the best android model that has a high level of curiosity therefore he became the first android to know about the whole truth about humans about aliens about androids about machine lifeforms and about the world whenever 9s discovers a new reality he is always stopped by 2b and remains ultimately focused on the mission assigned to them when compared to the real world it s like religion when we come across questions that are difficult for religion to answer we are simply told to believe in religion and they say that logic will never reach religion 9s which was created with the aim of protecting mankind began to question what the meaning of life would be if humans were in fact extinct because humans are the gods of the androids and android is in charge of protecting humans the androids and machine lifeforms know that their presence on earth is meaningless because human as the god of android is gone likewise with the aliens who are gods of machine lifeforms they knew they were an artificial existence their consciousness and emotions are not real we can see from various moments in the game that there are many machine lifeforms that have feelings such as love peace hatred envy and fear at the end a2 tells 9s that 2b is 2e which is an android model created to kill others 9s who knows the fact that his partner namely 2b is 2e still finds it difficult to believe this because 9s is too attached and does have a strong bond with 2b everything that lives in nier s world just spins around endlessly death has no meaning life has no price the endless war always continues because both parties always hold fast to their respective beliefs or religions all live in an endless cycle of cycles both parties as much as possible imitate what humans have and what humans do in fact machines and humans are very different humans can value life because they can die and never come back unlike machines and androids if they die they can get a new body and have the same memories as the previous body that s what makes the lives of machines and androids completely meaningless in this game that discusses the concept of nihilism at the final ending we are given a very difficult mini game we are given light and given an enlightenment that we can pass all kinds of difficult obstacles if there is a sense of togetherness and love for others with the arrival of other players who protect us players who help us have to give up their game savedata just being erased to help those of us who are having trouble all the people who help us none of them badmouth us all of them give positive and supportive words they sacrificed their attachment to this game to help us someone they don t know everything that is impossible becomes possible if we all go through it together overall i recommend this game at least you have to finish this game once in your life it s not just a game it s a life experience thank you square enix and platinum games for providing a life experience through beautifully wrapped games it s my first time writing a long review and sorry for bad english because i use translation
