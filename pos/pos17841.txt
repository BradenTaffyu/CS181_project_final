2023 i m an average coh player since 2006 i have played all products of this franchise so i can also express myself from my experience of the previous coh1 and coh2 what i like about coh3 the presence of italian units base buildings can be constructed without engaging engineers being able to report toxic players more easily being able to recover abandoned weapons with support trucks units can also retreat directly from inside buildings some units can raid enemy occupied buildings what i dislike about coh3 the north afrika campaign is unexciting when i think back to the coh1 campaigns in other words i was expecting a north afrika in a bigger style with great battles and tactics and emotional involvement with the soldiers instead each mission are just small skirmishes with horrendous slideshows that tell the hardships of the local populations under the italo german occupation no in game cutscenes no involvement with the historical spirit of those battles the menu currently is definitely poor no profile customization and static and depressing background image the shop currently is limited to selling skins at crazy prices absence of custom commanders like coh2 many call them commanders pay to win but i do not agree at all custom commanders if properly balanced allow for a more varied and enjoyable experience at the end of the multiplayer game the lobby is destroyed matchmaking is dedicated to the victory point game only if you want to play annihilation mode you are forced to look into custom games often dealing with hosts with toxic behavior annoying with attitudes of omnipotence who set up spam style maps and spam style modes with a central bridge and a game that will be an artillery spam some hosts are permanently afk in the lobby making you wait unnecessarily if you create a game and your friends are offline you could wait hours to fill it the quality of the animations compared to coh1 2 is noticeably lower what i would like to see implemented matchmaking that lets you choose between victory points and annilathions there should be a tool to close lobbies of inactive hosts there should be a tool for ragequitters to be detected and associated with other ragequitters as is the case in gta v in order to prevent them from ruining games for others the same goes for toxic players and team killers too there should be a tool to silence annoying players during the game who spam abuse pings at you and pretend through various insults to command your units there should be a tool to customize the look of your units like war thunder and not sell predefined skins at crazy prices sell the tools instead of the same finished product for everyone there should be a tool to customize the armaments of your tanks like battlefield 5 add more units and commanders like coh2 goliaths king tigers m26 pershing tank v1 v2 missles bunker with mortar etc etc snipers must be able to infiltrate and remain camouflaged without shooting by walking slowly as in coh1 with ample visibility this would allow for spying and planning and don t just walk at their standard speed to be detected by any enemy the knight s cross holders in the wehrmacht from coh1 the italian paratroopers of the folgore in the dak other missions involving the italians and the wehrmacht such as the greek campaign improve the ui coh2 ui was awesome ability to occupy neutral buildings and build operational bases there regards
