2022 90 of all negative reviews are either talking aboutdlc price which is a fair point but i m okay with it because i have been playing this game for 5 years and every time i leave for a few months something new has been added that makes the game feel fresh and new even after 800 hoursnew updates being bad i honestly have no idea why they even think this although if i had too assume it is that they dislike the new economy changes every major update because they can no longer win as easyor the game being severely unbalanced which is fair point but i feel that being completely un balanced is a part of the spirit of stellaris stellaris is the best 4x game if you want to roleplay and in order to be whatever you want to be balance needs to go out the window you can start on a ringworld a endgame megastructure or you can start with your planet exploding within the first few decades of the game you can start on a paradise planet with everything you need just right there or you can start as boulder people who yeet asteroids at planets they want to live on making the planet near uninhabitable which isn t good at all like seriously that origin is terrible but i love it stellaris is a game where you can be whatever you want and i feel like that upsets a lot of people who want a strategy game that is balanced and fair so they can win but trying to beat stellaris is like trying to win at reading a book the fun part comes from the journey stellaris is probably one of the best if not the best 4x grand strategy games you can get and i highly recommend
