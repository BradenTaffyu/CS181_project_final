2023 i had my fears regarding this game since dow 3 but i was pleasantly suprised the gameplay itself is very good and fluid its juts fun to play the factions are all interesting esp the axis ones imo and i have not experienced an ingame bug that has decided a game for me yet with that said the game still need some work regarding features and quality of life things that one would expect to be in at the current price point will be very fun to see what kind of battlegroups will be added to the game later on
