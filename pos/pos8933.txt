2019 well then after 150 hours it s finally time to make a review stellaris difficulty a toddler could beat this easy medium hard harder dark soulscomment this game takes some getting into but once you get the ui and all the concepts it s not too hard story non existent non existent but good for rping bad decent good epiccomment this is a map game where you make your own nation so of course it s great for rping dlc non existent not worth buying but reasonably priced not worth buying and overpriced worth buying but overpriced worth buying and reasonably pricedcomment this game s dlc isn t overpriced per se it s just that there s a lot of it if you need a guide to what dlc to buy i d say utopia and apocalypse first graphics adobe flash player drawn by a 3rd grader decent good very good looks exactly like realitycomment the ships look fabulous really bugs glitches very few some but nothing too major might sometimes be gamebreaking fallout 76comment the checkbox explains itself pretty well here other info the ai is stupid idiotic i recommend getting a mod that improves it while on the topic of mods this game allows you to mod anything so check out the workshop overall score 9 10 this game is really really good minus the ai and the amount of dlcs and the occasional bugs overall a solid buy but not a must have hey thanks for reading this comment suggestions and grammar spelling corrections to help me improve my reviews
