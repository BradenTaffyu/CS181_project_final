2020 product received for free early access review singleplayer in this game is a step up from warband for me battles feel like they pack a punch sieges have been vastly improved giving the defenders a clear buff still but not as meat grindy as warband s sieges speaking of sieges upgrading your towns is more meaningful and visually represented your party members are now members of your clan and you can have them do quests for you or form their own parties more battle commands and formations to make the combat feel better helping ai armies can get you control of a bunch of their units grouped up by category and the ai commander will perform a grand battle plan where it gives orders to you and the other ai commanders if you want to buy bannerlord for multiplayer only i highly suggest you hold of for now personally i find captain and siege to be interesting experiences but the skirmish mode is quite garbage on top of that there is a class system for multiplayer with very limited choices for equipment gone are the days of making your own builds or taking funny equipment for a siege battle or deathmatch since the alpha test the developers have made it clear that they absolutely won t move an inch away from the class system so no luck expecting that to get better taleworld s priority is currently heavily towards sp and thus mp is not really getting much attention beyond fixing crashes or critical bugs fixing glitches on maps is a rare thing to see owing to all of that i can easily recommend the game for sp but not for mp
