2018 can t drive 55i ve had euro truck sim 2 for awhile now but i remember watching the game notifications pop up all the time when my friends were playing back before i took the plunge and tried the game myself i wondered what could be so fun about driving trucks as opposed to racing games when i finally got the game on sale i realized of course 1 trucks will be driven yeah definitely that 2 the euro map is incredibly fun to explore with several expansion countries 3 the paint jobs are cool to paint and paint over and repaint so many designs 4 building your own trucks upgrading to better parts choosing models and makes that 5 hiring employees to make you money so you can paint more trucks for your own fleet of trucks you won t let anyone else drive 6 the engineering marvels bridges etc around the maps 7 the ai drivers you can shove them around and wreck in hilarious ways accidentally and or on purpose there s more but i need to go repaint my truck it s a great game though and i highly recommend it and i m looking forward to the beyond the baltic expansion but there is a learning curve be prepared to wrap your truck around the highway guardrails many times as you are learning to drive a rig unless you are an ace game driver unlike some of us who are prone to see the highway upside down every now and again
