2020 tl dr still very buggy though i havent encountered anything progress halting or game breaking microtransactions are not pay to win despite what people say except scrap box definitely can be considered an unfair advantage game itself is very fun with my favorite map from the series and lots of unique locations story isn t anything special but the voice acting makes it more than bearable overall a solid game if you can look past the bugs and i recommend it to fans of the series willing to look past these cons so i bought the game on bethesda a few days before wastelanders released as i wanted to experience the game in its original state to see how much of a difference wastelanders would make first few hours were incredibly boring and i almost regretted buying it however i pushed through and started to see how the game could be enjoyable i enjoyed putting together stories through the holotapes i d come across and felt a strong sense of progress through leveling and starting to find more powerful weapons however like many of the complaints around the launch the world felt lonely wastelanders drops i m around level 25 with a good chunk of story completed and immediately start the wastelanders story right off the bat the dialogue system felt better than ever with view dof shifts good voice acting and likable characters skill checks fallout 3 nv dialogue menu return which was a big relief i play through the story making steady progress and enjoying myself as i go there were a few quests i hated looking at you hornwright hq but aside from those it felt great by the time i finished the story i was level 50 with a solid setup thats fine and all but what about the world itself with wastelanders many locations were revamped to include raiders settlers and other human factions some of these small locations are now my favorite to visit as they really feel lived in with their own small stories there are now random encounters many of which put a big smile on my face whether its two robots stuck in a conversation loop settlers who need help fighting off local fauna or wandering storytellers with tales of cryptids they all felt unique and fitting of the world next the gameplay loop the endgame is very grindy and in a way many wont like the new currency is capped at 200 a day with many of the best plans costing over a thousand i didn t get very invested in this grind though and still managed to get another 60 hours out of the game i loved walking around the world and trying to find every new location i could finding spots to farm legendary weapons helping new players with events and slowly shifting my build from sneaky sniper to huge unarmed damage while there is a clear meta for builds you can very easily get by in the hardest areas using whatever build you want as long as you pay some sort of attention to your damage output overall the endgame is mainly focused on getting good legendary rolls unlocking new blueprints for weapons and perfecting changing your build i see many complaints about the game that are either incredibly biased misinformed or straight up false information on the p2w front the only non cosmetic purchases are scrap kits which allow you to store whatever scrap you have remotely which is not worth it in the slightest and repair kits to repair on the go however there are repair benches scattered everywhere you can barely go 30 minutes without finding at least one bench and if thats not enough there are free repair kits that are better than the paid ones which you get simply by killing an endgame boss which many high level players grind the only remotely p2w aspect comes from fallout 1st of which complaints are completely valid unlimited scrap storage allows you to hold many more legendary drops consumables etc which is a pretty sizable advantage however none of this allows you to get better gear stats or character progression than free players rounding out this stupid long review that s probably a waste of time is it worth the price if you re on the fence i suggest waiting for a sale if you re a big fan and have seen gameplay that really interests you then i say go ahead and pay what you want this game gripped me harder than almost any other game for nearly 3 weeks straight which is unheard of for me i usually only play a game for a couple weeks tops before getting burnt out and swapping games i personally don t care about bethesda s lying about the impossibility of features only to add them later as it has 0 effect on my enjoyment of the game however i understand why many look down on it and refuse to purchase the game because of it anyways any negative reviews are nitpicking and biased i win bye bye
