2018 early access review this game is a really good sim i wanted this game for a bit now but when the 4th of july sale came i got it at first it was a took a bit learning the game still learning about it then i found out there was arcade and realistic transmission arcade transmission is kinda like grand theft auto when driving a car controls you hit brake button and you start reverse and i think it shifts for you if you re in manual and realistic is what it sounds like you have to put the car in reverse to backup and the brake button will only act like a brake but i really like this game a lot it has good scenarios and you can download more its highly realistic you hit the curb at 45 mph or bump into something you car alignment is messed up and will start moving to the right or the left you hit a wall at 65 mph and you re car is shattered it really shows you what happens if you crash at 65 mph it has cars that are pretty familiar looking pros very realistic and very fun and also has mods and download custom missionsit is like driving a real car unless you re using a keyboard a very good simulatorcons require a very good computer i have a very good computer running this game and it does get lag spikes and fps drops sometimes but not often wishlist from the developers to add on to the gameadd a driver so when you crash it will tell you if the driver is injured dead or unconsciousness add actual cars honda cars civic ford cars f 150 toyota 4 runner bmw s etc that would be a really cool addon add real life maps like for example paris with actual roads buildings i would really like to see fimilar maps like oakland ca or santa cruz c a try to work with google earth to see if it can help you not sure if this already there but have a realistic clutch i e car starts jerking or car stalls out etc but in reality this game is a very true sim worth the full price i would wait on sales like i did but if you really want to try the game out or looking for a sim go for it i would if i knew i was going to like it that much 100 reccomend highly reccomended for teenagers that use there phones while driving it will teach you what happens if crash or getting distracted for a moment what can lead up to it if you re kid does any of thouse things in real life buy them this and tell them what can and will happen recommend using a controller joystick or a actual stearing wheel with pedals this game will make me get a stearing wheel with pedals
