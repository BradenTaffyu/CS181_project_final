2017 im a little on the fence with this one because i enjoy the world i enjoy the guns for the most part and i enjoy the combat system but the story was in my opinion just like fallout 3 just switched a bit to me but the more i played the more i got into it and i had alot of fun although i wish they had a better speech system even though i kinda like that my character can talk but kinda don t because i like to imagine what he she sounds like but maybe thats just me i do wish obsidean makes the next game although i m begining to doubt it but it s a wishful dream but take my review how you want
