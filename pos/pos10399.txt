2018 early access review not a hardcore player here but i like a good simulatorthis is something special played ac forza7 pc1 pc2 but this is different comes really close to how real race looks like on live tv just done few laps and played replay and is simply stunning light shadows attention to details sound are fantastic no need to worry about how driving is going to feel controls feedback etc anyone who played ac will know why and it is a beta version so its just going to get better and betterplayed full hd on gtx980ti i7 4 5 8g ram ssd smooth no issues100 recommend
