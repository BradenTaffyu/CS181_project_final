2018 stardew valley is a great game don t be put off by the retro graphics or lack of guns and shiny fast paced action if you want those then chances are you may miss the point of the game the game for me was almost a little like inception as one of the reasons i game is to escape to get away from the stress and pressures of everyday life work and other in stardew valley you do just that the opening cut scene reveals a character who is unhappy with a dead end job and seemingly no prospects until they find a letter from their late grandfather bequeathing them a farm in stardew valley something he himself went and escaped to in his lifetime and you go and you farm you learn what works what doesn t you meet people you make friends and if you work hard at it maybe more you go fight monsters you learn to fish you help people but you are never bored except maaaaaaaybe in winter as there are always things to be done on a farm and there s plenty to explore as well the thing i like about the game are the layers in here as you become invested in your character you learn about the villagers you ve moved near to they each have their own backstories which you find out both directly and indirectly they each have things they love things they hate people they like too it s a reminder what life could and in the past in some places was be like and it has a lot of replayability value yes you ll go back in understanding the farming and some of the mechanics but that gives you freedom to make different choices and concentrate on other things so move on up and settle yourself in to stardew valley and regain some lost sanity and some hope
