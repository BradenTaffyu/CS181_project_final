every character is either a reflection a continuation a criticism or tribute to a wide and varied variety of cultures classical literature with the framing of the story itself as cyberpunk retelling of dante s inferno beautifully dark cyberpunk dystopia the director literally began making games because he was tired of the lack of video games made for and touching on mature themes things are only light because there is darkness if you re fed up of stories about cheap redemption perfectly black and white narratives with barely any grey then this is the story for you the light only shines at the end because it s dark beautiful art beautiful and stunning music every chapter so far has ended with a stellar mili song the game is a simplistic match 3 game where you create a chain of symbols which denote your attacks so it s very easy to get into but don t let that simplicity fool you every boss has mechanics that require you to think read their abilities and work around the torrent of nasty things coming your way gacha but incredibly forgiving with acquisition mechanics like there is no other gacha game on the market this generous or forgiving you can easily grind out everything as long as you pace yourself you don t need dupes to max anyone the grind is very forgiving and really favours a few runs a week for the best time spent to pay out ratio but that s not stopping you going hard with the grind if you wish i have everything and don t even really pull for anything anymore i just buy them out with shards in game tokens you don t pay for but get from playing the content the devs run a cute cafe next door neutral this game has a massive trigger warning go read it not all events are voiced which is a shame but understandable they are a small indie studio
