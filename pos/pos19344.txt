as a veteran classic rts gamer but never played any aoe series before i can t praise enough how good this game is issues linux crashes quite often during my campaign play but not now in skirmish mode fear i hope they stop adding too many civs which imo would ruin the game in the end it is already too much fow newbies to digest things i m really impressed campaign game is quite good and interesting but would be great if they added more civs stories observer mode is extremely helpful and well done for people to learn with high rank players i ve watched several exciting matches online already dynamic map generation nice i mean there s no more reasons to still play sc2 war3 c c etc compared to aoe4 unless you are really into modern weapons and planes in the air i suggest people still playing those come over and make this game bigger
