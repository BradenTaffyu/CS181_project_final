2017 i am so glad i gave this series another chance never played anything warhammer played all total war games wasn t happy with the series after shogun 2 i wanted my medieval 2 with better graphics new units epic battles and new diplomatic options my thoughts well i just buy tw warhammer and play as the empire it ll be kind of like what i want i guess got no other options anyway and it s on sale holy crap what have i gotten myself into the battles look awesome the units really interact finishers and beheadings and everything and not just stand there stare at each other the campaign has so many factions and you can have real alliances and confederations and it s not just siege after siege after siege and random crap from the ai the campaign map is really diverse and the races play very different this is now my favourite game of the last couple of years just try without any dlc and see if it s the same for you edit 500 hours later and all i want to say is bring me to my men
