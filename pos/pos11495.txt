2020 early access review do you have to play a game with an end goal a reason to beef up and get the best weapons to defeat the final boss storm the last castle something that when you beat it you feel a sense of accomplishment yea me neither i love this game look right off the bat i dont play online or with friends so i cant review that aspect i basically take this minecraft on steroids and do whatever the hell i can and now i cant stop playin it im in the busy season now at work usually bustin out 13 hr days im not weeb enough to work that then come home and play a game until this just lemme raid this military outpost then i is that a rocket launcher yes the minecraft but with physics is a good comparison for a short and sweet synopsis yep even shovels axes bows iron armor but then its compound crossbow sawed off shotgun ak47 9mm mad max motorcycle automatic shotgun turrents 4x4 trucks etc and where as the mine in minecraft stands for exploring mines the mine in this means explosive mines made from a cars airfilter nails and gunpowder with the games custom settings you can also make it as pants staining as you want the nights 1 thru 6 arent to bad but once you hit night 7 everything is screaming and breaking around you in all directions the zombies can dig in this game as i found out in my second try they know how to climb some run on all 4s and leap over any piddly defense youve made the girl from the ring makes unbridled eye contact that one spits acid why is that one glowing oh and day 14 it gets worse and so on and so forth so yes you can build what you want go where ever you please do what you can make all the things but the over all mark is to survive as the days progressively get worse while you explore towns that have high rises and strip clubs for guns or tromp thru the woods for materials while running into zombie bears if you just want a game thats not full of fluff and goal is to find out just how bad can it get vs how good of a fight i can put up then look no futher ima go see what this gyrocopter i built can do
