2016 total war warhammer is a brilliant meld of total war and a fantasy setting and this has been the best and most optimised release for any total war game in a very long time unlike attila warhammer runs smoothly for a wide variety of pc specs bugs and glitches seem to be at a minimum and tend to be minor graphical ones and not gamebreaking ones the game itself in my opinion is the most challenging and difficult on most difficulty levels more than a few times have i lost a campaign on hard expecting it to be a breeze certainly refreshing as previous total wars were only properly challenging when the ai had rediculous buffs on very hard legendary i would only put down on my could be better list that sueges seem to be too linear to be fun for the hundreds of hours i and many total war players will play also non player factions tend to confederate easily with no tangable repercussions for the ai where it s almost never a good idea for the player with the effects it brings overall i would rate tw warhammer at 8 5 10 and certainly on track to become my favourite total war game to date
