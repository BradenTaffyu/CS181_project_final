2023 short review of fallout 4 maybe sarcasm no yes graphics acceptable so far atmosphere shooting lots of enemies large elaborate world ability to equip settlements a huge variety of additional quests a huge number of weapons that can be modified in different ways the ability to install mods in the game menu unfortunately achievements are disabled in this case the game is addictive for a long time various satellites radio stations and soundtrack the most boring and typical plot dialogue system of the same words you can not teleport from closed locations resultfallout 4 the best part in the series for me however unlike new vegas the game is very much inferior in the dialogue system and plot but it excels in new features i highly recommend playing this game
