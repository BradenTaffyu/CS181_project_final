2019 iracing is more of a sport than a game if you look at it that way some things about it make more sense it is expensive there is no denying that and if it s too expensive for you that s fine but to be very clear it is not a scam or a cash grab there are reasons why it costs what it does and in all likely hood the pricing model will never change you can definitely get a taste for it without spending too much though you can usually get discounted 3 month subs which is a good way to give it a try the base content is not huge but there is enough to see if it s something you will like i have 160 hours on record but realistically i would have thousands of hours in the sim i joined just prior to the official release in june 2008 i haven t played consistently that whole time but in recent years i would average 4 hours a week a couple hours of practice plus a couple hours of racing to try to write this review and go into all the technical aspects of the sim would take me hours so i ll see if i can explain why i spend so much time and money on iracing i think at the end of the day i m a wannabe race car driver and this is the closest i can get to doing it for real to be any good it really does require all the same mental and physical skills that a real race car driver requires this is true though for any decent sim but the biggest thing that iracing has that nothing else really does is the online competition there is no substitute for good quality racing against real life opponents testing your skill and your resolve against people from all over the world weekly official races endurance special events leagues other sims have some or many of these things but with iracing it s all here iracing is my hobby i don t play iracing i race i practice i test myself
