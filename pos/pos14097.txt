2021 i spent 4 hours designing and building a natural gas sequestration depot only to realise that i had to upgrade my power grid to support the generators they would power 1 hour down the power grid optimisation rabbit hole later my power grid was upgraded to thicker cabling but then i realised that the carbon buildup from my previous power generation coal generators had pressurised the entire bottom section of my base gas self sorts based on mass and that i wouldn t be able to run my new gas generators without some kind of carbon sequestration system an hour of mining out a massive cavern pumping a metric ton of carbon dioxide into it i was able to finally turn on my new systemnext dilemma heat buildup from all the machinery in my power plant section has been leaking into the rest my base through my imperfectly insulated walls and it reached the point where my crops are failing due to being over the plants max temperature so my calorie reserves have fallen precipitously with the crop failureso i need to design a cooling loop back in
