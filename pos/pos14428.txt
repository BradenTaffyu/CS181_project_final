2023 early access review if you like factorio then dyson sphere program is worth trying the game has a lot of original and cool ideas don t worry about it being a factorio clone even if it can look like it on the surface it s also very ambitious in scope so it s worth keeping an eye out for the game to see how it evolves even if you don t buy it that being said the game suffers from performance issues my pc might not be the top of the line but the game regularly dipped below 30 fps and past the first 30 hours my gpu usage was stuck permanently at 100 so avoid for now if your hardware is on the slower side
