2021 frostpunk is a great looking city building game in icy hell that is set in an alternative earth of the late 19th century where a mysterious ice age has killed millions and covered the entire known world for eternal winter in the wake of the ruthless natural disaster only the remnants of humanity have survived which the player will take over as he leads the last city towards a new tomorrow however tough times require even tougher ways to survive the eternal frost alive and often this means trampling on the interests of the individuals it is the moral dilemmas that make the game unique in its genre cold stained citizens may demand warmer accommodations from the player but the same timber would soon also need to be replaced by rapidly dwindling food in hunting lodges so do you agree with the pressure of your citizens on better insulated homes and trust that the solution to the hunger shortage will come a little later your moral backbone is being measured as the game progresses with the dissatisfaction and hope of the citizens continuous overtime cold living conditions and numerous other events often have a negative but sometimes also a positive effect on metrics indeed city expansion often has to be related to just these two metrics because if either of the metrics at any point swings to the wrong extreme you are kicked out of the city into the freezing wilderness and back to square one each decision has its ups and downs which is still affected by your game situation at the time prohibiting child labor may seem like the only morally correct solution but if the city has suffered for days from minor pairs of hands the decision may not be so straightforward nor are laws ever forced to be put into practice if one wants to bring an additional challenge to one s game however some buildings and inventions are locked behind them indeed decisions that seem moral at first quickly turn into invisible statistics as the game progresses which slows down their emotional charge however one thing in the game doesn t stop to amaze me even after years later that is the look as a city building game frostpunk is downright divinely beautiful to watch with its numerous thoughtful details that bring the steampunk spirited environment to life wonderfully the intensifying frost frogs the edges of the screen into a thin ice that melts as the temperature rises again in the parimetric snowstorms the residents climb forward vigorously at the same time making a path for those who follow but the constant snowfall will cover the routes again by the next morning the spectacular visuals are also supported by the excellent sound world as well as the great compositions of piotr musial which manage to elevate the atmosphere especially during the more intense moments of the game like the look small sonic details such as the location dependent wind howl of the camera create a surprising amount of immersion to playing as a god frostpunk is a spectacular ruthless and in some places interior chilling urban building and survival game that doesn t fully reach the emotional recharge the creators need as a work that has taken the genre in a new direction it still remains a peculiar and much needed breeze pros solid unique narrative wonderfully atmospheric hard choices that will make you feel sad high replay value has an end game in each level cons interface can be unintuitive at times game length is limited structures look too similar this impedes gameplay 8 10overall frostpunk is a stressful addictive and stylish survival management game filled with incredibly difficult choices
