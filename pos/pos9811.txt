2016 early access review the older i get the less i like violent games instead i find myself drawn to games i used to scoff at as a youngster simulations and city builders i have no explanation honestly one d think that i d be in love with shooters since adulthood has introduced me to whole new levels of disappointment and frustration but somehow it has also been very pleasant maybe that s why i like to build and micro manage i don t know man what i do know i like rimworld a lot it is a base building game that is best described as an accessible dwarf fortress you guide a bunch of characters e g space farers who have crashed on an alien planet or a tribe already living there and help them survive by building a base and managing food and energy sources you have to trade with other settlements and spaceships that occasionally enter your orbit you have to make sure your guys and girls are happy and productive but you ll also have to fend off pirate raids rimworld is quite fierce if played on the higher difficulties there s a lot of fighting if you want it for those of us who just want to relax and build you can do so by choosing one of the lower difficulties the game offers three different ais that control the events which occasionally hassle your settlement like raids solar eclipses meteorogical catastrophes etc some of them are really dangerous and can wipe out your base if they catch you unprepared toxic fallout i m looking at you the ais differ in their predictability and the severity of the events they choose to unleash rimworld is quite complex but perfectly accessible for anybody in my opinion you don t have to be a simulation buff to play it then again if you are a buff you might find rimworld a bit underwhelming compared to dwarf fortress since it lacks z levels underground layers you can dig to and build on and its multitude of creatures after approx 20 hours with rimworld i find myself gravitating back towards dwarf fortress which i find beefier however rimworld is by no means a bad game and i keep coming back to it the developers have been updating it regularly and i hope they ll be adding some unexpected stuff soon i propose magic flutes that let you guile tribesfolk into lethal traps
