2018 a nice strategy game i am writing this review using my memories i played it 1 5 years ago i know there are a lot of games in total war series i tried to play them before but i didn t get it but this game in fantasy series engaged me for a long time actually i played 60 hours in 10 days playing every day after work it means the game is really and really special dwarf buster a screenshot of total war warhammer by rurik there are 2 parts of the gameplay real time battle i played it for 2 3 times but it didn t hooked me up other part of the game which i liked most is turn based grand strategy you have a huge map to conquire there are a lot of enemies who will try to stop you they attack from everywhere you need to reorganize your resources and army to stand against them economy part of the game is important too you need to improve every conquired city to raise your income for making larger army i played on very hard and it was really hard i was in the center of the map and enemies attacked from 4 ways sometimes it was a stalemate situation if i tried to move army to one way i got lost on the another i tried a lot of difference ways to get an advantage it took a lot of hours and nerves but i win anyway i got so much positive feelings when i finally made it long campaign victory as vampire counts on very hard a screenshot of total war warhammer by rurik pros a lot of everything every race has unique style of the game a set of units and buildings and etc strategy required very engaging gameplay turn based part of the game neutral sometimes it gets extremely hard actually i played on very hard but anyway i got attacked from 4 different ways i got desperate very often you need to use save load very often you can t conquire all cities only 50 are available at later stages requires a lot of repetitive actionscons rts battles get boring very soon neutral guys at north is pain your army at their land get damaged every turn it was so annoying to fight against them something went wrong a screenshot of total war warhammer by rurik resumebe fair i got this game with humble monthly actually it was a reason why i subscribed i am not sure if it cost 60 but i got it for 12 and a bunch of other games i played it for 60 hours it was just one big campaign when i finished i was very happy because it was really tough challenge so if you like strategy games and you will see it on a 50 discount take it
