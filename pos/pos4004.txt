2020 first published in 2008 the board game dominion by donald x vaccarino came to spawn the deck building genre of board games in it the players around a table each start with humble identical decks for their small kingdoms and gradually transform them into rich empires doing so requires acquiring new cards throughout the game which are added to the discard pile and cycled back into the deck when the draw pile runs out slay the spire is a descendant of this game but seems to draw more inspiration from an earlier piece of vaccarino s work spirit warriors a game where you are building up a hero and using their attack and defense cards to defeat enemies vaccarino would eventually find the rpg aspects too cumbersome and cut away the fiddly monsters quests and damage in its place dominion was a game about kingdom building through acquiring land and economic assets thanks to the advantages of being a video game the ideas of battling monsters which were too cumbersome to put into a board game now shine bright and tantalizing in slay the spire a host of monsters treasures special events and a simplified card loot system bring all the strengths of a traditional dungeon crawl to the genre in a way that other deck building board games like thunderstone and ascension couldn t to say that slay the spire is a good game is an understatement much as dominion before it slay the spire has been an absolutely fundamental game in the creation of a whole new genre once you ve seen it on steam you ll soon be shown a dozen or more games running with the same ideas very few of them can hope to compete
