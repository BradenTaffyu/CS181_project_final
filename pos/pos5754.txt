2022 early access review think campaign is way better than it ever was in warband i sill miss a couple of features like feasts that would allow you to more easily meet other vassals also they removed the feature where you could tell a party that the enemy is approaching from a certain direction think that feature would be really good in this one but besides that i think this is a huge improvement i don t think its worth 50 bucks so i would recommend getting it on a sale
