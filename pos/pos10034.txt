2016 early access review so i had my colony of fawge town thriving technology was good chokepoint was good but then something happened that at the time i didn t believe was a big deal toxic fallout stay inside otherwise you and your animals will get sick over time collapse and die anyway i didnt give it much thought however only 4 days had passed when i realised the food was running out and the only food source i had left were my three huskies and pet panther it was a hard choice but i had to slaughter one of my dogs and prepare her meat so that the rest of the colony could survive for two more days day 6 i had run out of food again and this time i had to slaughter another husky and my pet panther which had helped me defend the colony from many raids the day after their sacrifice was made the toxic fallout ended and their deaths were in vain i have not played a game that made me think so hard on a decision i seriously thought my colony was going to starve to death if i make it it s going to be for those poor huskies and pet panther
