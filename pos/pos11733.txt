2014 early access review july 2024the game has come a long way there is so much more to it far more to do and goals to work towards from setting a base that can withstand the bloodmoon to gathering bullets to finding supplies medicine etc the game has come a long way from its rough almost minecraft like start 10 10 having so much fun january 2017ive been playing the game for a bit i do like it and do recommend it likes its like minecraft without creative mode gravity when the zombies take out the supports of the house your in and it all collapses on you that sticks with you the zombies can be pretty dangerous with friends the game is very fun and exciting dislikes the lag can be pretty bad at times there really is very little to do overall i think that the game will be a great game in its beta and release stages edit this game has really come a long way in in 3 years from its minecraft like start yes the world was made up of blocks to the smooth world bloody world we have now i still find the game fun to just sit down and play every now and then my only complaint is that i find the there is little reason to really do anything like dayz and other survival games you hunker down make a base horde your supplies and thats about it in a pve server it can get tiresome after a few days now of coarse pvp servers will find it more exciting and even pve people can find an element of excitment with some imagination but me i always look for a little more in a game still agood game to just sit down and go
