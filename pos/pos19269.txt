2021 hell it s about time is a timeless motto of rts players years go by yet the genre remains woefully undersaturated and that s why playing aoe4 a hefty new aaa real time strategy feels so damn good despite the flaws admittedly i haven t played aoe2 quite literally for ages and i skipped the remasters because i don t want people to think i m old neither do i want to relive my wololo related childhood trauma nor talk about it despite my therapist s advice the only lasting memory i have of aoe3 is the overwhelming campaign silliness so i can t really compare the fourth game to its predecessors and their modernized versions with that in mind some key points the game looks fairly good it s no graphics powerhouse but it s pleasant to look at your smol villagers building pastoral towns and promptly getting slaughtered by rampaging mongols art is generous all civs look unique upgrades affect the appearance of units and buildings fantastic amount of detail sound design is great really immersive and impactful battle sounds music is atmospheric unique renditions for all civilizations but still i miss aoe2 tunes a bit overall presentation is solid campaign aoe4 campaigns are serviceable but uneven there are some really well designed missions with unorthodox approach and some that feel like your typical amass a deathball of units and faceroll the opponents affairs campaigns are not among the genre s best but they re fairly confident certainly lack a bit of personality since missions take place on a timescale of centuries following loose story arcs like norman conquest of england on the unexpectedly bright side missions are accompanied by documentary videos on related historic events and customs and those are great documentaries fascinating with fancy production values thanks to the documentaries i ve learned that modern historians are building castles and trebuchetes train attack falcons and study scorched earth tactics historians are weaponizing and preparing for insurrection we have to stop them before it is too late why won t the authorities listen to me aside from campaigns there s not much else for singleplayer content there s your usual skirmishes vs ai and sets of masteries for every civilization sort of lists of objectives designed to teach the mechanics of each civ that s it so should you get the game full price purely for singleplayer don t think so as a multiplayer package i m having a blast with it though i haven t touched rts multiplayer for years my apm is probably in double digits and i m habitually sleepy despite all that aoe4 mp never feels too overwhelming when i dabbled in sc2 my main response to a lost match was to curl under the sofa and cry bitterly in aoe4 i analyze my mistakes because correcting them always seems within reasonable reach thanks to a somewhat more forgiving pace less reliance on hectic micro and a very real possibility of comebacks after losing an engagement so multiplayer to me is a joy what s fun about it and what s holding it back civilization variety each of the 8 civs is unique we re not talking zerg and night elves unique civs largely share building and unit pools but there s a lot more unique mechanics going on than in aoe2 french and english are rather standard affairs but it gets much more interesting rus for example has a bounty system where they get gold and progressive bonuses for hunting furries on the map and as a corgi of strict moral principles i ardently support furry suppression that leads to intense first few minutes of a match where rus player hunts all the animals on the map and their opponent tries to deny it by exterminating fauna first there s several more rus traits and many other gameplay possibilities between other civs chinese eunuchs inject larva to boost their economy landmarks technology in the game is divided between ages essentially 4 tech tiers you move up through the ages by building landmarks think wonders from civilization series each civ has 6 landmarks and can only build 3 in a match landmarks have unique powerful effects and really help tailor your game plan plenty of unique units too there s coop vs ai and team vs team up to 4v4 options i haven t tried those because i m a hyper competitive 1v1 corgi i live to win and dominate failing that i live to get mad at my opponent and report them for terrorism and springald abuse from what i watched though team games can be a lot of fun with some crazy strategies skill ceiling is very high but matches are approachable it s been a ton of fun following the pros on twitch and watching genesis the first aoe4 major tournament but so was playing on my mediocre elo and failing horribly at pretty basic things yet sticking to it learning getting better but still horrible and scoring some memorable victories and that s all that matters if you re reading this and you re anxious of trying out ladder please don t be watch a few yt videos and jump right in you ll suffer some catastrophic defeats at first but your matchmaking will adjust and soon you ll be enjoying the equal competition i ve really missed playing rts in multiplayer it s a joy comebacks are real i want to stress this point because i love this aspect of aoe4 mp bases in aoe4 are durable and defendable losing a battle does not equal losing a match i ve had people come back and win against me after literally being taken down to 5 hp on their last landmark as the great warrior poet john cena once said taiwan is not a real country never give up bugs no way around it the game s pretty buggy first major patch is coming soon hopefully it addresses most issues there s more incorrect and misleading tooltips in the game than correct ones there are infinite resource exploits in mp 1 3 of techs in the game are broken explosive ships murder land armies in a radius of a nuclear strike some of these issues could ve and should ve been hotfixed faster in a competitive multiplayer game no excuses crucial customization features are missing the game s in dire need of more hotkey options better camera zooming and improved replay overlay you can t pick your civ colour so i can t wear purple like byzantine emperors literally unplayable why would the devs dunk on my fantasy of imperial grandeur like that most of these features are announced as future patch additions but still various small but annoying underlying issues hitboxes are shoddy so even the pros sometimes misplace rally points ai for certain units is horrible and could generally use improvements with pathfinding and targeting priority across the board tooltips could be a lot more detailed there s a general lack of information in game balancing such a complex game is a process and an ordeal but currently some landmarks and units are just dead in the water and no one in their right mind would use them there re also some peculiarities like current mongol meta being counterintuitively infantry siege the devs seem to be behind the current meta curve too hopefully a massive balance pass will happen at some point i m running out of character limit so i can t bore you further unfortunately but i d love to gush a lot more about aoe4 and that in itself is a testament to how involved i am after too long a hiatus from rts it s a solid game with real esports potential and plenty of fun to be had by us casual players i hope developers gives it the support it deserves so it can flourish on all levels of play i really want it to succeed to pave the way for more big rts games in the future and i hope to be having fun with aoe4 in the years to come it taught this old dog to not be afraid of learning new tricks in rts multiplayer
