2019 undertale to put it simply is an amazing game i used to dislike it as i thought there s no way a video game the way undertale is could be that good i was mistaken with a story constructed so carefully characters made not too tropey and not entire confusing it makes undertale s pace amazing for almost anyone when playing with you like something quick and active or something slower and calm undertale is a game i would recommend plus the amazing iconic music that this game has it s beautiful toby fox the game s creator and also the guy who composed to music i can tell put a lot of thought into this he constructed something he was happy seeing and i am proud to say undertale is one of my favourite games sure you could say there are flaws with undertale still sometimes it does feel a little basic in some areas and such but believe me undertale is not shallow whatsoever there is so much to learn and find out even after you have beaten the game i could mention one of the flaws is the limitation to content you view in different routes it strongly encourages pacifist gameplay or outright genocidal gameplay for best results and an experience you will remember neutral routes in the game exist and honestly they are interesting to play but unfortunately you may not get the feel of the game if you don t follow the pattern the game so badly intends you to follow always have hope always give mercy and you will go on an adventure feel free to think what you want of the game i personally love it however
