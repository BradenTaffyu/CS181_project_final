2016 the game in a nutshell everybody likes mayo seriously though this game is amazing you ll sink 20 hours into it before you notice that it ll take at least another 80 to get to the point that you set at the very beginning each activity holds a certain challenge and each one of them there are at least 7 that i can think of right now takes a huge chunk of your time there s just so much to do and all of it feels rewarding there are a few things that aren t that great the fishing for example can be quite frustrating and it doesn t get much easier the more you do it the fighting mechanics as well as the farming ones aren t exactly great in the overall scale those things are a minor nuisance though there s a lot to discover past the limits of your farm and the more you get yourself involved in the events and people of stardew valley the more the game drags you in expect to put a lot of hours into this game and then the 15 seem like very little for how much fun you get out of this gem
