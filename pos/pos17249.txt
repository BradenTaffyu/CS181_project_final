2018 tons of improvements over the first i m still awful at it mortal empires combines 1 and 2 campaign is as epic as it sounds only potential complaint is the price to be frank with both games being 60 and dlc sometimes being 20 though with the amount of hours you can pour into the game it s not a huge negative for me
