2021 i waited to write this review as i was a tad unimpressed with 3 kingdoms when it was released but they kept promising updates now that updates dlcs and other features are fleshed out this is a fantastic total war game the options in this game shows how hilariously bad total war warhammer 1 2 are in their current forms want to hire pirates to invade your neighbors go for it want to hire mercs or play as the mercs to fight for you i had someone pay me 10k to go fight someone then that someone offered me 15k not to fight them suddenly i am rich and laughing want to build buildings that will annoy your neighbors with negative perks i will steal all your people via migration political intrigue ranges from telling the emperor to get stuffed target someone you don t like or make the world mad you can have governors people on assignment and other things to buff your armies cities or factions or do negatives to enemies can send spies to rival factions now this is a mini game in itself you can get your spy hired as a general a governor or even in the faction council then you can cause all sorts of havoc from within i opened the gates poisoned a well or leaked marching orders i also gave myself an entire city because well i was the governor but this can also happen to you think your general is loyal whoops ai has improved and can challenge you in some fights don t have archers well you might want to charge immediately or they will sit at a safe distance till they run out of ammo think your archers are safe they will try to find a way to ride around your lines and slaughter them warhammer had 0 unit options other than heroes so you just have a scrum and wait to see who wins now you can spear wall shield wall advanced formations or do a mix just depending on the terrain and opponent my archers can swap between regular arrows poison or fire depending on the army in warhammer you had to specifically make those units options options to play different with different factions is fantastic cons oh it isn t perfect shogun 2 fall of the samurai is likely still the high watermark keeping generals happy early on is a frustrating mini game gatehouses or passes are generally pointless you can t close the door to deny access and the ai never attacks them i had one fully upgraded and an army inside as 3 enemies came at me i was prepared to lose that army in a tough siege battle defense to give me time nope they just rode past some factions are awesome and others are very meh cao cao is sometimes too op i d like to see lu bu at least once be a major force naval fights we haven t had boats since shogun 2 can we have boats back please i miss ramming shooting or starting a boat on fire did sega fire all their naval people i also miss naval invasions landing with boats inside the walls was great some of the buttons aren t well advertised assignments or titles are buried somewhere and real small this could be explained or shown better but if you want a true total war experience get a friend and play as the yellow turbans buckle up as that is a brutal one to survive as everyone hates you and doesn t stop coming cheers
