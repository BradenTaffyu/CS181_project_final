2019 so why am i writing a review of dark souls iii early in 2019 when it came out like three years ago because it s a trash review thats why i was never really someone to push themselves in games i rarely played anything that was popularly considered hard why was that well it was because i was a lazy person i avoided challenge in the gaming media because then the games that were meant to relax me felt like work i played games with strong emphasis on narrative like the telltale franchises or the games that made you feel powerful even when you did little more than mash one button to win like the dynasty warriors games one day i was spending some time with a few mates one of the guys there who to be honest i didn t really know that well turned to me and said i want to try playing dark souls with you i didn t really know why he said it i still don t but he did i was skeptical but i also didn t really have a good reason to say no to him so i reluctantly agreed i had no idea what i was getting into dark souls burned by in a flash i died a lot like sooooo much if you could lose your life to it it must have gotten me at least a dozen times dark souls ii was a riot of yelling and so much hate on that jerk dark lurker but there being major boss battles that i couldn t call in back up to help me with meant that i had to face the traumatic task of learning how to actually play the game when i eventually made it to dark souls iii it was a bizarre experience since i had the feeling that i didn t suck at everything dare i say i had even gotten gud no but i had certainly improved the dark souls trilogy is easily one of the best times i ve had with gaming it was also the series that taught me the joy of challenge in games even if i was a slow learner i can easily recommend it to anyone who finds themselves even a little interested in the idea of a game that is going to push you i don t dislike my narrative games and i still appreciate my button mashers but games with genuine challenge have a special kind of richness to them that i m glad i ve learned to appreciate so this is a review where i barely talked about that games mechanics plot or characters but as i said at the start it s a pretty trash review in fact it s arguably not even a review at all i see it as more of a thank you letter to a friend who pushed me to step outside my comfort zone
