2015 early access review wow i m truly amazed at how detailed and realistic this game is ever since i joined beamng it s been mind blowingly improved and constantly recieving info from the devs and you can do whatever you want racing or stacking semi s onto each other pros extremely detailed simulation very open world nothing you can t do customization a huge modding cummunity racing being able to do what ever you want cons early access means bugs but they re always quickly fixed no multiplayer yet
