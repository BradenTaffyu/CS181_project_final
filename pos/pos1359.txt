2019 early access review what a great zombie simulator shooting a gun works like it should in a zombie type of game drawing the attention of all zombies in the area or can be used to distract and pull zombies away from an area you are looking to loot i highly suggest getting this game if you are looking for a great zombie simulator survival game this is it on my best run i have managed to live 3 years and a few months i like the fact how you get 1 life to live when you die that character becomes a zombie when you make a new character in that world
