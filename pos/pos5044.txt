2023 this game is no doubt a bethesda fallout title however it is by far the most refined title in the entire series save for maybe fallout 76 immediately up front it s a fantastic shooter with the only thing really hurting the gameplay is some very minor poor weapon balance and a lot of bugs the game is optimized horrendously but mods can mostly solve this issue the world different enemy types and gunplay feel great and overall this is an incredibly fun and addicting game to simply play the visuals are alright for their time the wasteland itself can be drab but thats to be expected the music is fantastic and overall the art direction stands on solid feet the story while weak is really not as bad as the internet makes it out to be it s a decent story it simply leaves little room for personal role playing you are not a mysterious courier in this game but rather a full blown already generated character with motivations and a backstory that may not be what the player wishes for the main quest line is alright and the factions could use more work spoilers ahead the minutemen are a far too logical choice for the commonwealth the bos has been transformed into a fascist military regime engaged in ethnic cleansing which i think is a good transformation for the faction as their role in fallout 3 was overly altruistic and ended up becoming boring and the institute morally is not much better despondent to the issues of the wasteland and engaging in unethical sciences since the railroad has no real stakes or ideology when forced to stand on their own without the institute this makes the faction choice overly easy and not much thought is required to pick the best option the minutemen new vegas partially suffered from this issue but its worse in this game on the other hand the worldbuilding and lore is fantastic and the side quests are amazing outside of the main conflict this game has excellent writing overall it s a good game with some major technical issues and some less important writing issues would recommend to any non fallout fan as a great entry to the series
