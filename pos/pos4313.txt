2016 without even thinking about it warband is the best value for money game i have ever purchased having clocked around 300 hours or so now and having managed finally to rule all of calradia on normal difficulty i m taking a break i may play a little more before the release bannerlord which if warband is anything to go by should be incredible if it isn t i will be immensely disappointed a few things sieges do not work especially well owing to the limitations of the ai in order to stop your troops getting glitched out behind staircases or running facefirst into castle walls whilst being shot to death by archers you do need to utilise the commands which are far too basic to suit complex situations in which you find yourself avoid frustration by expecting them to be a bit crap from the offset your soldiers are prone to doing stupid chit and sometimes they re going to do it which make some battles turn into monty python skits don t give your followers lands and titles early in the game if at all if they defect from your faction you cannot get them back unless you wind up conquering all of calradia moreoever if you defeat them in a battle you cannot even incarcerate them in a dungeon this is a big problem as their party skills are extremely helpful and beneficial to your overall gameplay swadian knights are on balance the best troops for field battles followed by sarranid mamlukes however slaver chiefs are vastly superiror to both if you re trying to capture enemies for recruitment purposes these are the leveled version of manhunters for sieges you want nord huscarls and rhodok sharpshooters failing this swadian sharpshooters or vaegir marksman tip do not loot and plunder villages as low and hostile standings with villages will mean you are unable to recruit from them it s very easy to tank your standing with a village and much harder to win it back doing this involves boring annoying quests like herding cattle which is a royal pita do not use the autosave option this is known to cause a no string error that effectively ruins your entire saved progress as it resets all your skill points back to zero without giving you the option to re spend them it basically wipes your character back to the starting level i lost about 40 hours this way during my initial playthrough always always manually save the reputation system which works well for the most part does become virtually impossible to balance as you accrue more lords to fight for you over time apportion territories and try to to balance interpersonal disputes again this is an old game and the sophistication of ai relfects its vintage it s a problem but a forgivable one all said and done hit detection in this game is perfect and you re not expect to find yourself saying how the did that possibly miss quite a lot at first i recoomend turning the battle speed up to highest as for whatever reason the game just seems to prefer it this way mechanically it s just better make sure you turn the number of troops per battle up to maximum also failure to do this will when facing a large enemy army result in you spawning on the field with 10 troops and the enemy with over a hundred and you will get roflstomped the game will always fill to max capacity with ai troops not yours for all its imperfections bugs and general datedness warband really is an immensely satisfying and enjoyable game that is well worth purchasing especially given that you can pick it up for about the price of a happy meal most of the time nothing to lose here score 8 10
