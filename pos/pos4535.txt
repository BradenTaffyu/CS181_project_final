2012 just a small positive review an extremely enjoyable sandbox rpg and i am not even talking about the multiplayer the best thing about it i will not lie are the mods modding community which are both numerous made a mod myself and i can tell you that it is a highly time robbing process so imagine total conversions of the game not much else to say rather then a recommendation if you play this game install for multiplayer crpg great character progression and for singleplayer floris mod pack arguably the best singleplayer mod out there the napoleonic wars dlc cranks up the enjoyment which is 18th century combat it s only multiplayer for now though but singleplayer mods are in development for which i cannot wait personal score 8 5 10best regards dukhat
