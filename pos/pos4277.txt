2017 mount blade warband warband is an extended version of the first game in this game there is no story in that production we take on the character created by us shaping its history and we as adventurers we enter calradia the world immersed in a war between khergits nords rhodoks sarranids swadians and vaegirs and we will be able to join one of them swear an oath to a pretender and help him regain the throne or be a king queen and conquer the land of calradia this production from the beginning is very boring because of the repeatable quests however after some time once our character will be quite strong we will create an army the game has a reputation system if you attack someone they will not be liked by them but it is also such a thing as honor points for taking parts in tournaments or for the release of the fallen lords simultaneously improving relations with the kingdom and with the lord when we have a good relationship and your own castle can marry a daughter son lord and as a result we can arrange a feasts the game offers a lot for that price great combat system a lot of possibilities for character development making the army conquering castles and capitals and their ability to to improve and many other things that i could write about endlessly personally i had a lot of fun while playing at this production he game has its flaws poor graphics and animations but has something that attracted me for many hours if you are not afraid of ugly graphics is definitely worth a try as for me i look forward to bannerlord
