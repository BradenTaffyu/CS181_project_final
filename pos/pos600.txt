2018 romanticizing pastoral life stardew valley starts with a relatively cut and dry plot that throws you in the middle of an inherited farm the basic loop of the game starts out with you cleaning up the farm planting crops and trying to figure out what the town is about that in itself was enough and hit home for me personally as i too am privy to the ideals of escapism to get away and live off the fat of the land the game so far feels like a simple game about farming but soon adds another layer keeping up friendships and trying to fix up the town to its past glory but it doesn t stop there it keeps going with each passing season things change peoples personalities evolve and open up along the way you find a mine you discover fishing all of which are repetitive mundane tasks to say the least but this game s sleep and seasonal cycle doesn t let you dwell on one thing for too long and nudges you towards improvement but of course you have choice you can attend that festival or let it go keep farming fishing or mining everyday or potentially have a more balanced experience the game very rarely forces your hand into doing something rather it nudges and suggests i m still working my way through the game but if you want to decompress and chill out give it a try you will know within a loop of a day or two if this is your cup of tea or not
