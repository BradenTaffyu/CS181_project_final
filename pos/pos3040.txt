2020 divinity original sin 2 is a masterpiece everything in the game right from the graphics to the writing exudes class going in to the game with the acclaim it has in mind as well as having played the first one i was expecting an rpg that checks all the boxes good progression dialogue and plot but the game continuously exceeded my expectations and proved to be much more than the sum of it s parts the reason i was drawn to this series was the combat i never was a fan of any isometric rpgs whether it be pillars of eternity or diablo because i found the combat in such games unsatisfying the dos series fixed this for me with its turn based combat where your actions have a much bigger impact in combat than items or abilities you could have the exact same items and abilities in the same fight and depending on your actions it can be either a boringly easy massacre or end up with your whole party dead the combat in the first game was pretty good i liked all the stats abilities and interactions this game changed some of that introducing magical and physical armour and getting rid of probability rolls you now have to chip away armor after which you can land assured ccs instead of having a percentage chance of landing a cc it also made a few other changes such as simplifying the action points system despite the new polarising armour system the combat in this game is a step up and this is due to one thing the use of terrain in combat terrain was never a factor in the first game most battles would take place in a clearing however in this game high ground is an advantage and each combat encounter has a beautifully crafted terrain that blends in perfectly with the world while also adding depth and variety to combat encounters i m not that much into roleplaying in video games but this game made me care very much about the world and the characters in it the plot is mature and filled with several interesting stories that will keep you hooked the only place where i felt a bit unattached was in act ii where you re asked to become more powerful and left without a sense of motive i recommend playing as an origin character the premade characters with their own story lines as well as getting 3 other origin characters in your party the story arcs for all the origin characters are meticulously crafted another thing that the game does right is the game world every location in the game feels authentic and has a personality of its own the world is lively with the people going on about their daily lives almost every object can be interacted with most of the things you see lying around can be picked up this synergises well with the great crafting system in the game which uses a vast array of items as ingredients the world is also filled with secrets and rewards exploration thanks to the wonderful story an amazing combat system a good game world and well written characters dos 2 is a fun ride larian really outdid themselves with this one and proved that listening to the community is the way to go
