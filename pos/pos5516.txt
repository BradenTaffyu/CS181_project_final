2019 early access review edit as the developer said you can access old save files through the game s properties on library beta options contrary to what i stated previously big disclaimer this game is not for everybody it will be confusing and it will give no flying about your feelings you will die countless times before you learn the game and countless more after you learn the game this brings me to what i consider the biggest thing caves of qud has in it s favor as a consumer product it is a proper roguelike as in it is like rogue was tile based graphics turn based combat permanent death mostly procedurally generated it drinks hah pun intended from the same fountain as did cdda as did dcss and many others and it does so extremely well not being too alien for the orthodox roguelike players but still introducing a great deal of mechanics as well as a universe unlike any other i ve seen in such a game there is no hand holding involved and this goes both ways you will be thrown into an unkown world with absolutely no knowledge besides your keybinds and you ve got to make something of it learning is on your hands and you may enjoy this or not but also since the no hand holding thing is taken very seriously it is an open world you re presented with quests and a storyline of sorts but you can and i personally encourage you to engage in all kinds of dumb ery if you so desire go around and kill helpless mobs make villages and folks love you or hate you there is nothing stopping you from doing whatever you want to do besides the death screen and the mechanics themselves you could murder every living being including the quest givers so long as your equipment and stats allow for it the universe itself has a very vast lore you can explore if that is your thing since this is not my main interest i have no good opinion and i am not sure how far down the rabbit hole you can go but since there is so much i guarantee you can put many hours into it the character creation is very deep and possibilities are close to endless the game presents you 6 basic stats to tinker around as well as the option to be a mutant or a truekin let s start by the mutation mechanics you got two trees to play with one focused on physical mutations and one on mental mutationsthe mutation mechanics are very reminiscent of cdda s perks if you happen to be familiar with it if not you get a base amount of points to spend with positive mutations costing you an amount and negative mutations awarding you more to work with here is where most fun can be had creativity wise choosing truekin presents you with simpler less diverse but still highly viable and fun choices to be made the game is very fun but it isn t balanced and probably never will be the sheer amount of content makes it understandably impossible i am not using this word lightly here it is i repeat impossible to balance you will die instantly in a multitude of scenarios you most likely will do it to yourself quite a handful of times also this game can be deeply frustrating but it can be priceless funny at times if you re willing to roll with the chaos improvise and laugh at mishaps you ll most likely have a good time if you get too attached to your characters or dislike permadeath don t bother it won t do you any good tl dr no hand holding you ll have to either experiment or learn from other sources aesthetics are simple but most of the time clean overworld can be cluttered at times everything in the game is achievable from hour 0 no unlockables progress is knowledge based and rewarding on a personal level there are many things to try and trying them is gonna lead you to ups most of the time cherish it or just don t bother it is imbalanced but that adds rather than subtract from the game it is a roguelike after all don t expect to be treated kindly to end this review this game is my definite go to when i get a roguelike craving and that is a testament to how solid it is it s still getting constantly updated and things keep getting added so you can expect to get some new stuff every once in a while even if it s just minor things overall this is a must for anyone who s interested in roguelikes
