2018 stellaris is easy to get into but once you do so there s a whole world of depth and replayability this game aims to be a comprehensive simulation of the political economic and military struggle for power on a galactic scale and gets most of it right in the way that other paradox titles often don t without taking you out of the experience with the lack of polish the freedom to define the traits of your species and empire is so great and so impactful throughout the game that there s legitimate room for roleplay in ways that i never thought possible in a strategy game species and empires are customizable in quite literally every aspect that matters and some that don t creating a near infinite array of game alterting possibilities forthermore most of what defines your empire can transform in profound ways following random events and conscious choices that the player can choose to undertake going beyond the trivialities of managing the economy and the military a stellaris playthrough feels like a more complicated system with many moving parts this is not to say that the core 4x aspects are a second thought the development exploration and war all have a flow to them and sufficient complexity to continuously present a meaningful challenge and create the just 5 more minutes effect that the best strategy games tend to bring out much as i recommend stellaris as a single player deep immersion experience it s even more fun with friends when you play co op style with regard to the numerous dlcs in my opinion they are not mandatory for a satisfying experience and as such can be avoided for the first couple playthroughs assuming you like what you see it may be worth paying to open up the more advanced and or esoteric mechanics down the line in the form of the apocalypse and utopia dlc pay no attention to the recent review bombs that stellaris sustained from the chinese players who decided that it was worthless without a mandarin chinese translation bunch of clowns if you ask me stellaris is a solid investment for the avid strategy player but it can also be a surprisingly satisfying experience for the more roleplay focused types among us and it s one of the more solid recommendations i ve ever had the pleasure of making onwards and upwards
