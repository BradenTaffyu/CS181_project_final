2016 i bought this game a long time ago i still beleive it was well worth the money i have yet to explore the whole solar system yet alone the galaxy very good mod support via ckan oh and it is also one of the most educational games ive ever played taught me more about physics than my entire highschool physics class the only negative i can think of is the insane learning curve many people need to spend hours just figuring out how to get into their first orbit but that is just one of the things that you must be willing to do in ksp aside from that very highly recommended
