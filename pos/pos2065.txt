2020 edit new content releases like once a year or maybe once in two years events are repetitive and boring playtime about 4 5k hours playing since 2012 no new content toxic pvp community pve is boring mindless repetitive grind when they finally add a new gear cap its grinded within a few days after that you ll just hang around on the guild ship and shop in the gtm daily missions are not worth it outcome a day about 1 million credits subscription is almost necessary too many restrictions however its by far the best mmorpg i ve ever played the stories are incredible and authentic no overtuning of characters or classes every single class and character feels unique there are so many customization options i cant stop creating new characters with new looks its insanely addicting when playing with friends i cannot stress out the fact how engaging and gorgeous the story is written the game has so many flaws but no matter which mmorpg i try i somehow always end up on the imperial fleet for the empire
