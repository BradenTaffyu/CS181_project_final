2016 early access review minecraft was too boring for me i m not a creator for creations sake terraria was fun i enjoyed the additional combat focus dayz didn t have it for me i didn t like the lack of building at least when i played it ark was fun dinos but it got stale as there was no forced conflict no reason to explore no reason to keep building so it fell into the minecraft trap 7 days to die allows me to be creative but gives me a good solid foundation of conflict and purpose to my building not only that but it creatively forces encourages me to get out of my safe keep and risk exploring which causes me to engage with the game content in a very enjoyable fashion this was a recommendation from a friend based on the steam sale and i ve dedicated 90 of my gaming hours to this since i bought it over the holiday break strongly recommend
