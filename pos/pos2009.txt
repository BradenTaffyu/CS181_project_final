2021 swtor has by far the best leveling experience of any mmo that i ve played as each of the 8 classes has its own unique storyline to follow throughout the leveling process each complete with its own unique companions subscribers get an additional 20 exp after level 20 but even as a preferred player i found the leveling speed to be pretty quick as well even if you only focus on your class story mission and nothing else you even get xp boosts fairly frequently just from completing certain missions that last for 3 hours of playtime meaning when you log out or are in a dialogue scene the boost timer pauses which is super nice subscription model is also very nice especially compared to some competitors in the mmo space if you re a subscriber you have access to all of the content after the base game without having to buy each expansion individually you also get 500 cartel coins their premium currency each month you re subbed unfortunately can t really speak to group endgame content as i don t have a group to play it with but once you hit max level everything you do gives you credit towards earning better loot doing easier solo stuff obviously takes longer but you still have the ability to obtain endgame loot if you re willing to put the time in i would say if you re unsure you lose nothing trying the game out as a f2p you can still complete your entire class storyline without subbing which should give you plenty of time to decide whether the game is for you or not
