2018 people say the base game isn t worth the price i have no idea what they re talking about i ve only ever played the base game and i ve put over 200 hours into it without even touching some of the available factions i still have yet to do a dwarves or brettonia playthrough plus i got it on sale and it s for 75 off as i m writing this easily worth the price if you love epic cinematic large scale battles or if you just like that fantastic warhammer feel if this looks like your type of thing buy it i d recommend doing a bit of research if you re new to the franchise but hey you can always get a refund
