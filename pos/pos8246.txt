it s tough because one one hand i love yu gi oh and this is a pretty great way to experience the game the presentation is nice the visuals are fun and it s a great way to experience the game if you can t afford physical cards or don t have people to play with however there are some things worth pointing out this game has a steep learning curve i got back into yu gi oh after loving it as a child and the game has changed drastically it can be frustrating and overwhelming for new comers but worth it if you stick it out konami has some very scummy business practices i ve noticed it in duel links too where if you want to play the new and powerful decks you either need a bunch of gems saved up or be willing to spend a bunch of money that isn t to say you can t craft powerful cheap decks but you will have to grind if you want to build more the pace of the current meta can be very frustrating this isn t playground yu gi oh anymore most likely you re either going to otk your opponent or they ll otk you you d think that would make matches fast but sometimes you ll sit around for 2 minutes waiting for your opponent to finish their turn if your opponent sets up their board on the 1st turn and you don t have any handtraps or ways to break it the game is pretty much over the heart of the cards will not always bless you if you re new and wanting to get into yu gi oh this is probably the most frustrating way to do so the solo mode is not great and even unfair at points if you want something more beginner friendly or reminiscent of days of old i d try duel links or legacy of the duelist however i must be a masochistic because i still love this game
