2018 i won t go into depth here as there are plenty of other reviews for that but for me the game is just so much fun a huge fantasy world with unique and interesting factions and simply exploding with content to experience each campaign i ve played has lead me to develop an attachment to the characters in it it s almost like strategy role playing even if i wasn t that into them going in don t worry about the plentiful dlc there s so much to experience in the base game both in this title and the first rather than locking away parts of the game well except maybe for the blood god dlc the dlcs enable the developers to craft additional factions and lords by giving an additional source of income the base game is worth its price but if you re hungry for more grab some dlcs to go with it just be sure you have a good pc and install the game on an ssd otherwise your load time may be more than you bargained for
