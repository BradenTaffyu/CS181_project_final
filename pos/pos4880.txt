2018 even though i was a huge fallout 3 fan i held off on buying this game because i saw it got some bad early reviews and because i wasn t convinced my 6 year old pc with a 3 year old graphics card could handle it but this weekend it was on sale and i decided to give it a shot all i have to say is i started it this morning and haven t done a damn thing all day since this game just sucked me in and didn t let me go and that never happens with me 9 hours played in one day and i don t regret it its immersive its beautiful so far i love it but do go watch a youtube tutorial when you get to settlement building that part isn t well explained in game at all update 2 weeks in this is quite simply a phenominal single player offline game which are my person favorite do i have complaints or gripes yes of course in a game this size i don t think anyone doesn t have a feature or element that they feel isn t quite necessary or well done enough but the overall experience is whats important so i will not go into details on what bits of this game could have been done better diferently or i feel should have been left out bottom line so far i don t regret a penny spent or minute wasted wth this game update end game when its all said and done fallout 3 was all around better i feel like the fourth outing of this series had some unecessary game mechanics and features that didn t work so well it felt a lot more on rails than fallout 3 as well the player gets a lot less choice in the story outcome still this is a phenominal game that i m glad i played through
