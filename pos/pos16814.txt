2019 i love this game it s glorious basically you buy houses decorate them furnish them and sell them you can also decorate furnish houses for money that you can use for buying more houses that you can decorate and furnish it s a beautiful cycle wait that sounds terribly monotonous okay at times it can be a little monotonous but it s so worth it you sell to a bunch of different people who will literally be so angry if you don t tailor the house to them with classic lines like what i already said i don t have kids why would you put kids stuff in and i don t need a sauna why are you putting in a sauna because i want to make a sauna sharron not everything is about you some of these people are weird like really weird one guy has a thing for guns and is obsessed with bunkers he s from the survival dlc which is great seriously it s a full on pack of extra objects bunkers buyers etc and it s free this company is amazing they produced a bloody brilliant game and then released free dlc because it adds to the game unlike some companies looking at you ea all in all i highly recommend also gardening dlc will be out soon which is literally the only thing i m excited for in life right now 10 10 would recommend
