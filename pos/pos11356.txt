2014 early access review honestly the best alpha early access game you can buy it has the most content it is one of the most playable it has one of the most dedicated developers it has a pretty sizeable and dedicated playerbase in a nutshell it s minecraft meets dayz that s probably the way you re sick of hearing it described as but it s appropriate it s a first person zombie survival game that you can play with against other players online with a fully fleshed out crafting system that allows you to make weapons and craft incredible buildings though this game has a more realistic way of building houses than minecraft does houses actually look like houses and they even have structual integrity so if you build a house without much support it will collapse walk on an old decaying bridge it will probably collapse try to build a single line of wood as a temporary bridge it will fall down after about 3 or 4 blocks mining looks great it looks like you are actually creating a cave with smooth walls and dizzying geometry however mining has had some issues over the course of development it s been nerfed made too abundant nerfed again and sometimes even being made impossible be warned that mining in this game is a bit glitchy however this shouldn t come as a surprise in an early access title the game used to have a blocky asthetic but the game has since had an update that makes the terrain smooth with rolling hills it looks great and it s not even done yet as the developers are working on random generation and on smoothing out the terrain even more see update at bottom about random gen oh i also need to mention at the moment there is only one map it s a pretty decent size but you ll see most of it within a couple playthroughs building your own structures especially when playing in an online server does change it up however this game can be played in single player as well or with a private server that s another thing great about this game options there s literally an option for just about anything how durable blocks are and how long it takes to mine them how many zombies spawn how much damage the zombies do to you how much damage you do to the zombies how much loot spawns how many players can join your server pvp on or off and many other options this game can be just about any way you want it some people will point out that options have been both added and removed and sometimes options don t have much of an effect at all again be warned things are constantly being changed including the amount of options and their effectiveness there s a chance an option you really like having may be taken away or accidentally broken it s all a part of the process of making the game balanced and challenging while also allowing you to create a personal experience there are a few mods and a few custom builds but those are pretty few at least until the game becomes more complete i m sure once the development moves futher along you ll see a lot more custom levels and mods being made and updated combat is bit floaty though as it stands now melee combat doesn t have that much impact and guns need better sound however usually combat works guns shoot bullets into things melee weapons bash things but this can be temporarily broken during any update crafting is a major component of the game you find resources either through loot in the environment and buildings or by getting your own from mining from rocks and trees crafting is done in a grid fashion which will look a bit familiar in that you can place certain components in a certain way to create something however it s not all guess work it s usually outlined what you need and where you just need to place it it s a bit simplistic and easy this way but it works for now 7 days to die is a fantastic experience it still has bugs and optimization issues such as mechanical bugs sound issues and sometimes even having parts of the game you really like being taken out or being made useless it s part of the process but overall it s the most complete of the early access titles that you can find on steam and continues to be updated pretty regularly update random generation this game needed this like most things it s not perfect but it s a welcome edition a random seed is generated depending on the name you give the world and the results are impressive you get rolling hills random buildings and points of interest large cliff sides both deep and shallow areas of water which also added the ability to finally swim underwater with neat effect and a large central city to explore the ability to randomly generate worlds now alone has potentially increased the replayablility of 7daystodie by countless hours my first couple hours with random generation i just spent exploring around to find all the nice looking terrain
