2016 r i p galactic civilizations stellaris is here this game lives up to every promise and is exquisite so far i couldn t be happier having played europa universalis eu ii and forcing myself to muddle my way through eu rome eu iii and eu iv as well as crusader kings ii i d become kind of disillusioned by paradoxes hyper in depth stretegy and convoluted interfaces but holy hell did they knock stellaris out of the park the ui is incredibly well designed the game is remarkably intuitive so much so that i d go so far as to call the manual optional for paradox that s one hell of an achievement i can t wait to see what kinds of cough star wars cough steam workshop content crops up for this game and i know i m going to be playing it for quite a long time i d go so far as to say that stellaris is tied with sins of a solar empire for my favorite space strategy game don t wait you ll love it
