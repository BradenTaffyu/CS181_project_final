2023 note this review was done on version build 1121649 hello friends welcome to my review of hogwarts legacy alot of real life people arguing about this game and causing a big mess in my opinion if you want to just play the game and ignore the real life jank then do it you do not need to follow what everyone else says do your own thing now that i got out of the way let me talk about this game the game revolves around the world of harry potter and the wizarding world harry potter is not in this game but it is in the same place he attended wizard school in the movies the game takes place in the past around the 1800 s the turn of the century alot of things in harry potter movies are somewhat different in this game also you can explore various locations around the wizarding world including scotland and hogsmeade many of the spells from the movies are also in the game and you can learn them throught the year the game itself is pretty open ended and you can even explore and put the main quests on hold until later be aware that some places will not be accessible until you learn certain spells this will block where and how far you can explore the season also changes the further you go into the story the game is also open world like a ubisoft title game there are also collectibles hidden around the world you can find these will take some time to find if you plan on trying to find them the game is not perfect it does have some bugs in it and the developers are currently fixing it still at this point this means it could improve from what it is right now anyways the following is my pro con list pros a open world game in the wizard world of harry potter if your a fan of the movies you may want to play this game collectibles around a open world side quests ability to learn new spells thought the year the first game in more than 10 years where it is linked to the wizarding world easter eggs in the game that link them to the harry potter movies including a quiz by a npc cons there are some bugs that can mess with collecting items in the game it can cause errors on the map in the game i experirenced a issue where it showed a field page i collected but never disappeared off the map repetition of the game is a big problem if you do not want to do it take a break and then come back to play it some other time the open world seems too open at some points and wish to have more things to do in it many places you explore look similiar especially the treasure vaults some people are complaining about stutters or other issues but i hardly had any and im on a 3060 graphics card make sure to set benchmark in the game to get graphic settings correctly do i recommend the game yes because the last harry potter game i played was lego harry potter series on ps2 and really missed the games in the end it is whether you have fun with the game if your a fan of the movies or not
