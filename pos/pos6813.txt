2021 this is one of those must have games if you use steam its probably best entry simulator game into world of simulators its easy enough to learn and get into but still offers a lot of possibilities if you get hooked properly on it it has been released in 2012 and is still supported by devs to this day with free patches and new dlcs has quite active community around it too its also on sale often and can be picked up quite cheap including dlcs pros super relaxing you can put some podcast or music on and just keep driving around and chilling probably best recreation of europe and european road infrastructure in any virtual world so far licensed trucks trailers and accessories from irl brands its still supported by devs gets free patches that add new features and rework old parts of map upcoming trucks are also always free lets hope it stays that way mods from maps trucks sounds trailers accessories you can tune your truck how you want to every little detail mods are really one of major parts what makes this game so fun modding scene has a lot of amazing quality mods but also dozen of trash ones but that is on you to filter out cons bad sounds real life truck engines do not sound like the in game ones ask any irl truck driver also minor stuff like train horns and such are also off lack of features that have been asked for quite some time like rigid trucks more ownable trailer types adr transporting wide roads in a lot of areas roads are way too wide than what they should be irl it really removes any sense of challenge where you have to drive just bit more carefully in certain areas economy in game is a joke when you reach certain point with hired drivers you just start drowning in money also one longer job with proper cargo and skills can easily net you enough money to buy whole new truck of course this game is not irl economy simulator but it would be nice if it made slightly more sense and was not so trivial older trucks are still stuck in early 2010s quality wise devs have not showed any interest so far in reworking these older models to their today s standard and quality imo this is bad and just keeps creating quality gap in game between older trucks and newer ones and that gap is just going to keep getting wider majority of these cons are mostly me nit picking stuff that i don t like they are not some major things and i still wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone being interested in simulators or just looking for relaxing game to doze off after long day 9 10
