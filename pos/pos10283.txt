2019 there s just something really darn addictive about rimworld i originally played it very early on but i was waiting for a sale to buy it on steam while it s worth the full price for sure i m a poor student luckily a very kind friend bought it for me and alas my rimworld journey was once again started 6 hour sessions feel effortless for sure there is a learning curve so be prepared for that there are so many things that can be done with a colony and there are so many stories that develop you ll find yourself getting strangely emotionally attached to your pawns and your animals i ve gone to great lengths in order to make them as comfortable as possible and as someone else has said you ll find that everything that goes wrong is your fault that s okay better the future shall be although the art style is similar to games such as prison architect it feels like it has much more character there are many options for difficulty provided through the different storytellers so you can pick your own pace if you d rather build that s fine if you d rather constantly defend yourself from waves of raiders that s possible too then you can save them and recruit them or just eat them i ve played 50 hours of vanilla and i m just delving into the world of mods after completing the research tree and not wanting to leave the rimworld enough anecdotes the game just works you can personalise nearly everything about the experience it s great vanilla it can be modded with a decent modding community and it just hits a spot try it
