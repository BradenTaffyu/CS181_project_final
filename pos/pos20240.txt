i waited for ages to have a proper rpg set in the warhammer 40k universe and rogue trader fulfilled this wait with perfection despite the presence of bugs which seem to be the signature of owlcat games the developers have actively addressed issues with regular patches let s get straight to the point during my 125 hours of playing i didn t encounter any game breaking bugs from start to end while there are still some remaining bugs the game remains highly playable let s be honest welcome to koronus expanserogue trader perfectly captures the violent ambiance of the warhammer 40 000 universe owlcat games did an amazing job on visuals sounds and ost also particular care has been dedicated to the writing there is a lot of text to read but it s truly amazing rogue trader is for me a true rpg by true rpg i mean a game with real roleplay features such as choices that genuinely impact the story character creation moral alignment from dogmatic to heretic along with iconoclast and an engaging story you can be a nice rogue trader or be a perfect bastard or choose to chase down the heretics the warp has left its corruptionunfortunately there are some drawbacks the game is 95 unvoiced i m not a fan of space fights i found them quite boring especially with foes in the last chapters the abundance of passive skills requires players to invest time in reading through them during each level up some cutscenes are broken i plan to do a completely new playthrough as a 100 heretic my first one was balanced between iconoclast and heretic once rogue trader becomes bug free with qol in conclusion warhammer 40 000 rogue trader did not disappoint i do recommend the game for any rpg lovers for the emperor
