2016 i ve loved the time i ve been able to spend with this game so far paradox have made a hybrid of a 4x and their traditional grand strategy titles with a facelift and it works quite well the focus on diplomacy the semi random tech system highly customisable races and the end game events keep playthroughs quite fresh which is much more than you can say for other games with this setting i m looking at you masters of orion easy drop in multiplayer make it a fantastic pick if you ve got a few friends who re into strategy gaming it s not perfect but with future expansions lined up and full mod support from day 1 maybe one day it ll be pretty close to it well worth the price
