2021 early access review rust building mechanics the forest storytelling raftoriginally when i played raft upon it s first early access release i don t recall there being much of a story if at all it was more a proof of concept fast forward almost 3 years and 2 chapters later and we ve got a pretty solid survival game graphically it s nothing visually stunning but it looks good working within the boundaries of the unity engine this may also be the reason for it s biggest downside being i generally only get around 30 40 frames per second max at any given time and as low as 14 frames per second at the later stages in the game having such a large raft and visiting large islands i m hopeful this is something that will be rectified once the game leaves early access though 10 fps raft 2 2 a screenshot of raft by lord bork gameplay wise it s what you d expect from a survival sandbox game base building hunting fishing looting as well as it s own story based missions all of which it does rather well so much so that i m excited for the next chapter tl dr a great sandbox base building game hindered only by it s poor optimisation
