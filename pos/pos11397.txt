2015 early access review it s easy to dismiss this game as another zombie game in a horde of zombie games or another minecraft clone however this game takes the minecraft formula and replaces it with something a bit more intense the graphic system has come a long way since the alpha video shown on the store page and with a group of friends this game is tons of fun building a secure base forraging for food and supplies and raiding bombed out cities i really can t wait to see how the final game is going to turn out the devs have done a great job adding content and quickly squishing the more severe bugs as they come out
