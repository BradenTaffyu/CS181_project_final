after reading all the reviews and spending some actual play time with the game i ve come to realize that the majority of people are wrong i was in the same boat as you were the physics didn t feel right and the cars were floaty and had lots of under steer but it all come down to the tuning this not carx drift racing where you can drift anything from balloon tire cars to slammed to the ground cambered out mess of a car the tuning actually matters please spend some time with the game before you jump to conclusions like i did
