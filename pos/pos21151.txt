2016 early access review i forgot to feed my slimes one day so they all escaped from their corrals and mixed together and ended up forming tars from then i simply let nature take its course there were no survivors actual review while i don t actually own the game i have been able to play it through my friend s shared game library and it s an extremely fun game until it isn t i do realize that this is an early access game but for the price of 20 i wouldn t buy it one world will be fun for at most 10 hours before you realize that you ve done everything there is to do and bought everything there is to buy from day 6 and onwards you don t even recieve any letters from people and instead of having the letters spread throughout the first few weeks of gameplay you ll recieve about a dozen random and unhelpful letters within the first few days while it is a very fun cute and beautifully styled game with several unique and fun areas to explore it gets old pretty quickly with nothing left to explore or do if i was to add new things to the game i d add an underground and snow area and several slimes to fit those areas perhaps crystal and ice slimes i feel like the game has enough fruits and vegetables as it is though i d also add more upgrades to structures and your succ gun such as the ability to have more than 4 freaking inventory spaces
