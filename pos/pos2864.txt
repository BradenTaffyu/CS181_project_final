2018 i am a very casual gamer i played wow many years ago obsessively and since then have really only gotten into a couple of flings with games as someone who works full time i don t have the time or honestly the interest in playing a game that requires me to play all the time to keep up with everyone else adversely i m usually pretty bored with single player games i also hate turn based games despite that i was browsing the most purchased in the steam store and decided on buying this game after reading the reviews this game took me about a month to complete and i clocked in 75 hours i can t even remember the last time a campaign took me more than 8 hours i actually was interested in what npc s had to say talked to everyone opened every chest etc not because i felt i had to but because i really loved the game that much also if i had played this game without looking up most of the quests online it would ve taken me at least double that time the combat was super fun even though it was turn based i was constantly looking for new spellbooks planning out my rotations etc it was also challenging i really had to make sure my party was well equipped and balanced in their abilities there were some fights i had to retry a few times and it felt like more of a fun challenge than a tedious part of the gameplay after finishing the game i m going to go back and replay it a second time with a different strategy and a slightly higher difficulty i loved everything about this game even though it s not my usual style of game at all anyone who s on the fence i definitely recommend it
