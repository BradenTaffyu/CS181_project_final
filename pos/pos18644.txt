2018 tl dr i reccomend this game overall due to it being a massive upgrade from btd 5 in terms of fun and balance although the pc port could use a bit of inspiration from that game s port i m basing this review off of my experience with the mobile game as well as the small bit of experience testing out the pc controls bloons td 6 is a tower defense game built around monkeys popping bloons a simple concept but the game is pretty in depth and strategic the game has plenty of new content coming from btd 5 including new heroes towers different powers new maps and a whole bunch of new gamemodes some of which test your skill to the max there are overall less maps but i ve never had more fun playing a bloons game until td 6 released mostly due to the amount of different modes and strategies available heroes are a new addition to this game they re essentially a stronger than average monkey with unique attacks automatic leveling and 2 special abilities they level up over the course of the game getting stronger later on so it s best to get them as early as you can for them to start leveling each hero has their own use and purpose and learning how to use them can be valuable to a strategy towers are changed this time each one having a grand total of three different upgrade paths and expensive late game fifth tier upgrades this may seem broken but the way the developers have implemented them is near flawless you can only have two different upgrade paths at the same time and only one can go above 2nd tier much like btd5 which doesnt make the tower more powerful but instead makes each one more balanced and allows you to have different options for different scenarios this freedom can lead to some interesting creative or pretty good strategies for winning and can balances the game well albeit with some exceptions with some tower s upgrade paths really existing without much of a use plus towers now have their own classes that being primary towers military towers magic towers and support towers they don t make too much of a difference however some towers buff specific tower classes as well as some gamemodes restricting you to one specific tower class the game has been made longer once again although shorter as well easy mode now has 40 rounds medium has 60 hard has 80 and impoppable has 100 each mode ends with a new moab class bloon a strong blimp that takes a lot of hits to pop it and has even more bloons on it s insides plus each difficulty has unique sub modes included in them that can be unlocked after beating the main modes for example after beating easy you unlock primary monkeys only then deflation after beating that medium has more sub modes and hard mode has the most each sub mode also has a medal greatly increasing the amount of replayability on each map the gameplay itself is pretty fun the rounds do a good job at easing you in and they definitely don t hold back later on each tower can be fun to use and have some pretty unique playstyles in some cases unlocking towers and upgrades was a blast and learning what towers are the most effective for certain scenarios has been a good experience so far now onto the port itself i prefer it to the mobile version in terms of control and speed it has better performance and the inclusion of hotkeys makes the game feel better to play however unlike the port for btd5 this port doesn t remove microtransactions they aren t a necessary component to the game at all and you hardly need monkey money anyway however the biggest issue here is double cash mode still being 18 dollars even though it s worse than 5 s double cash mode as well as it being on a 10 dollar port of a 5 dollar mobile game btd 5 handled this better removing all instances of real money purchases and making them cost monkey money instead i didn t mind the microtransations in this game as they don t interfere with the gameplay at all due to the game being easily possible without them but due to this costing 10 dollars it s a lot more noticeable and i d expect there to be a lack of microtransations but this port doesnt do that nor does it include a bonus for connecting the game to both your phone and pc so there s little point in doing so the hotkeys aren t shown to be anywhere as well while in btd 5 you could hover over your monkeys see information on what they do and what their hotkey is it s a bit of an issue if this game doesn t show a bit of crucial information for control convenience although these complaints arent major they re more just questionable choices that dont really intefere with gameplay it more has to do with the way the port itself was handled and how it could be much better overall i do prefer this port a bit more but if you want to save 5 dollars as well as play this game on the go at the cost of speed and control get the mobile version if you don t mind spending the extra 5 dollars get this version and if you really want to support the developers of this game get both either way this game is definitely worth a buy if you re a fan of the series and or a fan of the tower defense genre or if you re looking for a unique and fun game to sink some time into the game has a lot of quality and charm packed into it as well as updates every month adding new content to the game despite the port s questionable choices i recommend this game
