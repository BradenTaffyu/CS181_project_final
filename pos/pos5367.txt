2018 early access review as a young teen i used to play gamma world and have dreamed of a video game version my entire life i wrote it off as an impossible dream where has this game been my whole life honestly i ve been intimidated by most of the turn tile based true rogue likes but decided to pull the trigger on this one due to the perfect for me anyway subject matter wow am i glad that i did this is already shaping up to be one of the best rpg experiences i ve had in my life if you are a fan of this genre but have stayed away from these types of titles due to intimidation etc don t this is a fantasticly unique experience this game is shaping up to be legendary i wish there was more than the thumbs up option for this this one gets 4 thumbs up from my 4 mutant arms
