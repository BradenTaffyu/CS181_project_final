2017 at times this game has instilled a sense of wonder in me that i ve very rarely felt in over 20 years of gaming it s made me laugh out loud and genuinely care there s an overwhelming amount of things to see and do and there s immense depth everywhere you look this is the one game i don t regret buying at full price and i d gladly give larian more as good and honest developer i can tell that this title is a labour of love i genuinely think we ll be looking back at dos2 in a decade as a classic in the crpg genre
