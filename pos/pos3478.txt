2022 undertale is the first pc game i ever bought and i m so glad i did until then i just played your typical nintendo game minecraft or a triple a without thinking much of videogames as a whole undertale took me to a world i never knew existed games that are not only fun to play but that can make you feel certain ways other media like books or movies can t because here you are the one doing the choices and undertale is all about that it d be almost a crime to not to talk about the absolutely amazing soundtrack the simple yet charming art or the hilarious characters but i really don t know how to briefly express how much this game means to me also i may have written this now but i bought the game on the original website in 2016 and spent a lot of time with it and now i ve again bought it and played which shows how much replay value this game has at least for me i can never do this game justice with my words if you ve lived behind a rock all this years give this game a try you won t regret it
