2023 i m a gourmet chef now thanks to don t starve together before playing this game my cooking skills were so bad that i once set a pot of water on fire but now i can cook a gourmet meal over a campfire in the middle of a monster infested wilderness without breaking a sweat this game taught me valuable life lessons such as 1 berries are delicious but don t eat the suspicious ones they re suspicious for a reason 2 never ever trust a frog seriously they re the real villains in this game 3 it s not a proper adventure if you haven t accidentally set yourself on fire at least once
