2021 early access review like factorio only in space and better the grand scale of building a dyson sphere kinda blows factorio out of the water the concept is fun and has great appeal to scifi fans the only major downside might be the translations they re not all your base are belong to us bad but just something to keep in mind you can also report them to the official discord please note that a big part of this game is math like it s kinda everywhere you can get away without it but the whole idea is to be efficient in your automations the only hard math is the orbital mechanics but i wouldn t worry too much about those
