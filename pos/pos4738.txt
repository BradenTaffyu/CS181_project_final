2021 graphics potato bad average good beautiful the graphics are really nice especially with godrays on even on medium the lighting is beautiful great for screenshot lovers unfortunately being an apocalyptic world the landscape is mostly gray dead and monotone fallout 4 a screenshot of fallout 4 by xyoz quasar masterpiece gameplay terrible bad average good fantastic fallout 4 is a good mix of fps and rpg it has a wide variety of weapons and armor a plethora of enemy types with each having their own weaknesses and strengths build your character into anything you want be stealthy eat corpses never miss a shot with v a t s fallout fandom com or nuke everyone on your path or all of them after all perk points are limitless and so much more i could spend hours talking about all the things you can do in fallout 4 companions feel lively they react according to your actions hates dislikes likes or loves they also interact with the environment and with other npcs followers they will sometimes make comments depending on the choices you make throughout the game etc a system of settlements which consists of building houses defenses farms provide food water have enough beds etc the settlements will then produce money and crafting components for you the concept is interesting but feels incomplete placing structures correctly is oftentimes difficult and annoying settlements have no impact on the main game a lot of settlements have existing structures and debris that can t be scrapped for some reason difficulty easy medium hard at first it was kind of hard to start the game even on medium because a lot of information comes at once and there are many things to learn such as what armor is better how to build and manage a settlement what the important loot is how the hacking system works and so on fortunately you can change the difficulty anytime you want and there are no difficulty achievements once you ve learned all the basics the game becomes much more enjoyable and increasing the difficulty shouldn t be a problem very hard death march game length 400h on vanilla only story it doesn t have one horrible bad average good fantastic i personally found the story great first of all you start the game before the great war and then discover the world of fallout with your character you don t need the previous games to follow the story then there are plenty of dilemmas mind blowing plot twists philosophical topics such as can ais or robots be considered as human beings the same type of question as in blade runner what the lesser evil is choices you make throughout the game have consequences etc fallout 4 also has plenty of emotional moments some were wholesome others funny and then some were just sad or heartbreaking cinematic art it doesn t have horrible bad average basic cutscenes with the camera showing the npc s or your character s face when they re speaking good like watching a movie music sound horrible bad average good the soundtrack and the sound effects are both really good on a 50h game it would have been more than enough unfortunately at 100h it does get repetitive clearly not enough for a 400h game thankfully the dlcs have different soundtracks amazing player bases kids everyone mature casual players pro players price full price i also highly recommend getting the g o t y edition as it adds lots of content main game included wait for sale refund it if you can don t buy it free requirements minimum medium 45fps on high ultra godrays on medium with a gtx 1050 fast everything on ultra super computer bugs game itself is one big bug game breaking bugs lots of bugs surprisingly there aren t as many game breaking bugs as i expected you can finish the game without ever using the console commands only some minor side quests needed console commands to be fixed some named settlers such as sturges or codsworth will not work on their given task one achievement beverageer needed the help of console commands to be unlocked few bugs nothing final terrible bad average good great fantastic others multiplayer singleplayer final score 8 5 10
