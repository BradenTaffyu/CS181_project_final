2016 i really enjoy the other clausewitz titles europa universalis iv crusader kings ii victoria 2 yet i have never really liked the hearts of iron series i found them too tedious and honestly not very fun i have never liked a hoi game until this one hearts of iron iv is a huge step up for the entire franchise trading is a breeze simple chart on what is produced too much of and what you need more of research is immersive do i want to make italy an air power or achieve mare nostrum conflicts and battles are intuitive you can manually change the doctrine multiple times during each battle on the overall map there are small color coded battle markers that tell if you are winning or losing easy to give attention to the battles that matter while offering more time away from the battle interface easy to form theaters armies divisions all while customizing with strategies and deciding where lines are drawn color coded for simplicity realistic companies eg fiat for italian tanks baretta for small arms realistic machinery and accurate models less cluttered interface with important popups occuring every 5 minutes instead of 5 seconds this game is far above any of the previous titles i love it it has reinstilled the ww2 fascination that i had when i was a kid
