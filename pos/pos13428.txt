2020 kerbal space program is a space exploration simulation the player has to design and fly spaceships stations planes rovers and everything in between this game is unique for one thing in particular orbital mechanics everything is always in some kind of orbit and it s of little use to be close to something as long as it s in a completely different orbit it s far from you distances would better be measured in energy rather than position this game will give you a unique insight into what it really means to travel through a solar system from a physicist s view though the distances between things in every metric are much smaller than in reality the behavior of things is realistic besides the rather realistic physics what stands out is ksp s charm and humor i can t help but root for those cute little kerbals doing crazy things in space the humorous descriptions made me laugh several times when first playing ksp and they still make me smile from time to time overall i can wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who likes sandbox games
