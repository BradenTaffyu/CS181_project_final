2016 let me tell you a story 2 men from different spectrums of the gaming verse come together 1 likes playing cs go and a myriad of other fps1 likes playing smite and a myriad of rtsthey both have differences and refuse to play the others gamesbut these 2 brothers unite on the battlefield when they are pinned down by artillery shells and gun rounds coming from what seems everywhere where a single stone is what s keeping them from life to meeting death the things they carried they carried a spectrum of things an assortment of wwii weaponry halo weaponry modern weaponry anything they could get their hands on was in their arsonal they arm up and get ready to fight for what seems like an eternity and to complete the objective they they cry they carry burdens pain misury but also happiness laughter and joys on the battlefield this is truly a band of brothers note seriously this game is the perfect war sim it eclipses cod battlefield metal of honor in everyway while those games grant kill streaks and fast pace action arma just throws you in and lets you face reality and the community grants you with everything what s keeping this from a 10 10 game is probably a 9 7 9 8 is the poor optimization which i sadly could say i ve glanced over since the game is soo good i reccommend this game if you really want a real experience
