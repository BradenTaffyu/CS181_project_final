2018 this game is as close to 10 10 as possible there are plenty of encounters that play off each other and impact that can be had from simple interactions you might not think much of the amount of interplay from this game is absolutely amazing and i m almost certain you can have hundreds of hours and still miss some really small nuanced things in the game i came into this game never having played the first and i still absolutely loved it single player is completely awesome even if a bit more work but if you have a group of friends to play this with all the more awesome the following review is spoken without ever touching modding or anything beyond the base campaign some complaints that you should be on the lookout for grasping the spell interactions can be a bit steep when starting out for mages for instance you may poison your undead tank to heal them and then hit them with a spell called fortify which can remove your heal sometimes you can be roped into conversation with a character who isn t your pursuasion char and then be forced to spill spaghetti and rope your team into a fight line of sight will 9 times out of 10 kill you and you can only cry a single tear as the npc sometimes snipes you through solid walls spell mileage will vary greatly from the player to the computer a charmed taunted npc may cheese out their turn where you will seemingly always be forced to do something absolutely silly and try to kill yourself whenever your characters are charmed taunted they will absolutely destroy your inventory full of consumables though they will always use your rain scrolls first in later levels with lots of particle effects and interactions the computer may take quite a bit of time in deciding their turns sometimes depending on how good your computer is you can have a very unstable game some playstyles aren t quite viable for instance a battle mage is possible but not really ideal as you end up splitting damage over physical magical resistance which makes crowd control nigh impossible as the real damage from physical magical spells comes out when you are hitting their hit points directly spirit vision a thing that lets you talk with ghosts is great from a lore perspective but it can be easy to forget how versatile it is if you re not actively thinking about it and if you re actively thinking about it you pretty much have to spam it and walk across the world hoping you don t miss a fun little lore tid bit some fights are just straight up brutal if you don t quite know what s going on all i can say is don t be afraid to google a bit of help if you re really strugglingdespite the complaints above those really are just minor inconvinences which you ll have from time to time think of them like speedbumps in the middle of a really awesome racetrack like you can t deny the rest of the racetrack how awesome it is though you sometimes wish you could run it without the speedbumps fingers crossed that some grievances will be removed in the enhanced edition pros after the initial learning curve you basically get to sit back and relax and explore an amazingly intricate world of well written well voiced beautifully animated and beautifully built npcs and the world they live in you get a lot of self insertion capability either playing the righteous hero or scourge of the land and now for a fun story with minor spoilers soi m playing beaston the last legs of his lifebeing beaten upunfairlyby 3 condecending copies of amadia and 1 of dunahe s shackledhe s maimedhe s crippledhe s flooredhe s on firehe s an inch from deathour team long since abandoned himsave for one lovely summoner faneand his incarnate waga championin a true heroic momenttried to send a charge of battering ram to knock them all downbut no one got to see what happened after the champion chargedall 4 members of our divinty crashed as soon as the spell was cast11 10 would get rekt again
