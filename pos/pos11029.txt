if i could vote in between thumbs up and thumbs down i would the game has potential its rough on the edges rn but so was the original cs1 didn t have tunnels at launch and lacked many of the features we take for granted cs2 however is just lacking things that base cs1 has all these years later post updates were not asking for the dlcs for free but the free content you gave us over all these years should ve been the foundation of cs2 mod support finally being here is the only thing keeping playing this over the original but even with that mod support its hard to play this over the first one the only reason i can recommend this game is for the hope that colossal order change there ways and due what they did that made the first one so successful charging us 10 for palm trees or 10 for a map and a bridge ain t it chief give us the cs1 magic and this game will prosper on a small tangential note the hate on the game being buggy and unfinished is a little overblown the game is completely functional reiterating an earlier point cs1 didn t have tunnels at launch or eu themeing for that matter the game needs time to cook just like the original the hate on the predatory palm trees and bridge pricing is completely warranted its asinine they are charging us these insane prices for such little content compared to what that same 10 will get you in cs1 dlc
