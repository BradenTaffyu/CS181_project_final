2016 early access review i think the best way of describing rimworld is prison architect with more going on and less control if this game appeals to you solely through that sentence buy it you ll love it if not then let me go into more detail first let s take the assumption you have seen what prison architect is a top down view with people wandering around and surviving in a realistic way you overseeing them this game stays true to that just with many more hurdles think of it as doing a 200m hurdle dash except there is a hurdle every three steps you could get over most of them but a lot of them you re going to stumble through until eventually you trip up that is this game struggling through an onslaught of challenges just making it through until one gets you there is room for improvement tutorial is non existent luckily i am a souper jenius and managed to understand it from messing around but it could require some learning to get started the game is viartually bug free which is a bonus i m struggling for bad points but it s really just the anti beginner missiles lots of people compare it to dwarf fortress i am not one of these people
