2019 didn t think i would like this very much given that the 3k period isn t something i m super into but i ll be damned if i don t love this game okay so the battle ai is still pretty predictable but everything else has been improved massively so lots of great new mechanics diplomacy actually matters now campaign ai gave me a good run for my money the game looks gorgeous and is actually optimized so that it runs great as well its not that it hasn t got issues it does but compared to what we re used to from a tw release its bonkers how polished this is well done creative assembly i hope this is the new baseline for ca because if it is this series just reached a whole new level brings a wee tear to my eye thinking of how far the series has come since the original shogun
