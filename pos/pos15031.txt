2021 i ll be honest when i first tried don t starve waaaaaay back in 2014 after getting my ps4 and getting the game for free as a playstation plus game i wasn t overly impressed keep in mind that this was way before any of the dlcs for that game came out but something about the game kept drawing me back in eventually i said to myself this is a good game but it d definitely be cool if i could play with friends sometime after that klei announced don t starve together and over the years this game kept delivering and delivering from cool events to nice exclusive twitch unlockables and just last week officially updated the game to have a crossover with terraria in this game players are put into a randomly generated world with different biomes and set pieces there s also seasons summer fall winter spring and each season effects the world in various ways for example winter is dangerous because without proper supplies or a base you may freeze to death food is also more scarce in spring food tends to grow faster due to the temperature being ideal and rain has a tendency to be very common unprepared players may also end up with a lureplant growing in their base too during spring each season brings it s own boss and challenges if you get tired of exploring the surface you can travel underground into the caves and discover a whole new world of weirdness that the constant the name of the world realm the player is in has in store from spelunking monkeys to glowing colorful mushroom trees and even dangerous ruins this game is very fun especially when you have friends klei has spent years and years on this game and they keep adding more to it that being said especially with the new terraria stuff i really wish i could nominate this game and terraria together for the labor of love steam award but it s so unfair that i can only select games from this year as i d love to nominate terraria for better with friends i can t wait to see what the future brings for don t starve together as each update we get more lore and things get even more epic
