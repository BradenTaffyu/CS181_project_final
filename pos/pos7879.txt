2019 early access review beamng drive is absolutely one of the most beloved vehicle simulators out where your imagination is the limit you can install countless mods play an insane amount of playable scenarios make your own scenario or if you just wanna go loose in the sandbox and destroy stuff is entirely up to you honestly the only problem that i have at the moment is no multiplayer or co op i hope it gets added in the future beam 9 10 for me
