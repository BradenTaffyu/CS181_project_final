2020 updated with fatal falls this continues to be near perfection as far as 2d games go the new dlc is totally worth it with new areas and the scarecrow boss also has new weapons and mutations making each run more and more diverse incredible the care they put in this game and should totally be in anyone s top list of games in this genre this game is metroidvania rogue like near perfected simple as that some will argue on a payed dlc after all the free ones but it is 120 worth it the amount of care and detail in this game is incredible and after playing 27 hours the bad seed dlc feels fresh and different new enemies new areas 2 big ones new boss new weapons new music and more can get a tad crazy which is great to help the reflexes of this mid 40 s guy lol controller totally recommended if you finish this game on keyboard i salute you
