2019 been a civ lover since civ1 and civ2 skipped 3 4 played some 5 and have played a lot of 6 i like them all for different reasons i ll lead with what i like about civ6 and ultimately why i recommend it and then close with what i consider wrong with civ6 at the time of this writing i have no multiplayer experience with 6 the good the name of the game is city and district planning as cities now consume far more than a single map tile long overdue very aesthetically pleasing it s worth playing with music on until you ve heard it all apart from the spatial restructuring of cities it s civilization if you liked any of the games you ll probably enjoy this one at least sometimes the pre made scenarios are fun and are an excellent idea if you don t want to commit to a 12h marathon natural disasters dlc add some interesting randomization though this also lends to a complaint below the bad all leaders seem to suffer the same from natural disasters which fails to reflect for example nomadic tribes being more resilient to dust storms i may have been mistaken at least slightly in this point russian units take no damage from blizzards looks like some thought went into this but perhaps not enough for me to fully appreciate the dlc cost they still have the giant death robots which means that every long domination game on a large map leads to the same place for every leader nukes and vacuum cleaners an option to disable gdr and nukes should be part of the canon code when customizing a game and it s not the ugly map generation takes an exceptionally long time and i have a modern rig with a true beefcake processor please wait locks on your turn and enemy turns mean auto saving is mandatory on your turn you can usually open and close the world congress to clear the lock but no such luck on enemy turns the civilopedia seems to be the most neglected aspect of civ6 several necessary game mechanics are explained inaccurately if at all also the text input for it could use a complete makeover the legendary start feature of custom games present in prior games as well is not all that legendary as it doesn t seem to take leader differences into account at all at least one of the custom map types will not start a game with kupe since he starts in the water some basic error checking overlooked in several aspects of the game to the devs credit though they still seem to be paying attention i think civ 5 remains the better of the 5 6 in terms of polish and smooth function but 6 is an excellent and developmentally challenging step forward i m confident the game will continue to improve and i ve certainly enjoyed the majority of my time in it to date
