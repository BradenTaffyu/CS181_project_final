2013 arma 3 is a tricky game to review but here s me trying it anyway the reason why this game is so hard to review lies in the sheer size of the game and the variety of things it may or may not offer for the player i take arma 3 for what it is first and foremost a platform what you get is a good looking game with a solid would be great but you have to do some optimization to boost your performance engine two amazing maps stratis and altis which is probably the most impressive map i ve seen in any open world ish game and the prospect of near endless new content from the community what you don t get is an easy to get into mil shooter with cod sized maps and a quick pace if you re in for uncomplicated fast paced pvp gameplay you should probably look elsewhere if you re sick of that however arma 3 might be just your thing the strength of the arma series is freedom yeah you are free to mod the game into almost anything you want create any type of mission and make your very own gameplay experience you have to invest some time into the game but once you got into it the opportunities are endless want to play huge adversial or coop maps with a hundred players or more arma is just your thing and there are big communities in many different languages that will help you find that epic experience want to play singe player well if you expect strong single player content with interesting characters and storyline and so on then arma 3 isn t the game you re looking for or is it right now bohemia delivered one part of a three part campaign those missions are challenging offer a solid variety of infantry gameplay but don t expect a good story or interesting characters but as mentioned before the huge amount of community made missions and mods offer hours and hours of playtime personally i prefer small cooperative missions to play with friends already the steam workshop has countless missions for 2 5 players so should you buy arma 3 well i d certainly recommend it if any of the things i mentioned above sounds fun to you it is to say though that this game is not something that everyone might like so stay away from it if you are not willing to invest some time into it i hope that this review helped some people to decide whether or not they should by arma 3 please note that i m not a native english speaker so the language used in this review might seem a little odd for some
