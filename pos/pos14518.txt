2016 first impression christopher tin delivers again the menu theme may not be baba yetu but it s pretty damn close seems i will now have two games where everytime i start them i have to hang out in the main menu for a few minutes civ iv and civ vi runs flawlessly literally haven t encountered any technical issues so far loading and such seems smoother than civ v more micro managing probably a minus for some people how disctrics and builders work are a nice addition even if they don t actually change much from how workers functioned in previous installments it makes the game fresh i like how policies work i m not a fan of the cartoon look of the units however cities buildings and the fog of war are spectacular features i m liking all the new features that they ve added the ones they ve changed i like too however the ones that are missing i m missing overall this might be a plus though might move it later some bugs nothing game breaking so far though diplomacy seems sketchy as in needs fixing much like civ v did with expansions iirc i like how the different civs seem to have more personality thoughupdate diplomacy seems to have the same problem that it had at the start of civ v vanilla it feels random don t know if i ve just been unlucky and triggered several opposing civ hidden agendas or if this is indeed the case update after som experimenting seems like the ai likes to declare war against you if they think they can beat you so if your army is small war of course to some extent this has always happened in civ but it happens constantly in this game if you play a certain style i guess that makes for more realistic ai as that is how multiplayer matches often play out but for people like me who always prefered playing for culture victories this is a big minus not enough for me to give the game a not recommended but enough for me to say untill they fix this i d recommend civ v dlcs more and i d like to add that trying to spice up the diplomacy formula is a good idea but it needs tweaking i m really liking it so far it is in not perfect but it freshens up the civ formula with some of the new additions and i really like how they didn t take the easy and safe way out with the changes i remember reading how some things would be simplified and streamlined which usually translates to we made stuff easier for casuals who can t bother with complex games but of all the things i ve encountered so far that they ve streamlined or simplified it s all been legit nothing that takes away complexity only things that make for a smoother experience the issues that i ve found so far in the game diplomacy and bugs are hopefully things they ll fix with patches and expansions just like they did with civ v seems like civ vi has a bright future ahead of it will update review accordingly
