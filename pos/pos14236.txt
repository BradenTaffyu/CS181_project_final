2021 early access review this game is a gem still in the rough perhaps but the small dev team is constantly making great new changes and additions if you like factory building games or simply sim type games this can potentially be huge for you the core gameplay is build factories to build more factories to build more factories sounds dumb you might say but it is just really addictive there is a real satisfaction in figuring out systems optimizing them and overcoming new hurdles required for new higher tech tiers seen it played factorio already you might say but this game adds a whole new level to it with gorgeous visuals and amazing planetary to galactic scale it feels so good to sail through space between planets and even star systems to set up more factories or mining of more new resources and quite often you will look up from placing more factories to see the sunrise over your creations with the sun glinting in thousands of solar sails in orbit or creating reliefs with your dyson sphere structures and tiny blinking stars everywhere as your vast network of transport vessels go into warp speed my one main gripe with the game as of the time of this review is the lack of endgame content motivation once you unlocked everything build a few dyson spheres and doubled your factories output a few times i just run out of motivation to keep going i want to expand out into a larger galactic scale i want to build space stations platetary orbital miners warp gates for my transport vessels i want to harness the power of dozens of dyson spheres to achive even greater things i want to keep investing into the 100h playthrough but there is just no real motivation to do so the game would benefit immensely from a few more tech tiers to truly take it to the galactic scale but instead the devs are currently as of time of review working on adding combat to the game instead i cannot help but feel that is a mistake as the core appeal of the game is the relaxed and chill gameplay where you nerd around trying to find the best biggest or coolest way of doing things or take a break to just soak in the glory of your creations with a gorgeous backdrop having to rebuild and or defend old stuff all the time really would not add anything positive to that imo hopefully once the devs are done with the combat update which is thankfully going to be an optional choice hopefully we will get more endgame content that this game truly deserves regardless this game is well worth the low cost of the game and you will get hundreds of hours of fun i wholeheartedly recommend it to any fan of this genre and if you are not try it out anyway
