2016 i actually can not understand all the bad reviews here i played civ 1 3 4 5 be and i think that civ6 is very good it s not perfect but it s much better than any civilization game right after the release pros since civ3 there was a very nasty tradition that each next version of civilization is worse than a previous one with dlcs because many feature were cut in a new version and civilization 6 breaks this rule the only important gameplay feature which was presented in civ5 but has been removed from civ6 is un and also civ6 introduces many new features city districts is a pretty interesting feature it still requires some polishing but i already like itwonders which take it s own cell are very good it makes the game much more interesting you don t have one city with all wonders in it anymore this feature requires planning and thinking do you need this wonder do you actually need the benefit from it are you ready to sacrifice one cell for it people won t work there anymore builders are also became better this change helped to avoid tens of them on later stages of the gamecasus belli is a very interesting conceptnew tree for culture science is also interesting idea which makes game much more diversesean beancons broken balance that is most awful thing in the game it is okay ish right after release but it should be fixed and i hope developers will fix it as soon as possible especially diplomacy it doesn t work as it should also map generator requires some tweaking having 10 cells of tundra followed by two cells of hills and then followed by 10 cells of desert does not look good some features require too much micromanagement for instance spies and gossips bad ai but lets be honest civ 3 4 5 all have bad ai as well no editorneutral new ui it s not so bad as people are saying just people get used to civ5 s ui and it has been changed herenew graphics style before release i was against this new style but now i think it s not bad it doesn t feel like indie or mobile game maps and fog of war are pretty nice and stylishactive progression aka eureka s are good enough but require some tweaking in my personal opiniongood soundtrack
