as the game stands currently it is clear efforts are being made to improve the game and to set the stage for new content i know that this review will be bombed by negative comments but i do understand them too as in the end we all payed for the game and it stings to know how bad the launch was i sometimes truly ask if people have forgotten the launch of this games predecessor payday 2 and truly think on how the game was then i was there and i do remember how bad it was dare i say worst than payday 3 and now since 10 years of updates and new content obviously the predecessor outshines the newest counterpart i went on a bit of a rant here but i just simply cannot say the game is being abandoned or shutdown when there are clear improvements being done whilst adding some new things i don t consider a new grenade something worthwhile but i am not a fool either man how i wish payday 3 had the same content pipeline as payday 2 had then maybe all of the negativity surrounding the game would dissipate but alas it was not sustainable as developers are human too before playing the game yourself and if you played payday 2 just remember payday 2 launch was also like this if not worse i am aware i will be down voted for this but i m tired of pretending the game is bad when i feel the contrary
