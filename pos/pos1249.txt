2021 early access review i had been eyeing on this game for a few yearstheres build 40 and build 41 beta build 40 is the main game players play when they first download project zomboid while build 41 is the beta version testing for bugs that is accessable through the beta options menu on properties in project zomboid build 40 is not detailed in animation you can t jump high fences no crouch sneaking some traits aren t available compared to build 41 beta but it has multiplayerbuild 41 has most animation details doesn t have multiplayer because the dev is fixing it in its beta version to later fully release it to the main game a few more traits and perhaps items i still need to play more the game to see all the items this version has personally i very much enjoy playing build 41 because it feels more realistic than the build 40 so i unfortunately do have to play that version alone since there is no multiplayer online personally i have only played in survivor difficulty and well i have died quiet a few times luckly you just create a new character kill your previous survivor who is most likely zombified get your loot back and continue surviving the down side of that and its on both version you lose all your experience so its back from 0 to do all of it in build 40 i mainly play it for only purposes and to learn more about the game that way like what to do with skill or what to build to have fun and mess around too what got me playing this game is someone elses recommendation with over 1k of hours in the game and a few youtube videos recommendation its good people think it deserves to have a higher price change because of its details in the game and how realistic it is i suggest to get the game while its on discount try out build 40 on your own or with friends first then play build 41 beta on your own or if you have a roommate play on remote play or something so that it doesn t feel too lonely sorry if i missed something have a good day though and good luck edit the game is getting a overhaul on sound and new gameplay is being added to the games development look forward to that this source comes from the project zomboid blog post in their websiteedit 2 build 42 was announced a long while back the game has generally gotten a great overhaul it is still a hard to learn game but if your willing to put in the time to learn and understand everything else will be smooth survival experience for those fanatic apocalyptic zombie survival players
