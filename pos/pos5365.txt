2022 early access review i have played many rogue likes in the same vein as this game tales of maj eyal elona cataclysm dark days ahead etc and can safely say that not only is this game the best from a mechanical standpoint but also it is the best in being easily accessible its controls aren t simple per se but they aren t mind bendingly convoluted like the ones in dwarf fortress or cataclysm like all of these types of games it will take time to get used to them but eventually you will realize that they are relatively streamlined and also quite modular another advantage this game holds over those last two and many other roguelikes is that is very easy to understand what you are seeing on the screen like any other rogue like this game runs on a grid based system but in this one everything exists on flat planes meaning you won t have to raise and lower the camera depth up and down a hill to see five feet in front of you like you would in dwarf fortress that isn t to say there aren t ups and down because in this game there most definitely is in fact caves of qud goes infinitely down as far as i know the further you go down the harder enemies you will find mechanically this game is deeper than say tales of maj eyal but not as deep as something like cataclysm or dwarf fortress but that is not a bad thing far from it actually the mechanics in this game are a happy medium between mindless unstrategic simplicity and unbalanced cumbersome complexity there are many ways to approach a fight with intuitive outside the box thinking with it still retaining brutal but fair balance that it is an outstanding achievement in game design in my opinion it needs to be stated that tales of maj eyels combat can be too simple to the point where its combat resembles diablo and cataclysm can be so convoluted that it can take multiple key combinations to do something simple caves of qud controls beautifully and is mechanically deep and all that jazz but to prove that point i ll tell a story i was wandering through the jungle somewhere in the middle region of qud when i came upon an old factory with ancient conveyor belts that would pick up items and push them down holes that would drop down a floor onto another conveyor and the process would repeat till it reached the bottom floor that in itself was quite curious for such ruined machinery to still be active unmanned after all the potentially thousands of years it had been left in ruin and decay what however was more curious was that high level enemies kept popping out tiny hatches in walls and onto conveyor belts infinitely i knew i was barely strong enough to fight one let alone infinite amounts and i couldn t run away because i couldn t outrun them i was a mutant who had hook shaped feet that which slowed me down quite significantly i knew i had to act fast so i jumped on the conveyor belt and jumped down the hole to the floor below once i was a floor below i stepped off the conveyor belt to the side of the hole above me i knew in just a few turns an infinite string of enemies which i could not fight would down upon me so i began to consider my options checking my inventory i had various mines in my inventory which i considered placing but then thought better of it a mine only explodes one time and would be dragged away by the conveyor at this moment i began to feel hopeless and trapped but then i noticed something in my inventory i was holding a canteen multiple canteens to be more precise and in those canteens gave me hope for in them was drams and drams of molten lava i had acquired from a cave almost immediately my genius plan of action came to mind i injected a drug that made me temporarily immune to heat and began pouring all the lava i had onto the conveyor belt hoping it wouldn t be moved by the conveyor belts and fortunately it didn t and then it happened one by one the enemies fell into lava and were quickly killed over and over the interesting thing about this strategy is that it would never work in any other circumstance because enemies will avoid stepping on tiles containing lava as much as possible but because they couldn t see the lava until having already fallen down into it they blindly fell to their deaths it s moments like this that are deeply satisfying to play and unique to this game it can happen all the time if you play thoughtfully and intuitively and it wasn t complex to do either you could probably do things like this in other rogue likes like cataclysm and dwarf fortress but in those games it s hard enough to remember what buttons you have to press to punch someone so in a way skews your mental capacity and prevents you from thinking of mere possibility of doing something like that the process of what i did in was vastly easier to do as i only really had to open my inventory scroll down to the canteens click on them click pour on the ground click the direction to pour and click enter it may sound like a lot but the way ui guides you is very well designed and helpful in preventing you from getting lost in a sea of unintuitive obtuse menus and lists for those who are somehow not sold yet but like cataclysm for its interesting unique setting this game is not just as good it s better imo for those who want to learn the setting for themselves this is a minor spoiler warning don t read past this paragraph and go buy the gosh dang game caves of qud takes place in a world that is most likely earth or was earth rather something happened long long ago and i mean long long long ago that wiped out civilization as we know it or as we will know it because at the time of humanities destruction it was a super advanced human civilizations with technology so advanced that it could warp the fabric of space and time unfortunately it was most likely those very technologies that wiped the human civilization out now what remained of this land now named qud was something completely different humans still existed but they were vastly outnumbered by the either mutated or evolved or both animal species which could better adapt to the harsh environments of qud man was no longer at the top of the food chain when they couldn t see in the dark caves below like the nocturnal snapjaw a bipedal coyote like thing which could reproduce like rats so man only two ways to keep up one by mutating themselves into unrecognizable abominations and or psychics with powers over the laws of nature or by installing robotic enhancements and becoming mechanical cyborgs in the land of qud water is rare and freshwater is even rarer so rare that it had become the currency used in buying and selling to the southwest is saltmarshes swamps of saltwater to the west is salt dunes a sea of salty desert to the northwest a city perched upon a hill like an oasis in the middle of endless salt that is the city on the cover art btw to the north is a barrier of impassable mountains to the east is a ruined metropolis filled with ancient robots that still roam around aimlessly with an intent to kill in the center are forests of mushroom that can infect you and turn you into spore carriers forests filled with goat people that wield revolvors pistols shotguns and even snipers and to top it all off beneath you feet are hundred and hundreds of floor of ancient infrastructure left in ruin but well preserved because they are where can not reach for some reason i do not quite know every living being and i mean every is not only sentient but sapient as well even though the plants that haven t a central nervous system still somehow have self aware thoughts many of which you can speak to i wouldn t bother though because they usually don t have the mouths or vocal cords to reciprocate their response it is stuff like this that make the setting of so unique and interesting to me and i hope this review conveyed that in a way that was sufficient go buy caves of qud
