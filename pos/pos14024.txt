2018 early access review i love this game it is pretty calming and laid back except for when you run out of power and no one can make food so everyone starts starving and then you can t make anymore oxygen so everyone starts suffocating and then everyone is stressed and destroyes things and makes messes everywhere and your entire colony dies within minutes
