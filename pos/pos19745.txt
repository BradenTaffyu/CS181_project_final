2016 obsidian is an amazing company with a solid background in rpgs and storytelling fallout new vegas is my favorite fallout game with fallout 2 following closely and is an amazing rpg with great lore building and lore stacking obsidian also knows what the an rpg actually is unlike bethesda and makes great advancements over fallout 3 and over fallout 4 as well the reintroduction of traits which was short lived as fallout 4 lost all of its rpg elements was a great feature to fnv taking traits from the orginal fallout games and adding new ones even going as far as to add even more in the old world blues dlc the perk system is similar to fallout 2 a perk ever other level rather than one every level the perks also do what bethesda perks don t which is actually behave like perks by this i mean that the perks in fnv are game changing perks should make the game play differently rather than just doing more damage or more ex per task jury rigging and mad bomber are my favorite perks from fnv adding new ways to supply yourself with weapons and changing up how the repair system works there are perks that do add more ex per task like i mentioned but its signifigance is small compared to how many there are to change combat crafting survival and speech options lore i absolutely love lore i can t get enough lore out of things i m into the brotherhood of steel lore especially i m a huge bos fan obsidian does this amazing thing whereas others cough cough bethesda don t surprise they actually know what the they re talking about when they write lore they actually give a damn if the lore can be supported and if it will conflict with other lore they build onto previous lore and write new lore where its needed jacobstown is a huge reference to fallout 1 and 2 the name of jacobstown itself is a big reference the super mutants who mention the masters army is a big reference nightkin is a reference which i thought had been lost in the newer games obsidian knows what they re doing with lore much better than the company which prides inself on it s storytelling so obsidian is a great company who deserves ever dollar they get from you buying this game they make amazing rpgs they write great lore and overall they re just good at what they do and isnt that what it should all be about in the end making a great game requires a great company to make it p s the head honcho of obsidian is one of the lead directors of fallout 2 so classic fallout fans you can trust him you also should try out kotor 2 or star wars knights of the old republic 2 another great obsidian game
