2020 a masterpiece if you play the game you will understand why i call it a masterpiece it s impossible to explain with words you can only know by feeling it you can only know by playing and being consumed by the dark souls universe you will ultimately become a better person the second you launch this game i suffer from an addiction called league of legends i was a terrible person when i played that trash game it gave me major depression from being hardstuck gold 3 19lp dark souls has changed my life for the better it has made me better at communicating with women and ever since i launched the game nothing has come to me but pure joy and happiness i have gotten married to the woman of my dreams i have also started a family and i am going to get my daughter into dark souls once she is old enough i will never let this game die as long as i live dark souls is truly an amazing experience that you do not want to miss out on it will bring you so much joy and fortune i have never been happier and i haven t played league in a very long time now i dont even have the urge or temptation to even install the game i think that if smokers played dark souls they would forget about smoking they wouldn t even want to take time out of their day to smoke when they can just play dark souls 3
