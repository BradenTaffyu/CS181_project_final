2021 i am a fallout fan since fallout 3 and i have been playing fallout 4 for so many hundreds of hours fallout 76 is very similar in visuals with fallout 4 but if you wanna play a fallout game only with your friends and do missions together and build your mini community in game well this is it i see many friendly players in this game players helping one another gifting items for free and teaming up to do missions together is fun the downside is players like me who are addicted to fallout 4 base building and management stuff will surely struggle to unlock all the parts that are basically needed to build stuff in other words most of the items are needed to buy through atomic shop purchases which is again a huge bummer and disappointment for casual players like myself i mean additional themes and decors can be sold as micro transactions i can understand but why keep all the basic building stuff also purchasable through atomic shop this is where players get pissed off the most and mark it as a dislike for this game otherwise if you have say 4 5 friends who want to play fallout world together and have fun this game will give you all that joy and funny moments also as of latest update please note the below key points level up system is very complex to understand comparing with fallout 4 s easy scroll chart system every time you get into the worlds your base is gone so you need to build again but oh some other player has already occupied their base in your location now you have to keep searching a best place to settle in and this is a tiresome job every time player logs in to the world huge limitations on inventory stash update you need to get a bag pack blueprint or plan for bag pack to add additional weight the highest level you are the better the chance of carrying more items cannot build multiple bases unless you buy from atom shop an extra slot exciting story line and can be playable both solo and with other players and co op advance players dropping nukes constantly in areas that most players are either building stuff and had to stop their fun and go hide away huge map to explore and so much to loot crafting is a pain at the beginning tip just scrap those good looking weapons no matter how much you love scraping gives you learning points and they unlock advance parts so you can make new weapons and modify with more custom parts i would recommend buying this game only on saleif u have fallout 4 and thinking to switch to fallout 76 for more base building please don t stay with fallout 4
