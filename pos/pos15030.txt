2017 don t starve together is a game that i can say quite a lot about even as someone who hasn t played the original don t starve if you are wanting to buy this game but you intend to only play it by yourself then i strongly suggest you stop now don t get this game and get the original don t starve along with its dlcs instead if you still want to get this game then i m just going to say that there is a lot to learn about this game and you ll need to know stuff about the original don t starve as well you don t need to know the plot of the original game to know what don t starve is about even though it is a sequel in a way you don t need to know what happened basically you re going to be dropped into a world and you are going to have only one goal survive as long as you can there is a lore to the game and it is an incredibly rich lore that should definitely get some sort of attention because it s really interesting and ever so more expanding the world is already interesting enough with the kind of creatures it holds and what each of the playable characters can do but it s that lore that does make this world all the much the better once you know it right off the bat the game spews charm from it from character and monster designs to the artstyle the old vintage look and even down the music which sounds like what you would imagine the world would have i can sit on the main menu of this game for hours to listen to the theme you ll have 12 characters to pick and choose who you ll play as each one with different stats and different abilities that make them stand out from each other for players who have already played don t starve you won t have to worry about these characters needing to be unlocked they re all unlocked right out of the gate also for players who have played don t starve the characters have changed a bit in order to be a bit more balanced for multiplayer each character fits a different play style so you ll never feel as though you re playing as the same character and you can feel the differences with each character and you ll find someone with a playstyle who you ll enjoy playing as the most this game is not easy and if you are new you ll probably not survive for very long in it especially if you do not know what to do the game is not going to teach you anything you ll either have to learn to survive as you play learn from other players or research about the game at no point are you ever going to be safe you ll have to eat to keep yourself from starving find ways to restore your character s sanity so that way you don t go insane and be attacked by shadow creatures fire can spread and destroy precious resources some resources can t respawn some creatures will attack and try to kill you and there will be a pack of hounds that will randomly come after you as you go through each day even changing seasons will be a hazard as you ll either have to survive the cold of winter the storms of spring or the heat of summer it may be hard to get into first but once you get a grasp of the game and how it plays it feels so satisifying to be able to survive longer than you used to you ll need to craft items to survive and even craft items to craft even more items and you ll need as much as you can and know exactly what you need to survive for so long the one thing that stands about this game over the original don t starve is that this one has online multiplayer where you can play up to 6 other people you can play by yourself but it won t be easier than playing with others unless you have mods supported by the steam workshop if you re going to play this game with others i highly recommend playing with friends if there is one thing i can say about this game is that it will get reptitive once you get the hang of the game it s just a matter of surviving as long as you can and if you are able to learn the game to the point where you know everything about it you ll have nearly nothing to worry about if you want a challenging survival game and one that you can play with friends this game is definitely for you and i can highly recommend it to others even though it can get repetitive after a while i still find it to be a fun game where you ll always have to be doing something to survive and keep going and with the developers continuing to add more stuff to the game and showing a great passion for it i can see it being supported for a long time
