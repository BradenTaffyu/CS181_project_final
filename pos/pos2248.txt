2020 man it s a complicated experience on the one hand i think it s the best world bethesda have ever designed it s clearly built around exploration and that s always been bethesda s strong suit the crafting and base building mechanics fit in with this nicely and the survival aspects are basically like new vegas s hardcore mode the perk card system is a pretty cool way to build a character you will not be a jack of all trades and it really feels like the choices matter and directly impact how you playon the other hand there s stuff that s incredibly disappointing i found an interesting area and group of enemies hidden deep underground and you d like to think you d get some loot to fit in with that theme loot their outfits or at least a unique weapon or something but instead their outfit is an atomic shop item and their base is filled with generic scrap so you directly know when you see this in the atomic shop that this stuff should have been where they were and in fact the assets are already on the npcs just not for you you can earn a fair number of atomic shop points just playing the game but even so it s so much less exciting picking something up from a separate purchasing interface rather than the game itself that type of monetization sucks and you run into items and features being sold that you know would just be part of the game in past releases or most other developers i still recommend the game i m enjoying it a lot more than fallout 4 actually and i think the core is excellent i just wish the monetization was not at odds with good design choices but unfortunately it is and on multiple levels
