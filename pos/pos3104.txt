2017 early access review if you enjoyed the first part you will love this one after playing the first act very thorough here are my highlights combat strategic and creative combat just like in the first game combine the skills you value just the way you want it combine skills and spells for devastating combos make it rain turn the water into poison set it on fire and cause a massive inferno overcome challenging adversaries use diverse statuses to deal with superior forces stuns freezing burning poison slow petrifried while using others to help your own team rested fortified magic shell haste regenerating but beware your opponents will use this very system themselves to put an end to your adventure story play as a sourcerer individuals capable of using an ancient force known as source which attracts the voidwoken monsters prone to ending the world start as the ultimate underdog be a prisoner in fort joy a place where they herd sourcerers to cure them and try to break out while wearing a collar that surpresses you using source pick a origin be the noble red prince the mystical lohse or the vengeful sebille and maybe others that might come in the future or make your own character and customize him her with the new tag system are you a scholar and an outlaw or maybe a barbaric noble kind of guy it s for you to decide these tags offer unique dialogue options and influence the way you expierence your character and your followers have tags of their own making them even more alive you are godwoken chosen by the gods to do great things
