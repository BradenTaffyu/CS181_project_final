if you are new to magic the gathering and would like to learn how to play then this game is for you and it is free yes you can make ingame purchases for gems and gold and cosmetics but really it isn t necessary you can play for free so you re fine unless you are greedy and want to have everything quickly go ahead spend money p there are a lot of challenges you can complete to earn the same gems gold cards booster packs etc for free it just takes longer i emphasize it being free because paper magic and mtgo apart from extremely expensive are very competitive for new players this can be overwhelming and demotivating the first few games are vs bots because it assumes you are new once you get through the introduction you get paired with other players and you will receive the option to play ranked games versus other players as much as you want and occasionally there is some sort of event going on usually to celebrate the release of a new set
