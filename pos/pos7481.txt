2022 this game is amazing the only problem is this game also sucks lets give the pros and conspros the islands the islands are really cool to explore and super cool to see all the story islands and see how big they arethe story the story is amazing while having to figure out why earth is just a huge ocean and why there are barley any people left on earth gameplay the gameplay is actually decent it isn t good nor is it really bad cons multiplayer having more than 2 people on the raft makes getting materials super hard and food is scarce sure it s a survival game and thats how it works but this is honestly way too much platforming in a game where you have to survive on a raft i wasn t expecting it to be good or bad but this is just way too much half the time when just jumping on scaffolding or walking up stairs you will just randomly fall gets very annoying very quickly enemies this game has a lot of unique enemies but this games shark bruce the shark is the most annoying enemy in this entire game he does way too much damage and sometimes when you stab him with the spear the hits don t even register so he just swims away i hate the shark and even in early game when you first start hes a really good enemy because he keeps you on your toes but in the late game he become a annoyance and nobody likes it the bugs okay okay i can give this some slack but not a lot raft s bugs can get annoying one of the bugs in this game is falling through floors yes on islands or your raft you will just clip randomly and best part about it is sometimes you will get stuck there until you die another bug is items will just randomly disappear out of your inventory and no i didn t drop them or put them in my inventory they just disappear honestly this game is really fun i played 4 player coop with my friends and we had our ups and downs with the game this game is very re playable but i wouldn t play it again i do recommend people play this game because i played it from when it first came out to when they finished it what is my final review on this game well i d give it a 7 5 10 it wasn t the best but it was a hell of a ride when playing with friends go play this but play with your friends it s a whole different experience than playing with your friends
