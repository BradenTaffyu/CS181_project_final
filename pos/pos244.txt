2016 i ve gotten about 20 hours into this game at this point i can honestly say that it has more charm than any of the more recent harvest moon games i grew up with m fomt and btn and this game has me as hooked as those two did the events feel organic characters feel fleshed out and diverse and there are always things to do the depth of this game is astounding you can harness lightning bolts and sprinklers and mine cart fast travel the list goes on fishing is theraputic farming and designing your land is theraputic speaking to the villagers and watching events is engaging this game is just an incredibly comfortable addictive experience and i would fully recommend it to anyone
