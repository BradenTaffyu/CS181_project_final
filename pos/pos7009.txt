2018 early access review 7 10 years ago when i was like 10 14 years old i found a game called minecraft the game was so imersive that you felt you were actually part of the world could spend hours doing nothing at all but at the same time your doing everything this game is the same i bought it 5 min after release and i just now decided to take a break 7 hours in i legit thought it has been like 3 hours max but this game theres somthing about the graphics and the music that just pulls this game nicely together
