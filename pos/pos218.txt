2017 i once played this game for thirty seven hours straight i logged my first hundred hours within a week i don t even know how to articulate what about this game makes me like it eventually you do escape but you always slightly lament the stardew shaped void in your life a part of me doesn t know what to do anymore now and i m not sure i ll get it back also you will actually fall in love with your spouse if you choose one like you will talk about them it s a problem 11 10 gave me an existential crisis that i live with every day
