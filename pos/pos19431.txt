2020 a little premise before my review i ve tried fo4 and requested a refund after two and a half hours of gameplay fo4 is an open world sandbox action shooter not an rpg i have player fo3 and fo nv a lot and for the purposes of highlighting the merits of new vegas i will review it in comparison to fo3 story in fo3 the story is almost completely linear there s only a karma system that changes things a bit but even that is somewhat overdone you will get positive karma even for the smallest good thing you do if you are playing your character as a sane person it is difficult to not end up saint new vegas retains the karma system but it uses it in a better way in relation to perks different karma will allow you to pick a different ultimate perk and does not prevent you from recruiting companions the big addition though is the faction relations feature depending on how you do with factions and which quests you chose to do endings become radically different this is no mass effect multiple endings the depth of new vegas is on a different level compared to fo3 level design worldbuilding and atmosphere now this is where things become very interesting you see at first fallout 3 might impress you with the capital wasteland the ruins of dc and even with some of its dlcs the metro sections give metro 2033 vibes and the game can be fun fo3 has in fact decent or even good level design but it is much less open compared to new vegas some places are sectioned off and connected with tunnels fo3 gives emphasis to atmosphere highlighted in its dlcs the pitt and point lookout so far so good but how does it compare to new vegas fallout new vegas can and will be less flashy at times but it is a game which takes itself seriously and wants you to believe what you see the settlements in new vegas feel like they could be and have an economy food production believable water and electricity supply 200 years after the war the somewhat preserved mojave desert and las vegas are trying to build again and it makes sense gameplay while based on the same engine new vegas has a clear edge compared to fo3 crisp triggers weapon mods iron sights unique textures on unique weapons nicer equipment better traders better and more useful perks and traits no bobblehead crap replaced by acquirable at any time implants etc if you have played new vegas you will need a few mods to go back to fo3 dlcs this section emphasizes the differences between developers fallout 3 bethesda relies on quantity rather than quality the 5 dlcs of fo3 are on average mediocre but some are better than the base game my favorite is the pitt due to its incredible atmosphere and art style however it is very short and this is a common trait between 3 out of 5 dlcs the pitt operation anchorage aka fallout 4 beta aka less rpg more shooting and mothership zeta are short point lookout is a bit better overall but i didn t enjoy it that much however your mileage may vary another common trait of the dlcs is that just like the base game they lack depth new vegas obsidian has 4 dlcs and oh boy the worst one is honest hearts which is short and simple but has some good action and interesting unique items best enjoyed with minimal starting equipment or low level character the rest are very good to excellent in my opinion firstly all the dlcs are connected story wise and have depth and a reason to exist for the plot they are not alien to the world of fallout like mothership zeta is they are intense and have a moral to their story old world blues is more light hearted with lots of interesting places to explore additions to crafting new interesting items and a simple story supported by interesting but mostly funny characters dead money a difficult and unforgiving place with an immersive story and characters and lots of suspense it could be considered a horror story lastly the lonesome road features more nukes than in the rest of the fallout universe combined it features an intricate story about the courier s past and a powerful antagonist the choice you make in the end of this dlc can change north america overall new vegas has significantly better dlcs mods there s not much to say here fallout new vegas has better and more mods on nexus compared to fallout 3 conclusion while i like fo3 new vegas is the better game which you will want to replay many times the comparison of these two games does not only show the merits of each game but also how the two developers think fallout 4 is an evolution of fallout 3 not new vegas fallout 3 and especially 4 are more sandbox and want to appeal to a broader audience new vegas on the other hand was made by obsidian the original creators of the fallout franchise who treat their game as it is intended for a mature audience only for this reason the game is made to be more believable less flashy at times but more realistic overall not that it doesn t have its funky stuff dialogues use more mature language there s also sex drugs alcohol prostitution rape slavery violence and are all depicted in a way that feels coherent with the situation in the mojave this gives tribute to the phrase war war never changes
