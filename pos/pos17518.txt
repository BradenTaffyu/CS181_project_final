2016 steam reviews are the youtube comments of reviews it is a cesspool of negativity just like yelp or any other public review forum straight off the bat i can tell you this is far and away a total war game that really drew me back into the fold with rts each faction plays in a completely different fashion from the other game mechanics are on point magic offers unique strands of strategy monsters and flying units just absolutely re haul the game this negative press is mainly because of dlc which is upsetting most people have enjoyed the game and are using this recommendation system as a method in which to protest call of the beastmen easily offered me 20 hours of gameplay don t listen to the steam reviews if you want to know if you ll enjoy a game go to youtube and gameplay videos of total war warhammer a few minutes of gameplay footage is more likely to help you determine whether or not a game will be up to your preferences than steam reviews
