2023 i m not a magic player but i m absolutely hooked on this game pros excellent strategy scenarios creative deck building an array of battling modes including timeless with every card no more pay2win and nearly an endless supply of options of cards spanning for decades and probably many more to come artwork is absolutely phenomenal and the mechanics function smoothly cons lacks a community factor no chat or real way to engage with the other player making it feel a bit impersonal yet there s a friends tab no statistics tab or match history or real way to track data bonus the whole digital card collecting angle feels like a hollow gimmick money grab but after the release of timeless mode it leveled the issues of actual card collecting newbies getting squashed by long time collectors whale sized wallets i actually am enjoying the card collecting process its progressive enough to keep interest i will never spend a dime on this game but will continue wreaking absolute havoc with my phyrexian spawn unleashed
