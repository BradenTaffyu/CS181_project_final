this is a great srpg game most reviews compare it to x com but i think the similarities are limited to the cover system and the ui other than that the game is much more similar to srpgs like fire emblem and final fantasy tactics with its melee combat and skill magic system what makes this game stand out is its mastery system think of the class and skill system in final fantasy tactics but more complex the game is very long if you play it on hard mode and try to complete everything so be prepared overall i m very pleased with it and am looking forward to the developer s next game edit the developer is awesome he comments on all the steam reviews i m pretty sure he will comment on mine too
