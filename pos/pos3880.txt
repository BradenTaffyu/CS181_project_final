2020 i usually don t write steam reviews but this game was a really pleasant surprise and i think it deserves more exposure and positive word of mouth troubleshooter is a turn based tactics game where you play as a team of government approved vigilantes called troubleshooters in a futuristic mega city plagued by crime constant gang violence and terrorism and help the police clean the place up it s an indie game made by a small korean team so it s quite janky the translation is rough and the presentation is lacking but the gameplay and mechanics are rock solid here s why i think you should give it a try if you have any interest in turn based tactics games or rpgs 1 almost path of exile levels of character customization in troubleshooter you get a team of predefined story characters each with their own class and ability set but there are a lot of things you can do with each of them there are subclasses equipment with a lot of different stats and even equipment sets and most importantly the mastery system masteries are skills you learn from defeating enemies and completing various objectives there are a lot of them and they range from simple stat bonuses to stuff like life drain gaining buffs for killing enemies or the ability to counterattack in melee you can put almost any mastery on any character limited only by that character s available training capacity which increases with levels all of this combined allows you to specialize every character you have in several ways and each of those ways can have dozens of variations thanks to the mastery system you can easily spend hours just sitting with your character screen open and tweaking your party members builds 2 very good turn based combat at first glance it s very similar to the modern xcoms each character has 2 action points there s cover and flanking bonuses enemies travel in small groups that become activated when they see you but there s actually a lot more depth to it than that every unit has its own initiative and each action has its own time cost so some abilities will delay the user s next turn more than others and there are various ways to manipulate the turn order of enemies allies actions also cost stamina and when a unit is out of stamina they have to rest or find some other way to restore it through abilities or masteries there are terrain and weather effects and skills that are influenced by them there are elemental effect interactions lightning does more damage to units standing in water knocking someone back into a wall results in a stun wind effects can disperse smoke and gas clouds etc there are many different status effects some of which can be combined into stronger status effects all of this gives you a lot more flexibility in combat than just cover flank shoot overwatch if you can t kill an enemy quickly you can delay their turns or drain them of stamina or stun them by knocking them into eachother or debuff them to near uselessness the game also does detection mechanics much better than xcom2 instead of all the enemies on the map immediately becoming alerted when combat starts here every squad has its own alertness status and when you engage the enemy only the squad you engaged will know about your position but the enemies can contact other squads on the map and alert them or scream when they are attacked which will alert surrounding units that are not in combat this means that if you are able to quickly kill a squad of enemies you can keep sneaking around the map undetected 3 ridiculous amount of content for the asking price the game has over 600 different masteries to learn over 200 enemy types visually a lot of them are recolors reskins of each other but they always come with different abilities and masteries which makes them interesting to fight lots of missions side missions and side quests the missions are nicely varied even though most of the time you will be killing stuff there are a lot of different objectives like escorting npcs rescuing hostages preventing enemies from escaping assaulting defending points on the map and etc sometimes you get to play as one of the criminal gangs and fight against another gang or fight your own party members as part of a training exercise the variety of missions and enemies and the fact that you constantly keep learning new masteries unlocking new subclasses and abilities kept this game from becoming boring and that s a hard thing to do in a game this long even if you completely ignore all the side content the main story campaign will take you close to 50 hours to finish some things i didn t like or think could be improved 1 you cannot recruit create custom characters and even though there s a lot of customization for the characters you do get you cannot create and field your own team comps 2 the game takes a while to truly open up for the first several missions you only get two characters and some generic police units and because you unlock everything gradually there isn t much room to experiment with builds and masteries i think the game really gets going once you get your 4th party member but it will take you some time to get there so some patience is required 3 i think the game could use a little more challenge there are no consequences for failing missions and the missions themselves are not that difficult if you re the type of person who can easily finish xcom on ironman legendary i recommend setting the game to the highest difficulty as soon as it becomes available you can change it at any time it won t be super difficult but some missions especially optional ones will provide a decent challenge with that being said as someone who s been a fan of turn based strategy tactics and role playing games for many years i highly recommend this game
