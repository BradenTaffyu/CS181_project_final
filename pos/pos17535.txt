2016 after playing around 120 turns of an empire campaign and the first 30 of a greenskins cmapaign i ve decided to write this review performance wise the game runs well on medium graphics with some on high and ultra unit size on my nvidia gtx 670 and 8gb of ram the game looks smooth and has more shogun ii esque graphics than attila and rome ii the ui is asthetically pleasing and very intuitive and is very customisable going from quite bare bones to very informative allowing you to change it up in battle as always the total war wiki is there for further information the campaign map and it s ui is also intuitive full of options and necessary information and again asthetically pleasing moving on to gameplay the fantasy setting brings a new breath of life increasing replayability and bringing new exciting battle mechanics although there are a lack of races to play as 4 5 each faction is very different to play as in this case less is more the battles themselves are fast paced full of actions and awe inspiring set pieces there is a lot going on in the battlefield which changes the game up and forces you to bring new tactics to the table the campaign itself is very fun and 120 odd turns in is still very exciting and thrilling the arrival of chaos changes everything where enemies forget their differences and band together to fight the insueing tide of evil the arrival of chaos does not mean a boring survive as long as you can but instead brings an exciting new chapter of stemming the stream of the end times overall the game handles the fantasy setting very well magic is fun and not at all op is feared pre release and the game is better optimized than rome ii and attila even for nvidia systems total war warhammer is a match made in heaven and brings a new lease of life to both franchises this game is a definate for fans of warhammer total war strategy and fantasy
