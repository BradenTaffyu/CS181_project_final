2018 early access review after reading some of the reviews of the game i decided to give it a shot this game can be crazy addicting you can and probably will lose all track of time there is quite a learning curve and the tutorial only covers a small part of it you ll be proud of yourself when you figure out how to go from hunting to not only making your own food but to store it in a temperature controlled room so that it doesn t spoil but then you ll realize your pet dog is going in and eating it then you ll be proud of yourself when you figure out how to set up the dog s zone so he doesn t go into your freezer only to realize that you haven t set up any defenses for when raiders come in and oh hey can i take a hostage and force him to work for me it s a lot of fun and totally worth the price
