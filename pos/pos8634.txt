2021 one of the greatest walking simulators ever if not ever sometimes i even manage to kill an animal but mostly a miss and go about my walk honestly this game is strangely addictive and there s a real sense of accomplishment when you manage to get a kill there is a learning curve rather its steep for me as i ve never been hunting in real life or if that s the game i honestly cannot tell you note i bought the game and every piece of dlc i own on discount
