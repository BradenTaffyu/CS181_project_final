2023 this game comes at a time when respect for ca the developers of the total war franchise is at an all time low that is due to some unpopular executive decisions like the pricing of the most recent tw warhammer 3 dlc and the cancellation of some unpopular but money sucking projects like hyenas followed by lay offs in the employee department another unpopular decision for many long time fans was the development of tw pharaoh a game allegedly no one wanted made by the studio that had previously developed tw troy another unpopular game because of this the doom saying hate ill will and bias against this game was huge ever since the announcement of the title before even a screenshot was available with this in mind after spending a fair amount of time with the game in early access i want to address the main points of contention 1 the main complaint seems to be we wanted another historical total war game from ca but not this historical total war this is not valid critique it s infantile whining and it s the main reason for the hate towards the game and for the very predictable incoming review bombings judging a product for what it isn t instead of judging it for what it is doesn t seem fair to me if it s not the time period you would have liked it s ok wait for the next one but don t act entitled and don t nitpick at this game because of expectations that have nothing to do with the product itself 2 the map is too small the number of settlements which is the real measure of a map s length is at launch bigger or on par with every other non saga tw in the past certainly bigger than all time favourite shogun 2 3 there are not enough bronze age cultures no greece or mesopotamia it s called total war pharaoh for a reason besides it went for historical accuracy as many fans asked for having pursued that the time frame for the game gets quite narrow allowing for fewer contemporary cultures historical personalities to interact the devs seemed to be well aware of that so they compensated with lots of settlements gimmicks and game mechanics 4 too few factions campaigns not enough diversity it has 8 campaigns at launch same as most other tw games moreover it s filled with campaign mechanics that can theoretically make two playthroughs with the same faction more different than any two factions in previous historical tw games 5 it s the most pricey tw to date it offers less for more no it doesn t it is more expensive than previous tw games but the price point for games in general has increased during the last years not saying i agree with the practice just putting it into context as for content it doesn t offer less it just focuses on building tall rather than wide we get 5 resources instead of one which makes gameplay more strategic challenging and ultimately fulfilling there are outposts and regional units there are game changing campaign mechanics more than ever like ancestral legacies religion court intrigue faction commandments these make tw pharaoh the first tw game that manages to keep players enganged in the later stages of the game addressing an issue many had with older tws 6 we want family trees like in past total war games not immortal legendary lords yes because it was very fun not being able to fully develop a character throughout a campaign because of them dying of natural causes having to restart speccing your main lord 2 or more times during the same campaign and most times not being able to reach skills further down the line before starting from scratch with another char 7 battles are boring and samey not enough unit diversity a somewhat valid critique but a predictable and normal thing given the time period i for one do miss artillery but again seems to me the devs were well aware of that so they tried to work around it by making battles fun and diverse using other tools weather unit stances access to regional units which is one of my favorite aspects as it adds extra incentive to exploring various regions of the map and lots of battle bonuses through campaign mechanics lord leveling outpost interaction etc to all that i would point out something that everyone agrees on at least the game looks and sounds amazing both visuals and soundtrack are best to date in the series tl dr once you leave aside expectations for what you wanted ca to make instead of this game and the associated biases and judge the game for what it is you will find that tw pharaoh is the most complex innovative challenging and also prettiest tw to date subjectively it might not be up your alley and that s fine but i think the points made above are nevertheless undisputable all of them having to do with objective misconceptions about the game
