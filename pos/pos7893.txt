2022 early access review honestly one of the most fun car games i ve ever played once the novelty of smashing your car into ridiculous things or doing silly jumps i ve settled into just loving to drive realistic cars that take real damage from hitting something as simple as a curb the wrong way the motion blur added a really nice touch to the driving feel of the game making it feel more real without have an arcade type feel the only thing i wish it had more of was developer chase evade scenarios and race ai scenarios there s great race tracks built into the base game it s a shame you can t have that built right into the game to add ai cars to a track and do races this would make this top the charts in my book and the chase scenarios are just darned fun i find the mod community ones are often broken even some of the developer ones break easily when the runaway car crashes into things too easily on its own and just don t have that polish that s my only gripe and because this game is always in development i m sure something will come down the road overall my favourite car game of all time
