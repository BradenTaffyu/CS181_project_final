2018 slay the spire is one of those gems you rarely encounter a combination of deck building from games like dominion star realms ascension etc and the rogue like progression of ftl tied together perfectly to create this addictive and challenging experience the game is more polished and actively developed than any other early access i ve laid my hands on hell even many officially released games there is a weekly patch in the stable game and an almost daily patch on the beta branch adding new content improving and balancing the game from my personal experience everything i have reported has been fixed changed in the next patch the developers are active and communicative and the game deserves every dime edit even after release content is coming
