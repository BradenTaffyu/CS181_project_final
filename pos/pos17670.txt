2016 i personally have enjoyed this game very much battles are fun maps feel varied for field battles and the game overall runs great overall i love this game sadly though it does have a couple glaring drawbacks campaign map is severely limiting tons of attrition zones all over the map economy is super simple diplomacy can be a real pain in the rear don t bother confederating you end up with huge diplomatic and public order issues sieges are extremely stripped down from rome 2 not a bad thing in theory i always felt like the battles were far too spread out in the huge city sieges pathing needs work though siege towers tend to derp out at the last few feet from the walls my largest complaint though is the multiplayer campaign i love playing this with my friend and we want to rename our heroes which was a nice change of pace except that in multiplayer campaign you can t rename squat
