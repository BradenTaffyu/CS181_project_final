2018 although i doubt anything i say will really change anyone s minds given the buzz undertale s had for the past two years i felt i might as well put in my own two cents first off when i first booted up the game and realized what i d just bought was a 2d shooter with pixel graphics i was expecting the graphics to really annoy me surprisingly it didn t if anything it just added more to the atmosphere of the game i think that if it had been made as a fully animated 3d game it would have lost some of its charm and certainly the emotion a lot of undertale s charm is that it makes you think for yourself instead of telling you what to think the graphics help with that the next thing i thought mostly from watching playthroughs and then in the first few fights is that undertale would be easy although it s not horrifically difficult nonstop the bosses will give you trouble especially if you re a heartless individual who decides to try the genocide route the neutral route s boss will become slightly easier after a certain number of deaths but other than that the game is entirely skill based you have to win through your own merit and not because the game is giving you pity points there s a ton more that could be said about the characters the thematic elements the soundtrack general gameplay and other things but that would take way too much time probably the only thing i d want different is the amount and difficulty of the puzzles if i m going to die 30 times to some of the bosses i think it s only fair the puzzles give me more than thirty second s pause tl dr i definitely recommend this game although it s much better going into it blind i think it s still worth a go even after watching playthroughs of it there s something to be said for doing it yourself
