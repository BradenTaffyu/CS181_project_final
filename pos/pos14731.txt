2016 first of kudos to the ai in terms of warfare really done well and caught me off guard a few time ssecond let me ask you help me i havent been doing anything else the past day exept sleeping talking a shower and eating drinkingthird off no i m not a troll nor is my play time fakethis game really did what civ 5 had to be in my opinion it has a few flaws yes but here are the good and bad things in my opinion ai you can see especially in terms of warfare the ai and especially the barbarians are a pest who can ruin your early game if you dont plan well in my experience its very common that a civ beats the dust at the classical era graphics day and night cycle really adds a bit of graphical detail game overal looks beautiful reseach and civics seperated add so much more inversity to the game ghandi is back and we discover his true nature not gonna spoil that early mid game there is just so much to do at the start exploring is fun thanks to the addition of continent s new resources the music this is probably the thing i love more than anything in the game before i played seriously i was hypnotised by the intro and the menu song also each era the music get s a bit more advanced faction introductions there is so much more the introductions are more fitting to each leader cutscene s building a wonder launching a rocket again praise to graphical detailsthe bad diplomacy feels empty i dont feel i can make a declaration of friendship with anyone or take a trade heck they wont even accept my delegations that being said if i am not being demounced by said leader for not bringing my religion to kongo or builded a wonder before china it restricts the game really late game it just feels dull there is almost nothing to do exept facing demouncing threads from civ s who at prince assault you with spearman good luck against that machine gun man only to after the said deed declare peace when i destroyed a 1 3 situation to only have it return 10 turns later there is no world congress and diplomatic victory is no more i really hope there will be a dlc expansion something for that barbarians spawning rate i know this is civ vi barbarians ar part of the game but when i want to learn a game as how it should be learned i wish you could adjust the spawn rate for barbarians ive seen barbarian camps spawn 1 spearman every turn right next to my freaking lv 5 city kudos to those who can play this on emperor or deityoveral i still love the game wich for me stood the test of timegameplay 8graphics 9music sound 10ai 7 5overal 8
