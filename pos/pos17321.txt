2021 rarely ever have i found a game to be this beautiful and exciting over the last few years ori and the will of the wisps becomes one of my favorite games of all time not only because of the stunning and art like graphic but also the phenomenal soundtrack the studio did a great job in capturing the mood of each individual environments using a variety of color combinations which is eye pleasing of course but i have a difficult time at the start trying to distinguish ori and the surrounding enemies because they all glow quite similar for gameplay mechanics it is an overall improvement compares to blind forest with additional skill tree and shard spirits which are quite fun looking for after finishing the story although i completed all the achievements i still comeback to this game daily re playing some parts or taking screenshots of the world this game is a must have for any artists who are struggling in designing the environment of their own world it looks visually appealing and one of many top inspirations that i can look at all in all can t wait another 5 years for another masterpiece coming from moon studio
