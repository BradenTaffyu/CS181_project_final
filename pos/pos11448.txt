2019 early access review well this game man there is a lot to say about it however i ll keep it short before you go why did he recommend this game if it has more cons than pros just continue reading pros great fun if you have friends to play with if you go back to alpha 15 16 it s just incredibly fun time waster in a good way you can do so many things such as building quests shoot zombies for the sake of it go hunting and treasure finding many ways to change the game settings more loot more exp etc cons 1 without playing with friends and co ordinating skill spending good luck trying to get most items before the day 7 and 14 hordes 2 so many ing bugs that they for some reason have decided not to fix 3 even with my pc that can run any other game at 120 fps i get a max of like 60 this drops to 30 when i shoot guns 4 as mentioned in point 1 the new skill system is so shameful and does not live up to previous versions you used to mine to get better at mining now you just have to level up 5 times and spend the skills and then boom 50k stone in 10 minutes so dumb i recommend this game if you have friends that are willing to play it with you if you don t have any friends to play with skip buying this
