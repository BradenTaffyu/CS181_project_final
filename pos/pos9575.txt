2021 review assetto corsa a simulator for everyone2014 played time 100 hours 8 10the racing simulator assetto corsa developed by kunos simulazioni allows to have an immersive driving and thus racing experience kunos provides a simulator with a rather large collection of tracks and cars including the dlcs so there is something for every taste of racing let it be formula cars gt cars or regular road cars with several different liveries for most of the cars we are also treated with some of the most legendary tracks such as the infamous green hell better known as the nordschleife silverstone with the well known corner section maggots becketts chapel or laguna seca with the corkscrew corner on some tracks such as barcelona or red bull ring provide different layouts to choose from first off the graphics are not the best but it is a simulator which is supposed to feel real which will be elaborated further down the car models do look very good and detailed however not every livery shows the same quality thus reducing overall visual quality of the car the tracks themselves have some very detailed textures take the nordschleife as an example on the other side the buildings the green areas around the track and trees do not look as if they were up to the graphical standard of 2014 the sounds in this simulator are rather good but not great in general the cars have a fitting sound to respective real model but while driving it is definitely noticeable that the sound is simulated although the simulated sound it is not off throwing while driving the regular race weekend is very customizable from duration over weather to time of day not every session is mandatory the ai in this simulator is no real challenge racecraft wise the only difference between harder and easier ai is the straight line speed multiplayer mode is one of the reasons to choose this simulator over others setting up a server is not difficult with the provided server manager the only obstacle is to find it somewhere in the game files steam steamapps common assettocorsa server acservermanager exe racing against other people or friends is very different and much more enjoyable than to racing against the provided ai this simulator also supports wheels and provides very detailed and realistic force feedback even increasing the immersion further the other reason to choose this simulator over others is the mod ability there is so much high quality content online to implement in the simulator whether it is cars or tracks and also to use online with others making the combination possibilities almost infinite however beware of bad quality content there are also graphic and sound mods to improve the personal experience in this simulator the community is huge making the experience better for everyone participating there are downsides to the base game without the mods for one there is no rain option which needs to be implemented via mods if wished and some combinations of vehicles in online servers with ferrari cars are restricted limiting the customizability of races this game is recommended to every user with a wheel for its infinite modification possibilities and online experience however other users need to be sure they can handle the amount of realism on their input device
