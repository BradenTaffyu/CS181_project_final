2014 early access review don t starve together has been an amazing experience but that is because i played the original game and have a good understanding of the basics and intermediate gameplay for the uninitiated it can be a long dark perilous road to making it past the first winter i however highly recommend buying this game and the single player version with no in game tutorial and no real tooltips you find yourself googling and asking other players for advice on how to deal with daily life everything kills you especially your friends the pace of the game may feel slow but soon the amount of resources to gather and refine become immense and turn this game into a fast pace race to gather the gear to survive the winter in closing this game has an unforgiving learning curve which is only magnified by the masses of new players who have never tried the single player experience prepare to fail many times through your own mistakes and those of others have fun and don t burn the berry bushes don t starve together is a must buy from klei entertainment 12 29 2014 94 hrs vice
