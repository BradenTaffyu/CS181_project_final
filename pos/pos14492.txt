2021 this review is for all my friends coming from civilization v and wondering if you re going to get the same experience i will say i do genuinely enjoy this game however civ v is still and will always be the better game no matter how many dlc s they release here is a run through on some similarities and differences city building probably the biggest difference is the way a city and civilization expands in civ v you could simply build whatever structure your city needed granting the appropriate yield to science happiness gold production etc in civ vi you are in a way limited on what you can build in any one city virtually all boosts to research culture happiness production are found through building districts districts are only made available at certain population targets throughout your cities maturation in addition these districts must be built on an appropriate tile therefor if you don t have the required space to build you are unfortunately unable to multiple new factors also effect your city such as housing and amenity s without them your city doesn t function at an optimal level and each can be increase based on different base city center structures and district structures research and technology tree this process is virtually the same which is refreshing nothing new to learn ai interaction this is mostly the same however they ve replaced the embassy with trade delegations as foot in the door technique with other civilizations this may also just be my experience but it does also seem that ai leaders sour towards you rather quickly compared to civ v cultural policies this is disappointing they ve completely removed the cultural policies tree from the game and replaced it with a system in which you choose individual card boosts from specific categories military economic diplomatic and wildcard now this system can be equally as formidable but it definitely isn t the same as your civilization grows and you learn new forms of government additional slots will open based on the path you choose for example the monarchy government gives you 2 military card slots 1 economic card slot 1 diplomatic card slot and 2 wildcard slots religion again this is pretty much unchanged similarly to the research and tech tree nice not having to learn a ton of new features city states this is an entirely new system that plays off of the type of government you have in place each government type grants envoy points and as you get into higher tiers the more that are granted city states are mostly used as boosts to your own civilization as you send envoy s to each you will be given a certain status with each city state as your status increases so does the benefit boost to production religion culture etc to reach the maximum influence level with a city state it generally takes 6 envoys at which point you are declared the suzerain of that city state however if another civilization has 6 or more envoys there you will have to continue to send envoys until you have more within the city state to achieve the title of suzerain one additional benefit in becoming the suzerain of a city state is the ability to levy their army for a listed figure usually 400 500 gold can help if you re in a pinch world congress sadly this no longer exists they attempted to bring it back in their recent dlc s but it truly is a sad attempt at what was in my opinion a truly great feature gone are the worlds fairs as we once knew nuclear proliferation embargos etc this also plays into the difference in city states as you no longer ally them to gain standing at the world congress these are some of the main similarities and differences i ve discerned in my time playing both versions of this wonderful game i would say if you enjoy civ v then civ vi is definitely worth your time the game runs much smoother and appears much cleaner then the previous version this however i would recommend you catch on sale as it in my opinion is not worthy of the full price cost
