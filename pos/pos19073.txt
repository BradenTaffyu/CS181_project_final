2019 i ll keep this short if you want to play an excellent role playing game where you can create a truly unique character and feel like your decisions have real consequences where every decision counts and you are constantly being presented with those decisions where factions tribes and groups have a real impact and significantly affect the world play fallout new vegasif you want to play an excellent looter shooter with finely honed and extensive crafting systems that allow you to have full control over your customisation where you don t have to rely on vats for shooting and weapons feel satisfying to fire swing where power armour is true to its name and really is powerful but also realistic play fallout 4these are two very different games and which one you should play is down to what you want to experience fallout new vegas is one of the best rpgs ever made but has terrible shooting mechanics and its looting systems are lacklustre fallout 4 has excellent mechanics and has one of the best looting and crafting systems in the rpg genre but its storytelling is rather linear and your choices are limited and often quite inconsequential that s my two penny s worth
