2018 product received for free i have finally beaten the game on all three characters and while there is further things to do in the game like higher difficulty and such that s enough hours put into the game to write a bit of review about it this game is absurdly fun i never really expected much from a card game other than endless grinding or pay to win mechanics to achieve the state where it will be easy to beat it but this game doesn t have those normal card elements at all you just need knowledge skills and a bit of luck and you re good to go i highly recommend it to any fan of card games and anyone that likes a bit of casual fun you can save and quit whenever you want making it great for those that needs to turn off the game for any reason at any time p s this game needs a versus mode so i can go slay my friends too p
