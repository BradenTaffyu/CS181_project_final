2018 stardew valley is a towering achievement not in so much that it s a really fun game spoiler it is but that it was made by just one person and not only it that it was made by one person but that every single aspect of the game was so expertly crafted the game looks and sounds beautiful and from what i understand eric barone crafted both the art and the music himself by itself that s impressive then you consider that he programmed the entire game balanced everything wrote the characters and dialogue and filled out this world head to toe with fun satisfying and interesting activities if you have any interest in games as a medium beyond just playing and enjoying them barone s story is mindboggling there are numerous small examples of barone s craft that make themselves known beyond what normal games of this type display for example the way people will allow you to pass them with a small shake if you press into them enough or the sound effects that play when navigating the menus these might seem trivial but they re indicative of the quality of experience here there is so much polish and character to every aspect of this game and all of it adds up to make stardew valley a masterful experience another example of this depth of quality are the character interactions i m a sucker for good character writing in stardew each character that populates the town is expertly written with deep character backstories that surprised me even the characters i initially disliked proved to have more going on underneath the surface i went into stardew expecting a pretty straightforward indie farm management experience and i got so much more each pursuit is gratifying as well i initially hated fishing but soon grew to enjoy it once i gained basic acumen mine diving and battling monsters provided a satisfying progression as well and of course farming and building your home and land up from being overgrown to being a palace is not only incredibly satisfying but works exceptionally for what you d expect i put down fallout 4 because its settlement system was so awful stardew valley s although it admittedly has much less going on is an absolute dream by comparison and tying this altogether is the community center system which requires you to plug in specific types of loot for various rewards it s what finally got me addicted to stardew staying up way too late trying to catch that elusive catfish or reading the wiki while at work so i could find out how to get specific artisan goods if what you ve seen of stardew valley has interested you in even the least you should probably just give it a shot i thought i knew what it was but it proved far deeper and more polished than i ever expected a game made by one person could be and if you liked its spiritual ancestor harvest moon then you owe it to yourself to play this game it s a phenomenal example of the power of a singular vision when creating art and another example of the flourishing indie scene that s developed in gaming over the past decade or so
