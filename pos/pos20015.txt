2014 new vegas is a faithful sequel to fallout 2 new reno much like its predecessor the game features a desert gangsters casinos guns surprisingly good role playing the game takes place in the mojave wasteland a pretty much lifeless huge and twice as many locations as f03 it s a bleak world without much hope and the choice is between bad and worse new vegas does have a few technical issues overall the game is best played not as a sandbox but as a more traditional rpg where you explore the main quest which depending on your choices will send you to a variety of locations new vegas is a huge game i can probably write another 6 pages examining new vegas s various aspects but i d rather play more this game is only improved upon with the insanely talented modding community with some quest mods even better than the ones obsidian has written themselves dont forget all the armour weapons the re texture s and mods that increase the difficulty of the mojave without a doubt a must own even without mods and any dlc its just so great it would be a crime to not pick this up worth any amount of money
