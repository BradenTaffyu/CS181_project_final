2017 the twin tailed comet is often seen as an omen but this time it s wake has disturbed the winds of magic just as suggested above total war warhammer ii has an active and engaging story this time around or well as close to a story as you could get playing a total war game of course that s just one of the many improvements and new features this triumphant return to form brings to the table in this sequel to the lovingly crafted total war warhammer it s even more evident this time around that the team at creative assembly are not only masterful at bringing the warhammer universe to life but are also highly accurate clearly demonstrating a great amount of attention to detail towards the 34 year old universe and lore they ve chosen to adapt if you thought the first warhammer total war game was proof enough that the total war formula adapts and mergers perfectly with the warhammer fantasy world then prepare to have that conclusion reinforced as tw warhammer ii s new features and new narrative focus work wonderfully together creating several new factions that once again just like its predecessor differ vastly from each other in both management and play style perhaps even more so then the first games various factions from the machiavellian minded skaven to the high elven asur of ulthuan each faction feels uniquely different and fantastic to play for example given that the skaven literally breed like rats they ve a food meter you can gain food by winning battles and such and having an abundance providers buffs naturally the food degenerates over time as do the regions that the skaven inhabit as they spread pestilence and corruption wherever they own much like chaos corruption being spread in the first game except the skaven have increasingly negative public order as their own corruption spreads adding another level of difficulty to the sub terrain race but wait there s more naturally the second part of this trilogy adds a new part of the old world s map to the mix proving to be even more exciting and interesting than the first one with their not only being two continents the new world and parts of the old world such as the southlands but other features like storms causing attrition at sea given the vast amount of ocean that covers the distance between the landmasses but also rewards lurking atop ocean such as treasure islands that can provide items and buffs and sometimes debuffs depending on which choice you pick in certain events it turns out that in just a few days october 26th i believe the map will be expanded more with the free update mortal empires it not only adds a domination victory to the game although one exists in the base game alongside the vortex victory but also the rest of the map from the first game and naturally the factions and to make all this even better they plan on releasing the blood dlc on the same game naturally free to owners of the blood dlc for the first game the only down side of said ocean being that once again naval battles can only be auto resolved which is something i dearly hope they change in total war warhammer 3 when it comes out conclusion total war warhammer ii is not only a smashing sequel that manages to improve and vastly differ itself from its predecessor but also provides a unique narrative element with cutscenes and all to the total war formula and just generally stands as a solid game without the help of the first one not to mention it was rather lovely to actually have a game based within the warhammer universe this year that wasn t an utter disappointment overall i give the game a solid recommend for not only veteran fans of the total war series but life long fans of the warhammer fantasy universe as well smashing job once again creative assembly sigmar would be proud when i say utter disappointment i m referencing my review of dawn of war 3 which can be found here
