2019 hello if you ve read my serious reviews in the past you know that i have a general format with it but now i am updating it and will be updating my other serious reviews to use the new format this new format will have different categories weighed differently depending on what type of game it isgameplay 9 75 10 5 48 75pts 50ptseven in the base game with no mods or dlc hearts of iron iv is packed with content and things to do you could try playing as the soviet union annex poland and germany and then have a civil war after which is what happened the first time i played or as germany trying to win ww2 or maybe as mexico joining the axis and taking some of the us s land while they are distracted there are truly so many things to do in hearts of iron iv and that s not even talking about dlcs or mods which can add all different types of gameplay experiences this game is a grand strategy sandbox where the world is literally your oyster that being said some people may find hearts of iron iv a hard game and there certainly is a lot of micromanagement in the game so if you don t like those types of game hearts of iron iv is not the game for you story n a 3 0pts 0ptsstory in hearts of iron iv is not existent the story of hearts of iron iv is what you make the story of it be or whatever the story of the various mods make it be what there is of story is basic summaries of events graphics 7 10 1 7pts 10ptshearts of iron iv has ok graphics portraits of world leaders and icons are well designed including the map but it s nothing mind blowing or innovative even for a game released in 2016 this isn t doom 2016 which in my opinion had some of the best graphics i ve ever seen a game have mechanics 8 10 2 16pts 20ptsas i said before hearts of iron iv is a fairly complex game with many things going into it and isn t for everybody i m just going to leave it at that since going through all of the mechanics in the game would take me quite a while value 8 37 10 3 25 11 30ptsi m kinda mixed on this one hearts of iron iv is 43 99 cad on the steam store that s expensive for a game released in 2016 however fairly cheap as you now get some pre bundled dlc with the game this isn t something everybody would want and i m sure there are people would like a cheaper option that just has hearts of iron iv and no dlc that being said i would personally say that 43 99 is worth it considering the dlc you get but not everyone would say the same you also have to consider steam sales which make the game have an even better value overall 8 8 10 96 86pts 110pts overall hearts of iron iv has to be one of my favrouite games despite me only having 30 hours in it as of writing this review the number of things you can do in hearts of iron iv and the realistic tone of it makes it truly one of the best games i ve ever played
