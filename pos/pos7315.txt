2016 for what it s worth i have a much better respect to the truckers on the road these days after having experienced how challenging it could be as a truck driver thanks to this simulator every time i play american truck simulator i am reminded that life is indeed a journey drive to my trailer get the goods turn up the in game radio free as a bird check my gps and plan my trip cross the states through day and night cycle and finally making a delivery at the destination only to find myself wanting to pick up another external contract again on top of that i get to manage my own trucking company get a new paintjob for my favorite truck every now and then this game is amazing highly recommended
