2020 at this point i ve got exactly 76 hours in fallout 76 so i feel like i scratched the surface a bit and can make an attempt at not a review but an experience with one of the most controversial games i played fallout 76 is massive overwhelming even it has a huge and incredibly detailed handcrafted world to explore quests to follow mysteries to unravel enemies to fight loot to pick up crafting to learn character to develop junk to always be overencumbered camp to plan and build and it manages to always offer something new around the next corner hey what s this nice looking bat whoops i m outta here the scale sets the flow and as a result fallout 76 is a slow paced game it takes dozens of hours to get into its systems and probably months and even years to hunt down every bit of content it has it cannot be finished in 20 30 hours it s a world to live in not a one time story to experience and move on and herein lies the problem but it s not the problem of the game itself it s a problem of how the review process and gamers habits have changed everything is about speed nowadays reviewers need to be speedy to get their youtube view counts gamers need a hook that catches them first minute in and drags them throughout the whole game non stop refund timer is 2 hours this is why we get so many games that offer flashy speedy action packed 3 4 hours of gameplay and then just die not everyone wants to risk releasing a slow paced game i m overencumbered refunded i m fighting the same stupid scorched refunded what is this perk system refunded and so on and so forth in two hours of play gamers are deciding on a game that has months and years worth of content and this is fundamentally wrong i made this mistake myself after tons of bad reviews memes and everything that s been said about fallout 76 i didn t even want to play it and when i started it i was sceptical and nitpicky i was vacuum cleaning everything without even looking at what i collect complaining about loot system and weight limits being stupid and mass scrapping everything at a next workbench i was irritated by the rate at which my character becomes hungry and thirsty i was not happy with level 1 perks selection and so on but then not without help from a friend i realized i d been playing it all wrong i wasn t taking the game for what it is i was trying to bend it to what i wanted it to be so i stopped i stopped spamming e and started to actually look around and i saw that all the junk is not just some junk it s an integral part of the world offices have desk fans workshops are full of wrenches and scotch tapes kitchens have knives and tin cans etc etc i stopped pressing scrap all junk and realized that even scrap components have a lot of sarcasm and world building to them and then i understood it why all those items exist they re not just resources they exist to make the world feel alive and real through your ability to touch and move and replace almost anything and the fact that they can also be scrapped is just a nice bonus through those 76 hours of playtime i ve encountered a lot of different enemies unique ones tough to fight and with special abilities i ve found new items and blueprints discovered several secrets and lore pieces did a lot of quests explored vastly different places unlocked interesting perks and realized there exist synergies and builds but most importantly i realized the actual scale of the game and accepted it a big town is a big town you won t be able to just sweep clean and move on no instead you ll be going there again and again discovering new parts inhabitants events and stories every time a wilderness is not just a space in between point a and point b in a quest it s a living world full of stories and surprises and you will always see something new even days after so now to me fallout 76 is a good game with its own unique traits that make it s p e c i a l and that s a good thing because too many games are becoming too generic these days the developers are afraid to have or not to have certain features because youtubers and steam reviews made after 2 hours of play can kill or at least hurt significantly any title but bethesda stays true to their concept of detailed worlds which is a brave thing worth commending ps fallout 76 is not without flaws kb m controls ui glitches there are a lot of things to work on but those problems are not exclusive to bethesda games and were blown out of proportion by the reviewers some of the newly introduced quests don t work well in coop mode and yes there are certain balance aspects that push the players towards buying repair kits but overall and especially compared to other releases it s nothing new and nothing horrendous it s just when the internet starts it s hate rampage it manages to dig out every little detail and make it look like the worst of all evils
