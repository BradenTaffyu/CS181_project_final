2021 as a former mechanic because i hated it playing this game reminds me of the satisfaction i used to get after a job well done then i go back to doing real mechanic stuff and i m reminded once again that i hate it this game is everything good about being a mechanic with the busted knuckles the loss of real money the amount of time it takes contorting your body to reach curtain places oil money shots to the face and the clenched sphincter when the car shifts on jack stands while your under it compared to being a real mechanic this game is heaven
