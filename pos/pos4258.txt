2013 this is the purest rpg sandbox game by that i mean you cannot have a more sandbox experience in an rpg there is no story and no real goals it is entirely player driven you can join any faction you can build up your army you can create a new faction and expand taking over the others you can do everything an npc can do and vice versa i keep coming back to this game every once in a while and get dragged into it you essentially rise from a single peasant to a warlord who conquered the whole world without having your hand held at any time other than the rpg sandbox mechanics the game as an amazing combat system which supports enormous medieval battles involving hundreds of characters the music is really good but after tens of hours it can get repetitive the graphics are pretty dated but if you can get over it it s most certainly worth it
