2018 early access review really fun and you have the ability to do all sorts of things from the ability to do a casual haul with a classy semi or do realistic head on crashes with small cars the one thing i really notice is that this is a really cpu and going intensive game here recently i rebought the game come to find out that it ran poorly about four months ago i upgraded my pc and at the time i was running an older version of the game at the time it ran flawlessly then but when i rebought the game hoo hush it ran like crap with the same graphics settings i had previously had therefore forcing me to turn the graphics to low once i did that the game ran smoothly just beware that i am running an overclocked amd athlon x4 745k with a gigabyte geforce gtx1050 and 8gb ddr3 so performance will definitely differ if you have a much more modern and faster system i recommend at least a six core cpu and a gtx1660 you don t have to spend 500 on a good system just to run this game other than the forced graphics change this is a must have game
