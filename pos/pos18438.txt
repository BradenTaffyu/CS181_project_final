td 5 in terms of content it has a lot but it doesn t quite have as much as bloons td 5 the developers ninja kiwi are still adding more content the style of tower defense that this game follows is the lanes with free place enemies follow a path and towers can be placed anywhere a graphical feature that the bloons series has been known for is its evolving graphics that change based upon the upgrades taken this has only further improved with the sequel monkey towers now obtain small parts on their three dimensional models such as a scarf or a headband on the first few levels once a third level upgrade is chose the monkey s graphics change quite drastically but they still retain the small parts from the other upgrade chain game breakdown gameplay mapsmaps are the levels of the tower defense genre each map has a unique path for balloons and later maps have other obstacles besides the path there are also obstacles that are placed around the track some can be removed by paying in game gold while others are permanent nuisances finally each map has different amounts of land and water some towers have to be built on water while others have to be built on land there is quite a large selection of maps to choose from and more are being added by the developers ninja kiwi maps are boring though without the towers placed on them towersthere are quite a variety of towers available to the player many fan favorite return while some don t and there are some new additions to the line up don t be discouraged if a favorite tower isn t in the game yet as ninja kiwi is still in the process of adding new towers into the game each tower has different attack patterns and upgrades the dart monkey the most basic tower simply throws a dart in a straight line a boomerang monkey throws a boomerang in a wide arc that is perfect for curved chokepoints on a map the tack shooter while not really a monkey is perfect for small corners as it dishes out damage in a small area of effect around it by combining the multi faceted talents of every talent a beautiful strategy can come together that allows a player to easily mow through the invading balloon armies to create a tower a player must spend gold to create it this gold varies based upon the tower and its power the cost and sometimes the power of towers is changed by ninja kiwi so that every tower has an important niche to fulfill in one of the strategies designed to beat a map base monkeys can be a bit boring which is why there are now a plentiful amount of upgrades to choose from upgradesbloons td 6 picks up from where its predecessor left off with the upgrade line idea instead of only having two upgrade lines each tower now has three these upgrades all vary wildly in utility power and cost sometimes a cheap upgrade may make the early game easy but if the player had waited for a little more gold then they would have been able to upgrade a monkey into its strongest upgrade line each tower can be upgraded on two lines one line may have two upgrades at most while the other line may have all five upgrades unlocked the game only allows one fifth upgrade line tower per game so most of the time people will format a tower upgrade line like 2 0 4 which means two points in the first line and four in the last line while ninja kiwi is actively balancing the game i hope they address some over powered upgrades that cost too little and some underpowered upgrades that cost too much in my opinion the glue monkey is useless without its glue soak ability this ability allows for its glue to cover every little balloon a big balloon spawns since this is a necessity upgrade it reduces the amount of glue monkey upgrade combos that can be useful an extremely useful type of monkey is the hero heroesmonkey heroes are a new mechanic added to the bloons series in bloons td 6 there are currently about seven monkey heroes to choose from each monkey has its own in game leveling system that powers them up as the match progresses to gain more levels monkey heroes must gain experience points experience points are gained by defeating balloons the different heroes vary in price abilities and meta viability some are more utility while others are powerhouses and others buff other towers heroes can be unlocked using the in game currency known as monkey money micro transactionsmicro transactions are the main issue i have with this game the game costs 10 which is a great price for it but the game then tries to get more money by locking progress behind grinding so that players pay to get it faster one of the prime examples is heroes which can be unlocked with in game currency or they can be unlocked with real cash a tower s upgrade lines can be earned through play or bought with cash the most egregious examples of microtransactions in this title has to be the double cash mode and the respect option double cash mode is a feature that is locked behind a payment and it was available in the previous game this microtransaction costs 18 usd which is nearly double what the game itself costs the respect option also costs about 2 per respect though it can at least be done using in game currency while the game does let a player eventually unlock every tech tree item this takes a while by putting the respect behind a paywall it limits the strategic options a player has for a particular map overall overall this is an amazing tower defense with awful micro transactions the price is great if one is willing to grind for the whole experience story there really isn t much of a story balloons are attacking monkeys for some reason and the monkeys must defend their homes from these air filled invaders sound the music is pleasant is follows the usual tower defense theme of relaxing music that gets the player into a concentrated mindset while the music is about average for tower defense the sounds for the heroes and towers are satisfying and represent their respective abilities and attacks well heroes all have their own voices and will become upset or annoyed by moabs or large blimps that contain a ton of smaller balloons when they appear while the popping sound can put one into a trance of popping happiness the sound can also become monotonous while multi tasking i personally greatly lowered the sound greatly so that i have audio feedback but it won t bother me if i m listening to something else graphics the bloons series has always been at the forefront of tower defense graphics the series previous use of two dimensional graphics were good but the limits of the graphical style with the move to three dimensional graphics bloons td 6 is now able to bring true upgrade evolution every upgrade adds a new graphical element to a tower this makes each tower look no only aesthetically pleasing but it also provides great visual feedback to the player i find it quite easy to distinguish towers with different upgrades because of how this graphic evolution looks
