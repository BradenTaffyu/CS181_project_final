2016 let s just take a moment here to say that this is the love sweat and tears of one dedicated man concernedape has made an incredible game ever since the first harvest moon i ve waited for a game that hm touched but dare i say it didn t get quite right stardew valley took the concept and ran with it there s nothing i can say in this review other than if you liked harvest moon farming sims and a bit of adventure then buy stardew valley it s 15 bucks and if you re not satisfied you can always get a refund there s literally nothing to lose other than hours just one more day
