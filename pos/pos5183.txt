2015 great game bad rpg it s dumbed down but not like skyrim was the gameplay is straight up better and most of the annoying things about the gameplay are gone the game has a of content a better atmosphere and lots of things to explore yes the story voice protagonist was a bad move but overall the quality of the game moved up it s a good milestone for future fallout games like the next obsidian fallout game and even a good milestone for the elder scrolls overall if you play fallout purely for the role playing aspect then fallout 4 might no appeal to you if you like solid gunplay setting up multiple bases a game with a great atmosphere that makes you want to explore all of it and fun then i d recommend it to you i m a huge fan of the fallout series and while i m sad the voiced protagonist t is a thing and the story is very bland the rest of the game is solid the sound and textures are way better than any other bethesda game it s really nice to hear gunfights in the distance and being able to determine the guns as well as who is fighting the texture quality is far above the gross skyrim textures and the wasteland actually feels like a wasteland this is the first game where i m actually scared of mole rats i d probably wait for a price drop if you feel like it being a questionable rpg is a determinant in your choice to buy the game if story never was your reason for liking fallout but mostly everything else then i d recommend buying it at full price tl dr9 10 for me it s an upgrade to the gameplay that was much needed but in doing so the story seemed to lack focus it sort of reminds me of bioshock 2 vs bioshock 1 they improved the gameplay at the cost of the atmosphere similar to how fallout 4 improved the gameplay at the cost of the writing
