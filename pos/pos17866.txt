2023 preface i only reviewed this based on the singleplayer portion of the game i do not know about nor care about multiplayer coh 3 is the first time in a very long time with this genre that i as a single player gamer have felt the focus was on me this game is receiving a truly irrational level of hate that reminds me of the backlash against company of heroes 2 when it was released the difference here is coh 2 deserved the level of hate it received if we compare launches coh 2 launched with two factions one of which was basically unplayable in multiplayer because it was so awful compared to the other faction coh 2 also launched with a singleplayer campaign that was quite possibly the worst rts singleplayer experience from a major developer up to that point coh 2 also did not launch with a map editor or mod support coh 3 meanwhile has launched with four factions all of which are more or less competitive it has launched with two singleplayer campaigns neither of which endlessly insult your intelligence and most importantly from my perspective a map and mod editor i have seen many complaints that coh 3 lacks polish and lacks content compared to coh 2 these complaints are true but also betray a stunning lack of perspective company of heroes 2 has been out for almost a decade and has been updated continuously during that time period if you could go back and play the launch version of coh 2 and compare it to the launch version of coh 3 3 is the far superior experience and value
