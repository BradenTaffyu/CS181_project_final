2014 fallout new vegas is one of my most favorite games ever it s just as amazing as fallout 3 but the game is a bit on the lighter side astmosphere wise instead of taking place on the east coast like fallout 3 this takes place on the west coast and gives the game that more cowboy southern feel to it i also find the story to be a tad more enjoyable just because it s so different and refreshing from fallout 3 i m normally not a fan of shooter games but fallout is amazing i suggest you give this game a try i m sure it will be one of your favorites in no time
