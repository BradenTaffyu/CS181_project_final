2020 if you are not chinese you probably have a hard time imagining what four masterpieces mean to us when i was a child i used to read romance of three kingdoms twice a year during holidays we were eager to experience that part of the history covered by the fog of war and politics via video games that was exactly the time when the art of war in ancient china has reached a whole new level during a very long time our only options are games developed by koei don t get me wrong their games are great well at least some of them are and you know what you changed this situation now if you ask a chinese player what is the best game based on the history of three kingdoms their answers are probably gonna switch to the total war series
