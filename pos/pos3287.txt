2021 just finished this game with my short attention span it s really rare to spend 91h on anything so they must have done something right i enjoyed most of my time playing the game and i recommend it but it surely has some flaws the dialogue was funny and well written the characters had interesting stories and a lot of personality which made you invested in solving their problems and storylines the voice acting was also great the visuals are pretty good the towns dungeons and castles are well designed and textured i m not really a fun of turn based systems fighting in rpgs to me has always been a necessary evil but this system was not bad it s intuitive enough to understand what you re doing but leaves a bit of for experimentation the maps are very big and exploring them feels very rewarding there s not much of dull time spent walking around there s always an intriguing chest or a quirky npc that s needs you to do something for them the freedom in this game is something i haven t really experienced in any other rpg you can solve quests in many ways and you can do almost anything you can think of steal kill trick flirt etc i really started to have fun when i decided embrace my thief character and started to sneak into everywhere i shouldn t be most times this was rewarded with loot information and some times even new quests so it didn t felt inconsequential other games would just give me a tag for dialogue of course this amount of freedom led to some bugs here and there but nothing too game breaking here are a few things that could be better spoiller alert the quest system is a bit confusing there s too much information and no way to filter it out there s too much googling needed i tried to avoid cheating as much as i could but i spent a lot of time looking at my phone the inventory is hard to manage and could have more filter options and marquee selection surfaces are an interesting mechanic but some of them clutter the screen water and ice are ok but fire and poison for example are way too much sometimes you can t even see your character the ending felt underwhelming and rushed the character stories where way more rewarding to finish than the main quest the cutscenes could be more epic they re just concept art with a tiny bit of animation lack of budget maybe and why is windego narrating this is more of an opinion but too much moral ambiguity in characters can make them all feel similar they turn into a grey canvas with some specific motivations tossed on top sometimes that s not enough to make you care no more sob stories with animals please i almost quit playing after the finding emmie thing and then you throw bear cubs pigs little chickens at me no one wants this trust me generally this is a very good game with a lot of potential but has a few small flaws that all together prevent it from being an amazing game 75 100
