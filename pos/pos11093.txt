had 120 hours on jwe1 on ps4 and this game improves on it in every regard even the little things like being able to release multiple dinosaurs of the same species in one hatchery bay instead of being constrained to one dino one bay adding marine and avian species is amazing too with more creatures being added with dlc the different style of buildings from the different eras allows you amazing levels of customisation only negatives are 1 the challenge modes are just tedious you don t have to get 5 stars under par time so it s just a pointless goal furthermore the gameplay loop is wait for money to tick up spend it wait for money to tick up spend wait for money spend repeat ad infinitum completely boring and stupid way to slow down the game mod menus are your friend here 2 the big dlcs are way too expensive compared to the amount of content they provide only buy them when they re 70 80 off creature packs are whichever floats your boat best imo is the prehistoric marine species pack if a game can improve on its predecessor to the point where the first is totally obsolete then it s an instant recommend
