2016 i played this game with my son now he wants to be an austronaunt 10 10seriously once upon a time if my son would have asked me dad how did people land on the moon i wouldn t know what to tell him but today when my son asked me that question awww yis i simply said i ll show you how and we fired up the game i was able with the help of ksp to show my son the beauty of trial and error the difficulty of space travel and just how vast and empty space is and how small we are i let him built it himself parachutes on a moon lander backwards engines and everything i remember his look of disbeleif and surprise as our first rocket exploded the look of awe as we made orbit his wide eyed gaze as we made our trajectory to the moon and he could actually see just how small earth is and how far we are from the moon i remember his enthusiasm as we were about to touch down on the moon and we deployed his parachutes which didn t work we crashed hard after the inital shock was over my son asked in surprise dad why don t parachutes work on the moon oh man thank you ksp thank you for making science fun
