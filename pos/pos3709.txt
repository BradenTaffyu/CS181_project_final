2022 and so here it is omori this might be personal but i don t think i have the words for what this game made me feel the culmination of it all made me feel some of the strongest feelings a piece of art offered to me and i ve been the witness to beautiful pieces if you ve been lucky enough to avoid spoilers on this game please go for it inspiring beautiful comforting horrifying absolutely soul shattering if you re already interested then go experience omori knowing as little as you do if you wish to know more omori is a colorful wacky heartwarming and deeply emotional turn based rpg of the psychological horror kind with a gameplay that s not too complex with multiple endings learn about the tragic story of sunny or any name you wish the boy to have and his close friends dive into the depths of his mind great visuals from adorable to uncanny i love the writing the characters their interactions and dialogues the soundtrack is amazing with great tracks that go from uplifting intense disturbing to breath takingly emotional my first save took between 25 30 hours to reach the end completion note and to give the game justice i had to go for all routes and all achievements i d recommend to only care about them on your second playthrough and so fourth some might require you to precisely know what you re doing from the beginning to the end and will ask you to venture into every corner of the game was fun nonetheless discovering the multiple endings and making sure i wasn t missing anything from this game omori will not succumb
