2017 early access review this recommendation comes on shaky ground because while i do admire the premise execution and ambition of this game there s still evidently much more to be done for this game before it can be considered fully playable and tolerable the idea itself is great and well done on its base level you re stuck with the chasis of a car and putting it all together from scratch excluding actually sticking your body through the chasis to screw in hidden bolts building the car feels ultra realistic and immersive there s no manual within the game itself but i felt no shame finding a guide because it really does feel like how building a car would be in real life finding what goes with what in what order and how to put it all together all the time i spent building the car felt rewarding especially when i finally got it started and moving then came the driving itself well actually that happened before all the building because you pretty much have to start the game with a drive to the store to grab oil brake fluid coolant a fan belt and all the food and drink you ll need to guarantee you won t have to go back for at least a week in game time you won t want to go back because the journey to the store is hell just like getting anywhere in the game is i m not knocking that it s actually pretty enjoyable to a point and the first burst of satisfaction from accomplishing something in the game something i remember feeling when i first started playing this game is just how fast the driving feels going just 40 km h already feels so fast which is something i can t say i ve felt in any other driving game that alone is a worthy point of praise but i ve tried driving on both a keyboard and a controller making the proper adjustments for both and neither seem to give me the proper amount of control i want maybe i have it set to turn too hard or it s just not correcting fast enough i don t know exactly but the options themselves primarily fast steering rate and non steering linearity are confusing enough to figure out just what they change if you want to get the most from this game you need a steering wheel plain and simple maybe that s an obvious point for any driving game but there s a notable difference here i feel the life simulation aspect is an extra layer of interesting detail forcing you to balance time spent building your car with caring for your basic needs but this also reaches its own breaking point being easily the most unfinished part of the game only being able to carry one thing at a time becomes frustrating but that s not as bad as literally being unable to sleep anywhere except your bed at home the developer has stated they plan on adding a feature allowing you to basically sleep anywhere which will be a much needed fix but as it stands the game has too many seemingly immersion breaking features in particular slow fatal crashes that break both the simulation aspect and especially the permadeath feature turning off the permadeath is maybe even more frustrating though as instead of reverting to your previous state it throws you back home and leaves your vehicle in the place you died it may seem i have more negative than positive to say for the game but this is after 40 hours of gametime full of some frustrating reset points but plenty of fun too i see a lot of potential in this game and where it is now it s a fun experiment worth the price tag and after some time i can see myself coming back to this game to put in hours more
