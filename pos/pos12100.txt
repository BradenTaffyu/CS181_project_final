2017 hands down the best racing sim out there in terms of modeling and physics with a great online community and a ranking system that for the most part helps hold people somewhat responsible for their actions at least enough that when you reach a higher level you ll have a good amount of clean racing tracks have great details such as giving you a solid feeling of elevation changes etc on certain tracks i haven t experienced in other sims and cars are well modeled with fantastic sounds and physics i recommend having a decent sim racing wheel pedal setup fanatec etc or higher to get the full experience the competition can be fierce making it addictive trying to improve lap times safety rating and get podium spots as others have mentioned you really need to look at how much disposable income you have when diving head first into this game as it can get very expensive not just in terms of buying nice sim racing gear which in it s own can be a huge money sink if you go down that rabbit hole there is a monthly fee which depending on if you find a discount code and how many months you wish to pay for in advance can be kinda high in addition to that you only get so many starting tracks and cars which if you do some reading you can advance in the game without buying a lot but who s kidding you ll want to try out more cars and tracks which adds up quickly as cars cost 11 95 each and tracks cost 14 95 each with slight discounts for buying more than 3 items of content at a time that said if you re someone who likes to drive cars in real life such as hpde track days autocross etc with a nice sim rig you can help keep your driving skills sharp in the off season as i feel this game is reasonably realistic enough to do this
