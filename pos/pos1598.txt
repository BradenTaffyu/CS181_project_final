2018 title nier automatathis review is largely subjective and is mostly based on personal opinion note this aggregate score averages each weighted applicable category on a scale of 0 to 100 where 50 is a neutral score higher scores are positive and lower scores are negative i typically grade each category in multiples of 5 aggregate score 90 3 scores by categoryweighted 4 00 price index 90 0 weighted 3 00 playtime replayability 80 0 weighted 3 00 story 95 0 weighted 2 00 visuals graphics 85 0 weighted 2 00 sounds music 100 0 weighted 1 00 hardware requirements 90 0 weighted 1 00 absence of bugs 100 0 personally it s one of my favorite titles of all time to be honest the story was difficult to understand at first but after a few playthroughs several reddit posts and some forum discussions i can safely conclude that this game has one of the most beautiful stories i ve ever experienced the gameplay is fluid and balanced the visuals are beautiful the animations are graceful and the music is simply fantastic a beautiful game that solidly engages the player both intellectually and emotionally worth even more than full price completely worth full price wait for a sale be prepared to refund this title no man s sky do not ever purchase this abomination to the gaming industry if you have the full 60 lying around i would probably recommend purchasing this title at full price but also try looking around for sub 60 deals on this title on a steam sale this title is well worth it update the game is no longer priced at 60 it is absolutely worth it at 40 right now especially with the latest official patch from square enix platinum games which fixes pretty much all of the pc issues that the game has had for the past 4 years highly replayable 250 hours long 100 250 hours average 50 100 hours short 10 50 hours minuscule 0 10 hours you ll probably get through the main story within 20ish hours the extras that the game has to offer will likely take more than 50 additional hours masterpiece memorable good average poor nonethis was just my personal opinion but at first the story was difficult to understand i ve never played a game with an existential theme before but the amount of feels that this game left me with will leave nier automata as one of the most memorable games i have ever played all of the main characters are highly memorable and the themes presented by this game engaged my critical thinking in a way that was inspirational and even enlightening a lot of people think that this is just another anime game but take it from someone who has barely seen any anime this game has a fantastic story tl dr them feels bruh masterpiece beautiful good average poor visual catastrophe ask m night shyamalan to make a movie of it masterpiece beethoven is smiling in his grave memorable good average poor do not put your ears through this terrorquite simply i m not sure if i ve ever heard a video game soundtrack more beautiful than this game s understand that i m a band geek audiophile and veteran musician so i ve been around plenty of gorgeous music in my life a masterpiece rating from me is exceptionally difficult to earn but keiichi okabe the musician behind the soundtrack has gracefully earned it a stone tablet should be able to run it minimum average high end quantum computing may not be enoughthe worst part about this game is the fact that square enix does not seem to care about the pc port the vanilla performance is pretty bad to be frank the far mod for this game turns the pc port into what it should be but we pcmasterrace folk are tired of being the second rate crowd this category drags the aggregate score down the most update it only took 4 years but square enix platinum games finally gave us the attention we deserved the base game with no mods is in a great working state and runs very well none to report some but still completely playable several annoying bugs unplayable fetus 0 kids 4 everyone 8 teenagers 13 adults 18 casual players pro players better make this your day job sweaty neckbeards galore requires some effort minuscule effort just look at the screen and you win 2b more like 2booty 2b a2
