2017 early access review new review as of 4 7 20 this is a very in depth game about the life of a 18 year old in 1995 you are set in the fake community of rykipohja finland and your parents have gone on vacation they are never mentioned in the game besides the note on the fridge and the opening scene there are 2 main objectives both i will list 1 build your dad s old car and win the rally with it the car is a satsuma amp datsun 100a and is torn apart piece by piece as of this review it should take a medium experience builder with speed and a guide around 8 hours to build the car if you are a speedrunner i can say from start of game to fully inspected it would take 3 4 hours 2 get a girlfriend and start a new life this is pretty late in the game however if you go to town youll notice the yellow car guy has a girlfriend if you follow him from the dance hall on saturday he will crash and he will die but his girlfriend will be injured take her to your house and put her on the sofa or the bed and sleep after this you will start dating and she will go out with you those are the main points of the game but theres more then that the developer constantly updates this game adding all kinds of new things for example right now the beta has a combine harvester job you can drive a sewage tanker truck to get money and it is very realistic your air tanks will drain overtime it sucks fuel like no tomorrow it takes a long time to fill the fuel tank etc etc you also have to revmatch the shifts while clutching you cannot float it is a 6 6 6 low 6 high transmission truck and is very fun to drive there are lots of side jobs like hauling junk cars or making finnish kilju for the drunk man or delivering groceries to grandma there is alot of extra stuff to do including dyno test the car vandalize the inspection shop play cards at the ventti house with pigman or drag race it is a very in depth game and you can enjoy it for hours and hours endlessly its always different there is a realistic health system you have multiple bars in the top left corner with your thirst hunger urine stress fatigue dirtiness and a mod for alcohol these are not in order there is a very large modbase for this and they are fun to use mods however to enjoy the game for a long time you honestly dont need them the game is so diverse already that you can play it for a long time without them though it is fun using mods there is alot of adult humor and cussing and profanity in this game i got it cause i dont mind any of that and theres no sex or selling women or anything but there is a literal middle finger button i wouldnt recommend this for anyone under the maturity of a 16 year old there is also alot of funny humor for example the man at the shop his pants or the boombox says 5hit 2000a though the 5 is very well styled like an s 2000a the game is very stable i have never had it crash in the 3 years i have owned it the developer is always willing to help and the community for this game is very good about anything whether its mod support or you lost a part they will help you as much as they can all in all a 9 10 very fun game to play and if you download a save from someone else you arent near as stressed i play this game as stress relief and its very fun overall too its very realistic very in depth and very playable for the 15 price tag i would get this if you can the only issue is it does require a very good pc to play over 20fps but if you have a good pc this is totally worth it its under 1gb on the disk space too
