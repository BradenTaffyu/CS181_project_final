2019 a nice colony management game with a space western vibe where this game shines is mods but even vanilla is an enjoyable little stroll through danger and survival this is one of the few games where defeat is as fun as victory because the stories generated are fascinating to say the least as an example my first colony everything is going well till a heatwave strikes my minions all pass out from the heat slowly dying out in the jungle until hark a potential ally is being chased by a bandit why of course you are welcome to my colony you can grab one of their guns to fight the one bandit chasing you you re a pacifist oh god the bandit is killing my heat stroked and helpless people and starting a fire and carrying away one of the incapacitated survivors while the other dies in the fire at least newcomer is alive and will rebuild oh she s also passed out from heatstroke and slowly dies alone in the jungle great game good stories
