2020 i don t know what to say i actually really like the game in its current state unlike fallout 4 the progression is slowed mods and legendary items feel special for once there s and enormous landscape to explore and a diversity of enemies that d make most mmo s cry the current plot is a great way to start a new character and has been great so far level 21 some elements such as menu management don t port over well to live action finding those health items in a tough fight can be rough if you don t know what to expect hit boxes for models are still fallout funky often meaning you hit invisible hitboxes or miss enemies unfortunately it s further exacerbated by server lag which is infrequent but troublesome it s weird at times entering a hotel with enemies your level 15 then opening a door to a random room at finding a level 62 enemy
