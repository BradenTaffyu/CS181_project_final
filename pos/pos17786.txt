2023 to preface i have probably another 1000 hours in arena from the several years it wasn t on steam as it sits now it in an easy way to get into magic for free and with enough grinding you can avoid paying any money on it at all major cons are 1 no trading2 new developers dont care to optimize the game so it gets laggy and crashes on occasion 3 can t just buy the cards you want you have to spend money on wildcards which means a 0 30 rare on paper might cost you a few bucks if you want to just buy a deck outright 4 most of the good dual lands are rare mythic which makes building decks with multiple colors grindy or expensive 5 difficult to get started against other players and win without spending to get a good starter deck but there are still good budget options youtube helps with finding budget options 6 not great for playtesting eternal formats since there are only full sets going back to about 2016 2017 the number of sets is increasingly slowly though 7 still no 3 player modes wizards when can we get 4 players in a game pros 1 common and uncommon wildcards are plentiful and i have never run out making the bulk of decks easy to build 2 gold is easy to grind by just playing the game 3 the cards you own can be put in multiple decks at once unlike mtg online 4 if you do spend money a 50 card on paper only ever costs as much as a wildcard which can make expensive cards cheap making wildcards a double edged sword 5 play newly released cards early on arena which is nice 6 unique formats to arena can be fun i e alchemy historic etc and give some variety compared to paper magic 7 deckbuilder is pretty intuitive and makes finding cards that fit a theme pretty easy also supports importing decklists which is very useful when you want to netdeck overall i recommend the game has its quirks and perks and i dump a lot of hours into it despite its flaws it satisfies the craving to play more magic when my playgroup isnt available to play in person
