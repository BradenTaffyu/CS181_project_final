2022 this is a great game and i really really hate the hell out of it i don t recall a game that on the surface is very straight forward but once you hit an inflection point the complexity increases exponentially and duplicatively at the same time the nature of the resource distribution the luck of your seed where water is placed how is placed can it be combined how much is there how hard is the polluted water to get to how do you deal with x can i really do y and z like a real life solution answer yes there is so much thought put into all of these systems while at the same time basic reality makes little sense example trying to move heated water through a standard pipe will destroy the pipe you need water for sanitation for coolant and for some plants but never to drink which is good cause holy crap that d just chew through your water faster i ve restarted 9 times evolving my early game a bit tighter and a bit faster each time every single person seems to have a strategy a few degrees off from others checking youtube for strategy guides they are generally very long some are worth it some are eh some of them have completely opposite perspectives should you buy this game maybe i m recommending it but i m still saying maybe because in some ways the complexity of the game can be a little beyond its own control there are still some bugs in this and why wouldn t there be there are also some dumb behaviors that the game does warn you about and some it does not and maybe should trapped duplicants at a height more than two tile drop if you have two miners this can happen easily sometimes will not be able to eat or make poopies but there s no warning unlike other cases where the game will tell you you have a stranded duplicant such as two tiles on the same plane being missing i d rather the game held my hand or didn t watch a few videos please seeing the mechanics on display is very important because there is not only so much to see but so many ways to see it it is a data simulating powerhouse of confusing information and ways to do things you wouldn t think of have polluted dirt and slime don t want polluted air to be added to the area drop it in a storage unit underwater but make sense but do not for one moment think you should even do okay at first you are going to suck at this to start or i am a complete imbecile one of the two do not be afraid to start over do not start over just because of one little problem when you hit a new breakpoint such as a new research station being required go watch some more videos to get a grip on these new mechanics i love this game and i hate it so much i hate that i love it i love that i want to make an artificial being download the game into its brain and hurl it from the hoover dam this game runs deep be patient be patient with the game be patient with yourself
