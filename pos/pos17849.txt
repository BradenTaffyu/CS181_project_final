explanation of why this game is currently on mixed status 1 balance gamers mostly complain there is balance issue but it is all about they don t even play other factions and crying other faction has bigger thing than mine if so just switch your faction and say you are op brain rot time 2 dlc in the release coh 3 pushed pre released dlc as premium for 4 battle groups commanders in coh 2 current state is it is cheaper and in game purchasable so it is not pay to win at all 3 factions people like to complain when there is 11 year old polished game and compare it to a 1 year baby game so they talk about how there is no some factions in the game i wish you just good luck on life coh 2 at the beginning had 2 factions coh 3 has 4 factions and special units from other factions as battle groups 4 ai some people complain about ai is being too hard when i meet people they just want to push 1 unit type and wish that unit would win against anything at all look if the enemy pushes counter unit you got to adapt to that you can t just childishly push something because you love how it looks example pushing only long range unit and hold it in close range of enemy smg s rts game now here is what i like about the game you get challenges daily and weekly and reward is merits which is to purchase cosmetics and battle groups better optimization than any nearly released games that i know of and coh 2 a lot better unit production tree is easy to learn easier than coh 2 ai is sooo much better and fun to play against the game has actually good stylized visuals better pathfinder my actual review the game in current state is a lot better than before i would like to say this is my favorite rts game in current era it is different than other rts s doesn t require you to play fast and click everywhere you just need to play smart i enjoy my defeats as like i enjoy my wins i learn from almost every match it is really easy to learn and play but requires experience to master i also enjoy creating maps for the community ok this is for turkish players and a shoutout to devs i know the game is expensive for our country a lot of games are at the moment sadly it is not because the game is really expensive it just because our minimum wage is now 500 and our gamers went way back to not being able to afford even before steam era because of recent changes of our amazingly powerful economic masters so keep that in mind
