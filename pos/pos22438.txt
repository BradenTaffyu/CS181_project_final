2016 youtube video views 0 game dark souls iiigenre fantasy action rpgdeveloper fromsoftwarepublisher bandai namcocopy supplied by gamestopdark souls iii is an action rpg and the last game in the souls serie developed by fromsoftware and published by bandai namco i can easily say that this is currently my goty storydark souls 3 takes place in a transitory place revolving around the first flame and the cycle of fire and dark you play as a protagonist whose goal is to find and return the five lords of cinder to their thrones at firelink shrine in order to link the flame again the protagonist is known as an unkindled a being considered less of a being than an undead who is made from the remains of an undead warrior who failed to link the flame and as a result burned their bodies into ash the game does not have direct storytelling no one spills what is happening to you there is no quest menu and the few cutscenes that you watch do not usually feature any dialogue if you want to understand the story you must examine the environment read the description of each item and go on the wikia page to comprehend the lore i honestly love this type of apporach since you can easily avoid any type of story and just focus on the gameplay but i find it near impossible that a player doesn t care about the backstory of the places that he visits or the enemies that he fights graphicsfirst of all the game has frame drops that are always between 30 and 60fps but it never ruined the gameplay and it was barely noticable most of the times the design of each area is gorgeous and rich of details beautiful vistas gothic cathedrals burning villages poisonous swaps exploring this decaying world is a joy also thanks to the excellent enemy design inspired mostly by bloodborne without feeling derivative the bosses that you fight are also intimidating and full of different movesets that change mid way through the fight character creation has been improved with basically the same editor of bloodborne but i recommend using the preset characters without many changes unless you prefer to have an hilarious purple knight with green hair red beard and a constant grin on his face gameplayi highly recommend playing with a controller even though the k m controls have been improved the gist hasn t changed you can equip swords spears knives shields magic and many more in each hand and you can use certain items the estus flask recovers your hp while the new ashen estus flask recovers your fp used for magic and special attacks and the both fill each time you visit a bonfire which works as fast travel and respawn point each time you die you lose your souls that are both currency and xp and you can recover them by going back to the place where you died otherwise they ll be lost forever there are estus shards and other items that can be used to improve your character s stats and items you can go back to firelink shrine which acts as your hub where you can talk to multiple npcs and buy new items and upgrade weapons there is also the multiplayer component which makes the game excellent you can summon other players to help you fight bosses and get through difficult areas or you can summon dark phantoms who can also invade you while playing to engage in some pvp this is easily the perfect souls game everything has been improved the combat is a bit faster though not as fast as bloodborne and playing is just way more fun than in the other souls games challengethe game is extremely challenging every enemy that you encounter has the potential of killing you and you must focus on each encounter to avoid getting hit the boss fights are the hardest part of the game but the true achievement of the developers is that they never feel impossible and unfair if you die it is your fault only maybe you didn t dodge at the right moment maybe you used too many estus flasks earlier but it never is because a boss is designed to be nearly impossible except for the nameless king screw him soundthe sound effects and the noises of the monsters are great as always the voice acting is a bit over the top most of the times with the famous sarcastic laughter at the end of almost every npc conversation the soundtrack that plays only during boss fights is top notch it makes each encounter feel epic and at the same time it also scares you and makes you feel as if all hope is lost replayabilitythe game is going to last you for a long time there is pvp coop and multiple new game modes that will keep you entertained as well as secret areas and bosses to fight overall dark souls iii is an excellent video game and in my opinion the best game in the franchise it is hard fun long more accessible and highly replayable a must buy for every gamer out there even at full price story 8 5graphics 9gameplay 10challenge 10sound 9replayability 9enjoyment 9 5frustration 8follow me on twitter nickygra97subscribe to my channellike on facebook www facebook com join my steam group
