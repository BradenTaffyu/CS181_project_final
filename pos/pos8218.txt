2022 i really like this game the only problem i have with this game is konami s inability to try and balance the game to where it is fun to play even if you lose in the end at the moment the game has a meta where it focuses on only otks and that robs the game of any fun when that happens there s no back and forth battle there s only the first turn where you can basically tell if the game is worth playing out or just leaving because you won t have the chance to play at all
