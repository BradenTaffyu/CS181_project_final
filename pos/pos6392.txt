2014 very fun game flying hasn t ever been this easy to learn but difficult enough to master the f2p concept is done well it does not require you to invest hundreds of euros to have fun it sure takes a lot of time to grind stuff open but i ve had fun with just a few planes but if you want to open a lot of new airplanes then you need to invest some money
