this is the first wh40k game i really wanted to try most others being too far up the militaristic some would say straight up fascist metal bums of the flawless astartes turning the openly satirical tone of the tabletop game into a riefenstahl war movie one exception for me was mechanicus which was weird and nuanced enough to immerse in and had kickass art direction and music fortunately this game has even better art direction similarly top notch music and much more to it here s the main highlights and drawbacks imo 1 rt has one of the best premises i ve seen for a crpg main character and plot you re a rogue trader basically a king an undisputed frontier boss who can do anything short of stuff that will make the imperium send a fleet after you this makes every tired rpg trope very natural people do regard you reverently you are special super talented companions do flock to your retinue their best bet for making impact career or not dying and your input is required to solve kingdom spanning problems your party are all mighty warriors since in wh40k all higher ups are automatically great fighters and you always have a huge landing force and artillery with you there s never a question why you interfere in things or why you win wars all by yourself it s in your job description you can do anything including heresy and or democracy because you re a king with a special dispensation everyone will grudgingly roll with that also there is no money in the game you re so rich you just take expensive objects from allies as gifts in exchange for clout and good deals all options mostly fit with all in game interactions crime lord crazy psyker pampered noble stupid crayon eating boot of an officer old navy general civilian clerk religious zealot cult leader you can be all 2 the game has tons of content to offer and it s all hand crafted from artstation worthy level design to optional encounters to a glut of different mechanics from ship and colony management to space combat to multiple types of choose your own adventure sections one rendered in magnificient luscious hand drawn art and of course the insane number of abilities that all interact with each other there are downsides to that generosity leveling up is a chore and crafting builds can take hours if you re prone to it luckily the game is not difficult and many characters are broken good lots of mechanics mean many of them are only sparsely implemented none are truly useless but sometimes they only promise complexity reasonable one game can t contain 5 other games e g space combat feels like a germ of a real capital ship combat game but stops halfway there writing is incredily generous which is both good and bad wh40k lends itself well to pomposity and drama and sometimes the length pays off npcs may susprise you with unusual nuance your character s reponses also have a very broad range not just good good but rude cartoonishly callous fight still overall everything is long winded as an editor i see that many conversations could be cut in half 3 as a result the game does not particularly respect your time it s all right to crpg aficionados who like to spend 100 hours with a meaty game but sometimes it s grating here s a few examples extraneous not difficult combat that doesn t really add anything laborious level ups for each character and lots of item effects which invites optimizing but may be confusing and tiring time consuming star exploration with lots of loading screens and repeating events i love exploring systems and planets even for tidbits of text adventure but it s all a bit clunky especially if you beeline somewhere this can mean 3 samey battles in a row 4 because the game is so ambitious some seams are showing for instance companions are very varied and well crafted but their camp conversations almost don t vary throughout apparently not enough time for so much reactivity that said the companions are really good there re types for everyone they all have nice warhammery stories loyalty missions and romance writing is varied as well different companions expect wildly different lover attitudes from the rt 5 the original alignment system is also pretty successful considering the world of 40k you don t choose between a goodie and a baddie you choose between being a raging religious fanatic or at least an ultra conservative militarist which is the good society encouraged role that your subjects expect of you a self serving bastard of any color including the worst most perverted murderous maniac imaginable which is also expected of you although less enthusiastically or a weird inscrutable person who wants to help people and defuse conflicts some arcane stuff like that which is absolutely not expected of you but is tolerated note that this will lead to problems and to a many i told ya from more experienced locals all feel natural which is again quite fresh for a crpg i never felt like being an idiot for choosing an evil or close minded option and i never felt like optimizing when choosing a nice option nice options often made things complicated and nasty options were often intriguing i ve yet to do a full heretic run but i know there s entire additional mechanics to support it as well as a super perverted companion you can do bdsm with 6 this has dragged on for too long so a quick list combat is satisfying pretty and makes you feel powerful i loved the large variety of items in the game and the design of models all armors have custom fit and look for each companion and you qol can be better but seems to be improved in the 1 2 patch at least now maybe rumours optional maybe objectives will complete properly and planet systems will show quest markers tactical interface is fairly clear and polished the combat system is byzantine by design similar to tabletop but you can open the combat log and important each hit s detailed calculations or each enemy s sheet which is essential bugs are present i waited a few months but caught a few thankfully not game breaking mostly visual or weird behaviour one required me to reload a save few hours earlier patch 1 2 should help sotl dr the game s very big opulent and multifaceted and just a little bit broken just like the imperium it puts you into a perfect spot to freely roleplay in universe without cramping your style gives you interesting companions cool quests and setpieces and kickass visual and sound design but it also wastes a lot of your time on clunky minutiae long winded conversations that could be edited in half convoluted character leveling sometimes bloated design mechanics and some bugs in the end if you have the time it s well worth that and more lots of love and thought and talent went into it and it shows the sole fact that the game does not crumple under all this stuff is telling somehow they pulled off the best as of yet wh40k role playing computer game
