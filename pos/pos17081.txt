2017 i ll be honest i didn t really like total war warhammer i and i generally don t like rts games i m not sure why but i think it s mostly due to the game being pretty complicated steep ish learning curve and generally large amount of attention required however i really love total war warhammer ii i ll be honest the campaign mode really made the game fun for me i still don t like the battles too much and it s not the game s fault i just fully haven t understood the mechanics there are many many things to learn such as what units have more armor ranged v flying units cost of running an empire how many units should a lord have difference in factions and units they have what do monsters do and why get them instead of other infantry spells and mana pool what is leadership what is the difference between melee strength and melee attack and don t even get me started on cavalry i hate using them because i never fully learned how to use them properly i always get them killed that s why i use skaven no cavalry p so it s fair to say it s pretty compicated to a noob like me but the game has a narrator to help guide you in the game and also a quick tutorial to help you understand the very basics i highly recommend starting on easy if you re new like me it still felt challening at times and really helped me understand the game bit by bit i definitely made mistakes and am still learning but i feel as though the game is much more forgiving and therefore much more fun for my first play through i think a large reason as to why i enjoyed it this time around is because i just generally enjoyed the new factions this time that s not the games fault that s just me personally liking the new factions which then captured my attention and made me more willing to play the game the game still has all the old factions from tw warhammer i and it makes it fun battling them the graphics are pretty nice but you definitely need a high end computer to play it on ultra or above the combat itself is fun and the differences in the factions make different playthroughs feel completely different meaning there is a lot of replayability the battles themselves can range between 20 min each or an hour depending on the difficultly of the game and how even matched both sides are the ai feels pretty fair and doesn t seem like it s a cheating ai that knows what you re doing all the time if you re like me and are a bit more interested in the campaign or the game estimates you will clearly win you can just auto resolve the battle making it so you don t need to wage a battle ever y single time if you don t want to tldr overall i m pretty sure warhammer i was just as fun but for whatever reason this game really grabbed my attention i definitely enjoy it a lot more and i want all the newbs out there to know don t be overwhelmed with the games complexity just start it on easy and get all the help you can get the complexity is there for advanced players meaning you will never get tired of this game because there is always something to learn when you play the game longer and the addded difficulty you can increase will make sure you always feel like you re being challenged p s i m new to the rts world so this is just from a noobs perspective
