2018 this is a positive review but the talking is not so positive so we are at 2018 the game exists from 2013 and when it was relesead it was a huge bug festival like playin an alpha state of the game the game after 15 pathes emperor edition was much more playable but and this is a a huge but for some weird reason the company of this game keeps pushing this dlc strategy 12 dlcs like wtf about 110 euro extra and the game cost 55 euro seriously wtf i mean i can understand some dlcs to be sold like empire divided which a new campaing but surely not at this price 17 euro for a new campaing yeah but surely can t understand why the actual you sell culture packs like you buy the game and you can t play sparta or athens cause you dont have the greek state culture pack and be sure that a lot of people want to play these factions these or even the blood and gore dlc should have been part of the game from the start of it but nooooooooooooo we are at 2018 5 years later and guess what a new culture dlc guyz desert kingdoms bullcrap for all only 9 euro i bet that even with a mod there might be a 10 of the players who maybe played one of those 4 factions the only real reasons i recommend this game is1 the time period is probably the best2 the gameplay of total war games is somehow unique for me and you should try it3 mods who ever buy this game just straight up mod it use divide et impera for sure and have a nice challenging game with new units better ai and better combat system and generally better gameplay
