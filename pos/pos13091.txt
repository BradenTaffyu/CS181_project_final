2018 oh ksp ksp you glorious mad buggy time sink of a game over four hundred hours and that not counting the hundreds of hours i put into this in a copy bought from another platform because reasons ouch kerbal space program has given me some of my most memorable most glorious gaming moments ever the first time i made it to the mun and back only to land on a mountain roll down it and die in a ball of fire the first time i managed to build a spaceplane that made it to orbit and back in one piece without shedding any bits on the way up or down the first time i landed the twin rovers courage and stupidity on the red surface of duna the hours upon hours spent fine tuning vertical take off and landing planes exploring the alien moonscape of laythe in the juno midge a tiny jet engine with a fixed wing command seat unicycle landing gear and gyroscoping steering the times i ve watched helplessly as the kraken shakes apart my magnificent majestic spacecraft and space stations and eventually developing my skills to the point where i could build a functioning kosmodrome on laythe complete with a command station a fuel refinery a tanker a tractor three space or aircraft and various other odds and ends do a fully recoverable return mission to the surface of tylo and escape the hot embrace of eve kerbal space program is at its core an incredibly simple game yet with vast almost unlimited depth and tremendous educational potential learn to play ksp and you will get a whole new view on space news and sci fi might be forever ruined for you learn to love its persistent and pesky bugs and imbalances juggle with mods and try one wile e coyote idea after another only to see some of them actually work if you have the time and patience to learn it to the point that you can make it to the mun and back alive the sky is no longer the limit do i recommend it yes yes yes and yes
