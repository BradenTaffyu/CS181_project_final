2017 i had never played a total war game before this game drew me in because of the warhammer license this is easily the most fun i have ever had in a single player strategy rts game there is so much variety among the races the battles are very fun and the replayability is high i imagine the vast majority of the negative reviews are due to the dlc as far as i m concerned every dlc offers good content and all add a ton to the game so as far as i m concerned the money was well spent and i m not going to split hairs over a few dollars
