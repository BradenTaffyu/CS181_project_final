2016 oversimplified it is ets2 moved to the us different models and terrain smaller scale distances and time goes quicker but the same game basically sci is moving to a dlc sales model where this will undoubtedly result in incremental charges over the next several years just like the ets2 model if not more ambitious modders have already had their way and sometimes made some nice things but nothing close to ets2 yet which is logical this will be a great game it just might be expensive to see it bought on sale with a coupon paid 16 and it was worth it 7 10
