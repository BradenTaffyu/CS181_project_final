2023 i mean seriously this game should come with a warning label may cause you to abandon all responsibilities i used to have a normal life you know but now it s all about rusty bolts engines auctions junk yards first of all let me clarify that i absolutely despise this game i hate it so much that i m playing it right now as i write this review my productivity gone my social life non existent my self control well let s just say i have about as much self control as a squirrel at an all you can eat nut buffet i wake up in the morning and think to myself today is the day i m going to quit car mechanic sim i ve got better things to do but then just as i m about to hit that uninstall button i suddenly realize there s a 73 mustang waiting for me in the garage it s like the game knows when i m weak and vulnerable the worst part is i now have this inexplicable urge to check out real life car engines i ve started hanging out at auto repair shops pretending to be knowledgeable about carburetors and camshafts all because of this hocus pocused app i hate this so much i want to quit it like cigarettes but i can t it s a game that has turned me into a grease monkey a car enthusiast and a procrastinator of epic proportions
