2018 early access review rimworld amazing one has to be very careful when you play as it is so immersive and has such a strong pull that hours nay days go by and you still want to keep that colony going even if it means you sacrifice sleep it is an exceptional game and i couldn t do a review justice as it would be parroting what so many other positive reviews have already said so i will sum it up here go crashland on a foreign planet dig yourself in both in game and real life because it s gonna be a wild wonderful ride you ll become attached to your colonists you ll love some hate some if you re like me you ll even have strong feelings for your pets losing one is hard not just for your colonists but you i feel bad too i could literally write a 20 pafge review explaning all the things i like but that would become boring so i will just reiterate the most important thing to keep in mind the game may have a learning curve but it is one of those games that has such a grand payoff for spending the time to learn the systems
