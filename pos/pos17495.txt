2016 the game has the seal of of the elector counts i go for immersion when i play so for me the greatest feature is the ability to choose a race that fits your play style the best of the 5 races in the game i ve played as 3 here are their stories dwarves they fight to reclaim lost lands when you use them you have to play defensively you drive the hordes of greenskins from your mountains and right the ancestral wrongs they are a slow campaign but honestly nobody ever looked at a dorf and thought this guy this guy s on the track team god watching their stumpy march drives me crazy love their variety of artillery though and they have flamethrowers you can literally kill things with fire vampire counts total subjugation the vampire count armies have two flavors monsters and undead trash i went the undead trash route and threw endless armies of zombies at everything until their heroes fell under the weight of the dead it s got a kind of shambling majesty when you watch 3000 zombies and skeletons just engulf a formation of shining brettonian knights you know they re doomed but you kinda want to seem them put up a fight chaos fhoorr kaaosss my personal favorite no worrying about settlements no worrying about income no worrying about diplomacy you just run your angry armored ape train through every settlement in the old world they are awesomely terrifying because they seem so angry i have 2 complaints the first and most irksome is that the multiplayer is exceptionally bare bones and offers no ranking or matchmaking it s a mess and a downgrade from previous total wars the generals lords have fixed skill trees that do not allow you customize the lord to complement your army a pity because the lords in this game are such engines of destruction paladins of buffing i feel this could have been easy to implement the lack of ranking also makes this a distasteful affair the other complaint is the lack of giblets and entrails not really a complaint when the blood and gore dlc comes out i better see people exploding into bloodmist and leaving bits and pieces everywhere or i m telling khorne and he ll f you up
