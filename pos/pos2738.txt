2019 i won t describe how deep detailed and good this game is others already did that i just want to say that i ve spent 40 hours yep more than fourty on the very first map of the game to complete all quests to find all hidden treasures to play through multiple dialog choices and to try out the many tactics the game offers this game is that huge this is its biggest value and problem at the same time if you are not careful you will be lost among the many quests as it looks as if every single tree in this game can give you a quest often with multiple solutions i wish other games would suffer from the same problem also i would like to thank the developers not just for the quality and care they presented with this game but also for their consumer friendly attitude they show towards gamers in times like this when you get games half baked nerfed just to sell more dlc s season passes even lootboxes and skins they had the decency to make a complete full game for its price no shady money grabbing no tricks no pay to win here thank you for that and keep up the good work for that you have my money for your future releases if you like rpg games do yourself a favor and buy this one if you haven t already you won t regret that
