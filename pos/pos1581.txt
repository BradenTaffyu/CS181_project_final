2022 having played both automata and replicant in that order i think this is the most beautiful story ever told in any form of media that said this is my warm recommendation play nier replicant first dive into the lore a bit to figure out what the gestalt project thing is all about what shades and replicants are etc it s not mandatory but automata will hit 2 5x freight trains harder than it does without playing replicant it will also help you understand the world of automata a bit better then play automata and bask in the glory of what mankind has achieved within the nier universe enjoy the process of having your soul deconstructed and put back together as you play the various story routes don t try to reconcile the apparent absurdity of the game hack n slash sexy robot format with what it actually tries and succeeds to achieve within the player s mind once you have lived with the existential heartache for a few days after finishing the final story route go on youtube and search for nier automata concert readings with the voices of 2b and 9s act v now savor the true ending of the game read by the voice actors themselves unofficially out of love for the game and the fans then finally see the world in a slightly more positive light and be changed forever realizing that yoko taro is probably a celestial being from another dimension put on this earth to show us a different way of making games glory to mankind
