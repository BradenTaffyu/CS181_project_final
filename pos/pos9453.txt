2016 disclamer this review is based on my experience using a xbox controller 63 hours so far graphics car very detailed graphics environment not great but passable and enjoyable performance runs great on i7 4790k 970 80fps on high setting sound let this speak for itself youtube force feedback controller even with a controller i have sense of control on how my car behaves on the road damage the physics isn t great when you bump into things it feels like playing bumper cars youtube and the car damage are mostly scratches single player ai single player is great and with many challenging modes however when you are racing against ai they will pretend not to see you and hit you multiplayer the community is awesome everyone wants to race but every now and then someone will try to ram you on purpose multiplayer server browser host easy to host but no steam integration expect a lot of eu servers dlc might seem overpriced at first but completely worth tons of high quality cars and tracks overall great sandbox racing simulator
