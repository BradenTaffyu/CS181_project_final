2015 early access review 7dtd is a work in progress it s true and as such it still has some bugs though not that many in my limited experience and the rumors are true it s an ugly game mostly i m not here to give an in depth review however i m here to tell you why i like this game and why you should give it a chance to give you just a taste imagine if you combined minecraft with dayz and got rid of the terrible community of snarks hackers and griefers dayz players you know what i mean all while fixing the zombies so that they not only work but work smart instead of hard yes at times i can t help feeling that the same people who did the art for killing floor had something to do with this gem but think of 7dtd as the one who can t coast on looks alone who instead tries hard to bring something to the table besides inane meteorological commentary if 7dtd has anything it s brainzzz no i m serious it s a smart game with smartly done zombies imagine playing minecraft in a world without the blocky style or the odd beauty that accompanies it at times where instead of laughing at vanilla zombies you run and sneak and generally fear for your life because they are coming to get you barbara sorry i had to the flying turtles made me imagine a world where you choose between romero or 28 style zed where said zed can smell if you re carrying some rabbit or deer meat on your person where zombo can hear you searching that house because you broke a window to get in and then had to break into a fortified area to get at the safe you spied between the boards over the doorway where the walking dead might be easy one on one but damning and deadly should you not stay on top of your game and get cornered by a horde where you never know what the game is going to throw at you next because although some things remain predictable those things seem refreshingly logical and limited you take down an infected nurse and find some medical supplies you search a car and find some auto parts medicines are where you d expect them guns are where you d expect them food and supplies are pretty much where you d expect them you re not going to find a wolf carrying a sack of gold or a rat carrying bits of materials for you to use in crafting sometimes a town will have a pharmacy and be full of rare medical supplies sometimes a town will have a weapons supplier that has nothing left on its shelves sometimes you ll stumble into a snowy region or a fallout zone and find some unusual things sometimes you ll feel the game is unfair but it s up to you to set your boundaries because like minecraft you can set the game to creative and enable cheats if that s the way you want to play it run from those zombies or fly the choice is up to you either way i ve solidly enjoyed my brief time in this game and i urge you to consider not skipping it even though you may feel that you ve killed all the zombies you could want to kill in one lifetime my one qualifier on my recommendation is that you should factor into your decision whether you will be able to play this game with friends because like minecraft it s perhaps most fun when it s done with people you care about and enjoy spending time with thanks for reading hope to see you in game soon updated june 21st 2018 hello post apocalypse fans else why would you be reading this i ve decided it s time for an update on my review because the devs are still deving and i m still playing in fact these days it s the only zombie game i play genre is getting quite tired but i still like it just wanted to share with any potential customers a couple of things zombies are a little different than they were during my original play not sure though if it s better or worse just different also i m not sure they smell the meat you re carrying since it no longer gives you that message when you carry meat but those aren t the reason i m here to update my review just sharing those bits before the message and the message is really really consider getting this game it s a lot better in many ways than it was back when but the most important reason the one that is worth sharing is the knowledge that this game can be easily modded by the average player with some coding skill not much i promise with notepad free anyone can mod the xml files to produce drastic changes to game play in my server the deadly zones are now all pushed to the outer edges of the world snow is at the tops of mountains where it belongs and zombies are only encountered during the night or if you go into a building or camp or if a horde spawns unless you go into the bad zones where you can meet them at any time the hordes don t seem as well designed as they used to now instead of hunting around in your area they just head straight for you kind of irritating hope you re listening devs also also beware adult content the devs seemed to think was needed in the recent updates i ve modded that out of my server but it s in the base game strip clubs and naked zombie strippers which are totally not needed to make the game better also since i wrote the original review the vendors like to use bad language which you can fix by changing their attitude toward the player s from neutral or dislike to like in my opinion these recent choices by the devs are a step backward in development and very sophomoric i like a certain bit of realism but swearing doesn t make you cool and necrophilia isn t edgy or smart it s just gross there off my box
