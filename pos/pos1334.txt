2022 early access review project zomboid does not hold your hand there is a tutorial that kills any inexperienced player in the first 10 minutes the first few irl days of playing project zomboid are best used dying and learning about how basic things in the game work basically pick a skill that looks interesting use an entire life trying to understand it die and do it again it does work a little better w experienced friends to keep you alive during your learning period but they re not required the modding community is active and healthy at least by my understanding there s packs like britas mods that add a lot of weapons armour and a few other things in that vain to start off with though there is also a lot of quality of life mods simple things like minimal display bars that show you all of your stats like hunger thirst fatigue and such in simple coloured bars that are not at all intrusive they re by default at the top left of the screen and can be moved anywhere you want outside of the modding scene the game is perfectly playable and enjoyable just remember you need to be just a tiny bit of a masochist to enjoy project zomboid to the fullest i think the most interesting challenge is the extremely masochistic challenge of a really cd da which starts you with a cold of the severe variety a deep wound inside of a burning house and naked with nothing on your person though there are others this one is my personal goal to get through the challenge for me is to just get over the cold from the start i m new to that specific scenario the general modes of the game are builder survival and apocalypse or these are the more common ones which are nowhere near as difficult as cdda short for a really cd da though apocalypse is the hardest difficulty outside of the very difficult to moderately difficult challenges
