2020 i ain t no fan of hunting irl but i reckon this is the best hunting simulator pros maps are beautiful there are a lot of landmarks to explore it s one of the best games for screenshot lovers map dlcs are not required you can join someone else s server to play it for free without having to own it stealthy gameplay if you like rogue sniper play style there are many rare fur animals for you to hunt and collect you will either be a very patient person you never thought you could be or you will quit after a few hours of hunting failed getting anything cons be prepared to get frequent client crashes in multiplayer a lot of crashes however there s no crashes in single player bugs rarely get fixed because the devs are focusing on making new paid dlc content expansive world x expensive world leveling to max level is a very long process but also very rewarding it takes about 80 150 hours depends on play style cheating and hacking is not prohibited so you will encounter speed level and freeze hackers in multiplayer the most recent update new animal scoring 2 0 system has lowered the difficulty of the game making it a bit too easy new map dlcs are often lazy works where there re the same animal models with different skins and names what are the must have dlcs atv tents and weapon pack 2 saseka safari trophy lodge only if you really enjoyed this game and plan to play it long term maps you can try all the maps in multiplayer without owning them and then buy the ones you really like for single player experience
