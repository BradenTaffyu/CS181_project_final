2016 short versionfallout 4 is a great game but it s not amazing since the content isn t used to its full potential in other words i get dressed and head out into the wasteland not for quests or caps but in hopes of finding vault tec lunchbox confetti and the amusing teddy bear scenes if you re into that kind of stuff too keep an eye out for jangles the moon monkey comics bobbleheads and the first cat in space mr pebbles so it s still a fun game despite a dry storyline and dull decision options within quests long versionthere are a lot of reviews out there arguing both sides as to whether fallout 4 is good or bad some consist of essays written by fallout veterans and others consist of a few jumbled words i hope my review will be helpful to someone who is searching for something in between the knowledge that i ll share consists of things i find interesting about the game and ofcourse develop further upon my short version of the review the difficulty options you can choose from include very easy easy normal hard very hard and survival i started with survival and stuck with it i had a very difficult time at the beginning as the amount of ammo and medical supplies amongst other things is very limited i ventured into the center of the map relatively early which may have not been one of the smartest ideas but i feel like even though it was more challenging than the area you start in it s a lot more rewarding once i developed a strong presence in the center of the map using settlements survival didn t seem so bad i have not played fallout 4 on any of the other difficulty options so i do not know how they compare to survival but i feel like the game would be a lot less fun on the other difficulties survival might be really difficult but it also has a lot of cool features that contribute to why i think fallout 4 is great so i guess i could even say the survival difficulty is what essentially makes fallout 4 great since it has features like ammo has a weight this prevents you from carrying all of your ammo so if your primary or secondary weapon runs out of ammo that s it you re forced to pick up a random gun and have a few bullets from the corpse you just looted and not the stockpile that s stashed in your chest or workbench medical illnesses weaknesses you can acquire from being sleep deprived drinking dirty water or becoming dehydrated not eating becoming addicted through substance abuse and some other conditions these conditions force you to visit doctors or obtain aid by other means like finding buying or crafting some examples of aid include antibiotics cure illnesses buffout increases strength and endurance incase you re trying to grab that additional piece of junk you can t live without jet slows time for 15 seconds extremely helpful in certain situations such as when you come head to head with some tough enemies in a cut scene and radaway removes radiation from your body useful after thunderstorms after stumbled into a field of radioactive waste or if you re a commonwealth olympian like i am after going for a swim in a highly irradiated river to get from point a to point b not being able to fast travel is a big deal i figured it wouldn t be such a big deal since you get to go sightseeing but i was wrong when i started getting some quests that take you from one corner of the commonwealth to the other i realized how wrong i was having to save not by using the menu but by finding a bed and sleeping in it this this is what set me back many times i d be walking along the beach admiring the waves heading home from an hour or two hour long journey a journey that was bedless and then surprise a mirelurk pops out of its burrow jabs its claw into my tummy and i traveled back in time the time of setting out to complete that one to two hour journey again after learning the art of time travel i also learned that you can t speed through survival you shouldn t walk along beaches and beds are your best friends info that some might find usefulthe pip boy on your wrist gives you access to a variety of features such as stat current state of health strength of equipped weapon and strength of equipped armor inventory items that you re carrying data quests settlement info and overall player stats map map of the commonwealth and also shows settlement supply lines if you have that set up radio classical radio diamond city radio and the occasional distress signal or military emergency frequency another useful feature of the pip boy is the vault tec perk chart this shows you how many levels were attributed to the main branches strength perception endurance charisma intelligence agility luck as well as the minor branches perks if you re not familiar with what this is the main branches are self explanatory but some of the perks include strength strong back increases carry weight armorer unlocks higher ranked armor mods perception locksmith allows you to unlock higher level locks rifleman increases the amount of damage dealt using non automatic rifles endurance lead belly decreases the amount of radiation taken from eating drinking contaminated items charisma cap collector improves the buy sell prices at vendors lone wanderer increases carry weight and you take less damage and deal more when alone local leader allows you to establish supply lines between settlements and stores workbenches could be built intelligence medic makes stimpaks improves health fixes hurt limbs and radaway cleanses your body of radiation more effective gun nut unlocks higher ranked gun mods hacker allows you to hack into higher level computer terminals agility sneak makes you less detectable when crouching mister sandman improves the damage that silenced weapons do luck idiot savant randomly awards you bonus xp for your actions kills sometimes if an area has a red workbench it s a potential settlement location completing a quest for the person in charge there or clearing it out of enemies that live there will let you gain access to the workbench through this workbench you are able to remove certain structures in that area like trees and cars you re also able to build your own structures furniture turrets guard posts water pumps and farms collecting random items as you explore will provide you with the necessary materials for settlement projects some of these materials are within junk items such as anti freeze bottle acid plasticcamera gear spring crystalduct tape adhesive clotha few things took me some time to figure out about settlements that i d like to share if your population isn t growing and you don t know why you need a powered recruitment radio beacon and if you re tired of collecting all the junk in the wasteland limit it by tagging specific materials you don t have while in the build mode so that items you need have a small magnifying glass next to its name also you can assign people in your settlement to do certain tasks and you can give them weapons clothes that you want them to use junk is shared by settlements via supply lines things like armor weapons aren t while exploring the wasteland you may run into a legendary enemy these are marked with a star by their name these enemies drop random legendary items although some can be found or earned some examples include le fusil terribles combat shotgun does 25 damage but has more recoil too reba ii sniper rifle 50 damage against mirelurks and bugs chameleon synth left leg left leg armor enemies are less likely to spot you when you re sneaking and not moving
