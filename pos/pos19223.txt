2014 this is the best game ever made seriously its a good strategy game and all but it really has improved my life in other ways for example i now have superhuman knowledge of trivial points in world history that will never come in handy ever every time i blink i see a map of continental europe burnt into my retinas i m pretty sure that i have become racist towards various cultures and religions especially the french seriously them also stupid happens all the time you ve been looking at central europe for a few hours you pan the map to the west and notice that haiti now owns half of america you declare a war to claim one province and before you know it the whole damn world is fighting against itself in every single continent you feed your ally provinces from your wars and laugh manically as you watch their kingdom crumble to 200 stacks of rebels the game seriously plays down all the opression and ethnic cleansing that goes on it makes it seem that all you re doing by hitting that convert button is changing a few percentage values but deep down inside you know whats really going on when you hit the harsh treatment button to lower your peasant revolt risk you don t realize that your soldiers are storming into peasants homes and executing them just for having an opinion on how to better their lives i mean i didn t even notice that all of my african provinces were producing slaves until i got an event that abolished slavery the only reason i even cared about that was because it made my monthly income go down don t even think about trying to be a tolerant peace loving society either all the countries next to you will kill you or the boredom will kill you because there is literally nothing to do in this game besides wage war and find new ways to the common man in the butthole it really opened my eyes to how terrible white people are overall 10 10 best opression simulator so good it desensitizes you to make you think just like how a near omnipotent aristocrat in the age of discovery would
