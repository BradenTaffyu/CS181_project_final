2021 currently arguably the best racing game on the market and the developers made a lot of improvements over horizon 4 the map is bigger and a lot more varied there are deserts canyons jungles beaches a volcano etc so it always feels exciting to explore vehicle sounds have been improved a lot and they change based on the upgrades you install hundreds of cars with huge variety there is something for every taste from jdm tuners to american muscles suvs and trucks to supercars a lot of events to participate there are the classic sprint and circuit road rally and cross country races but you can also play drift races a battle royal mode player made modes etc or complete the story and open world challenges previously it was very hard to drive rear wheel drive cars without assists especially when they are upgraded to higher performance levels so people usually converted them to all wheel drive layout but it is much more comfortable now the campaign is better than it is in horizon 4 it was basically non existent back then and the festival was present only at a small location now the festival atmosphere is better felt with different locations across the map in horizon 4 you could select specific class and type of online races you wanted to join for example you could choose a class road races if you didn t want other performance classes or rally and cross country races but unless i am blind i don t see this option in this game so you will always get a random class and type the cons are nothing compared to the pros and how fun the game is so i definitely recommend
