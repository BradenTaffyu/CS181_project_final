2019 i have played every total war title from empire to three kingdoms this is by far the most difficult game to review in that lineup this game is highly polished in terms of its graphics voice acting and general aesthetics and settings there are lots of times when the game is extremely fun to play as you watch your characters level up and earn new weapons abilities and positions in your nations court that being said this game is also incredibly annoying and frustrating to play which does limit the overall experience probably the most annoying thing is the fact that right out of the gate you have a decent idea of how auto resolve battles will play out this does not incentivize me as a player to fight a lot of the larger battles because why would i if i already have a guaranteed victory why would i fight the battle myself and risk losing it my most recent campaign as liu bei i think i have fought 10 battles in 98 turns personally that is pathetic when compared to other total war titles such as shogun 2 i fought most battles unless i had pure overwhelming numbers the other thing that is frustrating is how the campaign ais operate they aren t stupid like in past total wars instead they are hyper aggressive and will ruthlessly dogpile on the player while it does add to the challenge when you have to fight that many countries it becomes less and less rewarding as time goes on if anything it just feels discouraging and doesn t make me wanna keep playing the last thing that hurts this game is the lack of any real difference between nations unlike a lot of other total war games there are very few special units for each nation whereas in say rome 2 or shogun 2 each country had its own unique units in tk not every nation does this makes the battles feel very repetitive and the fact that unlocking more of the late game units feels like a chore rather than something to be excited about is pure agony just as a note ignore what ca calls the easy warlord cao cao is great at the start cause he can expand fast but once he gains his natural territories you are immediately surrounded by other major warlords and they are not afraid to gang up on you i suggest new players start with either lie bei or gongsun zun as they are relatively easy in the early and mid game stages 8 10
