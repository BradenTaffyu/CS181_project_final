2019 267 hours logged and i have tried each class race i ve only fully completed the game once i love this game but i couldn t force myself to play it today i wish there was some massive dlc upcoming but no i have never played anything like it and i would find it hard to believe that another game company could top this kind of coop tactics fun run if you re trying to decide whether or not to buy it only do so if you have friends since playing alone is depressing the best part is working with others trying to figure out how you re going to change up the strategy on the thing you just can t kill
