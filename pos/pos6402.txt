2014 war thunder is an incredible free to play game the visuals are stunning and the attention to detail is mind blowing every model of plane or tank in the game is historically accurate they have tons of future vehicles planned for the game they really have only begun to scratch the surface in terms of the aircraf that will be added they also have plans to start bringing more tanks into play the game is cross platform playable on windows macintosh or ps4 which is just friggn awesome i would still consider this game to be in beta since they have so much more to add and bugs to fix here and there sometimes it can take several minutes to get into a match other times you can t get into an arcade match at all they have also had strange issues with spawning into a match also where your tank for example will spawn inside of someone else or you will fall from the sky all of this stuff seems to be getting fixed though the team developing this game has a real passion for it and the history behind each vehicle in the game it really shows
