2023 early access review it s a factory game i know you addicts out there need no more info to be sold on it it good you buy if you re not an addict and want to know more dyson sphere program factory game with a mix of traditional factorio stuff simplified streamlined you see in satisfactory with some interstellar logistics and power generation on top not as ugly as factorio sorry babe still love you but not as pretty as satisfactory it s 3d and you can use verticality in your logistics but it doesn t get as vertical as satisfactory the research tree is bigger than satisfactory but smaller than factorio i know i m comparing it to those two games a lot but those are what i consider to be the 2 pillars in automation games and i m guessing if you re looking at dyson sphere you ve played one or both of those factory games usually leave me with an urge to replay one of those 2 games but not dyson sphere it has elements of the best automation games out there while also having its own personality and take on the genre with the more futuristic feel and added logistics of ships going between planets it really scratches its own itch it s really high quality and really easy to pick up tutorials are helpful the user experience is pretty great and the difficulty curve of the game is pretty easy going there s really almost nothing negative i can say about it the devs care a lot and content updates are consistent and meaty they re adding combat soon this is not even to mention the cool community stuff they have like designing power armor and a giant galaxy map showing the star systems with the highest power generation there is a ton of depth if you wanna get really really nerdy and generate insane numbers but you can also just play it like a regular factory game where your goal is to just complete the tech tree this game is addicting and stimulating its own special way so much so i would consider it to be the third pillar of automation games if you re into to factory games at all i think this is a must play
