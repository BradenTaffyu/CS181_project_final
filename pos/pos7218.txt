2023 i don t have as much time invested in ats as some other games but it s the only game i have that s not been uninstalled at some point it s been on my pc and always with the latest dlc for 3 years now even though i m not always playing it because just as is the romance of the road trip the desire to get in my truck and hit the highway is always sure to come back i ve traveled around america quite a bit i ve lived in maybe 7 states and have been to 39 of the lower 48 states from my experience scs software has done a great job recreating all the aspects of each location that makes them stand out of course the distances in the game are compressed but any notable landmark or building are usually there sometimes with surprising accuracy there is one 200 mile stretch of a particular western american highway which i know very well and though some small towns aren t there the exit numbers geographical features prominent buildings intersections and sometimes even mileage signs are there going through colorado on hwy 50 i knew i was on top of monarch pass when the lanes changed the way they do when you crest the mountain there are countless moments like this as you recognize bridges buildings and even signs from places you ve actually been and it looks amazing at night even as road hypnotism sets in on the freeway as light sweep across your dashboard and green and white signs come out of the distance and roll past your windows ats is no doubt immersive and still screenshots can look like photographs the work they ve put into the game is evident this is all true but there s still things to critique pros and cons pro new states every couple of months keeps the game ever growing and keeps the game relevant especially as within this is spread updates to keep the game looking fresh going back to the game after a few months is not going back to the same game as there will be new places to see always con it adds up over time have you seen that massive dlc list in the store the game is mostly made of dlc i understand why they do it and i don t mind but a lot of people just want everything at once for one price so i should point out that there s a lot of paid dlc pro because the game basically is just driving around the attention paid to the inside of your vehicle the traffic and the scenery is the best simply the best you will see you will sometimes see drivers who are polite and yield right of way and other times cars who impatiently rush past you i joke that the traffic is so smart there s actually bad drivers watching for this and for random road events is all part of driving as in real life and one of the many things that especially with a good monitor makes it the most immersive recreation of real life locations i ve seen con there s a lack of back roads there are lesser traveled roads but if you just take the suggested route to every town you will end up back tracking on the same interstates over and over and over con though the ai traffic is the best i ve seen it will get confused in gridlock situations and just sit there i ve found there s always still room to weave your truck through at least they do like to get confused when one driver decides to merge into another s lane and neither want to yield to the other this can stop up traffic pro there are a lot of trucks maybe twice as many now as at launch added in free updates and a lot of customization this makes sense as the inside of your truck is your world in the game it should be personal every tweak of your seating position steering wheel mirrors lights etc is there to adjust your view and there s all the options for the truck inside and out hundreds of parts for everything from big chrome truck accessories to dashboard items con modded trucks made by the community blow the standard in game trucks out of the water to the point where you won t even want to drive the regular in game trucks anymore but and this is indicative of the developer s approach to the game overall they watch and learn from the modding community and the players the most recent dlc adds hundreds of customization options to one of the trucks mimicking many of the same options that modders usually include the recent kenworth w900 tuning pack turned me away from getting a third party modded one as they ve largely imitated the same thing here i ve gotta say i ve not often seen developers outright imitate modders and one up them with official dlc and this game has always been improving like this for the 7 years it s been out i have screenshots from american truck simulator that look like photos dead serious no filters or effects they look like photos but there s something odd i ve noticed i started noticing it watching gameplay back that i had recorded often times at a stop in a city the camera does this kind of jerky pan when you look around at an intersection i check and no i m in ultra at 60fps i m not talking about frame drops but it looks like it i see it sometimes in videos i ve made i watching them back and i m thinking why does it look jerky sometimes when you look around it was at 60fps while i was playing idk but you don t notice it much maybe it s just my system but nevertheless i am a player and that is my experience i honestly had to work really hard to find cons for the game as what it does it does so well the main gripe i see is the cost of the dlc but this is a game that s spent the last 7 years recreating america bit by bit it s here to stay for sure this is one of those games that you think about all day and long to play when you get home from work i ve had a few games like that i think maybe today i ll take the coastal highway all the way up the west coast i have a new black freightliner i haven t driven yet i ll take that up california highway 1
