2016 warning this review gives minor spoilers for undertale view at your own discretionthroughout this single year that it s been out undertale has been yanked in and out of these two sides of love and hate across the internet the ones who love it praise it for using a bullet hell battle system that encourages pacifist playthroughs and telling a humorous and emotional 7 hour thrill ride on the other hand the ones who aren t very fond of undertale criticize it for its obsessive fanbase that creates these weird fan drawings and constantly pushes people to play the game even if they might not want to as you can see each side has their own reason for liking or hating the game yet despite this regardless of whether or not you enjoy undertale this experience isn t mainly about doing either of these things at all it s about conversing with a joyous and friendly flower only to freak out when he reveals that he s a total sicco that wants to murder you and everything that breathes it s about feeling uneasy knowing that you have to do a randomly generated puzzle only to laugh when it was just going to generate a straight path instead it s about having a sense of insecurity when an over achieving skeleton asks you to hang out with him in his room it almost seems like he s going to try and make a move on you but he really just makes a humorous scene where he just gives you spaghetti that he made as a gift it s about encouraging a nervous knight to confess his feelings to his armorless and buff friend only to be weirded out when you realize the two knights are gay for eachother most importantly though it s about making you feel like the biggest jerk ever for the times you killed a monster or two even if you thought you had no choice the main purpose for undertale is to make you feel uncomfortable yes the game can make you cry yes it has a genius combat system in a genre dominated by games that play things safely however all of this adds up to take you out of your comfort zone undertale puts you in situations where you re interacting with people you don t really like or just have a lifestyle you might not agree with at first i thought papyrus was just some narcissistic dork but he s really just someone who pursues his goals with a fiery passion he just shows it in a way normal people wouldn t understand when i first saw undyne in her ominous armor i thought she was just some sociopathic knight who was just trying to kill me out of pure evil when i fought her however i found out that she s really just an extremely passionate fish who was only trying to kill me for the sake of the people that she defends and when i was about to meet alphys i pictured her being this old and wise scientist that knew everything instead though she s this socially awkward otaku that is so obsessed with anime that she confirms that anime is a real life record of human history to the monsters of her home she also suffers from a lack of self confidence in herself and constantly tries her best to be all she can be by posting statuses constantly on her social media page and trying to date undyne the whole game does all of this these encounters with the strange and the twist on gameplay to make you realize that in the real world not everything is as it seems not everybody is this invincible being that people like to stage themselves as not everybody is what you perceive them to be the dorks the muslims and even the smart kids at your school are not what people tend to generalize them as being they re regular normal people like you and me they re truly real individuals that have a heart and that have short comings just like everyone else and the game conveys this message perfectly through its determination to make you understand people and situations that would otherwise make you nervous to remind you to just love people and not to over think things in life it is a constant cell phone reminder that people should never ever forget to do one thing to love so yes i do recommend this masterpiece though not just because i think it s one of the greatest games of all time or because it is an emotional thrill ride rather i believe that if you re open about it undertale can cause you to look at life differently and maybe even change you entirely for the better yes i know i might sound like an auction man running his mouth to try and get a product off his hands and that you might be thinking that this is just another review that recommends a game you might not be all that into which is fine i used to not be very fond of this game when i tried the free demo of it for the first time due to its old school style but then i played it again with an open mind and i can now proudly say that i didn t regret a minute of playing this epic game so yeah give it a go it s one of those games you need to play before you die you might actually think very fondly of it later on
