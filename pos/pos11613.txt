all they ve done with the most recent 1 0 is remove things that everyone liked and added unnecessary road blocks they removed all the clothes and they dumbed down the armor system so that a 4 year old can understand it things like duster coats and bandannas were just fun and they took it away from us i ve been playing this game for 10 years started playing on macbook first and now my windows pc at some point there was a sweet spot where the game had lots of features and items it made the game intricate and re playable it seems since that sweet spot with every major update that has come out all they do is shine up the graphics a tiny bit and then remove things that players liked bring back jars bring back duster coats and bandannas bring back the blunderbuss bring back the og wooden crossbow
