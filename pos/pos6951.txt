2018 early access review note this game is early access hint why i rated it positively my concerns are listed for people who want a better idea of where the game is at in development this is a really fun game to play especially with friends you are on a 2x2 raft and able to expand it using the trash in the ocean as you build your raft you can research different things and learn more crafting recipes you can also explore different tiny islands and once you have antennas and a computer you can find other interesting areas the progression of the game is also nice as you have nothing but a hook and your 2x2 raft and need to figure out how to feed and hydrate yourself and not completely lose your raft to the shark and as time progresses you have the time and materials to perfect your raft i was able to get a solid 12 hours out of the game before it felt redundant there is no variety in the areas that you can explore and there is nothing particularly interesting that you can find the only animals you will ever encounter are the sharks and seagulls and whatever fish that you catch with your fishing pole but those don t count the crafting is kind of limited and there are some items that you can get and are literally only used for one thing like clam shells and copper thus they stack up really quick once you build your raft the way you desire startfrowing food and have researched everything there is literally nothing new or interesting to do these are things i am sure the development team are working on making more craftable items more interesting areas to explore etc lastly i have some thoughts on what i would like to see in the game and i know some of these are things the devs are working on hunting on islands it would be really cool to have bigger islands with diverse wildlife and ways to hunt them possibly simple potion creation for things like the health or extended underwater breathing if not armor clothes to increase health more dangerous areas like when you enter a certain part of the ocean you actually have two sharks until you leave the area or that the water is fierce enough to cause some minor damage to the raft things like that character creation because i am a weeb if other animals are added being able to tame one as a pet could you imagine having like a pet bear that can catch fish for you or even a pet shark to fend off others i just think it would be cool to tame animals and each one has their own perks island diversity such as ones that are lush and green and others that are volcanic each with their own benefits and disadvantages
