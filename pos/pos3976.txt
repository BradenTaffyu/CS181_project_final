2021 so i ve been playing games for 36 year now all the genres like them all most of all rpg turn based strategies ww2 shooters bf etc and just achieved victory in slay the spire after 206 hours of hugely enjoyable play i would say this is in top 5 games of all times for me maybe even top 2 together with card hunter those two games are so far the two games i would take to a deserted island i am actually seriously considering making my own card based game in the future so just try this even my 10 year old son loves it i just recorded the slaying for him xd
