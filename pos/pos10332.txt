2023 i m a pretty casual racing game player i don t own a wheel but i do enjoy playing all kinds of racing games with my controller ranging from arcade titles like nfs to more serious titles like forza motorsport having that said i ve never seriously dabbled into a real sim like acc mostly because i don t own a wheel but since it s on sale today i figured why not i m happy to report that it s very much playable with controller if you re just a casual driver you might not be as fast as the fastest wheel drivers out there especially if you use steer assist but if you re just looking to have a good time this game can be a lot of fun i recommend getting the gt4 dlc if you re new to sim racing gt4 cars are slower than their gt3 counterparts so you ll have an easier time learning the ropes with them but they re also super fun to race with keep in mind that most people only race gt3 cars online so you ll probably only get to use your gt4 cars in singleplayer these are my controller settings found these somewhere on reddit i ve found these to be really smooth i play with stability assist off and tc and abs on increase your tc abs levels if you keep spinning out do a few test laps on your favorite track to get a feel for the cars and be gentle on the steering if you re on controller rumble intensity 80 effects type enhanceddeadzone 5 speed sensitivity 75 steer filter 90 steer speed 100 steer gamma 1 5steer assist enabled
