2023 this is unquestionably my favorite game to me the true beauty of this game is ineffable but i will give some of my thoughts i have played a ton of hours across the xbox 360 xbox one and pc and i am still experiencing new things in this game to this day usually games with this much player agency and depth have a top down isometric point and click or occasionally 3rd person presentation to me though nothing beats the immersion and feel of 1st person games some games have quality content others have a massive amount of content but fallout nv has a great combination of both the combat is fairly janky but vats was a great solution for the jank other than a decent amount of jank i don t really have any other gripes honestly the jank has grown on me over the years adds to the charm and boy does this game have a lot of charm and flavor it has a fairly dark vibe often through game or story elements that aren t as look at me i m an edgy game as other games such as when you stumble across a deceased body in the room of a decrepit motel with some drugs laying on the bed with them as if they just dropped them from their hand or running into a crazy lady with a bunch of dogs and when you go into her dog shelters you find plates with human flesh on them a lot of the story and game world seem true to what i imagine a lawless post apocalyptic world devoid of morals would be like perhaps the best quality of the game is the open endedness of the story basically you have a set up for the story at the beginning then the game lets you mold your own story want to ignore what the main quest is telling you to do and wander off on your own you might just stumble across a way to skip multiple quests want to murder main characters and fail or bar yourself from multiple quests sure why not the game doesn t like to box you in much the story is structured in such a way things will still make sense if you decide to color outside the lines a bit the factions are pretty interesting imo and all have their reasons for what they do two things they all have in common is that they all believe they are moral exemplars and they are all intolerant of the other factions sort of like real life other aspects of this game i really enjoy are the looting the inventory management the absence of lame fetch quests the companions and the music is amazing the radio host definitely ads to the charm as well more than any other game the world of fallout nv is one i can truly get lost in so yeah you should play it
