2023 this game is really addicting and fun without a doubt but it sure is an investment if you want to access 60 of the game better to buy a certain set of the dlc than to own em all you can gauge pretty easily which are good based off sheer numbers of reviews even considering that some are negative only because they add genuinely interesting features as a side effect of dealing with the rest of the hot garbage glad the devs are still working on the game and adding cool stuff but there is still some to be desired chances are if you are like me you will play this for hundreds of hours as i have on multiple platforms and not get bored and mods will easily extend that way further there s an insane amount of stuff to discover research explore and the wars are mighty not good if you have a weak computer and yes you can play space hitler just don t be surprised when you get your fleets wrekt by half the galaxy banding together to stomp on you
