2020 this game admittedly has problems problems that paradox interactive themselves will never fix because it s not a matter of quality but of expectation people expect games of these types to be full of content akin to past games that paradox interactive has made without looking at how those games stand up to these games today yes europa universalis iii or hoi iii or even crusader kings 2 looked like they had no problems but that is because the modern day paradox grand strategy player has rose tinted glasses on these games take several expansion packs to reach their potential and even when those expansion packs come out fans are still not satisfied they re always looking to improve one thing or another because these games are huge and can be improved upon all the time fans and developers of this company have a strange but straightforward relationship the developers have a list of things that they want to improve upon and they tease the fans with developer diaries the fans become hyped for the expansion pack and then when it releases they teased with more teases and more developer diaries until one day the developers just pile up all the things that are left to change and do it in one last pack before they move on to another game this game was released in 2016 it has had so many rewrites re dones and reboots that it is not the same game it was in the gay old summer of 2016 if you want to see how much work the developers put into the game buy the game and request access to older versions you will see that these devs actually while having 1000 expansion packs care about the quality of their game play an older version to see if changes haven t been implemented to address fan concerns this is not a company that hands out turkeys to the poor on thanksgiving but they want you to feel like you are getting a quality game that you are comfortable with at least if you re not happy with the state of the game re visit it in 2 years and it will be addressed one way or another
