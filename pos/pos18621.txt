2021 hello fellow summoners i have gathered you here today to tell you my experiences with btd 6 aka bloons tower defense 6 ninja kiwi really outdone themselves this time the btd series has come a long way since the first game and has made a lot of changes for the better in this game btd6 they introduced heroes which are all very strong and unique characters which can greatly diversify the way you play the game my personal favorite hero is benjamin this monkey gives you a lot of money for the late game and debuffs the blimps that show up in the later rounds wow so awesome high five other than heroes there are a lot of monkeys that each have 3 paths that you can upgrade which are all unique from one another this plus the fact that there are a countless amount of maps makes this game have a lot of replay value another addition to the game is the monkey knowledge skill tree which you can invest monkey knowledge into to make your monkeys and the heroes a lot stronger there are also some secret monkeys that you can unlock with special interactions if you don t want any spoilers please skip cave monkey is a tower that was first introduced on version 17 0 it is unlocked for a single game upon breaking apart the frozen cave monkey on frozen over by repeatedly bombarding it with a mortar monkey for a total of 30 or more times upon breaking the ice the cave monkey spawns close to the entrance of the track towers can still be placed on the ice after it breaks the cave monkey attacks using a wooden club which pops 1 layer and stuns bloons including moab class bloons but not bads for a short amount of time 1 0 seconds for bloons 0 25 seconds for moab class bloons the club can hit up to 5 bloons at once including lead bloons no upgrades are available for the cave monkey and selling it will give no money there is no way to get the cave monkey back if sold outside of starting a new game my first experience with btd 6 bloons tower defense was playing with some good old friends of mine who i no longer speak to due to their passing rip when i first booted up the game i was greeted by the monkey ace who kindly excreted dopamine into my brain i was soon in the main menu where even more monkeys greeted me looking as happy as i did when my dad stopped abusing me
