2017 c mon become overwhelmingly positive already while at the time of writing this review i haven t even gotten past the first act yet i nevertheless feel compelled to write a review for this beautiful game for me the game s highlight is its excellently designed turn based combat there are no potentially pesky rng elements and therefore every fight follows the same strict rules allowing you to have full control over how every battle plays out there s also an insane amount of skills that are open to each and every character and free to combine at your leisure half of the fun is simply experimenting while the game is very very challenging in a good and fair way i never felt the need to look up guides as with some thought you are more than able to compose your own diverse team of heroes except maybe on hard difficulty but don t play that until you finished classic the voice acting is also superb with tons and tons of spoken dialogue and different choices you can make also initiating a dialogue with another of your team members may open up a whole different story which may reveal more of the character you are interacting with or the world around you finally the graphics look more than impressive enough considering the game s genre and the level design has nothing to complain about admittedly no game is without its flaws though and i will summarise my minor grievances here inventory management is still a hassle it s a common issue for rpgs and i m not sure if there ever will be a game that s perfect in that regard but with four party members switching items to and fro out and in of backpacks and the like becomes a considerable hassle especially when it can be hard to discern between quest items crafting materials fluff and junk to add to that civic skills like bartering and lucky charm increases your chance to find rare items with that player only are not group wide meaning that you will have to switch items and gold to and fro your characters yet again to reap the maximum gold and good gear frankly i don t bother with the last two because it s a serious nuisance and it doesn t really make the game too hard without nevertheless a fix to this inconvenience would be appreciated furthermore certain skills are either useless initiative determines the play order during a fight for your team only meaning that having one at 13 then 12 11 10 is sufficient and any extra points are basically lost or certain skills provide odd bonuses warfare a melee oriented skill that apparantly is the best damage increase for rangers as well i do have a ranger in my team with 5 huntsman and 0 warfare however and he s perfectly viable on classic i only need to make sure he s positioned with a height advantage which is actually how the game intended rangers to be played last but not least there s no way to change party members during a conversation meaning that if you are forced into a dialogue probably because he she was closest to the conversation starter with someone and a persuasion check needs to be passed it is impossible to have your player with skill in pursuasion take it over this led to frequent quickloads for me basically during dialogue your team members turn into mutes unless they are scripted to take part in the conversation i didn t intend for the second paragraph to be longer than the first and i would recommend to pay more focus to the great things this game offers rather than the minor nuisances i will give this game a higher rating once some or all of these issues are addressed which i actually expect they will tl dr a must buy even at full price it currently has the well deserved spot of 10th best game ever p s feel free to reply to this review with questions i usually reply rapidly also if you decided to buy the game after reading this i d be happy to help you out with the game or play with you co op if our times align rating 9 0 10halwin s 100 completion recommendationdifficulty unsure but considering honour mode achievement i expect 9 10 time expect it to be easily 150 hours will update this section once i have completed the game
