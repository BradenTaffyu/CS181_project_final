even after 7 years this game holds up fantastically i have grinded 20 hours with my 8 year old son and the shared excitement that we both share coming up on a level 9 animal is incredible this is a game that when played together with your kids is a conversation starter the laughs we have when one of us accidentally discharges a weapon or uses the wrong gun for big game are priceless the only feature i am missing is being able to see my son s pings 3
