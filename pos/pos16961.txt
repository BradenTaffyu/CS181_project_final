2016 early access review i don t understand why this game is still in early access it s one of the most complete games i ve played rather bug free as well to the game i don t feel like explaining what this is about you can find that info elsewhere easily as for the price tag if you re planning to explore the game to it s fullest i e do all or most of the achievements you can spend a lot of time with it i spent about 50 hours in game counter shows more but idle and so on and that s about how long it took me to do all of the achievements and these get really hard in the end but it adds to the fun for me for people who are uncertain as to if this game s worth the money i recommend just trying out the phone version yeah the content on the mobile version is largely the same but due to the nature of touchscreens and the capability of phones it s rather dull on phone i feel sometimes you just lack the tempo to do certain tasks in a certain speed on touch while on pc it s much easier with all the hotkey and mouse controls it s simply more manageable aside from that on mobile you have to pay for dlc while on pc you get everything for 14 bucks also you have triple speed here on pc while only double speed max on phone to everyone saying this is a slow game i recommend upping the game s speed you ll have your hands full with work especially on higher difficulties if you re the kind of person that s not even interested in playing a game to it s fullest someone who s like yeah i ll try every mode out once on the easiest difficulty and move on then no this game probably has very little to offer for you and thus rather low value in regard to it s price as for the multiplayer that s still in development i feel multiplayer on a game like this is needless but apparently people seem to enjoy it unlike me but i guess mp is in today s world a high value proposition for most of gamers anyway if you ve liked what you ve read and seen maybe stumbled across this review i can wholeheartedly recommend buying this game under the above circumstances
