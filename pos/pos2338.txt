2020 had this at launch would never recommend it now it s definitely a lot better for the amount of content in the game it s probably worth what they are asking now but i d still suggest picking it up on a sale only get fallout first if you have a group of friends who will play regularly otherwise it s an absolute waste of money you can get atoms from just playing the game admittedly slowly and the majority of things in the store are cosmetic save one or two things the robot scrap gatherer comes to mind but you can just save up and get it for free it s not that expensive if you are desperate for the atoms though fallout 1st is the best way to get them just do a one time sub and cancel it straight away oh on storage you get 800 stash storage which is more than enough in the game before restarting i had all the junk i d ever need a bunch of weapons almost all the outfits and armours and every power armour variant on power armour frames and still had around 200 left in storage
