early access review the developer greg is extremely hardworking and attentive while the game is still in beta it s the most fun i ve had in a long time greg really listens to his community i can t wait for the future of this game the bugs i had experienced that made me put down the game when it released got fixed within 2 3 weeks so it s nice knowing if something is affecting all players or a lot of players it will be attended to thank you for all you do greg you deserve everything that s coming to you congrats man
