2020 i absolutely love this game i really love the game play and caution this game can get very addicting however we badly need a bigger choice of houses to renovate the choice to demolish outside walls would be good to enable us to expand our houses and maybe the chance to build fences and veranda s would be awesome i would certainly recommend this game also my favorite part of this game is when i m vacuuming roaches
