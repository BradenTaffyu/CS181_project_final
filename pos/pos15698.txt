2021 early access review aim lab is an incredible aim trainer which means a lot because is still on a w i p status i think aim lab is worth of the time you are willing to give to this trainer and i would recommend it if anyone ask me however let s go to the real review aim lab is amazing as i just said at the beginning of the review and i think is amazing for training mechanics and warming up and that s it even though aim lab offers an incredible amount of exercises of multiples types to practice many things i think that playing the real game you are practicing for will always be better and don t get me wrong aim lab is amazing to practice mechanics but if you are trying to get good at a game at the end you have to give the maximum amount of hours and effort into that game anyways aim lab is still amazing even for pro players because there is always some type of movement that is not common on the game that you can get better in here so yes aim lab is amazing helps you train and get better mechanics and reflexes but should never a substantial amount of your time that can be invest on the real game to finish the review i would always recommend aim lab to anyone who ask me about it and i m gonna keep using to warm up and practice some movements thank you for reading this review if you liked or find it helpful in any way please show the appreciation with some thumbs up have a beautiful day
