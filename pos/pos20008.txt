2012 absesive ok that top line was my review for well over a year if you knew the series you got the joke but in the spirit of an often on sale yet over looked game i can do one better yes folks this is one of those games you absolutely must have set in the fallout world of post nuclear america this time in the nevada badlands outside of what is left of las vegas you awake as a courier recovering from a nasty headshot think old west mixed with rat pack era vegas and the fallout dash of mutants ghouls tribals npr brotherhood of steel and cowboys yes you get a pip boy the fallout standard navigation device inventory access and radio you have vat fallout s version of action freeze bullet time no this one does not have bobble heads iit s only bad point in my opinion though it does make the game more challenging look if you enjoy a premium rpg first person shoot hack zap game i can highly recomend this one intense combat fun plot a small but rich open desert world explorer nice voice acting as well best of all nowadays highly afordable if you haven t played this yet you are truely missing out
