2021 this is a phenomenal game with only 1 flaw for anyone that likes colony sims building cities mining realistic fluids such as water flow or anything like that this is the best of that genre however this can only be enjoyed up to a certain point if the game had an actual ending that encouraged players to beat planets and start over on harder ones this would be the best game on steam but it lacks in that department once you get a decent understanding of how to keep your colony alive the game will become stale this saddens me because this is my favorite game but due to that small flaw i won t ever play it again
