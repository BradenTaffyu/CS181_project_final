2020 early access review after 290 hours of gameplay block based building mining system like minecraft but not pixel art tons of stuff to do exploring building mining farming crafting and ofc killing zombies great multiplayer i mostly experienced co op play but pvp also seems nice and capturing decent singleplay with houses full of traps and more agile powerful zombies after dark this masterpiece offers great immersion don t expect great optimization prepare to play at medium or below quality settings this is not a graphical piece of art but it doesn t matter to me to wrap up i can say that every single second without playing this artwork is a waste of time buy and like me play with your friends to maximize the experience
