2021 one of the best hunting games out there truracs really makes you hunt unique antlers you never know what awaits you round the tree an award winning deer or a hungry lion furthermore the devs still update this sometimes there are bugs but they get adressed so be patient they do listen a lot to us the comunity this is why i can only recommend this game i am a irl hunter and i personally think its a good mix between hunting and arcade hunting realism and gamerealism
