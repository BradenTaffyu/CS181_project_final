2022 i ve been playing aoe since the first one in the late 90s and this is truly my favourite of the series the graphics are perfect the gameplay is fun and the historical videos and other contexts make aoe 4 a particularly special experience my favourite aspect by far is the clever mastery progression mechanic with a sort of career path for each civilisation it s a fun and interesting mechanic that encourages replayability and learning new ways to play each civilisation my only complaint is that i d like to see more civilisations and more variety between civs but i m sure that ll be addressed with a lot of dlc in future and that s okay with me for now i m very satisfied and i highly recommend it
