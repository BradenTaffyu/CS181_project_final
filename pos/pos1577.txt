2020 genre story rich jrpg hack slashnier automata timeline is set many thousands of years after the events of the first nier game in a post apocalyptic world where mankind is almost extinct and living on the moon because aliens invaded planet earth and released machines the story revolves around androids built by humans fighting against machines so humans can come back to their homeworld the story is pretty emotional and unique and has such an interesting concepts but some are reskinned from nier replicant it s a pretty good story even though it is not perfect and got some plotholes gameplay wise it s pretty fun it s not the best gameplay you will ever see but it s pretty good when you play the game the first time you will play it from the perspective of the female android 2b 2b has 2 weapon slots and you can switch between those weapons all the time or use them together for combos weapons types are swords small large ones spears aside from this you also have a machine pod flying around you which helps you with mission objectives and also you can shoot with it it s pretty useful and you will use it as much as your weapons once you beat the game you unlock the story from the perspective of the male android 9s 9s is support android not really made for combat he is scanner and while you can fight with him his combat abilities are far slower and weaker but he is able to hack things and hacking is pretty op overall 9s gameplay is way safer cause you can hack enemies all the time and avoid unnecessary combat important role in gameplay of this game are chips once you start getting better chips game gets easier you can increase hp increase evade distance etc most important mechanic in this game is dodging if you want to become good in this game keep dodging like crazy and you can pretty much dodge through anything especially with right chip but be warned every time you die you will lose all your chips and you gotta retrieve the body so my advice is to load the game once you die unless you are sure that you will retrieve the body because if you die before that all your hard work will be pointless aside from standard gameplay big part of this game are bullet hell sequences because you are able to operate with robots that can fly you can t choose when you will fly with them it s just a part of the main story bullet hell sequences can be tough for beginners so just keep dodging once you learn to dodge like a maniac game becomes way easier one big problem i have with difficulty in this game is the fact that normal is easy which it should be i guess but hard is extremly hard if you don t play side quests you will die in 1 2 shots from all enemies so i guess play on normal if you don t want to grind and do side quests and if you play on hard do side quests because if you are underleveled you will have problems i beat the game first time on normal and second time on hard but i did most of the side quests now to explain routes route a is you playing as 2b route b is unlocked after beating the game like i already said and it s same story but from different perspective of 9s but it s totally different experience it s really necessary addition to the story but cause of 9s hacking abilities it s easily beaten once you beat route b you will unlock route c and that s when game really starts it s necessary to beat all routes because if you only beat route a and route b you will only experience 40 50 of the story basically nothing because route c is the most important part and it s ending to the story side quests in this game are okay some are fetch quests but some are decent i found them worth it on the first playthrough because they helped me to level up easier but after first playthrough they weren t interesting to me also definitely read important intel but you still won t understand story completely after that cause you need outside sources atmosphere in this game is just amazing every soundtrack of the game is extremly good and full of emotions and my favorite soundtrack in the game youtube video weight of the world views 4 779 418 provided to youtube by nextone inc weight of the world keiichi okabe keiichi okabe keiichi okabe nier automata original soundtrack released on 2017 03 29 auto generated by pros pretty good story soundtrack is incredible pretty fun gameplay but can be hard if not played properly amazing atmosphereneutral playing route b can be a bit boring since you are playing through same stuff just from different perspective it reuses one important story concept from the previous game side quests are okay nothing specialcons some things regarding the story are left unexplained and some of them were explained in musical visual novel outside the game difficulty is a bit unbalanced on normal it s an easy game but on hard you have to explore a lot so it could be better levels are pointless some enemies will one shot you so after first playthrough that i played on hard and finished most side quests i found hard boring so i would recommend normal after first playthrough if you die during prologue you need to start from beginning and it s not short verdict great story would be amazing if it didn t borrow some important concept from the first game and didn t leave some things unexplained gameplay is fun difficulty balance could be better world is interesting and soundtrack is amazing amazing game overall note this explains how i rate games in my reviews rating 8 5 10
