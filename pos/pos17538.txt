2017 i have put a stupid amount of hours into this game and even then i still keep coming back the visuals are flat out phenomenal audio is realistic and emersive factions are unique and offer different playstyles even though features have been stripped and battles are shorter then previous titles in the franchise the game is still just plain fun to play watching your army of monsters and infantry clash with your enemy is nothing short of eye candy all in all if your a fan of the total war series do yourself a favor and at least check it out and if your a fan of rts games on a massive scale look no futher then this blast of a game
