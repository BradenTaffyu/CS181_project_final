2016 stellaris is an entry level real time strategy game with a space setting this is a difficult game to review on the one hand it is a very addictive blend of 4x and real time strategy on the other it is a game lacking a lot of depth paradox s other games like crusader kings europa universalis victoria and hearts of iron have far more depth than stellaris does and all have their own niche a lot of the depth comes from the historical setting in these games that attempts to accurately portray the world s situation at game start and each game s own take ck is all about dynasties and plots eu is a huge game of risk with actual countries vicky can be won through playing the economy and hoi is obviously all about real time warfar but stellaris there are no real countries there are no recognisable situations and the game isn t sure if it is about diplomacy or warfare in space both are very lacking diplomacy is almost non existent and warfare all too often comes down to just spamming immense amounts of ships until you either win or lose even though the recent major patch heinlein introduced much better ship mechanics all too often it is still just a numbers game does that make stellaris a bad game no absolutely not if you go in expecting an easier rts where all players are inherently equal since there are no pre defined bonuses other than allowing some ai races to start with a minor advantage you can have a lot of fun with this game each game will be very different since everything in the galaxy will be generated in another way so where in one game you may find yourself boxed in by stronger empires and lose everything in another you may be able to control a huge part of the galaxy and eventually conquer it all until the end game crisis comes what elevates stellaris above just a basic real time strategy game is its events as you explore the star systems you can encounter many small stories most of which can turn out different in several ways one time you find a seemingly abandoned starship and have your scientist explore it only to lose your entire ship the next time the same event comes up you get a rare technology instead etc more skilled leaders will usually lead to better results but everything remains somewhat random so do i recommend stellaris yes but only for people who already like paradox games or similar games like civilization series bearing in mind stellaris is real time strategy not turn based if you want the next master of orion or x don t go looking here
