2019 an awesome strategy game that feels like a love letter to all the nerdy sci fi franchises don t let paradox s reputation for super intricate strategy games daunt you if you can play 4x games like civilization or total war you ll find stellaris perfectly approachable that being said i would recommend reverting back to the 2 1 3 niven version the latest update kinda broke the game and made it a lot more tedious right click on the game in your library select properties select beta then revert to 2 1 3
