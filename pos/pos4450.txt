2018 a good game based on a oppen wold with a lot of distinct options to choose you can be a mercenary and search for contracts a noble who wins their money from rents a merchant who travel around the world selling goods eventually you have the opportunity of obtain higher ranks on the nobility command your own little army and try to stablish your own kindom the fact that there is that big amount of choices and possibilities for playing is great but the game is not really deeply developed in any of them it has been mainly in the battles and from the first person perspective you directly have not at all an accurate command of your troups on the battle it will be mainly the ia who command them then diplomacy commerce or other staff could be also too simple for some players but if you like medieval ages environment open worlds and first person fighting you will really enjoy this game
