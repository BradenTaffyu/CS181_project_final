2016 early access review tl dr exploratory roguelike with brilliant writing a huge pool of interesting abilities and an expansive world to explore caves of qud one of the best roguelikes i ve ever had the pleasure of playing i have endless entertaining stories from this game from the time i knife fought a bear and won to the time i set the horrifying slog on fire and shot lasers from my eyes until he died and oh so many amusing deaths such as the time i was flying over a river fell into it and was eaten by madpoles it s one of those games see before i can recommend it however i must offer a few caveats first most importantly the learning curve is high for those who aren t used to roguelikes the gui is entirely keyboard driven and having a numpad is highly recommended there are handy dandy references on display hit f1 read the quickstart but you will need to actually read for a little before you re off and running second character creation will be intimidating when you first run into it there are so many interesting mutations to take and so many true kin classes don t panic pick whatever sounds cool and marvel at the choices take a lot of toughness grab freezing hands or light manipulaton get yourself into the game thirdly it s still in early access there is a lot of content there is so much content the devs could stop developing it today and i d weep but it would still be a full game in its own right capable of entertaining for hours the skinny the main quest line is unfinished as far as i know it s roughly halfway done but it s difficult and long already and unless you re really good at roguelikes you won t get to the end of what s in already and it will tell you when you hit the end for now note the devs are updating it weekly they revamped caves just recently and there s even more stuff in the pipeline that hits every friday so with those caveats in mind you might be asking why would i rec this the answer is once you learn the ropes and get going it s one of the best roguelikes out there and quite possibly the king of the exploratory genre of roguelikes caves of qud is well written flavor text abounds and has a lovely tileset and poking around in its jungles and deserts and caves leads to all kinds of fun there are bears you can talk to in this game and even bigger deadlier bears with jetpacks you can die to for example there are also actual books in there elder scrolls style with multiple pages of in game lore and those are honestly more exciting to me than the rest of the game but i m a lore hound and i digress once you ve poked around the starting town and assigned hotkeys for your numerous abilities you ll use the world map to either go north to red rock or east to the rust wells and there you ll fight in traditional roguelike style bump against the monster to harm it on a turn by turn basis or use your mutant abilities to harm things from afar or get the multiple arms mutation to dual wield greatswords against your foes invest in axes dismember the limbs of your foes there are so many interesting options and the mutations interact in interesting ways as you fight through these distinct areas to get loot and more importantly more food and water water is the game s currency and you need both it and food to live it s a survival sim in that respect and you should be careful that you don t go into the desert without food because you will run out and die of starvation slowly you ll learn where the dangers are use the look command always to assess your enemies and you ll learn when to run or use the big guns in your arsenal slowly you ll forge your way to grit gate and golgotha and beyond and you ll die over and over and over trying new mutations every time or just using the replay most recent character option until you re sick of playing espers caves of qud for all it has a learning curve and its brutal difficulty coaxes you back in by asking you repeatedly what if you had this mutation instead it works brilliantly please buy this game and enjoy it
