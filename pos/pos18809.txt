2017 i absolutely loved fallout new vegas it had me smiling and enjoying my experience the entire time gameplay fallout new vegas is rich with content for you to enjoy a wide array of weapons and weapon mods to go with them to several different ways to approach the story the combat in fallout nv is very fun just because there are so many ways to destroy your enemies in the game along with v a t s makes it very fun to see kills in slow motion leveling up in this game is also fun there are tons of perks and different skills that determine which perks are available this makes the game have lots of replayability there are tons of diverse locations for you to explore in the mojave although alot of the land between them feels empty and weak the game will even reward you for exploring these side areas from a certain vault s equipment room to much more it feels natural the game will also introduce a reputation system basically the karma system but for each individual faction in the game the factions which are also fantastic and even an old friend will come to see you from fo1 this along with lots of side activities in vegas such as gambling such as blackjack and roulette which can be very rewarding with high luck stat alot more side quests are available once you get to new vegas as well story while the story in this game may feel a bit cliche at first it definately gets more interesting later on as the characters you meet in the story are memorable that with the multiple endings and choices you have in the story add to the games replay value alot audio music the sound design for the weapons and creatures are very well done as with the music and the radio are also fun to listen many scores from fallout s soundtrack can be heard in nv such as metallic monks giving a great sense of nostalgia to any classic fallout player graphics fallout new vegas uses the same graphics engine as fallout 3 which may seem a bit dated now but it still can give lots of beautiful shots with the landscape of the mojave desert the game and graphics run very well on new and older pcs alike you should have no problem running this game overall all together fallout new vegas recieves a 9 10 from me it s a great game with very high replay value along with a decent story obsidian did a fantastic job with this game
