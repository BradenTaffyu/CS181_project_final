2023 this game is exactly what is says on the box 40k rogue trader crpg by owlcat games please take the time to research and understand what each of those elements mean so that you will be happy with your purchase the game is not perfect but no game is the game is not for everyone but no game is chaos gate daemonhunters is my favorite game and rogue trader is not but that is not owlcat s fault just my personal preference however i do think this game delivers the 40k universe very well it has detail breadth and many choices for you to make and so i am happy with this game and to recommend it one great feature i want to call out superior combat difficulty settings there are about 30 that you can change at any time outside of combat feel the enemy has too much hp reduce it cover bonus not good enough boost it one feature i would like to see improved is the camera which needs to be able to zoom out more so i can see more of the map during battles bugs so far i have encountered only one ui bug it has happened twice and all i had to do was save game back out to main menu and load game again no progress loss it is possible there are other small game rule bugs skills not working as intended in combat but with such a complicated system i can t tell for sure glhfupdate after completing chapter 3 chapter 1 2 are a great game chapter 3 is a tedious buggy poorly designed mess clearly owlcat put all of their pre release effort into the first two chapters so for normal gamers looking for fun beware update after completing chapter 4 as far as story progression goes i think chapters 3 4 are less buggy than they appear the issue is that the story elements get more complicated but the game does not improve in the way of communicating this to the player leaving you to feel that you can t progress the story or reach a part of the map behind a wall or complete a side quest because it is a bug when really it s because you have not talked to the right npc or failed a required check or need to go somewhere else and come back it would really benefit owlcat s reputation if they invested in ensuring that the player can always figure out what needs to be done next instead of leaving it to random answers in forums and game hacks to help players progress frustrated players bad reviews and bad reputation for owlcat and their games update after finishing the game ugh i am so glad it is over they should have removed chapters 3 5 improved chapter 4 to the quality of chapter 1 2 this game needs less quantity more quality much of that is due to the rt rpg system which gets more tedious and repetitive the longer it goes on
