2017 an amazing installment of the fantasy total war series adding variety to the game and expanding the warhammer world did i just sink 80 hrs into for a single campaign in 2 weeks oh yeah i did you gonna wish you had an ssd if you don t have one yet genre strategy theme fantasy estimate total playtime 200 hrs 50 hrs per playthrough per faction difficulty hard key words grand strategy warhammer empire management diplomacy trades seiges rating 9 5 10 summary large scale epic battles strong warhammer lore unique campaign core event great graphics and fighting animations online coop and head to head campaign mode the even grander grand campaign mortal empires super long loading time hardware resource demanding no online competitive ranked matchprosgovern the fantasy realm take control of large scale armies and withness the stunning battle field scenary of the fantasy world in total war style backed up by the strong lore of the warhammer fantasy world the endless war of the unqiue fantasy factions such as high elves dark elves lizardmen skaven and the chaos the core event vortex race that tenses up the competition among all factions in the campaign is also fun 2 player online co op is also supported which adds some good amount of replay value and enjoyment to play with friend either in cooperative or against them on a plus if you also own total war warhammer you will have access to the mortal empires aka the grand campaign which has combined map with over 30 starting points no additional chargeconsthe biggest downside so far would be the long loading time of the game however it is completely avoidable if you have the game installed on an ssd on a normal hdd the game takes approximately 1 3 mins per battle loading similarly the game is also hardware resource demanding you might not need a super high end to run it but you will need at least a good one that can handle all the processing to get the pleasureable experience it is a game that will use all the processing power your cpu gpu and even ssd can offer and last thing that i would like to comment is the lack of proper competitive ranked multiplayer mode while this one might not necessarily be a con it s a downgrade comparing to shogun 2 s avatar conquest great game as always from ca especially for warhammer fans only complain so far is that it s so annoying that it has so long loading time is so therefore time consuming game kroq gar a screenshot of total war warhammer ii by defense of the votex a screenshot of total war warhammer ii by big boss and his army a screenshot of total war warhammer ii by
