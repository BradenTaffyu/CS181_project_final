2021 it makes me want to scream my entire face off sometimes sometimes i get up and walk around when i die in a stupid way i say to myself this isn t even fun i painfully laugh in the glow of my screen and whimper i think i m done with this i look up at the monitor thinking the game will respond in some way it doesn t the menu stares back at me with no indication of life it s just here it s here whether or not i play it even if i uninstall it it s just here patiently waiting for me to come back
