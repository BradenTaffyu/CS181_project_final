2019 i love everything about this game the art the music the characters the gameplay just everything so many things to do in this game yet the game lets you explore its beauty on your own pace there s no right or wrong choices in this game just keep being you do what you like and enjoy the game i just tried co op with a friend lately it s twice the fun the only cons is that sometimes it s hard to connect with your friend s farm if i was lucky enough i could connect just in a first try but sometimes it took up to 30 mins just to connect keep trying to join the farm restarting the game steam pc router etc but still it s worth it fortunately if it s connected successfully we could play co op like 5 hours straight without any issue maybe it s only happened to me idk the best farm simulator i ve played so far 10 10 even with the connection issue xdp s really wish that concernedape will fix this problem in the near future tho
