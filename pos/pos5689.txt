2021 early access review this game is good and enjoyable to play however please fix the ai pathfinding for sieges the ai just don t know how to use ladders and siege equipment to breach the walls they also can t figure out to rush the main gate when it is down causing heavy losses on your side when there shouldn t have been super frustrating to lose 300 men because you men can t get up ladders fast enough or at all to help support the fight please fix this problem i know you can do it
