some of the mechanics are not what you d call intuitive the combat is janky af and despite the recent 1 0 release make no mistake what you are playing is very much a decade old game but get used to all that and you have a very fun game i ve played a lot in the survival crafting genre i was a latecomer to 7 days to die and it has quickly become one of my favorites it s fun to play as a squad with a few buddies the options are very customizable and there are a lot of good mods available most of which are installed simply by dropping the file into the mod folder i highly recommend this game to anyone who likes zombies and base building
