2018 i get why some people are unhappy with the way this game went in 2 0 it went from a fast paced game where you didn t have to think about much at all and could just roleplay however you wanted to a much more calculated and deliberate strategy game there s still plenty of room to roleplay as your fantasy galactic empire but now the early stages of the game are much more meaningful in the old stellaris it all boiled down to two things grab as much territory as you could early game and then turtle up until you had all the tech fleets were doomstacks all the ships of an empire shoved into one fleet and wars were either you win or game over now the game is much more about strategic decisions fleet composition is more important though there seems to be a bug or two with the new fleet manager i m sure they ll sort it out soon enough there s no more doomstacking as your admirals have command limits just like in hearts of iron this is a great and welcome change to the game as someone who loved the old stellaris i m excited for this fresh take on it and i m really enjoying the new update paradox went above and beyond on this one they took a really big risk obviously by the controversy with this update but in the end i think they made the right call
