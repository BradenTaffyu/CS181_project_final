2016 although a lot of reviews say otherwise i really think this is a stellar hehe game granted it has a lot of flaws however paradox have been communicating with people who have bought they game and have been keeping an eye on the stellaris subreddit to see what bugs and problems people find with the game they have already laid out a plan of patches to arrive towards the end of may and through june that will be focusing on the main problems with the game diplomacy and ai whilst also fixing some major bugs and adding some more things in for qol if you re a fan of sci fi and of games like civ pax imperia or master of orion i am sure you will enjoy this plus the ability to create your favourite race from a video game to the best of your ability and then roleplay as them is really what makes this game great i mean who doesn t want to create the imperium of man from 40k and then proceed to extinguish all alien life in the galaxy for being filthy xenos hell be space hippies for all i care just buy the damn game and i assure you you won t regret it
