2020 this game makes me forget my stupid classmates which is enough for me but it also brings a whole new type of game play to the table the dlc prices are ok and you can get a lot of content out of them i personally recommend utopia and synthetic dawn because the new game play styles and megastructeres world types they add over all this is a great game but i recommend buying while on sale
