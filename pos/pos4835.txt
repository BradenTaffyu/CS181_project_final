2021 this is one of those weird scenarios where i feel like i ll probably need to come back and rewrite the review later on but to put it bluntly while i really dislike the developer and haven t completed the game i also have to admit i ve sunk 70 hours or so already on my first save the game is genuinely enjoyable from an exploration collecting and wasteland aspect i just can t comment on the main story or missionlines because i ve done almost none of them so what does that say really i guess that the game is good i definitely got my money s worth in time spent alone the level up system is super shallow and a downgrade from previous experiences i feel like it really muddies build variation but aside from that the game doesn t crash nearly as much as any other bethesda title i ve played there are no game breaking bugs i ve encountered and i m still playing so long story short yes i recommend it
