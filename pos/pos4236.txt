2016 mount blade warband is pretty cool i guess you play as you or whatever because you make your own character after deciding your backstory appearance and stats you are sent off to the land of calradia a place split into several kingdoms who all want to punch one another in the face each nation works differently from the other like how the kingdom of swadia usually fights wars so they can get more butter for their king so he can throw feasts that i assume serve nothing but butter maybe he s a fried butter fan i don t know because of this each of the nations excels and suffers in the war department swadia who are masters of getting guys on horses and smashing them into people but don t ask them to hit anything with a crossbow vaegirs smelly mountain men who like to hit things with arrows but go down against calvary in an almost loony toons like way nords not vikings who prefer to chase down horsemen on foot and swing axes at them rhodok no you come to them khergit not mongol huns that would rather drive by you 187 represent ride or die mother and who could forget the sarranids i m not sure what they do actually i don t even think i spelled their name right they do have camels though when your character gains enough influence they can join one of these nations and fight as a lord or mercenary gaining more prestige and having all the castles and towns you conquer get handed over to lords who didn t do anything while your fat king eats more butter the game itself plays rather interestingly you have two modes the overworld and actual battles in the overworld you do most of your management stuff you take quests recruit new units for your army travel from place to place start a trade empire light bags of poo on fire and leave it on people s front door etc the game is surprisingly open in what you can do as a character you can join a nation sure or you could build a trade empire across all of calradia and do a little bit of war profiteering or you could become a bandit king and pillage across the lands taking advantage of war stricken people or you can even say screw it and build an empire yourself a difficult but rewarding option as you take calradia for yourself but how do you go about doing this when you actually have to fight in mountain blade you don t control an army rts style you control a commander who controls an army you play from a third or first person perspective and have to do some fighting yourself or you can sit back and let your elite archers do all the work what do i care i m not your dad i don t have to tell you how to play you have three options in a fight an attack which direction is based on where your mouse is pointing or what directional key your holding a block that is either a directional based parry or just all around with the use of a shield and a kick to break enemy guards and kick them off ladders like the stinky invaders they are you can also use projectile weapons such as throwing rocks javelins bows crossbows etc this works like a tps or fps game where you have to aim manually and hopefully hit them in the head you can hit them in other places sure but whats the fun in that it would be a rather simple system if every battle wasn t a complete cluster you bring your armies into battle with you and battles can get rather chaotic especially if you modded the game and increased the maximum units in battle at once this leads to a hectic and brutal experience that a lot of games fail to capture you re in the thick of it another soldier on the battlefield screams of battle arrows flying overhead corpses piling up you and others get covered in blood you actually feel like you re part of a battle instead of just this overwhelming force like in dynasty warriors or similar games oh yeah the mods oh man the mods mountie s blade has an amazingly active modding community you know those guys that go when are insert developers here going to make a insert war here game well the mount and blade modders don t ask that they just make them themselves so far the mods i ve played between both warband and the original include roman empire the greek persian war american frontier in 1886 star wars lord of the rings warhammer sengoku jidai japan medieval england medieval europe homebrew fantasy settings and even napoleanic wars just to name a few i have a lot of respect for the modding community for these games the amount of extra content they produce means you have hundreds of more hours between those and the base game sure some of them suck but the good ones usually outnumber the bad in massive volumes but should you play mounts the blade battleguys yeah well okay uh i ve actually been following the development of mount and blade since the original was still in it s early alpha state and only swadia and vaegirs existed it s an interesting little game turned power house with the help of some passionate devs and dedicated modders warbands is basically the definitive edition of the game but you ve already bought and played it since it s been out for years and i just kind of wanted to review it but if you somehow haven t played this game then you probably should calradia is a strangely fascinating world and each playthrough can be completely different not to mention all the work the modders do mentos and bleach fightclub gets 9 unruly men with swords out of a possible 6 cherophobia is the fear of fun the curator
