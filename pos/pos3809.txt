2022 wow what an adventure its unbelievable that such a tiny studio could make something as good if not better than ogre battle 64 if you were like me and hanging out for 20 years for the next ogre battle 64 game do yourself a favour and buy this game now minor critique that stage where you only control 1 unit each felt annoying and unnecessary imo
