2016 i love the graphics i love the gameplay i love the new units and the new touch tot he total war series but i hate hate absolutely hate the warriors of chaos they are just soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo op it s rediculous you can have the numbers the exp the highground and the better equiped hero and it just won t make a single difference you will get crushed they will take your income by torching your cities they will never stop coming and the most frustrating thing is the complete lack of rocognition of this from the other factions in the game they can be stupid strong it s understandable but why why is the empire more focused on fighting me when their capitol is being sieged by chaos please work on that otherwise sweet game
