2016 in truth i wasn t sure what to expect from stellaris i ve played rts games such as company of heroes and turn based games such as the civilisation series before and somehow this game manages to merge the best of both worlds it does this by combining the real time though pausable orders system with a massively in depth command and control element not to mention the massive technology research trees that go from usuing simple thrusters on your ships to navigate your system to ftl drives for inter galaxy travel this game takes a while to get into but it does have an optional tutorial system built in that will explain what each screen does and introduce you to many of the deeply involving facets of the game its by no means an easy game to get into you aren t going to be taking over the galaxy within the first 10 minutes but if you can afford to put time into a game such as this i feel you ll find it deeply rewarding i ve only spent 5hrs with it so far and i certainly enjoy it pros widely customisable you can not only crate your own faction and name it what you like but you can also set traits that will affect how other space faring civilisations view you whether it be as a xenophobic human military dictatorship my current build or as a plant based pacifist race you are also able to customise and design your own ships using technology you research to outfit them with the fastest engines and most powerful weaponry huge scope starting a new game allows you to determine the size of the galaxy as well as many other options the galaxy my current game has currentlyt holds 1000 star systems with each system holding on average 5 or 6 planetary bodies some habitiable some only useful for their resources cons only worth getting if you can afford to sink a lot of time into i m 5 hours in and am barely scratching the surface as i said above its a slow game to get into but i feel it is becoming a rather rewarding experience 10 10 not a game for everyone as many prefer the faster pace offered by other genres but if you re a strategy fan then words cannot convey how much i recommend this game
