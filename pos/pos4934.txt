2016 just pointing a few points that i liked or disliked the sound is great full voice dialogues great music and sound effects it has some beautiful moments watching them along with high resolution graphics was enjoyable large amount of options to make your character s face good variety of weapons interesting followers the building and crafting system is interesting at the beginning but it gets boring quickly some people enjoyed building stuff etc but i find it useless in a fallout game the perks list feels messy i would prefer a more simple list the game has some major bugs and graphic glitches you have to save a lot or have some console commands ready to use as you may stuck in areas or quests and not be able to continue the main story felt interesting only towards the end before you choose which faction to continue with i still miss the old fallout isometric view and gameplay however even with so many changes the latest fallout series are still fallout and they still bring the war never changes feeling
