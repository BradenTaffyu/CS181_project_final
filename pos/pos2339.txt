2023 this game has its ups and downs to be honest this game is probably my first time playing a live service online fallout game together with other players instead of the usual single player experience the following review would be more like my own bits and pieces of thoughts about this game and my experience so far playing it on the social side you might encounter other nice wholesome players or you might also encounter some annoying kids or raging guys shouting with their mics depending on your luck sometimes even in chinese there are co op like public events where you do missions with other players also i like the new creatures cryptids added in fallout 76 the scorch beast grafton monster sheepsquatch etc aside from the iconic deathclaw still ferocious and cool by the way perks system vats and c a m p settlement building work differently in fallout 76 so it might take some getting used to on a positive note new power armors and weapons are added too some cool new c a m p basically your personal settlement items etc fast travel costs caps now by the way there are exceptions though i joined this game 5 years after its initial launch and i find it acceptable so yeah i d recommend buying it on sales or go for it if you re a long time fallout franchise fan i bought it from humble bundle and my play time alone with this game already made the entire bundle worth it and more
