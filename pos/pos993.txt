early access review after 400 game hours i survived until winter at least i learned the following real life lessons tomorrow will be an another day know your limits don t get ambitious the term too late is real no you are hungry tired anxious and injured leave those 3 zombies alone a game where there is one outcome lose a game where the zombies are just minor enemies the ultimate boss is your weakness your bad decision a game where you can see hordes a game where you spend 400 hours and still have no clue how to handle a gun a game where you neglect a flat tire and die i love it all the rage quits invite me for an another game where you will be 0 05 better than yesterday
