2023 i was very sceptical about this game i own almost every racing sim on the market and wasnt really sure which one would be my favorite and my go to sim overall always been more of the rally type gamer like dr2 0 and wrc generations after trying iracing i finally found the best road racing sim for me like i mentioned before i was very sceptical monthly subscription paying for cars and tracks outdated graphics this whole concept didnt seem to be very appealing to me but i wanted a sim with a good mp system and serious racing so here i am first bought a subscription for a month one week later i bought the year subscription and cars and tracks for 90 to really begin with after i left rookie class this is some serious racing in the time i played so far everyone is driving fair no ones trying to ram you pretty adult community which i really like that big paywall might be the reason the community is so nice because everyone paid for driving good races and no one is playing to spoil your fun also it has the best mp system i encountered so far you wont get graphics like in acc or ams2 as i am only driving in vr i couldnt care less graphics are not ugly and absolutely good enough to get you immersed and i got many other things to worry about when im driving im driving with a pretty beastly simrig the forcefeedback is awesome feeling pretty much everything i need to feel but it did take some time to set it up properly so you will be spending some time getting your settings right but sim players are used to it i guess havent played a racing sim where it didnt take some hours to set everything up in a way you feel comfortable with in conclusion if youre more into casual racing this isnt the game for you if you dont want to spent a lot of money stay far away from this game it will get really expensive compared to other games in this genre or compared to other games in general but if youre looking for serious races with a community that is looking for the same thing that will also help you with tips while youre just a beginner look no further to me this is the best racing sim on the market there is no looking back other sims became irrelevant after playing this oh and buy it over the homepage from iracing dont buy on steam you can then generate a key for steam afterwards you will get some nice discounts you wont get from steam
