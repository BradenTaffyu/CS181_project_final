2019 it s not fallout 1 2 3 or nv but it s still pretty good voice acting is absolutely amazing and graphics aren t too shabby the story itself has a pretty good twist and the lore is very well integrated my only complaint is the wiffle batting which i will warn you has the potential to scale endlessly when you reach level 100 and beyond because companions respond differently to different situations and choices the player can make there is plenty of replay value i ve spent thousands of hours in this game and still enjoy it just be wary of creation club and if you want to mod the game play it offline updates will screw you over
