2023 i usually do not write any reviews for games but with all the bs that is going on right now concerning ca and pharao i really want to help ohter players to decide whether the game is worth it or not i played a lot of tw in my life starting with med2 and than rom 2 the warhammer franchise i also play the tabletop game since 2008 3k the two saga games and now pharao and yes i consider myself someone who is eagerly waiting for med3 or rome 3 i can honastly say that the game is not worth the 60 but its not as far of as many say the pros you can customize a lot in the campaign army size 10 15 20 units passively making garrisons stronger which i really like ai aggression strenght of the sea people late game crisis from strong to weak and not at all you can tweak the diplomacy random start positions and sooooo much more i now want to see the listed customization options in every tw game and i really really like playing around with all the options despite all the negative reviews i do not find the map to small i think its ok not great and i will enjoy any dlcs that addn some areas if you like the setting which i do yes med3 would be better blabla this game is for you because the atmosphere is there a lot of new campaign mechanics that i enjoy a court system similar to 3k worhsipping gods better than in troy ambitions to choose from campaign events civil war etc if games within a game are not your cup of tea than this becomes a con but i really like them neutral the game throws a lot of midifiers for specific unsits and situations at you i really enjoy dealing with this if you do not than its probably a problem the outpost system is really a great idea but somewhat to simplified and needs to be expanded in the futureno warhammer like army diversification with mythical and or fantasy units i do not have a problem with that but maybe you have the troy ressource system which i absolutely love but you may find it worse than warhammerthe battles fell engaging and more close combat focussed with the known ai issues tw has at the moment yet you basically only have close combat ranged and chariot units to choose fromthe cons the factions feel somewhat similar at a certain point in the game some of the new mechanics are not that well balanced which in my opinion can be fixed and is not that big of a deal unit diversity
