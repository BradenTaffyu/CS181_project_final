after hesitating on the initial release i finally took a chance and i m fairly happy with the release certainly it s not a complete game and comparing to cs 1 is unfair since the previous iteration had nearly a decade to expand and continue development the skeleton is solid and despite some nuisance bugs i find that the game offers the same problem solving challenges that made the previous game so enjoyable with significantly improved road building i definitely want more from this game and i m eager to see what comes next but as far as i can tell the only real problem with development is that it s not happening as fast as people want if you are looking for a fully developed game with a wide diversity of buildings and add ons come back some time later if you want to support the growth of a new platform with potential to offer so much more make the investment regarding recent anger there is clearly a lot of anger in the community which seems to be a growing issue with steam in general more and more releases have been garnering hostile reviews and calling for all or nothing solutions all i can assume is that people are growing tired of buggy early releases and dropped projects it s a difficult environment for developers right now and everyone is experiencing a change in player behavior with paradox and colossal order now being fairly well known players in the gaming world perhaps they are experiencing growing pains and the kind of leeway that players gave to youthful smaller studios is no longer something co and paradox can expect maybe people are making comparisons to larger studios that have also put out lacking titles for increasing prices we have already seen inflation in gaming as new titles on playstation have increased from 50 60 to 70 yet games like cyberpunk 2077 the day before assassin s creed valhalla starfield and other major titles have left a bad taste in people s mouths to the teams behind colossal and paradox i find the game to be fun and engaging and i am excited to see what comes next please don t be discouraged by the public sentiment and know that there are players willing to keep the love going keep it up
