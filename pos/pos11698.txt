2019 early access review alpha 18 fixes many issues and introduces lots of great stuff highly recommend to check it out again if you do not own it already this is for you if you do like sandbox games and have some friends the greatest pro is the completely destroyable voxelbased world and in there you can do whatever you like crafting building farming mining exploring looting everything you do gets rewarded so that you can level your character and develop new skills to survive in the harsh enviroment infested with zombies the start might be a bit rough and still some things feel clunky and unoptimised but the core mechanics work nice there are pvp and pve servers or you set up a server or a peertopeergame just with your friends you also can play singleplayer but for me the fun is to specialize in different jobs and work together to survive
