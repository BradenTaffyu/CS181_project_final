2019 it s a high quality remake of theme hospital as far as tycoon games go it s fairly easy but the gameplay is interesting enough i find it relaxing to play the background music is made to be like a radio station with silly announcers funny fake ads and the music itself is good the dlc is also content rich and worth the money i ve been playing it on and off for months and still having fun
