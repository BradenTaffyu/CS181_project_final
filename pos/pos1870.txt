2022 swtor is a really good game imo it has a ton of customisation story lines and options for your play style i have played this game for god knows how long and when it came to steam as a free to play i hopped back on pros it has an incredible amount of content for each story line even if you re not planning to subscribe you still get access to 8 class stories who take anywhere from 15 to 100 hours each depending on how fast you go through them then there s the usual mmorpg content 4 man dungeons 16 man raids and world bosses all with different difficulty levels which imo is kinda meh it has good quality writing and storytelling throughout the story in this game is amazing and stands far above most other mmos i ve played whoever you are you ll find a story that suits your style and despite its age it has a really immersive world with amazing music and great graphics cons the problem with the game is with the payment model it s free to play which means you guessed it ea are trying there hardest for all they re worth to make you buy the most ridiculous things it is like they made a list of every single way they could get money out of you for example a bunch of customisation which look hideous and outright stupid anyways the new major updates really confuse me with who they are trying to appeal to the only things you really get is one hour of new content a bunch of bugs ea removing features just so they could ruin our days is it still worth it too play definitely yes even with the weird confusing and annoying cons i ve been playing this for many years and i have been enjoying my time but deciding on your play style you might like or dislike this game everyone is different for example some people really hate long repetitive tasks which is me while some like them this is maybe one of the best mmos out there but that does not mean it is perfect in every way if you like star wars and a decent storyline you will love this game or maybe not even after finishing the 8 class stories there are ways to play those stories differently on a second run which imo makes this a great game tips tricks 1 if you subscribe once you get all current content permanently and that is a lot of content after you do so if it s only the access to content you re after you no longer need to keep subscribing 2 add the security key app to your phone and connect it to your account you get 100 free cartel coins cash shop currency every single month that is a big deal it adds up quickly you will not regret it 3 when you first make a new character press y make a legacy give yourself a last name for all your characters do it asap because you ll want to level it up it is really really important 4 these are codes for special mounts that you should get as early as possible they aren t ref codes nycantina16swcelebration17swcantina17nycantina19
