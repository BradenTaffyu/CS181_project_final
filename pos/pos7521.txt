i have been computer gaming since 1978 essex uni mud and have never once had a desire to play a city builder game the decades have passed and i ve remained steadfastly oblivious to the genre until anno 1800 i admit that the february 2024 steam deal combined with the great looking graphics is what persuaded me to put aside my disinterest and give this game a try i was not disappointed i have been truly floored by the beauty of this game where you spend a great deal of time zoomed out to do 98 of your civilization building and management but taking a moment to zoom in and view the incredible level of detail in this game never fails to disappoint from prisoners mining coal on a prison island to a giant octopus swimming away near the surface of the beautifully rendered ocean i continually find details that impress and delight the game itself is ridiculously absorbing and provides tiny dopamine hits one after another the first day i played this game i bucked a long standing 15 year gaming trend of i ll not play more than a few hours to slap a total of 14 hours in to my newly developing civilization crawling off to my bed at 4 00am with bleary eyes and a chair shaped behind playing with friends is also incredibly satisfying and the cloud save feature works flawlessly this game is a true gem i can t recommend it highly enough stop procrastinating like i did and go buy it
