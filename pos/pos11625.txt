2022 early access review 7 days you ll be playing it after 7 years 85 100to simply put it 7 days to die is one of the best survival horror game i have ever played it s the one i dumped the most hours anyway the way it was designed lets you immerse yourself in its post apocalyptic set hours on end be it exploring looting bashing zombies heads crafting or building the name of the game is sandbox and 7 days delivers graphics sound let s start with the worst 7 days to die isn t your aaa with polished landscapes fully customizable characters and lifelike npcs but it isn t trying to be nor does it need to be imho the quirkiness of the visuals the repeated assets and cliche sounds are part of the magic and i wouldn t change a thing there are sadly a few bugs and frame drops especially in multiplayer when someone decides to dig a hole the size of the london subway system gameplay simple easy to learn not so hard to master the crafting system is deep enough while remaining engaging and attainable you do have to grind to get to a certain point but it doesn t take the lion share of the time building is also pretty amazing and lets you create mind blowing infrastructures without the need of spending 10 years at mit as for the fighting and leveling up you also get a nice n wide skill tree that you can still complete within a realistic time frame maps are huge and you will always have plenty to do with the traders missions you will still need your imagination though if you need the guidance of a storyline this might not be the one for you solo vs multiplayer if like me you have the ability to imagine yourself in a post apocalyptic catastrophe and completely immerse in that setting then you ll spend hours playing solo that is of course until you decide to convince your friends and family to join you or even going alone into a server where you will loose hundreds of hours beware though pvp can be harsh and there are a few bad apples around there but overall the community is pretty nice and you can sill have a blast in pve with endless mods 7 days to die was launched in 2013 in ea and don t get fooled by the alpha it s a complete game with active developers this is definitely one i will be getting back to from time to time
