2015 early access review a zombie survival game that offers everything that it should graphics are but has a great gameplay i ve been playing since alpha 6 graphics have improved a lot from back then and hopefully it gets better you can dig everywhere like minecraft construct a cool underground base or take over an abandoned house and be as creative as you can with your builds it has single player and multi player note there s no story mode just you surviving alone or do coop with your mates famhas nice devs takes time to come out with new updates but when they do it s worth it visit their site if you want to know more about the game i recommend this game why because its really cool and worth the money
