2018 it s expensive realistic almost to a fault and the only way to actually race competent opponents under real conditions in a videogame you don t matchmake into a lobby where someone decides what cars you re racing on what track and just deal with it you turn up for your 9pm race that runs every night you run qualifying laps to get your place in the grid you race when your tires are hot and you actually use pit stop strategy i ve never played a racing game that actually chalenges you and tracks you getting better over time like this note you don t need a racing wheel i climbed the ranks on a 360 pad just fine until i was ready iracing has a subscription fee of 9 bucks a month it s really just to keep people who aren t serious out and it includes a mountain of tracks and cars buy an account on the website not steam it generates a steam key so you can add it to your library but iracing is launched from the website and all your stats and car customisation lives in that website iracing accounts publicly show the real full name you gave at signup i strongly encourage you to use a funny fake name update 100 hours later 1 with regards to what i said about real name use they pluck your real name off the credit card you sign up with on the site but emailing support can get you a name change as it did for a buddy and me you really get what you pay for in the support dept 2 if you re thinking about buying a wheel get a g29 on sale and apply the 5 mods from amstudios youtube channel everyone needs to know this do not pay 600 dollars for a video game wheel just buy a real one and make a simple wheel adapter to plug it in to your g29 bless up and happy racing
