2021 boi i don t even know where to start this game was trash like real trash all the bugs no npcs bethesda up etcbut i m impressed of what i have seen the last week when i bought the game with 2 friends we decided to give this game a try after 2 years and holy has the game improved it did a no man s sky and the game is just pretty damn good there are now npc humans with storylines the game isnt as buggy as it was there is a lot of content and by that i mean that there s a lot of content like for real walk 30 minutes in a straight line in a big ass fallout map with multiple biomes and get like 30 missions which are either events small missions side missions or storyline missions also i gotta say that i m impressed with the community in this game i never expected nice people in such a type of game i tought it was like a rust player experience just to find out that almost every high level player we met gave us free things that helped us a lot like stimpacks or some weapons for our level i m at level 27 and i feel like i haven t even explored 1 3 of the map i can easily see get myself to level 100 and put hours and hours in this game and the best thing about this is that i could finally play a fallout game with friends i finally could explore the wastelands with my friends and we had a pretty damn nice and funny experience bethesda thank you for not leaving this game behind you made my fallout with friends dream become true cozyfallout4
