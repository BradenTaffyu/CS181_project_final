2019 this game has ruined strategy games for me the sheer quality of total war warhammer ii is why it s hard to justify playing three kingdoms it s why civ doesn t do it for me anymore it s why as i creep towards 200 in game hours i haven t touched half the content on offer this game has an embarrassment of riches available to the consumer although buying into the full playset can be very expensive the base total war warhammer ii comes with four races the lizardmen skaven and elves both high and dark this alone is a lot of content however if you own tw warhammer i then all of that games races and dlc are playable in a massive 50 hour campaign called mortal empires this is a highly satisfying game mode which ca released for free as the game currently stands just before the huntsman and beast dlc which marks the third small dlc and fifth overall for warhammer ii there are around 20 to 30 legendary lords each representing a faction to embark on the mortal empires campaign there is also the smaller vortex campaign exclusive to warhammer ii factions there is just so much content here for players to enjoys but it does come at a price to buy warhammer i ii and all of the dlc at full price it would cost over 100 now there is over a thousand hours of content in the game but it s a hard ask for someone to put up all at once when buying you have to remember this dlc released for a very popular couple of games over four or five years some packs are worth more than others the prophet and the warlock unlocks some really important units for lizardmen and skaven and isn t bad at 8 the grim and the grave though i could live without those units the curse of the vampire coast unlocks three factions a new race and campaign this is pretty valuable to spice up the game after a lot of time with it however older race packs like beastmen and wood elves struggle to provide value for the cost other than having the race itself my suggestion for someone interested in this game is to buy whii you find a race you re interested in and then buy that lord pack if you like skaven buy prophet and warlock if you like high elves buy the queen and the crone it will add valuable units to your favorite race and new lords then over time add to the game as you want to do other things grab whi and it s dlc when it is very cheap on sale you probably will never actually want to launch the client other than trying out the old world campaign which i hope they revamp and add into wh iii however once you have all the content including the loads of free content then the full playset that is warhammer ii feels like one of the most expansive strategy or board games ever it s enough to keep you busy for endless hours and if you re me possibly make other strategy games seem lesser by compassion one thing i will nitpick is that diplomacy is limited three kingdoms does it much better and i hope that is the something ca brings over when they do tw warhammer iii also turn times are very long like make a cup of coffee between turns long this is something ca also needs to address in the next game
