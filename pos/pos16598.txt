2016 early access review first a quick story tried an end to end sewage run three times unsuccessfully first time i drowned in a septic tank second time the truck got hopeless stuck in a ditch and the third time i thought i had it made when i turned onto the highway right in front of a logging truck which t boned and flipped me my fourth attempt was nothing short of harrowing successfully made three stops got tipsy and won money at the pub slot machine got onto the highway during a rainstorm lost control flipped the truck in the middle of the road all i can do is wait sure enough another logging truck screams up and slams into my truck flipping it back upright i jump back in and am giddy blow the cop stop let them chase me decide better and stop to pay the fine and make it home with zero gas and red lined fatigue all worth it here are my thoughts so far this is the first driving sim that has ever made me use real world driving principles drive defensively not recklessly decelerate for turns stop at all major intersections and look for cars do not drive too fast anywhere it s a hell of a lot of fun to drive in this game i recommend turning off auto clutch unless you simply have no clue how manual transmissions work even so turn it off and see if you can figure it out the game is punshing but it needs to be in order to instill the type of driving skills described above one time i went out on a firewood run way too late in the day and by the time i got to the customer i couldn t see what i was doing and had to give up this just makes you plan your day more intelligently building the car is way too much fun by the time you re done you feel invested i know nothing about cars but playing car mechanic simulator prior to this actually helped me piece the thing together with only occasional glances at websites the first time you peel out of the driveway you re elated it s a rush that s worth the 14 99 by itself troubleshooting and engine tuning adds an even more immersive level once you ve got your baby running there s a bunch of things to tweak to perfect it growing up i used to watch some guys across the street from me around with their cars all day long now i kinda get it so many intuitive and interesting control choices most intuitive award goes to the urination feature with its multi function key simply brilliant only makes it better that the default key is p right now as it s in development i will not post a list of gripes i have them but the enjoyment i ve gained even at this early stage far outweighs any complaints i might have if you like this type of game you won t regret the 14 99
