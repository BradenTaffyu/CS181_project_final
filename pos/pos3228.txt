2020 solaire bro s attempt to review every game in his steam library link to curator page check out my youtube page the nostalgia was strong after my 90 or so hours in divinity original sin 2 not just about the ending mind you about my entire complex journey through rivellon the nostalgia emanates from the game s mishmash of old ideas being given new life and purpose in a modern age when i was initially dropped into the game i had the obvious feelings of baldur s gate and other progenitors from times gone by this is intentional predominantly its turn based tactical combat reminded me of early fallout games with hints of shining force for those of you that go way back the game immediately impresses upon you the importance of knowing your squad s abilities forewords and back and not just in combat the story beats matter as well each character s strengths and weaknesses their overall value will be so entrenched within you by the end that you ll feel like you ve gone to war with them and based on some of the harder difficulty moments you will go to war the story is generic high fantasy especially if you ve played a lot of these games or read a lot of this type of fiction that doesn t mean it s bad there are certain fantasy tropes that stick around for a reason because they re fun and they work a lot of this is reflected in your companions your squad of heroes all have different skillsets personalities and they re all united in taking on a bad guy at some point in the story you ll realize some things aren t how they appear naturally and boom your quest is given a whole new purpose it s fine good even but what really enriches the story is the characters you ll be spending the bulk of your time with characterization is always the key to good fantasy this coupled with the customization that rpgs allow and you have yourself a lot of potential larian does an excellent job of recontextualizing some overdone archetypes by never taking itself too seriously the game spends just as much time being charming and funny as it does being dark and brooding if you re ever having difficulty following or understanding the plot which can be a challenge for a long game with many subplots you can always fall back on the humanity provided in the characters that populate the world while you ll occasionally feel an inevitable disconnect between the characters in your group amongst themselves this is just the way it had to be with a game featuring this many possibilities you ll never feel that between your main character and their mates each team member frequently has new things to say suggestions on how to move forward and requests that they d like you to fulfill and it won t feel like a chore you ll want to fulfill them the game features a lot of side quests duh it s an rpg staple i only mention it here because they re worth praising sometimes it s hard to delineate what s part of the main adventure and what isn t blurring these lines are important and haven t always been treated as such even in 2020 but this is partly because of how difficult it is to achieve the goal is you must make them fun and important they have to be important enough to where the hero could be understandably sidetracked so it doesn t feel like the hero is simply lazy or has screwed up priorities an example for this being done poorly would be fallout 4 once your son is kidnapped in the first 20 minutes why would your character bother doing anything else the game offers it just doesn t make sense it lacks verisimilitude and ultimately sells out by becoming too much well like a video game this is important for those who crave a sense of immersion when completing quests i do particular in rpgs my only real negative deals primarily with the final act i found it to be the weakest portion of the game not from a story telling prospective but from a gameplay standpoint the act features a lot of backtracking and puzzle solving that wasn t always to my taste there was one specific point i remember thinking how was i ever supposed to figure this out without the internet funny enough i found several other players remarking the same sentiment on various forums the difficulty in the puzzle felt similar to old lucas art adventure games in that regard eventually however all puzzles were solved as they were for those games as well the fact of the matter is the internet does exist reasonable people can disagree a few moments that weren t for me are surely to be perfect for someone else divinity original sin 2 is love letter to the rpg genre it improves on the great systems of old and creates its own blend of something new i m sure i count myself among the many when i say that i m looking forward to where this studio goes from here like how i used to look forward to the next bioware game that s unique praise that will ring true for countless rpg fans out there 9 10
