2015 early access review you will not find a better vehicle simulator out there simple as that beware of the cpu requirements you will need a nice multi core cpu to run 2 3 vehicles at the same time i recommend it 11 10 updated review after a year the game has improved so much new vehicles maps tons of optimizations improved physics and overall realism when driving etc etc etc i wish all early acces games would progress like this one
