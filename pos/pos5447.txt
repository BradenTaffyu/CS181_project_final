2018 early access review 10 10 it took 50 hours to understand what the game was about and 400 hours later i m still trying to understand where i sit within the land of qud utterly mind boggling amounts of detail at an otherwise seemingly infinite world if you re like me and yearn to relive the wonder of truly having to learn a game from scratch like i did growing up before the internet was as ingrained as it is give this a go just be warned you re in for a terribly challenging treat
