2018 if you ve been interested in the 4x or rts genres but never could get pulled into them try this game i ve always been fascinated by series like civilization warcraft starcraft command and conquer company of heroes and homeworld i ve tried to force myself into those games because they seem really cool but i m not very good at them and they never hold my interest enough to keep trying and get better now at the time of writing this review i ve spent 7 days playing total war warhammer 2 and doing almost nothing else with my time unlike civilization this game is focused entirely on total war there is diplomacy trading and stuff like that where you play nice with the other factions but it s all in the name of feeding your war machine that narrowing of focus makes it easier to prioritize and not get so overwhelmed with options although there are still a ton of options at almost any given time the rts portion of the game i find is easier to control than a lot of other rtss because there are so many little guys on the battlefield when you zoom way out google total war debug camera it s more like you re controlling blobs of platoons rather than individual units it definitely still took me a little bit to start feeling confident in battles and i m still learning but i ve never been able to really enjoy an rts like this before and it s awesome the fact that total war is basically two games in one 4x and rts means it doesn t feel like you re doing the same thing all the time you re not just staring at a map for hours like in most grand strategy games and you re not on the edge of your seat the whole time frantically selecting units to go help your weak archers who just got flanked in my experience it s about 80 4x and 20 rts because i take a long time to make decisions on the big map since there are so many decisions to make and so many of them feel like the difference between winning or losing one thing to keep in mind though while the in game tutorial is fantastic and gets you well acquainted and comfortable with almost all of the mechanics of the game it doesn t tell you everything little thing you ll need to know so it ll be important to check out some youtube video guides but yeah i recommend this game it s the only 4x or rts that i ve really been able to get into and it s easily the most addicting thing i ve ever played in my entire life thanks for reading
