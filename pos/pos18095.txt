2013 for anyone thinking of buying rome ii on sale after 100 hours rome ii is largely playable right now it runs fine on my 6950 i5 2500k at high settings with aa the game is still easy even on max difficulty however the ai seems largely more active in terms of diplomacy declaring war on you asking for trade agreements asking for help in wars and creates quite large empires in the endgame which are great news overall i d say that this game s best feature is in the variety of units and factions it has a gigantic world map and an unprecedented amount of factions a reasonable amount of which are playable and a new one baktria is on the way this lends some great longevity and entertainment value also the new province system is pretty pleasant to manage altough the simplified building choice is a definite negative point overall the ui is objectively simplified compared to the previous games it s up to you to decide if you like it or not i personally enjoy it the siege ai is awful it doesn t respond to slingers depleting their ammunition at them it also engages in fruitless attempts to climb walls with two isolated units of ladders which get destroyed and then attemps to burn the gates with a few units while their friends stand 50 meters away never seen them use anything else but ladders altough other people have seen it use siege towers and such multiplayer is stripped of depth and most good things introduced in shogun ii are gone it is barebones and the co op desynchronizes frequently some units are too powerful elephants and chariots overall it s an enjoyable game with a ton of flaws graphically it s good with mods and okayish without them i d give it a 7 10 for the singleplayer 3 10 for the multiplayer to clarify this is after 7 patches the game at release was utterly broken hopefully this will help you in your purchase
