2023 for those of us who want to fully immerse ourselves in the game the cost can start to feel overwhelming and that s where the rub is it d be awesome if they could find a way to make the dlc pricing more reasonable paying over a thousand bucks for the complete experience just seems a bit much i m not saying the game isn t worth it trust me it s super entertaining but it d be so much more inclusive and player friendly if the dlc didn t come with such a hefty price tag cause why am i paying 40 for the weather that should ve already been in the base game if they could find a way to make the dlc more affordable i think everyone would be happier and the game would become even more of a hit
