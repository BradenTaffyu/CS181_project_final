2018 early access review tl dr if you can look past the visuals project zomboid is an intriguingly complicated zombie survival game with an emphasis on survival and outmaneuvering rather than facing the zombies head on the game starts in a randomly chosen apartment with minimal equipment next to no character skills and a world full of zombies and houses to loot soon your inventory storage cabinets and shelves are brimming with a myriad of different items some of which are immediately useful and others which will take some time to figure out the games difficulty is highly variable depending on your chosen scenario and difficulty level which most notably affects loot amount number of zombies random events and whether houses have running water and electricity or not the game can feel like a cakewalk at easier levels but it can still catch careless player unaware remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer having aggroed far more zombies than my baseball bat could handle i beelined for my safehouse and locked myself in when i heard the zombies banging on the door i realized the depth of my mistake i had led them directly into my safety area and all of my exits were now blocked by zombies i ate my reserve chocolate and began wading back into the wave of zombies the game has several page tutorial pop up on screen at startup but it doesn t go beyond teaching the basic keybinds and the bare minimum survival skills the rest is left for the player to discover which i found irritating at first but over time grew to like this approach looting houses left me with piles of random items which i had no idea what to do with until i started experimenting and gaining more skills there s still alot new to learn even after 30 hours of playtime and i haven t even touched electronics mechanics fishing or trapping yet there was some things i wish the game would ve told me earlier tho like how you could use spacebar for pushing zombies even while holding a weapon and again spacebar on fallen zombie to curb stomp them to death in order to preserve weapon durability the map is premade so you can eventually learn the entire layout of the world but the item spawns in houses is randomized unless you find a specialized shop or industry building you ll never know what loot you ll find so its essential to be flexible and make the best out of your situation if you cannot find nails anywhere to barricade your house you could try disassembling furniture in the neighbours house and hope you salvage nails from it just remember to check your surroundings first theres nothing worse than getting zombie infection because you had your back turned to the door and the noises had alerted a neaby zombie to your location having learned from my last characters mistakes i picked a two story house as my base and made two escape routes by attaching sheet ropes into opposite upstair windows i had spent days clearing the local street from all zombies and i was raiding the neighbours fridge when i heard a chopper circling the area alarmed i looked out and saw zombies from a mile away all gravitating towards the sound it was far too dangerous to go out so i hid until the sound was gone once i emerged from my temporary safe i saw more zombies than i d ever seen loitering around my base and all over my vegetable garden there was no way i was going to be able to make the area safe before nightfall i had to abandon the area and rebuild elsewhere the game has a skill system and most recipes are locked behind higher levels you learn skills by using them but you can also get a learning multiplier by reading a related training book or if possible watch an educational program on the television this process can be rather slow and can turn some people off if you were looking for a faster paced survival with everything unlocked from the get go personally i don t mind since i ve played games like wurm online and runescape before i m not sure if the game even has an end my longest survivor is only a few in game weeks old the game has player hosted servers but i haven t played much with them myself ideally one day i ll entice my group of friends to play this together on a self hosted server but until then i prefer singleplayer mode in multiplayer you cannot pause if real life calls theres no fast forwarding during nighttime as long as everyone on the server isn t in bed the server will continue to progress the game while you re not playing which might cause problems with farming and i wouldn t like having my hard fought supplies stolen by a random players either latency can cause stuttering teleporting zombies and in general can make combat feel unplayable still i would imagine this game to be absolute blast with a proper server and a good group of friends its good to remember that this game is still in early access and has been for years i bought the game a few weeks back and found a game thats already enjoyably deep and i ve had next to no crashes or bugs so far the biggest issue i ran into is that house roofs aren t actually solid so when i tried going for a walk on the roof off the second floor bedroom i crashlanded into the kitchen breaking both my legs in the process additions and improvements are on the way but no there s no eta for their arrival the game supports modding though and there s a fair few mods to spice things up if vanilla version begins to feel stale for you i personally find the game already enjoyable in its current state and can heartily recommend it to anyone wanting a different slower paced zombie survival game having survived on hardcore difficulty for a while now i knew how to handle myself my top priority in any new area was to leave every door and window open it was pointless trying to stop the zombies it was far more effective to outmaneuver them most of the windows were already smashed by zombies so i cleared the glass shards to protect myself from cuts never run sneak near zombies take short sprints when seen and break line of sight before continuing to sneak behind a corner my new favourite trick was keeping alarm clocks with me on scavenge runs so i could set their alarm timer 10 minutes ahead and attract zombies away from a house so i could loot in peace the best thing is that i still feel like i m only scratching the surface of what is possible in this game and i just want to finish writing this review to play some more
