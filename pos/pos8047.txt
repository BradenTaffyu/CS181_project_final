2018 early access review beamng is by far my favorite racing game if you can call it that for how satifying and realistic the cars feel no contest there a bit glitchy at times but nothing too bad most the glitches come from the complexity of the physics engine so i personally cut them a lot of slack there the detail is incredible literally every aspect of the car is put into the game and then calculated real time as your driving and crashing as you could expect though this is not for a weak computer a powerful cpu and gpu is a requirement for higher frame rate so it is something to take into consideration before buying as for third party stuffs the modding community continues to impress me with new custom cars and it doesn t look to bad visually either unfortunatly there is no multiplayer yet but the sheer fun that can be had alone in this game is amazing 9 5 10 almost perfect if it wasn t for a few forgivable glitches if you own a beefy computer this is a must have even if you think you don t like racing games
