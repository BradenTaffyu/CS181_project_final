2022 fo76 has no idea of its own strengths and weaknesses the game started out with the bold and stupid choice of leaving no living npcs in the world the cool post apocalyptic vibes of the npcs of older games were supposed to be replaced by other player characters who roleplay but there s no text chat bethesda also gave players precious few tools to roleplay with this whole fiasco was retconned and living npcs were added back into the game all good right no this is not some no man s sky story where a flawed game is reborn like a phoenix into something wonderful bethesda decided that after making terrible game design choices from the beginning they would continue to make terrible game design choices they gave people the pitt someplace new and exciting to explore after years of going through the same places this should be great right no instead of allowing people the ability to freely roam and explore the pitt and build c a m p s in this unique wasteland they made it a glorified daily op even worse you have to complete a bunch of daily objectives just to be able to go to the pitt so is this game all bad no for some odd reason i ve fallen in love with this tarnished game i spent nearly 300 hours exploring building c a m p s and having myself a grand time one of the reasons why i have to recommend this game is that modders have fixed many aspects of the game that the developers didn t bother with community modders have added a text chat mod into the game which is fantastic i ve met plenty of fun people this way and they have been very kind to share in end game loot and events if bethesda had one iota of self awareness then they could make fo76 into a much much better game instead they keep building up the worst aspects of their game and leave the great things to rot don t expect a polished fun start to fo76 expect bugs problems and frustration there is a lot of fun for those willing to put up with these problems but you have to manage your expectations i did and maybe you will also fall in a love hate relationship with fo76 like me
