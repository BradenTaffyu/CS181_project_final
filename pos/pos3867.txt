2021 troubleshooter abandoned children is the best srpg i have ever played i love this game so much as of now i have currently completed all the story content in the game and am waiting for more in great anticipation i often see it compared to xcom but as someone who grew up playing final fantasy tactics that game feels a lot closer to in terms of game design it mixes the fft turn system with the xcom cover system in xcom 2 you have a squad of weak people who will die in the slighest mistake with you carefully going through missions and taking on small groups of elites it s a game thats really stressful but feels rewarding when you beat missions in ffta you have 6 people and take on equal sized groups of enemies sometimes a couple more overall a pretty chill relaxing fun game while having a little bit of difficulty to it at times in troubleshooter you will have a small group of elite units who will plow through large amounts of enemies by themselves it s very fun and satisfying to blow up a large squad with just one person or send someone into melee range and have them counter attack everyone to death but it also remains pretty difficult because enemies will start having more and more different kinds of threats for you to deal with and there starts becoming very large amounts of enemies combined with there being a stamina system for characters mid mission which prevents them from using skills nonstop and means they have to take a break to recover their actions at times and there being ways for the enemies to push your turn time back it s very possible to overextend and get overwhelmed this along with characters not having perma death when they are killed means you can afford to make a couple mistakes in some missions and amount a great comeback i remember a mission where i pushed too far forward got overwhelmed and just had 2 people left but managed to make a huge comeback and win the mission against the 50 enemies who were left and the 3 bosses in xcom i would have had to just immediately restart or accept that possibly some of my best members are dead it s still very difficult in parts but its not too stressful and more just a lot of fun even when its being difficult additionally it s very possible to make all your characters hit 100 of the time so you dont have to worry about feeling that you lost entirely to rng which is what xcom can often times feel like for character customisation you will overtime obtain a large cast of characters with different classes and in this game they have the system called masteries which is a much bigger version of fft s character customisation masteries are passive skills you put into your mastery board passive skill tree which give effects like hit chance increased when you hit a bleeding enemy gain attack time when an enemy walks in melee range of you you attack them revive when you are killed etc there is an extremely large amount of masteries and it really lets you customise your characters in personal ways maybe you want this one guy to be a tank but someone else built them as a full dps there are also mastery sets which are combinations of a set of masteries and i found it to be a lot of fun trying to figure out how to best optimise the points i had available to get the most out of all my characters the game has a really long story with many different missions and enemy types for to explore filled with all sorts of cool characters that s told in a visual novel style inbetween missions at first you start out with just your main character and you use the police basic xcom troops but overtime you ll unlock more characters i can definitely see it being a bit boring for some people early on not having a large cast of people to play around with early on but from a story progression standpoint it gives a massive payoff as you get further along the game my only real complaints for the game is that the 3d models are not the greatest i really hope they get updated at some point the bodies are fine but the faces can be pretty rough to look at this game s amazing if you like either fft or xcom then definitely pick it up and you ll have a great time
