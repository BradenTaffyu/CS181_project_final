2014 i highly recommend this game all of my hours played have been in a span of two weeks and i loved every second they say that time flies when you re having fun and i couldn t agree more the game takes place in calradia and there s a ton of factions that you can join swadia ftw the objective is to conquer calradia by taking castles from the enemy you can either aid a faction in conquering calradia help a claimant conquer calradia or you can make your own faction and conquer calradia on your path to the throne you ll have to build your own army from the scratch by recruiting peasants and upgrading them as you progress the graphics aren t the best nor the worst but you really learn to play with it controls could be better but once you learn the mechanics winning becomes a cakewalk i hope this review helped you dux
