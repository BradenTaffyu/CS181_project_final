2021 early access review buy this game stop reading this review and buy the game the thing i love about mount and blade is that it caters to all types of gamers there s strategy an rpg element and real time tactics also some of the armor looks just awesome the best part is you can be literally whoever you want a merchant sure a hardworking blacksmith sure a notorious bandit you bet a ruthless conquerer who destroys his enemies and brings entire civilizations to their knees of course i love this game and hope whomever is reading this enjoys it too
