i have become obsessed with this game the characters the writing the music the animations all are exceptional and help draw you into one of the most compelling settings i ve enjoyed in a video game the gameplay can feel borderline incomprehensible when you first pick it up this is not helped by its misleading tutorial but the first two chapters are hard to mess up even just goofing around as you do the lines start to connect and reveal a system that is as deep as it is satisfying to play what starts as just picking moves of the same colour because they boost each other quickly becomes picking moves that capitalize on damage vulnerabilities or status synergies eventually matching the colours becomes just one small part of the puzzle and the resulting animations and special cinematic ego attacks are a spectacle to behold by canto 3 everything started to click and coincidentally this is where the game starts to throw some serious challenge your way using the knowledge you ve naturally started to intuit over time to overcome these challenges makes for an extremely satisfying experience and soon what was at first flashy animations and half baked strategies becomes a web of synergies and status effects that bring low even the toughest bosses the story is very well paced and flows in a way that puts other visual novel style stories to shame it s quick snappy captivating and everything feels like a small slice of a much bigger breathing world the characters are all flawed and self destructive in ways that sometimes makes them seem irredeemable at first but each one wins you over with a surprising depth and endearing sincerity to them every character feels distinct and fleshed out except meursault who is intentionally a wall begging to be broken through and the villains and powers that be go from strength to strength as your band of hopeless misfits struggle to survive in a hopeless broken world their perseverance and little moments of humanity pull you in and give you a reason to care and make you wish for the best for them seeing this team of dysfunctional weirdos slowly break down their walls and form organic feeling bonds with each other is satisfying and occasionally heartwarming the art style is gorgeous and striking with every character bursting with personality without ever feeling over designed the music needs to be experienced there is nothing i can say to do it justice the big boss fights from canto 3 onwards provide the best music i ve heard in a video game in a long time i highly recommend this game to anyone with even a passing interest in it it is very much one of those special games and it deserves every bit of love that it recieves
