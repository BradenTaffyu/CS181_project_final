2017 first total war game steep learning curve for me and still learning but really enjoying every minute of it very glad mods are supported and are easy to install and use there are some must have mods out there that make the game that much better seems like ca have picked up on some of them and those features are being implmented in warhammer ii more building slots for instance edit most of my reviews don t get much traffic but maybe because of the sale and interested new buyers are checking out the game i only play custom battles and campaign i do not play multiplayer performance is fine on my rig w 4770k 4 2ghz and 980ti sli at 1500 8000mhz resolution is 3440x1440 game is installed on two ssd s in raid 0 loading times are quick load into my campaign in 20 30 seconds 21 9 seems to be supported quite well and i have had no issues there i have had one random crash in 40 hours of gameplay campaign is where its at for me my favorite part of the game there is a lot of content and i can see plaything through with all the different races at least once each race seems to have unique features starting areas units etc that make playing through very rewarding there are all sorts of different army compositions and ways to play the campaign all out destruction diplomacy confederations vassals there are multiple ways to go about ruling the old world battles are epic definitely recommend the camera mods so you can zoom in and out further during the battles there are a lot of mechanics that you need to understand to have a succesful battle after getting my ass handed to me a few times i read some guides and watched some videos so that i could understand the mechanics and actually start to win the game could probably do a bit of a better job explaining some of this the information is all there it just does not really tell you how to decipher it
