2021 early access review when you get into the game you will say omg texture and graphics are bad let me log out and re pay dont we gamers when do we stop judge a game with its graphs maybe never but this time you should stop and take a look you know what the game people were judging all the way is the most amazing game in the game history its minecraft yes looks dirty but gameplay and stuffs are real good this game is just like that amazingly large item variety and survival game is tough if you play hardcore you need to defend your base your farm your friends most likeable about this game is when u build something it can decay over time if zombies hitting even the traps so you have to always upgrade and make it up to date base every day awesome grind mothafaca 3 playing with your friends is amazing bonus buy and let go of prejudice
