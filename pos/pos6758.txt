2016 with its stellar gameplay and presentation euro truck simulator 2 set a new standard for the simulation genre gaming nexus www gamingnexus com better than euro truck simulator worse than actually driving a truck with your own business in which you travel around europe tl dr driving games have never really been my thing in the past the only reason i bought this was because one of my friends was nagging me to buy it when i first played it my first hour was literally crashing everywhere trying to adapt to the controls but the more i played it the more i loved it you can own your own buisness and travel around a huge chunk of europe definitely a must buy give it a chance it s worth it note all of my reviews are laid out in a particular format that fits the game about euro truck simulator 2 is the 2nd game of the euro truck franchise you drive around europe completing deliveries and earning money to manage your own company you can hire drivers to work for you by also completing deliveries around europe you can buy your own truck and design it in anyway you choose make your dream come true but in a video game gameplay the gameplay is pretty simple if you ve played simulation games beforehand there are different modes for controls so for newcomers it shouldn t be too hard to adapt once you re used to handling your truck it can be pretty relaxing the game has tons of real life radio stations for you tune in to your truck pretty much has things a real life truck would have such has headlights indicators and a horn it even has steering wheel controller compatibility there are 8 different camera views so you can drive your truck at different angles an almost basic style gameplay unless you go for the more advanced modes design graphics you don t need a super powerful pc to run the graphics at a high level the developers have done a great job at detailing environments as best as they can some locations are beautiful to drive through where as others are a bit plain and simple the graphics aren t the best i ve seen but they re good enough to show a beauty element to it the graphics settings are easy to navigate should you need to change them ui user interface when looking at some of the screenshots i can see some people being a bit overwhelmed if they haven t played many simulation games before but as i said before you easily adapt as long as you know the controls you don t need to worry about all the things you see around your steering wheel managing your company can be confusing at first but the more you play the more you get used to it pros very realistic huge world to explore beautiful environments different driving styles real life radio stations to listen and relax to cons some parts of the road make no sense e g roundabouts can be confusing for people new to simulator games some environments can be plain and or repetitive final recommendation as many people have said this game is more of an experience you don t have to like simulators to like this you don t have to live driving games to like this if i ever want to play a relaxing game this would be the game i d choose most of the time it provides many hours of enjoyment with plenty of things to do i would definitely give this game a go final verdict 9 10 youtube video euro truck simulator 2 promo trailer views 6 995 259 travel across europe as king of the road a trucker who delivers important cargo across impressive distances with dozens of cities to explore from the uk belgium germany italy the netherlands if you found this review helpful please consider giving it a thumbs up you can also find more reviews over at also check out completing the backlog s curator page here url follow for regular updates on reviews for other games you can also check out my review page here for reading
