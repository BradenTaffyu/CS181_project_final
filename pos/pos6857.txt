2023 many people remember the game truckers a strong russian project from the beginning of 2000 a nice picture and deep gameplay we transport goods from one point to another earn money improve the car later the second part of the game appeared no less cool police bandits a wide fleet of vehicles including cars development of your own company working wipers a key feature of course years passed sometimes themed games appeared but attention on them did not linger for a long time memories of the truckers were on the same level with nostalgia for the corsairs it seems that there are new projects with the same genre and gameplay better more beautiful more interesting but it s still not the same and then suddenly there is euro truck simulator 2 well not quite suddenly the target audience and fans of car games have long been in the know i approach cars strictly on holidays and in the mood but euro truck simulator 2 was intuitively interesting and what can we hide over the past year i have not laughed so much at a single game in a good way everything started well they gave me the choice of a terrible muzzle of a trucker and a preferred brand of trucks it s great to meet trucks in the game that you see on the street and if earlier only man or renault were recognized now you think with delight oh here iveco went i got distracted after the choice they talk about different types of management and give basic training and then they are sent to the expanses of europe to transport goods between cities and countries initially the player is a hired driver transporting cargo on the customer s truck in the future it becomes possible to both buy your own truck thus expanding the possibilities for transportation and open your own company recruit drivers and earn hundreds of millions in theory let s go in order transportation of goods takes place in a fairly calm mode there is a time to which the cargo must be brought but there is nowhere to rush the navigator plots the best route the customizable radio plays your favorite songs outside the window is beautiful european nature other cars rush past the weather changes to rain it gets dark there is a traffic jam in the tunnel and behind it is a railroad crossing running out of gas we go to the gas station the driver begins to yawn we stop at a motel however it is better to rest between transportations sometimes the gameplay is more meditative than in minecraft and then some idiot at a speed of 100 kilometers per hour overtakes in the oncoming lane you immediately somehow come to life or you yourself overtake the truck in front why is it driving so slowly you overtake at night in rain and fog in the opposite lane without slowing down on a winding one lane road and at such moments it becomes fun and dynamic two cars emerge from the fog to meet you make a sharp turn to the side of the road the truck skids you turn the steering wheel in the other direction hit the brakes lightning flashes seems to be alive only a column on the side of the road hooked something clinked from behind and the on board computer lit up red instead of a pleasant blue it s probably all right let s go further the car sometimes stalls but you can live do not give several thousand euros for repairs why so much this is simply not the first unsuccessful overtaking followed by a trip to the side of the road anything can happen there are also more severe cases drivers of small cars imperceptibly approach the dead zone a thud is heard and that s it they arrived accidents however threaten strictly financial costs a fine for an accident will be issued and taken right in the second of the collision conveniently a fine for driving in the opposite lane or driving through a red light is charged according to the same mechanics sometimes it angers when paying for an order of two thousand euros one and a half can be paid for fines and the rest will be written off for damage to the cargo but in case of a serious breakdown the employer pays for the tow truck call yes and having broken his car then you just sit on another one and do not mess with the repair working for yourself is a little more difficult you have to maintain the car yourself look for orders too arriving in a remote city with a valuable cargo you will not necessarily be able to find a new job there on good terms but in addition to the general expenses for accidents and gasoline you need to pay a loan to the bank what else would you use to buy a truck and hire people for myself at this stage i gave the truck to a hired driver he will obviously drive more carefully and he himself returned to third party orders on other people s cars less profit but costs are much lower by doing work the character gains experience points and even upgrades skills most of it is an increase in profits from different types of tasks and the opening of new types but there are also wonderful certificates for transporting acid or explosives with an aggressive driving style it s terribly fun even as an idea also new levels open up improvements for cars and new cars hired drivers also gain levels and can be specialized in a specific area such as transporting fragile items i wanted to make a small note but it turned out to be almost a review despite the fact that i have not delved into the project enough yet perhaps in the long run traveling back and forth will be annoying in the meantime in neat doses very very fun due to funny situations on the road and when it s not fun it s just meditative you look at nature listen to music relax until the first idiot in the oncoming lane
