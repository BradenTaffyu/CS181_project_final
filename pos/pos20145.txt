2016 fallout new vegas is probably the only post 2 fallout game that i would consider to be a legitimately good fallout game instead of just alright fallout 4 or worse fallout 3 it feels more like a sequel to the original games than any of bethesda s work and frankly there are so many improvements from the gameplay to the writing and story that i m too lazy to go into an in depth review of all of it so you can either take my word for it or just go read my fallout 3 review and imagine if there was a game like that except good instead it makes the shooting feel slightly less like it was taken from an amateur s oblivion mod it balances out the perks and makes it generally tougher to become a god the companions actually make you want to travel with them instead of leaving them all in a slumber party at your house and the main storyline actually makes sense this time it s just overall a really great rpg and a great fallout game the dlcs are a little different than most bethesda dlcs in that they all have an overarching storyline going on in the background leading up to the final part the first dlc dead money will probably either be your favorite or your least favorite depending on whether you like being challenged or you re a big whiny baby it s probably my favorite part of the game as a whole and the characters and general atmosphere of it are pretty great especially if you turn on hardcore mode for it which i don t really recommend doing outside of dead money because it s not really that challenging in the main game it s more like a minor inconvenience that occasionally pokes you and tells you to sip some water honest hearts is the next one but you can basically skip it as far as i m concerned you get some cool 45 pistols and tommy guns that you ll never find enough ammo for in the main game and you get to see joshua graham also known as the hanged man from van buren for about 5 minutes or so because the main questline of the dlc is like one hour long and there s not really anything else to do in it it also has barely anything to do with the overarching story old world blues is the next and it s most peoples favorites it has a lot of fun areas to explore that actually have things in them and the overall presentation is pretty funny and entertaining which might be a welcome change of pace because of the dreary nature of the rest of the dlcs lonesome road is the final dlc and while peoples opinions on it tend to vary the lonesome road true faction allegiance mod is pretty much mandatory in my opinion because otherwise you ll spend the whole time getting yelled at for being an ncr dog because you waved good morning to one of them on your way there it s a pretty solid conclusion that solves the mystery of who that guy in the collector s edition playing card set was if i had to complain it d be that lover s lab s selection of sexual mods for new vegas is pretty terrible and you re a lot better off with the elder scrolls games if you re into that it can also be a little slow at the start on additional playthroughs because even though each area presents multiple ways to handle it you will likely see the same few areas in the beginning because of how the map is designed to send you in one of two paths to new vegas the long way that takes you through several areas on your way to new vegas that you re supposed to take or the big manly man way through a chasm full of deathclaws overall buy new vegas
