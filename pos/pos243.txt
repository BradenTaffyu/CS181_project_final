2019 product received for free i made a new friend earlier this year and we found out we had a lot in common including some pretty serious mental health conditions she bought me this game because it helped her get through so much and i am eternally grateful there are so many days i don t think i would have gotten through without this the game is not for everyone but that doesn t mean it s a bad game at all it s relaxing peaceful and helps keep you busy when you need to kill some time there s no real end to the game so you don t have to worry about messing up the patches that are released add a lot to the game and there will be a nice big content patch coming soon on top of that the modding community is wonderful and help expand the game the way you like it overall there are so many things to do and it is just a very special heartfelt game
