2020 sometimes there s more to a game then just being fun to play don t get me wrong that is still the most important thing in a game and the thing that will keep me coming back over and over more than any other nier automata certainly achieves that standard easily but there s so much more to the game than that the short version is it s a true work of art it s a work of art that demands your full attention in order to get the entire experience sure you can hack and slash your way though the main story missions and get the abbreviated version of the story and you will still enjoy nier automata and have a good time but it s in exploring the nooks and crannys of the world in retreading ground you have gone over several times before because of a new side quest in uncovering the deepest secrets of the beautiful desolate landscape that nier automata will really shine the animations are flawless care obviously put into every movement and idle action the music is soul wrenching and poignant adding oceans of emotion to what might otherwise be a misunderstood scene the characters aren t human but in some ways they are the most human of any rpg i ve played they re robots yet they feel anger happiness duty friendship and oh so much sorrow the dialogue there s not much of it but every word means something more than you think at first the story is shorter than a typical rpg but it has layers that will cause you to stare in shock as everything you thought you know about the game is suddenly upended i wish i had played this game when it came out i would have loved to experience it for the first time along with everyone else but i m glad i stumbled across it when i did i have never felt the same way about a game as i have with nier automata it s made me laugh cry and everything in between it s also simply a blast to play if you usually don t play jrpgs make an exception for this one like i did i doubt you ll regret it if i could never play the game again after today i would without hesitation quote 2b in saying the time i was able to spend with you it was like memories of pure light i couldn t put it any better
