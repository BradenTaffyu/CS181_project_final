2019 early access review i would strongly recommend this game provided you know what you re getting into do some research before you pull the trigger the writing is fantastic and quite unique the gameplay is very expressive especially when the medium of turn based roguelike on a grid is considered the world is very cool an anecdote about the expressiveness two characters ago i played a cyborg knight templar who specialized in beheading people with an axe in each hand he would charge into the fray swinging madly and arms and faces would go flying everywhere last character i played a cantankerous geezer whose special talent was to berate enemies while beating them over the head with his walking stick this was not a particularly robust character but he befriended a porcupine centipede and they went on many adventures together all of this said the game is difficult it s roguelike it s unforgiving the audience of players who will enjoy this is very small if you re not in the audience this will be a frustrating waste of time if you re in the audience you will be hard pressed to find a better game i m 105 hours in and i don t devote much time to games anymore it s good stuff
