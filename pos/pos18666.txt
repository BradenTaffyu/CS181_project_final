2014 after playing civilization 5 for quite a long time i have started to become interested in a deeper gameplay with deeper political consequences better religions and more interesting colonize mechanics i couldn t do in civilization of course there are plenty of mods to extend the gameplay for civilization but a new game where everything is new is fresh and exciting so let s shall begin with topics i want to review music most of the times are peaceful songs whistling in the background but the music dynamically changes when going to war with another country which is trying to boost the morale of the player which usually works the weird part about the peaceful songs are that they are somewhat forgettable but will stick to your head so that you may find yourself whistling a tune of a melody a week later dlc s there are many way too many dlc s that did come out for this game luckily they are usually units getting a better design for 2 each so you are not missing out on too much the ones which are more expensive have definitely more going on for example the new dlc conquest of paradise enhances the colonization mechanics which were at the beginning of the game a bit lackluster but more on that later countries the country s themselves are from the year 1444 to 1821 the interesting part about them is that you are absolutely free to choose which date you are going to start that means you can play against revolutionary french as austria or play as portugal to colonize the new world ai the ai has a certain points of intelligence made out of preference there are militaristic diplomatic passive and colonizing leaders for each country with their accurate ruler of that time that is until you start playing and the heirs will be completely different than actual history of course the human player gets treated just like an ai to other ai s if you conquer they will hate you if you don t have any alliances they are going to attack you that s why there s that certain point of risk of alliances with the ai which can make your ai ally to an enemy faster than you might think just never trust them too much ideas the idea system is a way to put more of your own preference into the country that you are playing there are currently 71 unique idea groups for specific country s 18 group ideas for country regions like italy and 8 possible slots for your own idea groups to choose which consist of another 7 ideas that sounds like a lot and it certainly was a pain for the creators but it was well worth it it gives most of the countries just their own specialty but i m not going to go into that sort of stuff colonization the new made colonization concept is a simple but innovative one get exploration ideas colonize more than 5 provinces in a certain region and a colonial vassal gets created the colonial vassal is just like another country but he has to pay taxes and can t attack you you can control these taxes on your own but never set these taxations too high because you know what happened with the usa and great britain at that time independence wars definitely can get a strain on you if you know that you have to travel across the atlantic ocean to fight a war there are certainly way more things i could try talking about but i just want to bore the casuals and try to keep the strategic fans interested especially the fighting mechanics and monarch points but i don t want to tell you everything there is that certain interest i wanted to awake in some people so that they are going to try this game for themselves and not get ultimately bored because i just told them everything of the game for most of the people the price is going to be the main issue with this game 40 certainly is quite a lot in the steam shop but that s why special sales exist if it s getting 50 off i can definitely recommend it the game managed to keep my interest for other 265 hours now and hasn t even bored me a bit so far it s probably a game what you are going to get in touch and love it or try it and hate it i hope i managed to get some peoples interest and if you are still reading this thanks for reading my first proper review it means quite a lot to me mfg artjom
