2022 though having a steep learning curve in terms of game mechanics d os 2 has survived a couple of rage quits on my part and ended up being my favorite rpg of all time and when i say all time i mean almost 25 years of gaming and well established relationships with all the golden classics baldur s gate planetscape witcher etc d os 2 gets a huge part of its unique charm from its grimdark and edgy setting you even start the game as a prisoner in a magic concentration camp ironically called fort joy this endearing facility provides all sorts of torture and suffering for your kind folks who can wield uncanny and evil source magic and as such you are also inevitably a bad person to begin with and your adventures are going to be delightfully ambiguous and morally gray you can play as a custom character or as a character of origin already established in a narrative sense who has a unique worldview perspective and agenda and awesome characters of origin they are very lovable and alive they make an immersion in a game world smooth and easy it is nice to play someone who is not brand new in a game world but rather has a complex history in it i had the hardest justice boner ever while playing as ifan ben mezd and slapping a barrel of death fog right in spoiler s face by the way please please don t play as fane or losa on your first playthrough those are marvelously unique this narrative device kinda reminded me of vtm bloodlines where your game experience was shaped by the starting clan of your choice or about tyranny where you pre shape the game world locking out entire locations and opening others this undoubtedly adds a great amount of replayability to the game especially for all my fellow completionists out there as for the downsides quality of game content starts to dramatically decrease somewhere around the midpoint of the game and if fort joy is the best location in the entire game the last location the ancient city of arx is a sad and unpolished clusterf k and the final battle is just a meh anticlimatic to a point of being stupid makes my heart bleed for all the lost potential this story of one s divinity would have if it has been properly developed and told game ends abruptly leaving you eagerly craving for more of it and it is a huge pain point for me there is no more i have scooped every bit and piece of content during my five full playthroughs and somehow i am still hungry but otherwise it is an astonishing game great core mechanics deep lore beautiful visuals fantastic music and you can rip out people s faces and wear them as masks while playing badass undead lizard wizard or eat pieces of dead flesh for new knowledge as an elf cannibal or just collect dirty undies for your spells yes they are definitely 100 for spells what other rpg would let you do that
