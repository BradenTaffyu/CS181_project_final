2019 it s essentially a complicated lego set strick some bits together and see what it does then try and do rocket science with it there isn t really an end to it the gameplay is a bunch of missions but it s up to you how you get those missions done which is where the fun starts there s career sandbox and science mode to play the game in sandbox is just free for all build whatever science mode requires you to use science instead of currency to progress and career is the standard progressive gameplay there s also scenario and mission player options there s no story just a lot of reports which can be funny the progression comes from unlocking parts of rockets and or planes and being able to go further or higher than before to complete missions that require you to go further or test something in different locations some of the parts look authentic some are made for the game obviously but there are things like a real looking space shuttle and the cockpits capsules and fuselages look very familiar ofc you need to be able to get these things off the ground just because it looks like the real thing doesn t mean it will fly like it and usually means the complete opposite often it is something small that will cause your work of art to launch doing cartwheels the physics are fairly accurate not totally realistic you can do some silly things with abstract vehicles i d say it works the right way most of the time just not in the right proportions in some places like rovers on kerbin act like rovers on the mun very floaty just not as extreme it s pretty educational it will give you an idea of how some stuff works in real life like how they reach other planets and the limitations of rocket propulsion probably a fair amount of physics too such as pivot points center of mass and lift etc the graphics are fairly basic the rockets look nice and most of the effects are cool such as take offs and re entry escape heat build up and the space skybox looks nice but there is very little on the surfaces the space center and runways are the only things on the landscapes except for rocks or trees that are used for scanning missions which are minimal and more common rocks or trees that don t even have collision on mods help with this though mods there is a large mod scene for this game you can add more items a realistic solar system more quests different gameplay and better graphics there are mods to upgrade the landscapes and skyboxes that make it look a lot better some of these are a bit of a faff to install but worth it the community is one of the better ones really friendly and helpful and there s a multitude of guides on reddit and youtube ranging from posted 6 years ago to the last few days almost all of them are still valid too the simulation mechanics don t change so new dlcs or mods don t change how things need to be done it runs fairly badly at times even on a mid high end pc some tweaks maybe needed to get it to run smoothly it s fairly demanding on some resources great game you can sink a lot of hours into this it s one you could go back to in a few years and still enjoy as much there is no age limit there s no politics violence or bad language
