2018 i thoroughly enjoy this game easily one of my favorites even when i think i ve had enough i find another few or more hours of relaxing enjoyment in it it s a slow paced hunting game with a greater focus on the terrain and visuals more than the gunplay or providing a deeply realistic hunting experience it also features a series of missions akin to a story mode that demands nothing of you a romp in the woods with a gun and points for the animals you kill this game is more about the moments you have in it than beating any scores real or imagined featuring an rpg style unlock and levelling system call of the wild will require a decent amount of time to get the full buffet but it s worth every minute this game is a welcome change of pace rather than levels with set goals and a story meant to leave you gripping the seat this is a meditative journey through a massive open world full of secret gullies and unrepeatable moments it s a great experience solo and a wonderful adventure with friends for those interested in reading further i want to address a few things i take umbrage with in many other reviews first off you re not going to get arma iii ballistic simulations in this game i don t understand why that would even be an expectation there are games out there that will give you that heart pounding reaction of calculating all the variables into that perfect last minute shot here you ll find a simple breath mechanic and a little bit of sway that you can decrease in your preferred weapons as you advance in the levelling system i like that shots can be missed and they can be amazing but you won t break a sweat making them the gun play is more about finding what works best for you and on your chosen prey the guns and bows are there for a variety of playstyles and personal preferences not to be an endless arsenal of weapons fitted to a particular situation secondly there s a lot of hate on the dlc the reserves are worth it i got medved taiga just because i love the snow but i was taken on a journey the smaller dlcs are personal preference honestly i think people are greedy about hte extra guns and the tens blinds are a convenience the game doesn t feel like it was designed with them in mind they just make it easier to pick a spot and time and keep coming back to it minute after minute until you get that perfect shot that s a palystyle choice more than anything all the little things that seem like no brainers are made free backpacks new looks and different animal colorations are all free there s a lot of small dlcs which can quickly feel like microtransactions when we re so used to the format call of the wild doesn t make itself a pain without the dlc though there s nothing exploitative in their pricing model if the game is too slow without atvs and custom spawn points than maybe this isn t the game for you the gun packs are also more for playstyle than anything even the dlc species can all be more than effectively hunted with base content a favorite point for those short winded reviews that expect their image of perfection to be the standard to which all media is held is the semi unrealistic and occasionally buggy animal behavior once in a while the weaker deer especially does will just stand there like you pulled up in your honda civic with the high beams on other times an animal will get stuck on terrain or run in circles i ve seen it but it s pretty rare in the grand scheme of things these moments stick in your mind because they re weird funny even and you know they shouldn t happen i ve taken down ecosystems worth of animals in my time with this game and i can count the number of times i ve seen these bugs on my hands and feet if that doesn t satisfy you and you think that it shouldn tt be happening at all i have a couple things for you to think about one nothing s perfect i shouldn t have to point that out but since i doubt that convinces you go pick a bethesda game and see how many copies it sold skyrim got an entire re release because people are still buying it it s a great game and you probably even played it but if bugs are a deal breaker then you should go back and check your double standards the last complaint is the arcade style rules you can shoot anything you see and the only penalties are bad shots and giving up on finding a dead animal heads up it s a video game you want a visceral experience of stalking and taking down a living thing go buy a gun and a deer tag it s disturbingly easy if you live near me and in that we get out of what may be wrong with this game and into everything it does right if you want a true simulator track down a copy of cabela s outdoor adventures 2005 or the old alaska one no one s made a game that committed to the real thing since then this game is not a true simulation but rather an experience it s not about hunting a deer like you would in real life and it s not about the scoreboard hunter call of the wild is a plodding challenge of patience persistence and use of your knowledge it rewards you in smalls bits of xp and unlocks but he real treasure is the stories you take part in the moments you have and the staggering moments of being with yourself i wander this game world without purpose sometimes and even after 200 hours still stumble across secrets that evoke the sense of wodner i felt blowing open the side of a mountain in zelda to find 30 rupees yet this game does not play on nostalgia it feels like i ve grown up and can still find such joy in little moments playing alone is a wondrously steady adventure across a landscape it doesn t make your mind go blank with other games and it doesn t hinge on you getting flashy new rewards i once found myself walking along the shores of a mountain lake in layton district headed towards some cabins i hadn t seen before the graphics were beautiful and i was determined to explroe this little corner of the world and hunt the moose i had just seen running through it then down the trail i saw it a deer white fur mottled brown like a cow i was on the trail instantly determined not to lose track of this amazing find for the better part of the next two hours i trailed this deer all over the map constantly catchign up and losing it yet again i will never forget the pure fun i had the winding path i followed and where i saw its every track where i last gave it a flesh wound before losing it for good like my own moby this was my moment my experience in the game that no one else would ever go through that s what this game brings to the table i m not alone in that i ve seen many a review that describes a simple story of chasing an animal and how fun the short excursion was even if it escaped in the end likewise the multiplayer feels more like a chatroom or a story making game with your friends trophies and the associated bragging rights are more of a social aspect than a victory you try and top your friends because they re your friends not because you need to be the best the story in the missions is always a adventure that pulls you along with a cast of lively characters even though you only ever speak to one this is a heartfelt beautiful and simply fun game it s clear the dvelopers poured their love into it in summary this game was an elightening joy for me maybe it s not your thing but i highly reccomend it you won t find the most cutting edge ai technology here or the greatest fastest gun slinging but the real enjoyment comes from not knowing what you ll find step into a wild world beautiful for its reality and explore finding hidden wonders and sprawling stories like the old days of gaming this game is what you make of it and i think that s something truly special
