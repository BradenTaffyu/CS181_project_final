2020 everyone has expectations when it comes to fallout games whether you ve been a fan since the original game or you found the games after bethesda took over with the third game certain things remain the same you expect a good open world game you expect lots of content lots of quest and lots of atmospheric ambience fallout 76 is really a tale of a game trying to live up to expectations while carving it s own niche and trying to get fallout fans mmo fans and people who just like good games all together under the same roof it should be said fallout 76 is far from perfect a game which fails to live up to it s predecessors name while at the same time being pretty good as a game in it s own right gameplay if you were like me in the previous installments of fallout you were an everyday man someone who was great at everything sneaking melee ranged whatever the case we could do it gone are those days in 76 the special s and perks work slightly differently every level you up to level 50 you gain a special point and a perk or pack of perk cards the special you assign gives you additional points you can use to activate your perk cards so if you have a 12 strength you ll be able to use cards worth up to 12 points perk cards are the normal perks you would have been able to choose from while playing the original game these cards can have a cost of 1 5 points depending on how ranked up the card is all the good stuff is there to dmg with certain weapons reload speeds carryweight reductions etc etc etc oh yeah and lock picking and hacking as well this was kind of where i was a little frustrated the general idea that locking picking and hacking can be locked away requiring cards to use is a little well dumb these are two core mechanics in all the fallout games i d have much rather seen it be based on a skill which you could increase as you picked locks and hacked computers grind the game is a massive grind whether you re grinding to finish up daily challenges or grinding for material to repair your equipment grinding to level up grinding faction or grinding for plans crafting items it seems like you re always grinding something talking about grinding wouldn t be complete if you didn t talk about some of the major obstacles that are set up to prevent you from having the most fun in the game storage or stash space without a subscription to fallout 1st you re stash box is limited to 800 pounds all things considered 800 pounds fills up really fast with the way you re breaking down equipment and storing it to be used in basemaking outpost making and or equipment repair to sum it up before i subscribed to fallout 1st i played a total of about 8 hours and my stashbox was at over 750 pounds that was building materials ammo and a few choice weapons i wanted to hold onto while deciding what path i wanted to take i knew that wasn t going to be nearly enough so i subscribed to fallout 1st fallout 1st gives you access to an unlimited stash box which allows you to stash away all your building and crafting materials while the unlimited space doesn t work for weapons and clothing healing and food items etc etc etc it does give you the ability to not count crafting items which can get quite heavy it also provides you with a tent you can use on the fly which gives access to your unlimited stash box normal stash box cooking fire and most importantly a free fast travel point you can put anywhere while not pay 2 win in and of itself the tent provides a really useful benefit which can t be replicated by any other means outside of paying for a subscription merchants are also limited to 1400 caps per day which are a general pool used between all merchants in the game this is another limiting aspect of the game which maybe or may not be unnecessary with me with in 2 hours of the new cap limit for the day being active i m already at my max by selling purified water and other items which are just taking up space in my inventory this could be an issue or not it depends i could go on an on about the game and it s limitations or gameplay mechanics which are kind of either poorly thought out or down right limiting to the player but i don t have unlimited space or unlimited time so we ll move along to one more issue that needs to be touched on glitches considering it s a beth game you re going to have glitches while generally the glitches in fallout 76 are no where near the size or scope that hits the single player beth games they are there headless enemies enemies spawning under my base and destroying it from the inside out vats which says 95 chance to hit and then trying 6 or 7 times and getting nothing general quest bugs and glitches etc etc etc pro s fun but limited gameplayfallout universe with people albeit nobody who wants to groupepic quest and enemies albeit not clear enough on quest difficulty con svoice communication only no textfinding friends in game to group with can be difficult 100 hours before my first grouplimitations on stash almost forcing someone to subscribe to fallout 1strecommendation in spite of the flaws this game has i found myself playing it for well over 100 hours at this point and enjoying most of my time it s been a great distraction to all the stuff going on in the world but if you go in expecting fallout you ll be slightly disappointed this is like a empty shell of a fallout game lacking things which make the single player game amazing while the graphics and lighting and sounds of a fallout game are there the world is empty of npc s sure a few exist but not nearly enough for an mmo the map is rather small and the game features massive grinds especially for armor repair mats to sum it up i d recommend this game if you re ok with the idea of paying for a subscription and love previous fallout games if you re ok with the fact the game isn t packed with content yet and will likely leave you frustrated at some points
