it almost took me my full 100 hours of playtime to take over the world and it was just too damn difficult near the end like the three remaining kingdoms were nonstop declaring war on me and it got old but the combat and designs of the soldiers were very good it was a very nice improvement on warband i only recommend this game for people who like medieval games
