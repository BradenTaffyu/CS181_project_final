2018 as a uneducated chicken nugget i played fallout 4 first but i see my mistake now i never played any other game in the franchise and i can see why fallout new vegas is regarded as the best in the series the city of sin reborn into the wasteland i love everything about this game from the gambling the factions the neon lights of new vegas and the story the game has to offer even if obsidian reused the models of fallout 3 everything this game has overshadows that i would recommend this to anyone who has never heard of the fallout franchise or even anyone who played fallout 4 and is a uneducated chicken nugget ring a ding ding
