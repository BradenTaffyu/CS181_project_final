i can t with this game it s fun it s frustrating it s simple yet difficult you can shut your mind down and chill while playing yet it proposes a challenge strategy and planning ahead it s a part of my morning ritual now i make a cup of tea and go do daily challenges mentally preparing for the rest of the day honestly one of a kind well done
