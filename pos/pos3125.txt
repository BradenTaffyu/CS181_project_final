2019 let me first start by saying i am not a turn based strategy game player at all but i love rpg games and when i saw this game released it peaked my interest i have to genuinely say this is a great game for me there is a lot of trial and error since this is not the usual type of game i play once i learned the basics and trust me it has taken a long time to learn i began to truly enjoy this game a lot i have not even gotten far in the game and i am enjoying it immensely it can be a bit overwhelming with all the different weapons skills and armor but once you get the basics down it is a very fun game the story has kept my interest and the fighting is top notch the graphics are really great and i have not really encountered bugs so far i do get stuck from time to time just because of the way you move in game and sometimes loose sight of my character behind rocks or buildings that is really the only complaint i have so far update since playing more i have figured out how to move the camera so you don t loose sight of your character or get stuck anymore i am happy i decided to expand my horizons a bit and try this game because the developers have done a fantastic job and it has been a great experience so far so i say if you are interested like i was but not sure give it a try i think the game will surprise you like it surprised me i will update as i progress more in the game so i have been playing for a lot of hours now as you can see and i started a second play through and i am still finding quests and things i never found the first play through the replay ability on this game is really astounding i never got bored and am still not bored after all the hours i have played there are so many different characters and so many different skills to experiment with this game is truly the most fun i have had playing an rpg in a very long time the graphics are great the story is very good your complete freedom in creating your character the way you want all make this game a must play if you are into rpg games you will not regret buying this game it is just fantastic and there are a whole lot of mods if you like to mod that i have not even tried yet
