2022 early access review the game is near perfect i ve had two full runs and i have nothing bad to say about it the pogresson is very satisfying the gaps between research tiers are just right that it s not too fast but also not too slow that it starts to feel tedious the controls are intuitive enough with a lot of shortcuts provided for more convenience blueprints are also provided to make scaling up much easier and the graphics oh my god the graphics the way it renders space travel the solar sails the dyson sphere it s like a vista you can just keep watching because it s absolutely beautiful and even until now i can t stop being amazed at how an indie game manages to render all these details without my computer catching on fire that it can even render thousands of solar said and rockets at the same time is absolutely mind boggling i also didn t encounter a single bug easily the most polished indie early access game i ve played ever since i got it almost a year ago i would ve paid aa prices with how polished and beaitful the game is everything just works
