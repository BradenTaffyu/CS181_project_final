2022 edit they added nerb nord so i guess we all love each other nowi would buy it i would recommend it and i wouldn t mind to not buy it on sale this sim is a game changer brings sim racing to the next level with advanced physics models graphics and the way gt cars handle the road really leaves you speechless you wont want to race on any other sim and you ll forget about racing games and fall in love with racing sims a huge negative our favorite track nurb nord is nowhere to be found and they can add it for practice hotlaps but have not as real sro teams use it for practice training as does the acc team so we should be allowed to have it for the same purpose
