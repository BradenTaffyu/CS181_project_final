2020 greetings from bulgaria i am vulkk or alex and i have been playing swtor since one of its beta stages without breaks and time outs i would like to encourage you to give the game a try with this quick review below while still being honest about the flaws of the game in its elderly age star wars the old republic is now nine years old at the time of this publication the game has an incredible amount of content to offer to a new player the learning curve is not too steep and the stories are all free to enjoy them at your own pace all the way up to level 60 is currently available 100 free of charge you can play all 8 origin class stories to level 50 and continue through the first digital expansions of the game up to level 60 if you enjoy playing casually you could only subscribe for a month to get all of the story content unlocked forever for your account however once you approach the endgame you start feeling the limitations of the f2p model very hard once you find out what it is like to play as a subscriber you may struggle to get back to preferred status player the middle limitation level after your sub expires swtor offers tons of solo content but it shines in the group play especially if you team up with guildies and have a voice chat available be it casual or hardcore raiding pvping exploration conquest everything is more fun with friends in this game play the class stories alone to immerse yourself fully into them then join a guild or play with friends once you find yourself in the endgame grind being a nine years old game swtor struggles to offer continuously fresh and engaging content to some of the hard core fans and veterans of the game i myself have been playing it since beta and have witnessed every single update change bright moments and failures over the years it s a thing to consider but if you are reading this review you are probably wondering if it s worth picking up the game yes absolutely the game engine is a giant issue from the very beginning low fps in group environment such as operations and warzones may be frequent and the graphics of the game in the old content really shows how long it s been since swtor s release bioware is dedicated to updating the old content slowly from time to time enjoy your own star wars saga with fully voiced over cinematic story experience and personal choices that some times lead to real consequences down the line
