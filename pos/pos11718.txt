2019 early access review this game is a rare example of an early access game that wasn t abandoned it s devs are still working on it regularly with large scale updates and bug fixes i m constantly amazed at the amount of people who aren t happy with where it s at and ask for less content or reverts back to previous stages don t let the negative reviews drive you off most of them don t bother learning the mechanics of the game and complain about the difficulty it can be unforgiving and highly rewarding at times my only major criticism is the wiki is hit and miss with information and new players would benefit from a more concrete updated source of information
