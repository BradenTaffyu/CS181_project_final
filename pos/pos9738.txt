2016 early access review takuya wasn t anything special he spent his days troubled and mostly upset his outlook on life being rather bleak the other colonists didn t really get on with takuya oftentimes picking on him and mocking his clothes when not working on his favorite hobby gardening he would often be wandering around taking in nature he was also fond of the dog freud takuya struggled with mental health on one occasion he simply lost all faith abandoning his clothes and food and taking to wandering the fields at night the others didn t really pay it any mind takuya decided to start making sculptures after he regained his sanity although not of the highest quality they were admirable he named them after his fellow colonists in the hope that he might make them happier about his existence he managed the gardens for some time keeping the crops and flowers in best condition no one was ever without food when takuya was there one night the colony was set upon by brigands being chased across the land a criminal had arrived seeking asylum with a raiding party at his heels takuya propsed to let him in so they did much fighting ensued many blows were dealt much of the base was damaged by fire and the battle ravaged into the early morning by breakfast the field was littered with corpses takuya never finished his last grand statue the gardens which he once tended so dearly lay neglected overgrown in the corner of a fertile field where takuya used to visit so often stands a quiet unmarked grave the grave of the lonely gardener who never found his place i never in my wildest dreams thought that a game like this could have such an impact i often scoffed at survival games assuming that they could never leave a meaningful impression i ll never make that mistake again
