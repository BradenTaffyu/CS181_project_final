coming from someone who never really saw an appeal to mmo or mmorpg games i absolutely adore this game if you are a big star wars fan and are willing to try something different i highly recommend this game the 8 base game class stories range from alright to excellent with even the alright ones easily outclassing modern star wars media best part is that these stories are all untouched by disney they re all well voiced acted and make you feel like a badass regardless of your class subscription is optional and not required for all 8 class stories and first 2 expansions and if you do decide to purchase it then you ll have all the other dlcs unlocked permanently though i will admit in order to look really cool you will have to spend some money current late game content is unfortunately rather lackluster compared to the base game and first 4 story dlcs but it will be quite a long time until you reach that point i only wish i could get my friends to enjoy this game as much as i do
