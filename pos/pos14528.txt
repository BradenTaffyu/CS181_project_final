2016 civilization 6 is the successor of perhaps the finest historical simulation game in well history not counting beyond earth here does it live up to its former glory minus be definitely will you still catch the one more turn syndrome of course is it worth 60 for the base game depends is it worth 80 for the base game 4 future dlcs yes civ 6 takes much of civ 5 dlcs and adds several new and fun features to it every civ 5 fan will enjoy this game once they have adapted to its different art style having said that the base civ 6 game still feels slightly lacking compared to civ 5 dlcs but that is because civ 6 does not have dlcs yet if you were to compare the base game of civ 6 to the base game of civ 5 there is no comparison civ 6 is simply on another level of greatness but as with civ 5 the upcoming dlcs for civ 6 will improve the game dramatically i sincerely hope therefore if you are interested in this game buy the deluxe edition even if you don t plan on playing the game until dlcs are out as you are getting 4 future dlcs for just 20 more which does save you some money the base civ 6 game might not be as polished as civ 5 dlcs but civ 6 with its own dlcs will definitely be some negatives about civ 6 compared to civ 5 will add more when i get the chance a lot of customization options are currently missing when setting up your game such as the lack of maps to select from only 5 shuffle compared to civ 5 s dozens ability to add remove city states from the game the map artstyle will take some time to get used to especially the fog of war overall recommending in hope that civ 6 dlcs are as awesome as civ 5 dlcs
