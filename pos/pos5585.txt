2022 early access review the game works but it s still a bit shallow the previous games were just as good this one brings new graphics and a few ease of life improvements the big limiting factor of the previous games was the lack of unique interactions and this still feels very limited most conversations have no purpose and often have nothing to say i still like the game and i still play it but i m not blind to its short comings
