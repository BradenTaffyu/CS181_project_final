2018 i mainly play euro truck simulator when i ve got nothing to do just throw in some of your own music and drive it s got graphics that have aged pretty well and realistic sounds but if they don t satisfy you the community has it backed up with graphics mods and sound mods all of which can be downloaded off of the workshop the multiplayer mod which i assume anyone who got this game has installed does make you feel less lonely since you do have actual people driving around but it does result in massive traffic jams still i do recommend this game as a time passer
