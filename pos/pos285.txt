2016 live out the farming life you ve secretly always wanted stardew valley is a farming and social simulator developed by concernedape in stardew you decide to quit your boring job in the city to move out to a farm you recently inherited from you grandfather just outside pelican town the farm has been overrun by nature after it being left empty and unloved for many years your job is to turn it around and start making money out of it you re not alone in pelican town and you ll meet many of the townspeople in the first few days pelican town rarely sees new people moving in so it s a big deal when you turn up i ve never played any of the games stardew is compared to harvest moon and the like and so i took a bit of a gamble when i bought this game thankfully i was not disappointed and after playing twenty five hours in just four days with no sign of stopping anytime soon i couldn t be happier with this game the game does throw you in at the deep end though so the official wiki is probably going to be your new best friend visuals of the game are similar to terraria and starbound but that s where the similarities stop anyway it s a great looking game if you re a fan of pixel graphics but even if you re not you shouldn t write the game off everything in the game is well designed and fits in nicely with the style it s also a very colourful game making all the nicer to look at so as you d imagine the main gameplay comes from farming each of the four seasons which consist of twenty eight days each see a wide variety of different crops and flowers available for you to grow and you ll be planting most of your crop at the beginning of the season some crops like parsnips or melons can only be harvested once before you ll need to plant them with new seeds while others such as corn and cranberries will continue to produce fruit vegetables for the rest of the season once the season ends crops specific to that season will die and you ll have to clear them away before planting new crops you will want to plant a variety of crops mainly for the community center bundles more on that later but it s worth remembering that the more expensive the seeds are the more valuable the end product will be there are also fertilizers you can use before planting your crops which will increase the chance of high quality crops you have basic silver star more valuable and gold star crops considerably more valuable as well as fertilizer that increases growth speed it doesn t end with planting them though you ll need to look after your crops by watering them each day unless it s raining in which case you don t need to as well as building scarecrows to keep crows away you can also harvest or make artisan goods such as honey or maple syrup which is done through special machines that you ll need to unlock and then build unlocks come with levelling up your five skills every time you increase a skill skills are increased by simply using the skill so for example your fishing skill is increased by fishing you ll unlock new machines to build as well as increase your proficiency in that skill once you hit level five and level ten instead of unlocking something to build you choose a profession which will boost a certain area of that skill such as 10 faster crop growth for farming or 1 ore per vein for mining speaking of mining there are other things to do in stardew mining fishing and foraging are the main alternatives to farming but there s also social things to do as well as restoring the community center the first three are pretty self explanatory but i ll briefly talk about fishing fishing is the main part of the game argued about in the forums personally i really like the fishing mini game but many don t it consists of trying to keep a green bar behind a moving fish icon and for larger fish it can be quite challenging however as you increase your fishing skill and you yourself get more used to the mini game it does become quite fun and a little less challenging it s also a great way to earn extra money when your farming chores are complete the social side of things mainly consists of doing little quests for other characters such as catching a certain fish for gus the saloon owner to use in a new recipe but you can also give gifts to other characters to make you like them more giving enough gifts to one of the ten bachelors bachelorettes in the game to get to ten hearts will let you propose to and then marry them opening you up to the possibility of having kids in the game the last thing here is the community center the community center has long since fallen in to disrepair and once the mayor unlocks the door for you you ll be able to start building it back up by completing bundles of items each room has several different bundles for you to complete completing each bundle will unlock a small reward and completing all the bundles for a given room unlocks a big reward such as fixing mine carts which can be used for fast travel from three locations the bundles are mainly for four items though some only require two and other require five the last big thing to touch on is house upgrades and livestock there are two house upgrades that you can buy which will make your house bigger as well as unlock something new to do the first upgrade is a kitchen which means you can cook food and the second upgrade adds child beds to your room which you ll need if you want kids to purchase these you ll need a fair amount of gold as well as a specific amount of resources which the carpenter will ask for you can also pay the carpenter to build you what you ll need for keeping livestock ranging from chickens in a coop to cows in a barn keeping livestock seems to be a lot more work for a lot less gain than farming crops but you can still get goods from the during winter while you can t grow anything during winter unless you ve repaired the greenhouse through the community center it is also possible to sells the livestock for a profit if you get them up to five hearts but i haven t figured out how to do that yet finally the save system the game automatically saves when you go to bed at the end of each day and there s no way to manually save this is another thing a lot of people have complained about it also happens to be what makes the game so damn addictive i often find myself doing a couple of things in the morning of a day before i turn the game off before realising that i ll have to finish the day to save my progress since the first thing you ll do each morning is chores you ll find yourself like i have several times playing the rest of the day just so you don t lose that progress it can be frustrating if you need to go and don t have time to finish off a day but it s a clever way to keep players playing the game verdict stardew valley offers players an incredibly relaxing and enjoyable experience through its farming simulator style gameplay though there is more to it than that whether you re a fan of similar games or you just want to try something new i cannot recommend stardew valley enough lone ranger reviews el k
