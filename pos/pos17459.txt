2019 if not the best total war game it is at least one of the best in the tw series i usually play campaings on legendary or very hard difficulty and after early game i just snowball the map not so much in shogun 2 in this game from the start to the finish u have to deal with problems all the time so u can t snowball and the ai keep hammering until the very end of his life sure yuan shao with the vassals is just annoying but still its challenging even in normal also its the first game that i check diplomacy every turn cause its worth it sell food for money all the time at least p some negatives to speak of are that in some sieges the units maybe have 200 men in the road but if 2 men are still stuck on the walls my units cannot target them except if my units are archers as i said this is a great game and i definitely suggest it to every total war fan
