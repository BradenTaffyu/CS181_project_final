2014 this is not goat simulator or grass simulator or bread simulator or another stupid simulator this is truck simulator so your job is driving a truck delivering stuff across europe so far as a casual gamer i didn t find it hard to drive these trucks though the ai can be ridiculuos stupid so you started to get a job using company s truck get some money to buy your own truck so you can start building your own empire ehh i mean company and then buy a garage buy trucks and hire drivers buy garages in every town upgrade your garages manage your trucks your drivers and your garages because you re the boss also i love how the developer works on this game not like ahem unity stuff you will feel bored cause of it s repetitiveness but sometimes you will back to drive your trucks again and then bored and then drive it again and feel bored again and again overall 9 10 recommended for fans of driving games sorry for bad english my grammar 3
