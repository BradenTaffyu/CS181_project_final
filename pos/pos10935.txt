2016 updated 3 11 2016 as you might notice i ve spent a bit more time in the game i think it s still great and the upcoming mods that allow you to play ww1 modern day cold war and many more scenarios add a ton of replay value original take a look at the achievements they alone are worth getting the game for seriously though the game is way better than it s predecesor because it s way more noob friendly i had to spend about 20 hours of watching videos on youtube just to understand hoi3 yet here the 4 short tutorial video s were more than enough and the tutorial is pretty well made and fun this is coming from someone with very little experience with this genre and even i m enjoying myself so far btw poland can into space it s a legitimate achievement
