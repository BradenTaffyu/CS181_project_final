2021 forza horizon 5 is fine for what it is feels similar to forza horizion 4 but it s also a good racing game pros 538 so far in the game more are comming with updates wheel spins are improved you get almost every car from it if you have the luck driving feels a little bit better here than in horizon 4 so far you dont need to grind a lot to get all cars thats pretty nice eliminator is the same like in 4 just with a new map also horizion tour is a neat new mode soundtrack is ok horizion stories still ok for what it is its nothing completly new but some little missions during the main missions is neat open world map is nice to explore but not really sure which from both games is the better one i mean i kinda like the city in horizon 4 way more but here the landscapes are better the festival playlist weekly missions are still ok here i liked them more in horizon 4 because you dont had to play eliminator still can create your own routes with the editor also challenges suprisely new is even you can create your own game modescons texture loading problems in the distance game looks worse than horizon 4 horizion arcade is a far worse version than the forzathon from horizon 4 you dont find as much players there as in horizon 4 because the lobbys are smaller there cant not join as much as in horizon 4 the ai bots was better in horizon 4 with the normal tracks and also with your own or custom tracks lack of customization parts bodykits at the carsfor me so far i enjoyed forza horizon 4 more but who knows maybe the game even beats horizon 4 in the future with more updates
