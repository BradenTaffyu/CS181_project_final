2016 early access review first colony went ok built in the boreal mountains fall comes along and my food stores are not looking good a trade caravan shows up but instead of having food for me all they have is a bunch of expensive livestock including boomalopes yes livestock that explodes i thought i was screwed then an invasion of mad boomrats smaller things that explode attack but go straight for the caravan creating a chain reaction of explosions from boomrats to boomalopes setting fire to the traders killing them all and that s how meat was back on the menu boys
