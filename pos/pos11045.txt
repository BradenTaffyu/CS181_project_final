2022 jurassic world evolution 2 jwe2 is park simulator management game based on the jurassic park jurassic world ip but there is probably quite a bit of skepticism and interest in what that means the gold standard of jurassic park game has historically been jurassic park operation genesis jpog but for those outside of that particularly fandom there has been a lack of quality with jurassic park themed games over the years this may be well founded in recent years after the first jurassic world evolution jwe failed to impress with its offerings i ve invested many hours into jwe2 to date and feel confident enough to break things down for you disclaimer this review will be based upon version 1 3 0 of the game thereafter referred to as update 2 visualsbeginning with the first thing you ll see its the game s graphics i am happy to say its a rather beautiful game better than its predecessor which was already hailed for its graphical beauty however don t set your expectations too high jwe2 takes an iterative approach to its graphics so rather than a gigantic leap forward from jwe it improves upon its foundations lighting has been tweaked and the texture quality especially on dinosaur skins and the maligned ground textures of the last game have been nicely improved for added details such as individually identifiable scales the biggest drawback is ironically the draw distance there is more pop in than is desirable which also effects shadows too this is virtually the only area visually that is a downgrade from its predecessor but it is by no means a major problem just a slight inconvenience the introduction of new biomes into jwe2 however is a much more substantial addition anyone who has played the first game would start to experience a little bit of eye strain and fatigue from the tropical environment leaving you wanting for some variety jwe2 feels much more refreshing and easy on the eyes by comparison with added deserts snowy mountains and temperate biomes to mix things up it won t be pushing any limits but overall an appealing game that should be fine for all except those wanting the best graphical performance game modesthere are 4 different gameplay modes in jurassic world evolution 2 they are campaign chaos theory challenge mode sandbox the game foregoes the structure of the first title where you built a park and progressed from one island to the next in favor of splitting the base components of jwe s campaign into two campaignprobably the most disappointing aspect of the game jwe2 s campaign is exceedingly short depending on how quickly you pick things up i couldn t see more than a maximum of 4 5 hours cumulative playtime whereas you could easily get through it in 2 3 hours if you know what you are doing it is more like a tutorial for chaos theory but it teaches you poorly as the backup generator really is a backup and you should make a standard power station more often than not in all other modes chaos theorychaos theory is mostly a standard park builder with a few objectives loosely tied to the narrative jurassic park 3 and fallen kingdom aside which are reminiscent of the campaign and feel incomplete this is the real campaign experience i wish players would begin with ignoring the prompt to play campaign first challenge modechallenge mode retains some of the conditions from jwe but it adds new ones with a unique map pool dedicated to this mode the latter maps are in the vein of isla pena creating unique challenges you will have a limited dinosaur roster and some special conditions to grapple with but this mode is mostly targeted at management players sandboxall your dinosaurs and buildings are unlocked for you to make your ultimate park experience lots of settings to give you maximum control like task time research and fossils expeditions to create a semi custom free mode similar to jpog s gameplay research fossils are toggled on by default disable them if you desire more creative freedom in sandbox disclaimer most maps must be unlocked in the other modes campaign complete corresponding levelchaos theory 3 star rating or complete levelchallenge mode cumulative star rating across all challenge maps to unlock them allgameplayjwe2 can initially be overwhelming but after a few hours of gameplay its depth bottoms out this is no better exemplified than with the scientist system a new addition in jwe2 to address criticisms of shallowness with the original jwe scientists serve as a core component of the gameplay loop you need to hire them in order to perform research go on digs treat dinosaurs and breed new ones there are three skill areas you will need to balance logistics genetics welfare they also carry special attributes like faster expeditions and cheaper incubation which are arguably more important than their base skills on paper they are great but constantly having to rest them to avoid sabotage risk can be overwhelming though thankfully you can disable them in sandbox mode jwe2 otherwise brings with it a lot of qol changes such as an airlift from the hatchery option that makes the experience smoother than ever similarly the mobile veterinary unit mvu genetics system and dinosaur behavior is greatly expanded with new loosely controlled behavioral changes brought on by the new synthesis process wherein you produce a clutch of eggs before incubating them all at once a major time saver the animals move more fluidly have more unique interactions and fan requests for pack hunting and fence climbing have arrived the mvu meanwhile has added a component for caring for dinosaur illness and injury with these conditions now being more varied in how they occur behave and come from crucially the big selling point is the addition of flying marine reptiles the former are vastly more developed with options to customize their environment in the modularly placed aviaries ability to break out attack guests and other unique interactions marine reptiles on the other hand are a disappointment however as they are basically fish in a pond with little customization or interaction to make them feel anything more than a set piece guest management is another area where some improvements have been made but deficits remain we now have guest types general adventure nature luxury but outside of new customizable amenities buildings they don t really have a place and the lack of guest attractions is palpable individually placeable trees and decorations added in update 2 have helped improve feelings of park building substantially making the game feel a lot closer to what it promises jurassic world evolution 2 is a good game it has delivered far more than its predecessor ever could it is far from a perfect game but after two big free updates much of the early nuisances with the mvu lack of sandbox options and technical issues have mostly been sorted i would have to say with update 2 jwe2 rates a solid 7 5 a few updates to add some depth to lagoon gameplay and more attractions and guest improvements and the game could be an easy 8 8 5 if done really well i would recommend this game to any dinosaur or jurassic fan and i encourage fans of park simulators to give it a try it isn t nearly as shallow as it might appear it just might surprise you
