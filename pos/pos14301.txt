early access review engineering and technological singularity summarized into a masterpiece labeled as a game this is not a game any competent engineer will tell you that this simulation is a story teller the story of industrialization and journey of the humankind and most importantly the tragedy of our lifetime that we live only within a fraction of the industrialization and will never get to experience the later stages of production and space travel humans 200 years from now will look at 2020 s as dark ages where people worked five days a week had to compete for education and decayed at their 90 s from simple diseases like heart failure prion diseases pulmonary failure etc they will never work a minute in their lifetime and own things that multi billionaires couldn t own today what could the richest man of london in 1820 afford you own today could he take the next plane to new york and use his smartwatch to buy fabricated snack bars from the first shop he sees as soon as he lands all without seeing a single dollar bill the richest man of new york in 1920 would trade his whole car collection for your beat up 2020 tesla so would you with your future if the time left any open doors for a bargain they will travel to nearby stars on ships as large as our cities people will be born on those ships everyone will know each other they will talk about how would it be to live on earth where they could take a leap full of what it means to be alive into the cold waters of that sea that you are uninterested to swim in they will be fully aware of the fact that they will never step on wet sand after the storm passes on a cold evening and we will never get to experience any of it as dostoevsky says to be too conscious is a thoroughgoing illness maybe it is even contagious
