2022 i was going to do this review when i have all the achievements but i just found out that this game doesn t have steamcloud i m quite surprised that an excellent developer like fromsoftware doesn t realize something so important i found out about this because i wanted to play the game on my laptop and my game doesn t exist i want people to know because if you change your pc format it or want to play it on another device if you don t have any save files you will lose everything you can make a backup and that s it problem solved but there are people who don t know that and that s why i m writing this review oh and the game is amazing one of the best experiences i m having edit i got all the achievements now this game is part of me
