2015 early access review this is one amazing game and it is pushing the edges of soft body physics i ve been playing this game since almost right after it came out this isn t any arcade car crashing simulator this is a physics engine used as a car game think about this type of technology used to make fully destructible worlds in game games think about playing gta 8 and crashing your car into a building to see it fall over anyways i am getting a bit carried away here are some pros and cons of this game pros amazing physicsplenty of modsvery detailed mapsnice graphicsforumsoh wait this game is still in alpha cons sort of un polishedless free time cause this game is just too awesome i recommend this game to anyone looking for a realistic car crashing simulator if you re looking for an arcade car crashing game i would recommend next car game have fun crashing
