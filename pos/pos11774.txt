2022 got this for the steam deck it works flawlessly and doesn t tax the battery too much at all either such a fun game you need to get through the first learning curve but the cycle time getting back into the action is quick i love how many of the weapons have clear conditions on causing critical hits unlike your traditional x chance to cause a critical many weapons in dead cells will trigger 100 of the time if you satisfy the conditions they call for so for example you ll have a bow that ll crit at long range another at short range other weapons might crit when the enemy is burning this makes for some wonderfully imaginative playstyles and given the huge array of weapons keeps the game fresh the only aspect which i wish was clearer at the start and took me a bit to pickup is the upgrade system you essentially have 3 skills red green and blue which relate to brutality survival and tactics what they re called isn t important but the game doesn t make it super clear how importing stacking one of these is once you realise that and start doing it you get further and are more successful in your runs is one of those games which changes when you complete it and finishing the game is only the start the game is initially very hard but also completely fair 100 recommend especially if you have a steam deck
