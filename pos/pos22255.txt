2020 favourite game of 2010 2020 this game made me feel like i was exploring a complete universe not complete as in every person walking around the main hub world is loudly complaining about the next big boss i have to go kill but only after obtaining the next item found in the chest and the weapon skill from the old man blah blah blah blah not complete in the way that there are 500 npc s and they all live in houses that contain the exact same dinner table bedside table and family dog dark souls 3 says you to that kind of game play and it plops you down in sam raimi s army of darkness while games like skyrim and witcher 3 are huge they can break immersion with issues like strange enemy placement before mentioned chatty npcs everywhere and these cut and paste assets littering the world here are my pro cons for all of the tl drspros extremely atmospheric world beautiful amazing enemy boss mechanics and design mini pro horror fans like should delight as well clean clean clean gameplay crisp hit boxes don t swing a large sword in a little hallway just like in real life oh but muh gameplay yeah but my realism is sustained good rpgness truly infinite ways to approach the world and bosses want to role play as an elegant woman who fights with a rapier but after dying many times adopts a more sinister guise as a hollowed phantom who fights with a sytche want to play as a barbarian who discovers the basic magical arts of the flame and then grows into a strong passionate pyromancer who helps others a warrior of the sunlight a pvp pve covenent want to play as an old wizard witch who wants to explore the arcane arts by whatever means necessary want to play as an actual white knight protecting your online pvp waifus want to just say it and literally roleplay as guts from berserk with his actual sword yeah you can do that fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun pvp co op difficulty can be offset by summoning people online for bossescons this game demands your attention and if people don t approach it with an adaptive mindset then it is hard game hard game hard game too hard where is easy mode game yeah if you are sitting at your rig at 2 00 taking a couple of bong rips drinking whatever weird ipa yeah maybe you might die a couple times if you don t ever adjust your game play same token if you approach dark souls 3 the way you would approach a boss in baby games like ocarina of time that is to say acting like you ll be able to survive long to find the bosses super exploitable weakness yeah then you ll get squashed like spaghetti overrated difficulty this is my review and this is what i think when people are speed running this game with guitar hero controllers guess what you are approaching the game wrong if you can t beat it the first boss of botw i approached i think it was the camel the boss killed me with a billion lasers i had like 4 hearts and died about 15 times where is the outrage for that if 12 year olds can beat breath of the wild you can beat a dark souls game nothing in this game is really that hard if you keep levelling up and you try a simple build i have made about 5 characters and the game gets easier each time can t marry the firekeeper i would recommend playing dark souls remastered after dark souls 3 it is nice this way
