2015 in short fallout 4 is a game about exploring a post apocalyptic world in the search for your son you wander the world exploring looting items crafting building houses and doing quests for many of the factions around it s basically skyrim but in a different setting and with more different features as you get deeper in the story you realise that it s a bit more complicated than finding your son which is what makes it very interesting the game looks pretty good considering its running on a very old engine the engine also comes with it s problems that have always been around and u think bethesda would have fixed them by now some examples are fps lock to 60 and vsync on you need to change that in the config files or the graphicsdriver but you actually don t want it to run much higher then 60 because the games mechanics is tied to the framerate so it completely screws up the gameplay mouseacceleration on by default also needs to be changed in configfiles no field of view slider config file fix you need to restart the game to change graphicssettings bad optimisation in the cityareas shadowdistance just hogs the framerate i get low 40 s in some areas with 980ti and a 4790k 4 7ghz i suggest turning it down to medium or entering a custom value in the configfiles mods is a really big part of this game and it resolves alot of the technical issues thanks to some great modders it also adds more fun and replayvalue to the game despite some really annoying technical issues this is a must buy for anyone interested in these kinds of games the sense of exploring the huge world with tons of stuff to do story that keeps u coming back beautiful world with great lightning mods challenging even on medium diffictulty can also be frustrating technical isses clunky inventory system mods fixes this lack of information on how to do certain things in the game u have to find out for yourself would have been nice with some kind of co op 7 5 10
