2020 i am happy to recommend this game to anybody who enjoys ripping people apart or shooting them to death or dropping buildings and vehicles on them my only complaint would be that wooden struts are stupidly weak i kinda hope that they add like a metal version of the wooden strut that can break but it can take a bit more force it would make designing destructible buildings easier i am aware that the other struts can break but you can t break them with stress
