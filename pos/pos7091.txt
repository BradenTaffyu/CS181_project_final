2020 what ats is to me beautifully relaxing and hypnotic it s sweeping vistas of land and sky as far as the eye can see freedom the exploration of places that i may never get to traverse in my lifetime respect true appreciation of and for the capable and talented men and women that drive these giant beasts in fair or foul conditions on smooth or perilous paths whether it be day or night challenging which again plays into the aforementioned i m not sure i could handle a real peterbilt on the logging trails of oregon or the mountains passes of colorado some of those turns ewwwwww joyous when i actually reach my destination on time in one piece and park correctly and of course a true labor of love thank you scs for an experience like no other and for continuing to build on and improve upon it i find something new to beam about with each drive ps cruising texas is awesome
