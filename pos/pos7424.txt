2019 early access review sound graphics the graphics in raft are beautiful it s not the most demanding game out there so i expect most players will be able to use the great and fantastic graphics settings looking out of my raft or high up in my watchtower into the sunset is lovely there is some nice and calm minecraftesc music however you ll hear this maybe once per in game day otherwise it is just silent some more tracks would be nice gameplay you start on a 2x2 raft and build up your raft by fishing trash out of the ocean with your plastic hook i m a big fan of survival games and i ve been hooked on raft since i first started playing it s so gratifying to see my raft grow and grow and look more awesome there s still so much i have to do more islands to visit and achievements to complete this game can be played alone but is much more enjoyable when you re playing with at least 1 other person i play raft with my partner and it has made the adventure a lot easier and a lot more fun replayability you don t have to stop once you ve reached the endgame the radiotower i ve been continuing to explore build up my raft and try to grow my collection of tamed animals and shark heads if you re a player who enjoys a grind then this game is for you as resources are used very quickly pros devs are still updating the gamevery fun multiplayereasy to lose track of time when playing cons no workshop support yetlimited number of large islands all though devs have committed to adding other landmarks to discover overall raft has easily become one of my new favourite games and i ll continue to sink plenty of hours in at 14 99 full price this game is worth picking up and if you can get it on sale then even better i ll have many hours of fun to come with this game 9 5 10
