2017 i love this game pros hosting is easylots of dedicated servers ping affects the game negatively ofc but not to a huge extent i can play with people from europe easily graphics are very cute but also low enough intensity that the game can be run with integrated graphicsvanilla game is super customizable mods are great and there s so many extra characters game improvements etcsolo play is doable and still fun recommended mods starting items especially during winter summer when people join so they don t die instantly natural respawn keeps the world goingautomatic health adjust for ai enemies most of the game is tweaked for many players so if you re doing solo 2player etc you can balance it seasonal bosses like deerclops aren t difficult solo but bosses like the dragonfly can use adjustment increase animals and set pieces adjusting the presence of animals in the game config means they re everywhere but with this they can appear more often where they do also put in set pieces for fun the mods are awesome a lot of the community is friendly and best of all it runs great on linux
