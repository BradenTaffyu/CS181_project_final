2019 this game is 100 what you make it to be which can sound overwhelming but take a deep breath and strap in for this one with so many people having purchased this game and playing it in the almost 13 years it has been out at the time of writing this review it almost always has an active player base because of the amount of community work that has been put into it with so many different game modes as part of the public server search tool you can play so many different things that you may never get bored of it it can also serve as a nice play to just mess around making weird objects and screwing around in a sandbox environment it is definitely a must buy for any steam user because of not only the history of this game but the possibilities it has even now
