2017 i have played all of the other scs american based truck simulators and i ve been dying for something updated like this for quite some time glad it finally made it to steam too the mods are easier to find and install than the previous games were and you get updates automatically from the developer instead of having to go to the website to download a patch it does need more trucks like freightliner western star caterpillar mack and others and not the ones that are from the workshop either i d like to see actual classics from the 70 s to the 90 s too even if you do or don t like trucks this is a simulator that really does well and isn t some cheap rip off i have my cdl and this helps me when i am not driving because here i can make mistakes that you can t in real life i think this would also make a great vr game too
