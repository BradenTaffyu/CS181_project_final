2014 this game this game where can i begin let s start with this buy it got it okgameplay although you might argue that the shooting and gameplay in general is the same as fallout 3 which you should also buy it does improve over its predesecor like with the all new ironsight a real one for once crafting is generaly the same etc etc quests this is where the game really shines its story and quest will leave you wanting always more and that s a good thing the characters are way more interesting then in fallout 3 in this game you will want to think twice before killing someone who isn t an enemy and you will always think was that a good idea also the quests are not fetch quest well some of them but not a lot factions in this you will come across the many factions of the harsh nevada desert which wil include mad bombers underground thechnology freaks the new army of some sorts a legion of slavers and mr house i can t tell anything about him story you are a simple courier or are you so after you ty to deliver a package you get shot in the head but you live and now you re on a wonderful magical quest to find the sonofab h who shot you but that s where our story begin find out by yourself community you being part of the pc master race can and will put mods on your game what are mods you ask well they are content created by users like you yes you and with time and patience you can make some too but seriously go to the mod nexus it is amazing what people can do with this game dlcs as i see it the dlcs downloadable content are part of the experience don t buy the game without them you will miss out on an extrordinary adventure dead money the first and best dlc released for new vegas i recommend starting it at low level you might not get the best ending but it s way better that way also play it in the dark it will be quite an experience honest heart the weak link at least in my opinion it does have a good story but all in all it was laking something i don t know what old world blues if you are patient you will enjoy the dialog but if you normaly skip it all you will find this dlc laking it still as some memorable moments though the lonesome road arguably one of the best story in video game history this dlc makes you uncover your origin do this as your final challenge before the end of the game if you want to enjoy it and finallythe verdict as i said before buy itright now you will not regret it it doesn t cost much and it will take you more than a few dozens of hours to say i m finally done with this i give this game 9 8 10 my favorite video game in the history of gaming
