2018 early access review review updated for alpha 20 welcome to 7stores2buy 7hours2fry 7wars2cry 7bros2shythe game that still calls itself an early access title 8 years after its first publishing for reasons unbeknown to me yet plays like a full released game albeit polished each alpha the game albeit slow at times could be considered a full expansion to the game so really you could say the game was expanded revamped reworked or otherwise upgraded 19 times since its inception now and continues to be a blast to play the pros completly destructable and malleable world as you see fit straight forward gameplay where you can be tossed in the middle of it and have it figured out unique horde mechanic that tests your survival and preperation skills hint s in the name huh rpg elements that make the game very co op friendly there aren t classes but you can spec to fit roles or distribute the work load that way the game adapts to you as you grow stronger so do the enemies flexible difficulty from someone just living life in a post apocalyptic setting to ohmygodwhydidibelievemakingzombiesalwaysrunlikesonicwasagoodidea tune the game to however awful and punishing and hostile you see fit despite being a blocky world it sure does not look like one so much explorationcons things are subject to change sometimes an update rolls by and removes something you really enjoyed rarely happens but they do re design things at times ui can be quite a mess to fiddle about much more oriented for pve rather than pvp don t get me wrong this game has many pvp elements but is not designed with it as its main focal point rust would fit that much better graphically can be hit or miss i like it but i ve heard that it s been a dealbreaker for some enjoyment is limited by how much you want to invest into it as there is no story or outright progression playermodels are quite stiff also customization leaves a lot to be desired conclusion personal final rating 8 5 10the game is quite a lot of fun offers a rather unique way of survival has a ton of hand crafted and yet still randomly generated worlds to explore feels alive and seemingly always there to get you oh and better not waste your time once the moon glows red you better be prepared to play minecraft on drugs many many drugs
