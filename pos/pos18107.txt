2014 total war rome ii is a strategy game and the next installment of the total war series we return to the age where we will relive the ancient rome the greatest empire ever existed in human history compared to the first rome total war this one is completely different in most aspect some might think this game is great some might think this one is not great this is my opinion the gameplay it is clear the game is becoming more streamlined than the previous settlement are now being managed in provinces with each provinces contain 2 4 cities including the province capital recruitment public order and food are now provinces wide so you don t have to build barracks or temples in all of your cities battles are also improved with soldier that throws javelin before charging like the roman legion doesn t have to wait to stand still to throw their javelin research tree are also present auto resolve battle now has 3 stances with each stances has different advantage and disadvantage and now each army or fleet must have a general or an admiral commanding them and the amount of general and admiral that can be employed is limited which mean there will be no army spam in the map diplomacy is also improved and there are more treaties can be made the graphics has also been improved both on real time battles and the campaign map they look even better and beautiful if the game runs the right way unless you re running the release version of the game which contain many bugs and glitches even to the graphics itself unit collision is a mess and sometimes which is most of the times when the game is first released there were many texture errors from the menu loading screen to the unit model terrain and many more it was mostly fixed by now the ai i think this is the worst part of the game the ai on battles are somewhat stupid extremely basic their morale is also low losing just 40 men and they start running away even the when they outnumbered your army they even sometimes didn t move at all and if you play battles without time limit this could be a problem when you re outnumbered ai siege weapons don t move at all most of the time now with the game has been patched several times the ai is improving but still not really good at least now you can have some challenge playing on harder difficulty but other than that this game is great since many patch made through i recommend this update now with the release of the emperor edition total war rome ii is now better than ever the ai working as they should now although still not perfect the performance is also great and i notice that with medium setting the graphic looks way better than previous medium setting total war rome ii emperor edition are now very playable rating 8 10
