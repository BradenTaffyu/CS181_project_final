2016 early access review i ve been playing this game since the early alphas and the thing i like about it the most compared to the other colony sims is it s rts based battle mechanics there are plenty of great colony building sims out there and there are plenty of great rts games out there but rimworld was able to seamlessly combine these two genres quite beautifully this is the kind of game where a raider can chop off one of your colonist s legs and then the player would be able to operate on that colonist and give him a peg leg this is also the game where you can butcher that punk raider who chopped off your colonist s leg and turn his bloody carcass into a lavish meal or feed his corpse to your pet warg and her babies and then loot that raider s cool jacket yes random reader you read all that correctly what are you waiting for go buy it
