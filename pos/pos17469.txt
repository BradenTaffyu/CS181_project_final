2021 i am gonna write this review now and update it after playing it for a specific hour to show you what it looks like for a first time total war player 2 hours in the game i ve actually spent 15 20 minutes just to see what factions are available to play their purposes traits etc and ended up playing yan baihu i mean he has lots of enemies is charismatic looks badass i like his beard anyways for a non native english speaker it was hard to understand the storyline cause of new english words used i ve never ever heard of before first mission was very interesting i wanted to know what each unit is doing so i spent quite some time reading almost everything if not everything placed my units in questionable positions to try and surround the enemy with all of my troops pressed battle asked enemy for duel won cool enemy forces surrounded successfully sent in my commander also cause why not he could not move after reaching the enemy for some reason but at least he didn t die after that i had to check out different sections of the game like diplomacy and everything else i for now consider boring i dont understand whats going on but i ve liberated a village i think that s cool gonna update after about 15 hours hopefully 25 hours alright i ve played a lot with this game in the past few days and kinda figured out almost everything so far diplomacy is really easy and simple to use court is somewhat also figured out etc the only thing i am still struggling with is micro management in battles and buildings like i know i gotta build something that increase public order if needed stuff but not on an advanced level i just build whatever i have money for and what is needed in the short term i got absolutely no idea how to think of buildings in the long term cause i barely got any experience with it yan baihu is still quite badass character even though i barely hear him speak anymore i made a secondary army gave them cool stuff archers etc and made another one for temporary only and now i cannot decide which one s generals are better to keep so now that s a headache for me to decide which one to keep got my multiple bolt arrows killed in a castle raid by towers cause i am a degenerate and that s about it i guess i really enjoy the game especially the part where i am dominating everyone which is what happening most of the time cause these bots always forget to protect archers against my godlike cavalry units side note if you re also a starter watch tutorials on youtube on mechanics you don t understand in the game they re really useful 40 hours now i ve declared war on quite some people increased in prestige rank which made me able to assign someone as law enforcer or some i dont remember which completely stops people from desiring higher court position until lvl 10 that s awesome i made like 8 armies cuz i also got lots of money delagated a lot of battles cuz there are a lot of battles if that makes sense and umm some nations started to dislike me like talking about 100 200 even 300 for reasons i dont understand declared war on friendly nation executed friendly generals whilst i do not see those nations as their trade partner or anything how else am i supposed to know who are friendlies to who that kinda screwed up my relationships am being called a traitor and stuff for reasons that s their fault for not telling me funny how i am blaming bots lol anyways war is going well almost eliminated the once dominating nation victory is close hey what s this he has another ally and another one and another one well that s gonna be tough reserves are in minuses sometimes when there are no events and food production are on top 100 or smthng nation wide meh85 hours in started a new campaign also with yan baihu cuz who else campaign diff hard battle diff very hardand guess what and guess whati just completed the gamewooohoooremarks it s incredibly annoying having to manage buildings with like 100 counties time to delete and never open this game again because it s time consuming as hell have a good day sirs i can still hear the soundtracks on repeat in my mind
