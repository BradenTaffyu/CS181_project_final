2016 i think what makes this game so good and perhaps so popular is that it struck the perfect balance it is a simple farming sim social town sim old school dungeon crawler very simplified and an achievement hunter s dream none of the aspects of the game ever reach a point where they feel tedious or pointless at no point did any one goal feel like it was unachievable or that the time or work to make it happen outweighed the end result stardew valley gives you just enough mini goals at just the right frequency you can take it as slow or as fast as you like you are never punished for changing your mind about what goal to work on and the game is built in such a way that you can juggle several goals at a time without too much difficulty i love being free to follow the game s quests and suggested tasks or to ignore them entirely i can interact with the villagers court them make friends with them or ignore them completely without penalty each of the segments of the game farming mining combat socializing collecting items is just simple enough to invite you to learn them thoroughly and just complex enough to be interesting without getting to the point of feeling grindy i should mention that i never played any of the harvest moon games but i did play animal crossing on the wii this game shares a similar feel in the social aspects of animal crossing but lacks the deep penalties in that game in animal crossing if you fail to visit towns people regularly or give them gifts they will get upset and move away i would highly recommend this game to anyone who plays casual farming sims social town sims this game would also work well for people who like being handed small easily achieveable quests at an easy pace or who wants to be able to change the type of play style at a moment s notice great for those who want enjoy constant change of pace
