2023 multiplayer review only for people trying to cut through the noise of mixed reviews if you re new to the series but love rts games like starcraft c c red alert etc enjoy a wwii setting and like a more tactical micro experience with some rng and complex cover system think x com instead of units standing in the open blasting each other doing the same amount of damage with each hit then you should just go ahead and get this game gitting gud depends knowing the units strengths and weaknesses and learning how to combine them effectively unlike other rts games that are more about macro amassing resources producing tons of units and cpm skirmishes are intense strategic and require your full attention if you re fan of the prior coh games but do not want to be patient while more maps are added and better balancing implemented then maybe you should wait for those coh fans who are relentlessly panning this game and saying they d rather play coh2 for a couple of years try to remember how long it took the devs to properly balance the factions in coh2 and realize how difficult it is to really balance a game with this many factions units and other variables against all the cheesy that a large player community can come up with
