2013 warband is the stand alone sequel to mount blade it has all the features of the first game plus some additional new features graphics 4below average even for the age of the game characters objects and buildings all have low poly counts and low resolution textures sound 5below average sound the standard screams grunts and kills but impact noises sword clashes etc make no sense and don t sound right at all but aren t so bad that they distract from the game either they are simply there music 8above average the music does a good job of setting the mood of the game you may actually feel hyped before a battle gameplay 9excellent gameplay sword motions feel smooth and fluid easilly controllable as you gallop on your horse mowing down enemies it does however take lots of practice don t expect to hop on your horse and be the medival rambo immediately impressions the game drops you in the world and lets you get started it gives you no direction at all and it s up to you to figure out what to do such is the nature of a sandbox game the poor graphics do break some immersion until you get used to them sort of like playing an old ps1 game the graphics these days are garbage but if done correctly they can still immerse you the game starts off very difficult and slowly gets easier as you get better and your character gets stronger the reverse difficulty curve can be problematic but also exciting as you feel yourself getting stronger and better at the game value 10as this is a sandbox game you will get many hundreds of hours trying every angle of the game and your money supports the developers telling them you want more of these games more of this niche genre less aaa garbage summary if you can ignore the poor graphics this is a very good game ready to let you do whatever you wantupdate the viking dlc is amazing
