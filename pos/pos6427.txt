2014 much like my sentiments of farming simulator 2013 i fell in love with euro truck simulator 2 and i have no idea why mundane job simulators are overwhelmingly garbage but a select few including ets2 are surprisingly compelling there is no way i can think of to describe this game without sounding terribly drab you re a truck driver and are starting your own shipping company you have to drive according to the law take rest breaks buy fuel pay for upkeep there is nothing on paper that should be exceptional about this game yet for what it is euro truck simulator 2 is disturbingly enjoyable i recommend everyone to give it a try
