2020 originally when i was younger and inconsiderate i pirated this game and sunk in at least 100 hours once i had my own money i bought this game on steam when the multiplayer update came out i played a lot with my girlfriend at the time and when we broke up i stopped playing for a while and deleted the save a few months later i was in a low place so i bought this game on switch and completed the story and got married and had kids so i sunk in a fair amount of hours 200 it was the only thing motivating me to look after myself as i wanted to keep playing as i recovered from that dark part of my life i played less and less until a friend mentioned they wanted to play with me so now i ve been chilling on a farm with my friend through lockdown this game as a whole has helped me through a lot and has given me a bunch of great memories i recommend stardew valley to anyone that likes harvest moon farming sims in general or just having a great time the music is stellar and the art style is nice and fits with the game generally a great experience
