2017 this is a true sequel to fallout 2 not that bethesda that they tried to pass off as fallout 3 or 4 none of that want a game where the companions don t feel like meatbags with guns new vegas want to talk to npc s that have goals dreams and thoughts instead of being cardboard cutouts of people with hollow personalities new vegas want to have an experience where you can slaughter the town that helped you and not deal with eating essential npc s new vegas don t care about the coming conflict at hoover dam and want to carve out your own experience and travels new vegas on that note want a game that doesn t forcefully shove its plot down your throat new vegas basically if you re not one of those lolololo skyrim is the best rpg ever type of people then you ll appreciate the time albeit short obsidian took to make new vegas the de facto fallout of the modern era
