2016 early access review though still definitely an unfinished game slime rancher has all the mechanics of a completed game this game is for anyone who wants a laid back relaxed and cute game that involves exploration and experimenting the only problem thusfar is that it is lacking content however the game developers are still making more areas to explore as this is still an early access game overall this is a very good start to a fantastic game
