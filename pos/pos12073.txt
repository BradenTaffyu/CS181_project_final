2015 honestly the only real competitive racing sim out there it has it s downsides like being too expensive but you really get what you pay for if you just want to hotlap some cars and try stuff out play with your friends on the weekend there are better options but if you want to truly compete against the best sim racers on the planet this is the one and only game you could play
