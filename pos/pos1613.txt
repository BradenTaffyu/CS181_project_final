2022 i slept on this game for 5 years and i regret it after having finally played it the story of the game is honestly heart tugging at times and the gameplay is some of the best i ve seen in any game to date you ll need to play through this game 3 times in order to get the full story but it s so much content that the first playthrough feels like nier automata the second feels like a complete dlc and the third playthrough feels like nier automata 2 with how much content it has you ll probably love every second of it because you just want more and more and the game keeps giving it to you putting aside the fact that the game has sexy androids since that s just preference the aesthetics of the game are absolutely incredible every location is memorable and amazing to look at and the amount of detail and work put into everything is stunning the music is also iconic and will quickly become one of your favorite soundtracks in video games if you don t already know some of it from other things if i could choose a game of the year this would ve been it if i could choose a game of the decade this would be it this game is simply put one of the greatest games of all time and is a must play for anyone who enjoys action rpgs even slightly also please take it from me that you have nothing to prove don t treat this game like dark souls and be pressured into playing only on the hardest difficulty enjoy your time playing it and only ramp up the difficulty if you feel like you need the challenge if you can t beat the intro of the game to the first save point on very hard then very hard is not meant for you and that s perfectly fine don t ruin your enjoyment of the game with difficulty it starts off hard like that as a insult to anyone trying too hard to be cool years ago when i tried it at first i did that and stopped playing it at the time and again i regret having done that after playing through the game though coming back to very hard is very fun play it to your taste playtime and time money at the time of writing this i ve put in about 60 hours and the game is 40 that s 66 cents per hour of enjoyment and well worth every penny put into it you can easily get up to 100 hours if you re into doing completionism things and the replayability of the game is astoundingly high for a single story game exactly what is this game succinctly this is an action rpg bullet hell of hot androids who have to kill the machines with a great story that will tell you the rest so now the standard game rating story 11 10 way more engaging than i had ever expected and it s one of the least talked about things with this game gameplay 10 10 it s very fun and everything is so smooth feeling it can be easy if you need it to be and hard if you want it to be and all of it is under your control presentation 11 10 one of the most beautiful games i have ever played in every single way soundtrack 11 10 one of the greatest musical soundtracks of all video games good enough to be added to your list of music replayability 9 10 great to come back to and has plenty of content for you to squeeze out of it but i think there is a point where you can be finished with it it s just that point is very far away
