2019 if you are a fan of total war or a fan of the three kingdoms era than this is a must buy however if you are new to the series then i still recommend this game as a great place to jump into the series the only issue with starting the series with this game is how difficult it will be to go back and enjoy previous games in the series because of all the updates and change this game easily has the best diplomacy system we have ever seen in a total war game complete with the ai constantly and consistently seeking different diplomatic options and allowing the player to approach the ai with many different options to bolster their income gain trade agreements gain territory and supporting vassals to overthrow their masters the 1v1 duels that you can chose to have with your generals are outstanding and have some amazing animations now obviously there is not fully matched combat which does make some animations looks worse however i will happily take this over units trying to find opponents and the strange unit formation issues that are caused by this each faction feels unique and has its strong points and weak points which does make each campaign feel very different and unique faction specific units add another layer to this that adds more decision making for army and general composition i was very worried coming into this game that i would be using the same 2 3 general combos in all of my armies however i am very happy to say that is not the case each general type has their own benefits and draw backs and depending on your tech tree focus you may unlock units that make you want to recruit certain generals less or more often and add these higher tier units into different general retinues the retinues and the different skills your generals take will greatly influence what kind of units you will want to recruit or maintain inside of different armies and even though all of the generic generals have the same skill buff trees their is frequently reasons to go down different paths in different orders depending on what you need from a general at any given time there are a few bugs present currently such as city towers doing much more damage than intended as well as there being a certain faction who seems to collect vassals like pokemon but these will most likely be fixed shortly as ca as acknowledged that these issues exist and will be rolling out patches soon this game has everything that makes me love the total war series and adds enough new dimensions and options that i know i will be playing this game for years to come much like shogun 2
