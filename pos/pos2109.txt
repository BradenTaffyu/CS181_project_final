let s start with the biggest questions first as of right now is the game functional yes it s been on a very slow but fairly upward trend in terms of functionality the servers work and the bugs have been and continued to be ironed out as things move along is the game worth the price for base game yeah the price tag is pretty good and the 2 free heists so far sweeten the deal even more but the most recent single heist dlc is vastly overpriced and i wouldn t recommend getting it unless you ve already got the season pass or it s on sale the season pass currently is only available for holders of the gold or silver edition and they ve not made good on their promise to allow players to purchase it post launch so i m gonna give even further warning to either only buy base game for now or just wait for a sale sale preferably is the game fun absolutely they have done a good job mechanically with the gunplay cooperation the stealth overhaul quite a lot under the hood honestly all in all i d say it s a good objective based horde shooter where it stands how about the xp system it s still not that great they ve improved it a bit but it s still far from satisfying to level up the guns and yourself it all becomes a mind numbing grind if you re aiming for some very specific level locked something or other is the customization any good the fact that some masks can t be customized at all is a huge bummer but ultimately not the biggest deal in the world at least to me personally the gun customization is different to payday 2 s but also has it s own bit of flair to it with weapon charms and stickers to go with the customizable paint jobs and those that fancied the tailor packs of payday 2 will like the return of clothing and glove choices as well although costing c stacks which brings me to c stacks what s the deal with those payday 2 had a problem with money it was too easy to have more than you ll ever need so in come c stacks they re a different form of currency that re bought with your earned money and used to buy higher tier things cosmetics paints stickers gloves clothes masks weapon presets and for some reason specific weapon parts which do offer weapon stat changes well what about the music no more simon right yes simon is gone but gustavo has been doing a pretty solid job of picking up where simon has left off he had some experience doing the last several payday 2 tracks and has managed to create some pretty good stuff in what we ve seen so far in payday 3 alright alright so then would you say the game is at least worth getting if you have friends playing it 100 yes it s probably some of the most fun i ve had recently co opping with friends if you re looking for a solo purchase i d say wait while you can play it solo i d say the fun is far better with friends currently
