2022 this game saved my life i am 58 my ex wife and i have a daughter together and adopted our son together they are now both 4 years old when we were going through our separation i found myself lost and miserable i was self destructive i got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that i punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion that caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand my working hand my games hand the hand that i held and carried my children to bed with the hand i desperately needed to make sure i could continue to provide after learning of the severity of my self inflicted damage i was borderline suicidal keep in mind that just a few months before this i was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety i have never had fits of rage or been one to break down and cry but i was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side having nothing better to do i searched for a game i could play one handed while i recovered i somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews i decided that it had to be worth a shot i must admit i didn t beat the game or play nearly as long as some of you in fact i may have only played this game a day or two with that being said after doing so i had a new found joy and hope for life i was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me i was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness i was able to see the fruits of my labor i relaxed for 5 ing minutes to this music long enough to realize that i was going to be okay after coming to that realization i turned the game off and i went back to work it hurt my hand like hell but i was motivated i stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself and i became the father i needed to be in that moment not the weak boy i was behaving as today i am close friend with my kids mother we don t fight or argue or say hurtful things to each other we are parents and friends i now have 3 kids my third child is wait for it also 4 years old the woman i am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly we have been in a relationship for a year now and are very happy together moral of the story you never know what life holds in store for you and if i would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me i wouldn t be where i am today this silly little game helped me realize that thank you
