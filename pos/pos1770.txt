2017 i don t often write serious reviews for games because i m too lazy and i think it s much more fun to just make jokes so here we go i honestly made the mistake of thinking that nier was devil may cry waifubait main character for that reason i didn t want to buy it at all but then my friends started playing it and started beating it beating it multiple times they told me it made them emotional even cry in a couple parts so i set aside money from my paycheck to buy it and i m actually so glad i did even though it s only the last day of march i feel pretty comfortable saying that nier will be my goty it s one of the best single player experiences i ve ever had while definitely not trading gameplay for story typically i expect either a compelling story or some super fun gameplay but this game has both in spades i ve spent a lot of time just messing around with my stats and plug in chips finding the perfect match to fit my playstyle another thing i was hung up about typically games like this require a controller but i m perfectly fine just playing on keyboard and mouse it s actually perfect in my opinion i don t feel like i m slighted by not having a controller at all but i would believe it if someone told me it was easier with a controller games like this are made for controllers i believe but in nier the keyboard and mouse controls don t suffer at all so yeah i was initially planning on avoiding this game altogether waiting for the hype to die down so i didn t have to see this flavour of the month game anymore but i was very ignorant and so so wrong about that i m glad i gave this game a chance and i recommend that anyone who s on the fence about this game just hurry up and buy it already you won t regret it 10 10
