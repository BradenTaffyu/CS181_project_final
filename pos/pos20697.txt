overall i enjoyed it but some downsides your choices don t really matter at all no alignment or anything can get really repetitive if you like to 100 games looking at you merlin trials with very little pay off while the outfits can be fun it becomes a chore after a while very little time is spent in classes and almost zero time feeling like you are part of whatever house you are sorted into no qudditch a very big drawback is that the world is empty and there is nothing to see except hogwarts and homesmead but i understand that s what they were aiming for it s literally like you re playing a spin off from the hp movies after all this time always
