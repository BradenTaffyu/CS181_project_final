2018 early access review this is the closest i ve ever seen a videogame come to any actual realism and i absolutely love it your gonna wanna throw your computer in the wall whilst trying to assemble the car but it s a good feeling and when you actually get it working you feel like you just accomplished something in life until it breaks down 5 minutes after and you never find what the problem is so you close the game and never touch it again
