2019 i have had many wonderfully exciting rimworld adventures some involving death others involving success and then death some even involving near victory and then death because i forgot to build turrets to protect my colonists who were frozen onboard the spaceship as i say you see those six colonists right there in a year i will still have six colonists but these people won t be there but i was wrong in a year i had no colonists but we went down in a dramatic last stand that will stand the test of time forever builds cool mountain fortress freezer is deep in though so i had to build a mini tunnel to let the heat out of the mountain gets eight colonists a herd of muffalo and a steady supply of bolt action rifles cold snap all crops die we only have three days of food left refugee quest last raid was two guys with bars so i am not that worried 8 guys with great bows emerge from the side of screen question whether tau the forty year old artist was worth it i send john out with with a bolt action rifle to fend the savages off he used to be alive like you till he took 20 arrows to the knee i frantically lock everyone inside and block the doorways with steel walls they break through the slate walled building and burn the outdoor geothermal generator our freezer lights tube television and massive hydroponics greenhouse are all without power they leave we break the steel walls and frantically wait for them to get offscreen so we can rebuild the power center and get our freezer back on before the food rots bob insane from sitting in darkness and eating raw meat for two days gets corpse obsessed he ignores the forbidden doors and runs outside to grab a body from the graveyard the raiders who were leaving see him and pursue him he makes it back inside just in time but the raiders are now besieging us again one day later they leave but not after spitefully killing the herd of muffalo and setting the corpses alight as we go out to rebuild raid png we scramble back inside and rebuild the steel walls these a holes are outlanders there are five of them and they have good guns they begin to try to break through the steel walls however three of them walk down the tunnel and break the cooler and get into the freezer there are three hostiles in the base and two about to break through the steel walls with what little time left we have we fall back to the inner keep bob doesn t make it while he runs to the safehouse he is headshotted from behind by the raiders f to pay respects kitty can t handle her lover s death so she goes berserk instead of attacking us she leaves the keep and charges at the raiders head on goodbye down to five colonists we watch helplessly as the outlanders break down the door i come up with a plan while the unarmed colonists dig a tunnel out of the mountain behind us the armed ones hunter and rexiss will cover the escape with their bolt action rifles while the brave souls prepare for a last stand the escapees use wood from a deconstructed bed to cover the entrance to the tunnel rexiss and hunter take three of the five attackers down with them as they collapse dead from massive bullet wounds the raiders steal some gold from the stockpiles and set them both on fire as i watch all of my hard earned resources go up in smoke i ask myself was tau worth it he richard and elena are the only survivors elena and richard freeze first tau packed a parka after eating the two others he starves a few days later i f ing hate tau but seriously this game is great buy it
