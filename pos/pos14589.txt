2020 i d like to compare civ vi to civ v in this review more people think that civilization v is the better game compared to this game in my observation but i like this game better than its predecessor i think this game is an improvement and that s why i like it better although i also love civ v here are some things why i like the visuals better although i prefer realistic leader characters than a cartoonish ones like in this game i also like the interface better food is now less important compared to civ v hence cities in desert tundra can be better now thanks to districts growth is limited by housing capacity you can build districts buildings and improvements to increase housing capacity in your cities district is a complex new thing in this iteration there is much to learn for new player about districts districts are very important in this game city states now have unique abilities that they offer to their suzerain in civ v the importance of city states depend on their type location and resources in their regions rather than using cash to gain favor with the city states now you have envoys this are limited depending on what diplomatic policy you have set in your government you can also gain a free envoy by doing things like quests from city state once for every era the civic system is now similar to the tech tree many of these civics unlock policies upon research completion player has policy slots for their goverment of choice which they can fill the slots with unlocked policies this offers flexibility you don t get in civ v cost of these civics are not affected by the size of your empire like in previous game and i like big empires there are unique boosts for technologies and civics you can do specific action in your empire to boost a certain tech or civic this gives you a chance to compete better with your rivals that possess stronger science or culture generation wonders now have unique placement requirement s a city with very high production capability or a leader ability that grants bonus to build wonders can t just spam wonders anymore some wonders are unlocked with civics great people are now limited but have unique abilities they re grouped into their historic eras in real history culture is now used to gain tourism you win cultural victory by accumulating tourism points above everyone else tiles now have appeal value which have effects like on generating tourism yield from seaside resort improvement more game modes added with expansions and updates this offer more variety and challenge to your gaming experience now you have builders instead of workers builders now have charges constructing improvement now done instantly and consume a charge they re gone once all charges have been spent compared to previous games workers can build how many improvements you want but that takes turns to finish pillaging improvement now changes the status of the improvement to be pillaged rather than destroyed which you have to rebuild if you need it also buildings in the cities may be pillaged as opposed to get destroyed on city capture roads are now automatically built by trader unit assigned on a trade route you can also order your military engineer to do that but that will cost a charge which is expensive the soundtracks are awesome as always with this franchise for each leader now you got 4 new themes ancient medieval industrial and atomic in civ v you ve got war and peace themes and themes for cultural groups like asia america etc on the opposing side i prefer civ v s movement system now you need full 2 points to enter a hill or forest previously if you have a remaining 0 5 you can enter such tiles or cross the river i nominate this game for labor of love firaxis just released the new leader pass just in time for steam awards nominations good timing firaxis new content for a 6 year old game for a game that already has so much replayability adding even more replayability and more playstyle varieties for a game that is already one of my all time favorite is always greatly welcome people are already talking about civ vii some leaders from previous games return very nice
