2021 disclaimer i don t recommend this game for people in hectic households toddler etc due to the lack of a pause function or for people who are too busy to play for more than brief periods at a time the gameplay involves long periods of stalking and waiting and is more suitable for those who can spare 1 2 hours of uninterrupted play time per session furthermore given the abundance of negative reviews reading some variation of i ran around for hours and didn t see any animals 0 10 i want to point out that this is a hunting simulator and not an action fps the game models noise and scent as well as vision and you are usually in pursuit of animals that have much better hearing and or senses of smell than humans running in the game is only suitable to get from point a to point b and should be avoided while actively hunting walking through bushes and tall grass should also be avoided on hunts although it s not too noisy on trails the animals will otherwise hear you coming and flee before you know they were there and even if you spot their tracks you ll never catch them just by running after them i have only played for 9 hours but my player stats show that i have scared off via noise almost 600 animals i have only seen 40 50 so far the animals are there you just aren t going to stumble across them while running around as if it were skyrim the game requires long periods of slowly creeping around and sitting still in blinds or foliage using calls and peering through scopes or binoculars review as a person who has not only never gone hunting but never held an actual firearm in their 36 years of life i bought this on sale just to see what it would be like i was pleasantly surprised the base game includes two large reserves maps to play on they are beautiful and populated with sufficient species to keep the hunt interesting for tens of hours if not longer visually the game makes good use of modern hardware and looks very pleasing it isn t next gen level but it looks great at 1080p with an rtx 2060s the animal models are perhaps the weak point here as they could stand to be a little more detailed their animation however is realistic and looks good the audio in the game is fantastic wear headphones and enjoy the realistic ambient sounds of nature listen for the calls of animals and identify where they are just as they re doing when you make noise the voice acting is limited but well done there is a rudimentary story implemented but it functions as a series of challenges to complete in exchange for lump sums of experience and cash you can ignore them and will probably complete them organically in time as you play or you can use them to get a feel for the gameplay and map layout there are functional rpg elements via a skills menu and a perks menu you acquire xp for killing animals discovering landmarks and completing challenges you get one skill point or one perk point per level alternating skills vary from extremely useful make less sound when you walk steadier aim to fun but unnecessary most players will therefore likely wind up building their hunter along similar lines i feel that this is one area that could have been fleshed out a little more but it s acceptable as is the hunting gameplay seems realistic to me as a non hunter so take that with a grain of salt unlike a game like skyrim you won t stumble across animals every 50 the moment you walk off a trail you need to listen for their calls use calls of your own to attract them follow tracks and make use of need zones where animals congregate at certain times of the day to eat drink or rest by default the game uses visual helpers like glowing tracks and call indicators to help you but you can turn those off if you want the realism and challenge note that this will invalidate some of the skill choices that adjust the indicators so you ll want to build your hunter accordingly there is a lot of slowly creeping around and waiting expect waits of 5 10 15 minutes or longer at times depending on your prey and the conditions of the hunt going after elusive diamond rated animals can allegedly take over an hour real time for some people if you enjoy stealth games and delayed gratification you ll feel right at home if you need constant action to stay immersed perhaps give the game a pass lastly i want to address the dlc elephant in the room yes there are a lot of dlc and yes they add up if you buy them all at full price fortunately the dlc are completely optional i bought the game on sale and picked up the well reviewed yukon and tundra maps and then later the safari map mixed reviews but i want to experience an african map with one gun pack and one lodge for a total equal to a lunch not bad after reading descriptions and reviews i decided i didn t need any of the other dlc i say get the base game and maybe one map that really interests you and wait for a sale to grab anything else if you decide you like the game overall the maps cost as much as a coffee and donut on sale excepting the newest one which is a bit pricier i haven t played multiplayer and recommend checking out other reviews to see how that s like i m a singleplayer only gamer overall an experience that even a non hunter like me finds enjoyable relaxing and tranquil at times tense and dramatic at others i wouldn t hurt a fly in real life but after experiencing long hunts in this game and bagging a gold rated deer or coyote i think i understand better why real life hunters enjoy hunting if you re a real hunter i think you ll enjoy the game even more than someone like me i ve seen some positive reviews from actual hunters but take a look for more if you re still on the fence 9 10 game surprise hit for me having never played a hunting sim before update at almost 50 hours in i m still finding this game to be engaging which is more than can be said for a lot of games i ve played considering what i paid for it on sale an absolute bargain
