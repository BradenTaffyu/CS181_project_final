2022 this game captures a lot of great parts for what it s trying to be and it s an early access done right they had a vision for what they wanted the game to become we got content a story and best of all a fun experience there is both chill building and tense diving moments with exploration in between my only negative factor would be a single small glitch and an annoying enemy but otherwise a really great game def a recommended for friends and solo 8 5 10
