2023 it s one of rare labors of unending development and care games 7 years old and still update 1 6 incoming it s great both in solo and coop has modding community speedrunning folks works just as a chill place or some industrial excercise where you can look for maximizing profits i m generally afraid of games with grinding potential but questlines starting from daily errand from bulletin boards and ending on ginger island offer some ending points arbeit 100 perfection is quite a long task to not skip with using some external help i didn t mod but thinking back going for smapi at least for not switching to wiki as often and animation cancelling shortcut would make progression so much more manageable it s great how this game manages having potential both for casual and for min maxing and personally for me i would love to play it casually but i can t chill untill chests are sorted so might not be the perfect game for me as there are some pitfall where i m lead in optimizing tasks multiple times rather than just solving a puzzle but there just so much charm in betweeen that i m greatful how it allows my brain to switch for a while even if it s just chopping wood and wishing minigame for an hour
