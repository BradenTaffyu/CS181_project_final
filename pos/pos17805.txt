product received for free decided to try it out because i wanted to get into mtg but i wasn t ready to spend money and visit a local card shop very delighted to find that the game has a detailed tutorial that not only helps you learn the basics but also you get access to so many cards booster packs and pre made decks that give you so much content to enjoy for free not to mention the lack the chat in pvp matches makes it a more tolerable experience for people who want to avoid toxicity while learning the game i am going to continue to play the game and recommend my friends to play this before investing time and money into it irl
