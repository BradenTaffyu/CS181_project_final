2018 after hitting over 400 hours in divinity original sin 2 i feel like i can finally review it in full depth the game is spectacular it was everything i wanted from original sin and then more the quests are in depth and you feel the consequences of your character race choices on top of the dialogue you pick i ve played four full playthroughs and each one i was still finding things i had missed and i m sure i will find more in my next one the story is just fantastic i couldn t ask for more from a storyline the game makes you want to read every little lore book and just learn more and more about anything and everything going on and if you re an original sin fan there s little pieces of lore left around everywhere for you to prick your ears up at and get excited about and then some then there s the combat it s fantastic it s incredibly strategic in every aspect your first playthrough on tactician will give you some good laughs at some of the difficulty you need to face and work around this is a good thing my friend and i faced some extremely hilarious moments of trying to figure out a fight and failing miserably when we were learning the game it was amazing fun and then you enter the realm of searching out perfect gear perfect min maxing perfect stats and perfect combat that in itself is the most enjoyable aspect of the combat in divinity original sin 2 you can hop from easier combat to the most intense combat the game offers and it s all fun i recently finished my solo honour mode and it was definitely hard and an adventure and left me sitting during quite a few fights thinking out beforehand how i was going to handle them because even the smallest mistake can mess you up i can go on and on about how amazing the combat is but you really just need to delve into it yourself to truly see how remarkable it is i can t find anything i enjoy as much as d os2 s combat system anywhere else if you re looking for a game to literally lose yourself in for long periods of time or to even play casually in your free time this is definitely my go to this is just a masterpiece of a game it s every fantasy and rpg player s dream come true and did i mention the co op is incredibly fun really it s just a stunning piece of art now i have a great many pros for d os2 but i do have a few cons and these are entirely subjective and my own personal opinion i really don t enjoy the four man party system for someone like me it s way too overwhelming managing four characters at all times and i just don t like it because some best in slot gear pieces are unique and you won t find anything else with their bonuses on in the game second skin ihu you re just sacrificing too much playing a full four man but that s from a min maxing perspective and probably not that important to others the second part of why i don t like the four man parties is because once you get a taste of the solid power of a lone wolf character you really can t ever go back now this can be a good or bad thing it gives the game a lot of replayable value i m about to hit my 5th playthrough and i m finally needing to stray away from my babe sebille which pushes me to pick other players to experience their stories with all that being said this is definitely a game i recommend anyone to buy it s amazing in every aspect i absolutely cannot wait until the definitive edition either and big big props to larian studios for their choice to give the buyers of d os2 the definitive edition for free incredible company who listens to their audience i can t wait to see what future games come
