2021 so i played the game for 100 hours so i could get an honest review of it instead of playing it for 5 and saying it is trash or not playing it enough for me to notice it s critique i will compare this game to other rpg s or similar games if you want a summary of this review i will write it at the bottom of this review along with the reviews of the dlc s but on to the start introduction my fallout experience the 1000 word essay on how this game is greatwe have all heard of fallout new vegas and i as many others have been taught or shown across the internet is that this is the definitive best fallout game so after some time i decided to get the game with all it s dlc s and decided that i would check out the game and see if all the hype was concrete or was just fallout fans with rose tinted glasses i start of with installing and starting the game and realizing that it is completely uncompatable with windows 10 this may be on bethesda s part as i know fallout 3 has this exact issue as well so my journey begins in the mod manager and ini files to enable more memory usage but after these fixes the game only crashed twice throughout my whole 100 hour playthrough the mods included in my mod list have no effect on the game but only made it crash less and fix memory usage so i start of with an amazing introduction to the main factions and the story taking place in fallout new vegas from the get go by a aged but still good cinematic comparing it to the fallout 4 cinematic i would say this one introduces alot more of the world to the player compared to the black and white war scene all about war never changes i start of the game with making my character in comparison to other rpg s like skyrim or fallout 4 this game truly gave you the tools to make your own character everything from the wacky dialogue options to actual things that could impact your gameplay is decided from what s p e c i a l points skills and perks you picked this really made it feel like your decisions mattered from the get go so i get on my mary way out on to the majave wasteland and instantly get hit with this massive world to explore but i follow a long the main story and talk to easy pete and get introduced to these amazing dialogue options comparing it to other bethesda games they were truly fleshed out and you could totally make sense of the conversation when you could actually read a sentance that your character would say instead of a few words or yes and no at this point i also get introduced to the karma system where bad and good actions could impact your late game stats as i get hit with these intrequet systems that i would say are pretty overwhelming if you don t expect it or are not used to rpg s or other roleplaying games i also discover the grave sight and see a grave you can dig a grave but only if you have a shovel so i go to the little ponsy shop in goodsprings right next to the grave sight and buy a shovel with this i had made an impact on my gameplay through my choices and ended up with a laser rifle a mid game weapon at level 2 when this happened i knew i was gonna have a good time with this game i made my way and thought i would make my way to the big glowing tower that is the lucky 38 and boy did i get turned into shreds by those deathclaws facing the strongest enemy in the game and it not feeling like a cake walk like in a later released fallout game it showed me where my place was which was killing powder gangers and thugs after i got my ass beat by every abomination i came across it set a milestone for me to get through that valley and kill those radscorpions that plagued me when i left goodsprings the game made me feel like i was in for a journey a journey that was mine to make and my choices mattered here the characters the voice acting the effects they were lasting and they did change the story for my character which made the game so much more enjoyable after my introductions to the game as a whole i got to know the factions in the game a little more and if i were to summarize them i would describe them as such the legion are the bad guys who are misogynistic dog twink boy toy slave owners that base themselves on the ideals of the roman enthusiast ceasar then we have the ncr new californian republic the good guys who traveled into new vegas to help the citizens and by help they mean help the areas with recources they need summary gameplay the game held up to the expectations i was expecting which was shocking as i went into the game thinking this game is the best rpg i have ever played but it truly is the best rpg i have ever played and the best rpg on my game list i love all the elements of this game and how your actions can impact the games surroundings and that your choices matter for the story and in general gameplay combat the gun play is simple yes yet satisfying and a lot of perks you learn compliment the experience melee is simple and don t involve more complex combat except block and swing but it is satisfying turning a ghoul s head into mash potatoe story the main story has a simple premise but has complex solutions as you can shape the ending of the game however you deem fit which is something truly rare in games these days even story telling games don t dwell into your choices mattering this much for the outcome of the story sound music if you don t turn on the radio in this game you are truly missing out on some bangers i am telling ya but seriously the sound design in this game is as everything else truly masterful you will have to explore the vaults and everything else with it s matching soundtrack that either puts shivers down your spine makes you enticipate what combat scenario is next or makes you jam in out in the lobby halls of the casinos graphics now this game is 10 years old so i didn t wanna slack on it too hard but even some games that came out the following year looked a lot better than this but the graphics are not too bad they are still good especially by 2010 standards and give more of a fallout feeling to it all something about the graphical design of new vegas just give more of a rustic run down wasteland sort of feeling with its orange tones but that might just be me dlc s i really enjoyed 3 4 dlc s which were old world blues honest hearts lonesome road if you are playing new vegas these dlc s are a must play in my opinion as they are truly great dlc s dead money on the other hand did not hit home for me as many others but if you like dialogues with character building and clues of a mystery to solve and puzzles i can see how you would enjoy this dlc as well architechture the buildings just look great you know what they are supposed to be and in what conditions you know what buildings stand out and which ones you can enter apart from some instances the bad now there are alot of great things with this game that is for sure like how great the rpg elements are and so on but there is a few bad things like how the game isn t functional from the get go and that you have to manually fix it there is also the landscape which has some unique parts like red rock canyon and the area around the strip that look notorious and when you are there you know exactly where you are but a part from those specific places all the other 60 look the same but that is the only concern i had when playing apart from some bugs and the two instances of crashes rating graphics 3 5rpg elements 5 5combat 3 5gameplay 4 5story 5 5sound design 4 5 added content 4 5 overall score 4 5should you buy it hell yeah you should
