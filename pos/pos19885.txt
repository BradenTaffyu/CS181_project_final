2019 age of empires 2 was one of my favorite pc games growing up and so i immediately picked up the hd edition when it came out in 2013 when i heard it was getting a full remake that included all the hd expansions a new expansion and quality of life changes i knew i was going to buy the game yet again for returning aoe2 players as long as you like or don t mind the new art direction this game is better than ever not only can it run on modern pcs like hd but now it shows villager gatherer totals as part of the ui and allows for automatic farm fishing trap reseeding in addition all the campaigns from the original game have been tweaked to allow a slightly higher population cap enough to take advantage of current hardware without changing the strategy of each map and all campaigns have voice over including the ones that were missing vo in hd and re dubbed versions of the original campaigns not only that but there are also new scenario editor features some of which are buggy right now but with the promise of many features being patched in such as triggers to change train research locations for new players this is probably the best version of the game to get into aside from some technical issues on some computers in the launch builds this is the most polished version of aoe2 right now with a new mini campaign teaching strategies for multiplayer and a way to download mods while in game it s probably never been easier to get started in aoe2 i m afraid i cannot currently comment on the multiplayer features since i primarily play the game alone or with friends the launch version apparently had a lot of multiplayer issues but hopefully those will be temporary if microsoft and the developers continue to support the game as intended it may be a good idea to check the official or steam forums to see the status of the multiplayer and streaming features overall i m not disappointed in buying this game again it s not just bringing back the classic aoe2 in the way the hd edition did it s a huge step forward that may keep the game relevant even as microsoft re invents the series with aoe4 even if you weren t around for the original release of aoe2 i d recommend giving the game a shot if you like historical rts games this game really has survived the test of time
