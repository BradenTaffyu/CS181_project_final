2021 product refunded i am writing this review purely for the game sims 4 not for origin which let s keep it real sucks and is the reason i refunded the sims 4 on steam first off i have around 400 hours on the sims 4 and i have about 17 of the dlc s which btw the dlcs really help improve the game i also use mc mod which is also a must have if anyone wants to get a better experience with the game i have been playing the sims franchise since sims 2 on the ps2 sims 2 castaway was my favorite i personally thought the sims 3 was better than the sims 4 for the longest time however now with all these dlc s i think the sims 4 is better than the sims 3 it has a lot of customization and it really lets you do a lot with the building selection i have been playing the sims 4 since 2014 i believe and it s been fun granted the dlc s are pretty expensive but if you wait for a sale its well worth it my only main problem with the sims 4 is that you still cant do co op natively like i really dont understand why that was taken away sims 2 will always be the best sims for that reason but sims 4 is a good sims entry in the franchise i recommend this for anyone that wants to play a sim game
