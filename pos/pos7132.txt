2017 even though i am an actual american truck driver greetings all i do drive long distances and i have to admit this simulator is very good for what it is some things are unrealistic but i m sure this game will improved slowly but surely already logged 57 hrs in not to mentioned even logged around 700 hrs in on ets2 anyways i do reccommend buying the game on steam or actual game instead of playing the demo if it has it great physics still needs improving though no lags depending on your software rain physics are nicely done and graphics are acceptable it s a great simulator game definitely an awesome field if you want to actually be an trucker for the record you ll make alot of money if you bought your own big rig instead of being an company driver for those who haven t played ets2 or ats or any trucking simulators yet you re missing out lol just kidding all the trucking simulators are awesome to play in you re into trucking trucking is a challenge and alot different from the games when you are out in the real world of trucking atleast you will get the idea of how to handle loads how to back up trailers in tight spots how to feel between light and heavy loads based on engine speeds and rpms and fuel consumption as to those who played ets2 and not ats yet well there is alot of things similar for example the drivers a1 traffic drivers trucking customizing mods and a few others you ll recognized well keep up the best work scs you all are doing great we all are looking forward to your new upcoming games dlc packages and update patches happy 2017 everyone
