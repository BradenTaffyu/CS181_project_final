2016 an open ended country life rpg youtube video stardew valley the beginning let s play part 1 views 1 024 stardewvalley add me on steam visually the game looks absolutely gorgeous you can instantly tell a ton of work went into creating all the sprites likely one of the best 2d games of this style i have ever seen very cute colorful and filled with detail has a ton of charm i would say it s like harvest moon animal crossing and a bit of terraria minecraft although in my opinion stardew valley is much better as far as a single player expeirence surprisingly has a ton of things to do it seems like every single day there s something new going on in the world and the game constantly gives you new goals to work torward while opening up new mechanics consistantly without overwhelming the player extremely addicting and filled with loads of content many people will invest 20 50hours into this game lovely relaxing soundtrack there are full on retro styled games within the game mini games if you will but i was completely surprised at how good they were i spent over an hour playing journey of the prairie king which is one of the arcade games in the saloon which to me was a load of fun loads of quests and events player choice branching story i m not too far into the game at this moment but you are able to support joja mart which is like an evil walmart corporation trying to take the towns business or you can choose to support the town instead by building up the community center and so fourth many different ways to earn money you can farm raise animals fish mine quests forage or explore and find all sorts of items to sell and so on there is even a combat system where you fight monsters in the mines and can get new weapons equipment and earn many rewards relationships friends children you can even have a gay relationship and adopt a child if you wish crafting upgrades you can craft a large variety of items and unlock more as you expand your house level your skills and advance through the game many of which are optional but give benefits like sprinklers to water your crops for you the only real issue i had is a lot of the information you need is not given to you and you will have to use a guide wiki in order to find out a lot of things in the game
