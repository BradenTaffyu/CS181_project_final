2021 feels like good old aoe2 but need some improvements cannot change playable color where is patrol defend etc options for troops building rotation auto explore for scouts there is many quality improvements but here some can put troops in walls no need pay attention to farms landmarks for leveling up to next age those give different kind of bonuses these are just my opinion and i hope they continue improve game otherwise too new civs and stuff are always welcome edit 13 7 finally they add colour picker so can change colour
