the bloons td series has been a fun way to pass time for almost two whole decades now with the original game releasing back in 2007 it s colourful it s easy to learn but challenging to master and the concept of monkeys fighting against an unending horde of non threatening balloons is ridiculous enough to be instantly endearing td 6 is still the latest in the main series after roughly six years itself but it s still getting new content and has plenty of active players it s better than its predecessors it doesn t require a lot of hi spec hardware to handle showing thousands of dart throwing animations all happening at once and it is frequently on sale for massive discounts i do have a massive gripe with this game though and it s the amount of inspiration it takes from free to play games no season passes thankfully but there is a daily rewards system you don t reset to the most worthless reward if you miss a day but there is an achievement that expects players to collect an entire year s worth of rewards from it there s a shop where you can exchange more of your real money for permanent upgrades or in game monkey money which can be easily earned just from playing the game though it takes a lot of time to get a lot of it that can be exchanged to unlock new monkey heroes or for temporary power ups i ve always rather hated when a game you need to buy asks you to make micro transactions so you can play it less and there s plenty of limited time content the odyssey race territory boss events that reward trophies cycle through at a reasonable pace and the trophy rewards are all cosmetic but there s still a fear of missing out it s not enough for me to hate the game but it s enough that i would ve liked it more without their inclusion in conclusion i won t go ape over the game but there s not enough badness to go bananas over so go have fun monkeying around
