2016 early access review it has been a long time since this came out and everything here is still just as true simply put one of the hardest most frustrating most obnoxious games i have ever played there are no tutorials nothing is in english you know nothing suddenly you re dead and broke and your car has exploded you scream f this game at the top of your lungs and then suddenly you figure out how to put your first part together and you scream and cry and laugh in joy hours take place and you finally found that missing screw you forgot to tighten you learn to tune your car and get it to start it finally stops stalling on you the engine hasn t blown up yet and you start to drive to your inspection to find out whats wrong with it still only to find out that the only thing that is wrong is that you forgot a stupid triangle in your trunk but its okay because now its time for an adventure this game seriously gives you some of the hardest rage moments in a single player game but you keep going back for more because its all on you you have to figure it out and by the devils angel is it hard to do but once you do it is the most rewarding and satisfying feeling that i have ever experienced in a game like this ever because no one is holding your hand no one is helping you cheat your way to victory it s all you so go you and make this happen make your dreams come true as you build your little h y car that you almost want to drive off a cliff but you wont and in the end you ll love this game no matter how many times you rage quit after smashing your keyboard 10 10can t wait for the future updates
