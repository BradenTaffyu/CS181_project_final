2021 i m quite late to this highly regarded rpg but i m glad i gave it a go overall it s a damn well produced package the combat is genre leading offering tons of flexibility and keeping even the most rote fight engaging it s a shame to admit but in 90 of rpgs i play after twenty or so hours combat is a chore i have to get through to continue the story divinity 2 is one of very few exceptions to this rule if you re a fan of freedom in choices and roleplaying this is also a very strong example of the genre there are myriad ways to approach almost every problem the highest praise i can give it is that it is the closest a game has ever felt to the tabletop experience on the negative side the story isn t incredible it s very well written in terms of the minute to minute storytelling the narrator especially and the voice acting is brilliant but the overall story feels like pretty standard high fantasy fare i think there s an element of bias here i tend to prefer grittier and more intimate stories but be prepared for lots of chosen one shennanigans loads and loads of high fantasy jargon and loads of grand prophecies the tone is a bit all over the place which is very accurate for simulating that pen and paper feel but sometimes makes it hard to become invested in the world for instance you can interact with a ghost to learn the tragic and agonising circumstances of their hideous demise then walk up the road and get a whacky quest from some chickens still if an inconsistent tone and fairly rote storytelling don t bother you divinity 2 is a must play rpg for it s genre defining combat and approach to open ended problem solving
