2015 after a few hours of play i can calmly recommend this awesome game it a post apocalyptic action rpg survival city builder stealth is an option it has every good feature the previous fallout games had and so much more upgradeable weapons armors buildings settlements new leveling storage collectible and conversation systems to make it even more replayable great lore charming dark humour opponents are nicely balanced and controls are very smooth once you figure it out character stuck few times between various objects and i lost progress 9 5 10became a scrap collector myself
