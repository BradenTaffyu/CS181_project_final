2023 payday 3 has had a very rough startthe game looks beautiful and the animations for everything are really nice after reaching lvl 60 as of writing this and patiently dealing with the constant server issues and matchmaking problems since launch i think payday 3 has the potential to be a very good game i have so much fun when the stars align and the game lets you connect you get a good team and win through an intense uphill battle warzone or everyone co operates and pulls off a stealthy heist that leaves you feeling like a genius the few issues i have with the game are matchmaking and the way you level up in payday 2 you simply hit crime net and were brought to a screen showing all your fellow heisters doing crimes from there you could get a big view of all the different activities and playstyle types people were doing or you could even host your own lobby with the heist you want and the playstyle you want to do for the mission and other players will see your game when they browse crime net hell you can even set the level requirement if you dont want low level players coming into your high difficulty game where alot of perks are required to survive payday 3 doesnt have any of this instead you press the heists button choose a heist a difficulty ect then you que up and it throws you in with random players you cannot communicate with anybody until the heist starts something you could do in payday 2 and by that time you dont know if your stealth build or loud build will be the best choice not even resetting the heist lets you change your loadout like you could in payday 2 on the planning screen you would have to leave entirely to do it so its really going to be a coin toss most games i play in are very divided with what players want to do some players want to go in guns blazing and cause chaos and some players want to stealth and will spam the vote restart when someone gets caught until everyone agrees or they will leave making the team suffer especially on the higher difficulties the leveling system sounds cool you level up by doing various challenges such as getting x amount of kills with x weapon or doing a heist a certain way or using your equipment a certain amount of times ect while its good to try different things forcing players to play a specific way will almost always cause issues you could pull off a solo overkill difficulty mission and kick so much ass but if you didnt complete or progress any challenges you will get 0 exp from the heist and it is such a mood killer when it happens im sure as time goes on and the game receives more heists weapons and updates completing challenges and leveling up will be much easier as theres much more variety and options but as if right now you are mostly forced into playing ways you wouldnt normally play or using weapons and gadgets you dont have interest in which is funny considering the whole weapon level thing they got going on where you unlock attachments the more you use a weapon you like aside from those issues my time in payday 3 has been really fun when things work and everyone is on the same page i just wish the devs didnt try to fix change things that werent broken and worked well from payday 2 hopefully future updates will bring qol changes as listed above only time will tell
