2017 i waited for a long time before buying this because of all the not so flattering reviews i saw i m glad i did buy it after all though sure enough the stats perks skills system has been simplified into a combo of stats and perks only but i don t see the change as dramatic as some i m not a hard core rpg guy so i can t say much about other aspects of role playing either i can say however that the gunplay and enemy ai has been vastly improved over previous titles and some nice completely new elements like gun armor mod crafting have been added to try and summarize all the critique vs my own experience of the game i would compare it to when fallout 3 first came out many of the die hard fans of previous fallouts abolished it for not being an isometric rpg and having elements of player skill affecting the events rather than just character skills to me that change wasn t a big deal back then and neither was this one i enjoyed fallout 3 and fallout new vegas despite of all the outcry of how they should have been in the same fashion i enjoyed fallout 4 too and i expect to return to it again
