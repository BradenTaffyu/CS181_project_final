2020 i played the b e t a in october 2018 i bought the game in november 2018 i left in december 2018 it s easy to say that the original fallout 76 burned out on me very quickly only one month after it s release i had already become sick of it and left that was until wastelanders came out alongside it s steam release i was excited to say the least i was intrigued to jump back into this game and see how it had changed see if i could get hooked on it after it s release 1 week ago i continue to log in every day and play 2 3 hours it is so much better that the original release of this game and here is why you should really consider getting it the world is alive after i started a brand new character i walked out of vault 76 as a fresh dweller and was interrupted by npcs they asked me questions and we spoke the dialogue system gave me flashbacks to new vegas after i left to walk towards the overseer s camp houses and shacks which were originally empty were now occupied by npcs i was shocked in a good way simply having people in this world has made a big change and it has definitely helped it new main storyline i haven t finished it but so far it has been very enjoyable to play through the characters you meet the places you go to all play very well and have a fallout vibe which was lacking from the original launch of this game gameplaygameplay feels a lot better than what it was at launch enemies feel more balanced the weapons fit with their levels everything seems to just work and i m a happy for that it makes the game enjoyable not frustrating like it was originally no bugsi have not experienced a single bug yet no technical glitches no broken npcs no nothing bethesda has seemed to up their game and fix majority of everything that was present at launch i say it like that as there may be some i have not encountered but in my 21 hours so far nothing has come up a few negatives this game isn t without some negatives of course atomic shop i m not a fan of microtransactions in games you already spend a decent for and some of the items in the shop are a bit interesting to say the least but they do have some great pieces in it even if sometimes they are a bit overpriced fps my experience so far with fps has been mediocre around 70 80 in most areas but can drop to 50 or even 35 in other areas you can see my pc specs on my profile but i do not recall having these types of frame issues on launch in 2018 i will continue to play around with settings to find the best for my system final wordswastelanders has definitely brought me back to fallout 76 and will surely make me stay around it s fun it s enjoyable and it s fallout i cannot wait to see what comes next for this game definitely recommend it in the state it has now become
