2021 let s get something straight this game looks ugly as although i personally like them i ll take the l here and say the graphics are horrible by most standards even at the time of original release the voice acting is amazing at times but can be horrible the gunplay is sloppy and sluggish the game itself is very buggy you may need multiple mods to keep the game stable on windows 10 without mods it stutters and crashes every 1 3 hours with that out of way let me tell you why this is one of the best if not the best open world rpg of all time characters are complex flawed and sometimes have contradictory opinions factions are modeled after real life politics giving the world an extra layer of inmersion the weapon selection is massive not including unique variants you can find throughout the game although the game gently pushes you in a certain direction but you re free to roam the game however you please game decisions are almost never black and white and some choices you have to make will give you pause to consider consequences the game offers more than an open space for you to simply explore it invites you into the setting itself and creates a wasteland brought to life some hilarious dialogue with a mercenary i had never spoken to before in prior playthroughs talked about how he didn t want want to get his butt forcibly diddled but a marauder this conversation alone brought me more joy than all of fallout 4 s dry and worthless dialogue combined sure games have come out such as fallout 4 skyrim and outer worlds but those really only felt like scratching the surface of a true open world rpg the last game that got me truly sucked in and lost was new vegas and as time moves on i m starting to think it ll remain the last
