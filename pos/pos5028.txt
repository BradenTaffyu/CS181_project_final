2020 no matter what i always seem to come back to fallout 4 and while my vanilla days are gone i find modding to be very enjoyable and i feel like it s definitely become a part of all bethesda games enhancing them to a much higher quality and providing unreal customization and options to make the game more enjoyable for the individual player while the vanilla game is still very enjoyable as it is my first impression of this game was very similar to my first experience with skyrim back in 2012 2013 i love open world roleplaying games and linear has never really been my thing so i am obviously very into the open world style that bethesda provides with their fallout and elder scrolls games fallout 4 being no exception the fact that i can go anywhere anytime really appeals to me and since fallout 4 has the settlement building system i quickly dove into that to be able to provide as many resources as possible by scavenging and later using the resources i ve gathered to something more than just selling them to the nearest merchant like you usually do in skyrim this added a lot of opportunities that i feel aren t as available in other games sure in skyrim you have the house building aspect of hearthfire but that s about it when it comes to freedom of customization of course there are limits to the settlement building but of course you can always change it with mods which i find to be no problem at all if you feel like modding your game to your liking is a problem then that s your problem no one is forcing you to mod at all after playing through the game once i dove into the modding scene to create a good modlist for playing survival mode in other words hardcore where your character requires food water and rest in order to keep your stats at a level of satisfaction after playing survival mode i came to the conclusion that i believe that s how fallout 4 should truly be experienced it is extremely enjoyable and i will probably never be able to go back to playing any other difficulty mode and again with modding survival becomes even more enjoyable adding countless opportunities for improvement i played on this survival character for about 80 hours before retiring the game for about a year fast forward to 2020 i created yet another modlist and played survival mode again this time i spent over 100 hours on the character before retiring it as i said i always seem to come back that s what i love about this game however i find the dialogue in this game lacking sometimes unbearable there are no real ways to change the outcome of the game other than the different factions providing different endings and your choices feel like they don t matter other than when the time comes to choose your side this is unfortunate but bethesda has a history of not providing the best kinds of dialogue all their recent games being good examples of this so it s not surprising that fallout 4 repeats history also the talking character was a change however i don t find it disturbing i quite enjoy having a real dialogue with both parts talking a change i could see is the option to change your characters voice and developing the dialogue system to provide real choices instead of yes yes maybe no yes all in all i love this game it s one of my most played games for a reason and i can feel the tickle of it reaching me again after being away from it for almost 8 months however i have other games to play and more on the horizon you should play this game it s great and if you feel like my description is good then you will most definitely enjoy it
