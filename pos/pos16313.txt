early access review this might be the least accessible game ever made i hesitate to call it fun but i can at least say it s very rewarding so don t get it twisted this is a positive review that said you need to be comfortable with sub gmod levels of jank you need to be comfortable with ps2 graphics you need to know how to put together an inline 4 engine or at least be willing to scour wikis constantly in order to learn you need to be willing to do menial jobs in order to scrape together a meager living all of which you will pour back into supplies fuel or your car i must say it s all completely worth it that first drive in your satsuma once you get it running and running well is a very special feeling the game is beyond janky beyond tedious and a masochist s wet dream it s also hilarious it s charming and when i try to pick what i d actually change to make it better or less annoying i come up blank every time it s a truly one of a kind experience and though it certainly won t be for everybody i d say give it a try if it s interesting to you human beings contrary to what we may believe find fulfillment from putting effort into something rather than the reward we might get in return in other words it s about the journey not the destination and a journey is just that until something goes wrong then it becomes an adventure my summer car is always an adventure
