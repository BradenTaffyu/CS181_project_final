2022 dead cells was one of the first few games where i exclaimed to myself damn i m having so much fun that doesn t mean i never had fun playing any other game before or that i never played any games before it s just that the level of enjoyment i felt playing this game for the first time made me revel how much i love playing this game and video games as a whole this may sound exaggerated but that s just how things went for me there was a growing excitement within me as i progressed as i encountered new enemies entered new areas and unlocked new weapons every step and jump i took was an absolute blast this game offers incredibly satisfying combat accompanied by a mind boggling array of weapons and abilities to choose from the combinations of these elements frequently complement each other the variety of enemy types encountered throughout the game is refreshingly diverse too the artwork animations and soundtracks are fantastic but what i like the most about the game are the boss fights every boss fight is adrenaline inducing the satisfaction of defeating a boss never gets old i wholeheartedly recommend this game hope you enjoy it as much as i do
