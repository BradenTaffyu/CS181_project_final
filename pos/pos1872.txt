2022 so i ve played swtor on and off since it s release i pre ordered it and have my black yellow crystal on all my characters and have well over 1k hours total played before it migrated over to steam as an additional download option i ve played wow and ff14 but i could not get into final fantasy during warlords of draenor for wow i came back to this game took a break and after legion i started playing this game more often i ll start off with a pros cons list as a simple outline and i will elaborate a little more on them as they are listed pros class story i adore the class stories in this game from being a sith rising through the ranks a spec force trooper taking out enemies of the republic or a simple man trying to make his way in the galaxy by taking bounties the stories are really enjoyable and i find myself making new character almost all the time yea there are some real stinkers in my opinion i don t like consular all that much and trooper is halfway decent but the empire is where it s at imperial agent has the best story hands down gameplay it s a pretty standard mmo wasd movement keybinds auto attacks building spending to people migrating from a game like wow i d say they ll be pretty comfortable some moves feel weighty and flashy and are fun to pull off nothing too complex i d say expansions aside from maybe the rise of the hutt cartel and maaaaybe shadow of revan i d say storywise these expansions are great additions and are a must to do at least once if story isn t your thing well that s cool too community if you find yourself a nice social guild to start you ll have a good time there are some really nice people i ve met on here transmog i cannot understate how much i love the transmog this game has being able to mix and match armor pieces and then being able to unify the color of the chest piece is such a super handy tool to have that i wish most other games would try to emulate cons community yea i know twice while there are some nice people there are some really nasty folk but that s kind of what you expect sometimes mostly just chat trolls or pvp tryhards even guilds full of people who are just well not friendly at all if you re running a flashpoint which is this games form of dungeon chances are if you aren t in a group with your friends the people will plan on trying to speedrun it and expect you to keep up and skip cutscenes content droughts there are just large bits of no content from the developers they re good folk don t get me wrong but having to wait months on end for a couple missions for story or even just something new to do is very boring and leads to burnout leveling this one is kind of subjective and i like the leveling but i know it s kind of a big thing for some people the leveling goes by pretty quick you get xp boosts from class quests and if you re doing side quests on the first couple planets you ll likely reach a level cap if you re unsubbed before you finish your class quests i d wager to say you d also finish even as a sub granted planets do scale you to a planetary cap but that really takes away a sense of progression to some inflation galactic trade network prices for some cartel market items is through the roof a crate that gives you random cartel market items is if i recall correctly somewhere in the high millions which to some is chump change but then you have an item that sells 30 of those for upwards of billions of credits and cannot even be listed on the gtn which is absurd bonus consider this extra section a i couldn t decide where to put this and some of these may or may not affect you in some way or another cash shop while there is a cash shop it is mostly for cosmetic purposes or boosts there is no buy endgame gear from their store which is good for some the game is f2p and there are ways to earn the premium currency cartel coins from playing you could argue that selling the items you get onto the auction house galactic trade network is some form of p2w but i don t think it s a very good way of doing things customer support maybe back in the day when there was a highly active team working on this this probably wouldn t even be mentioned i have had so much trouble with customer support as of late despite being very concise with my information for certain issues and nothing has been fixed if they ask you to send screenshots through your email i doubt they will ever see them also do not get subs from the steam store there are a ton of issues with it that still haven t been worked out in closing as i said at the start i love swtor but the game has its issues some in control and others out of i m no designer and i have no tried and true method of fixing the issues if you re migrating over from another mmo or would really like to get some great star wars story and fulfill some fantasies you ve had about being a member of the republic or empire in an era before the ot then i implore you to give this game a try even if you don t like playing with other people there is still single player content for you to keep you busy and if you enjoy interacting with others there is plenty to do cheers lads
