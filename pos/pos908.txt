2018 played for over 100 hundreds hours and while i very much enjoyed playing it i think it is fair to say there was things i didn t enjoy at all let s peep at stardew valley the bad not relaxing in anyway stressful extremely stressful i thought this game was going to be calm relaxing laid back and fun to play i couldn t have been more wrong i personally found to get the most out of this game to get the statue of perfection at the end of the two year mark i needed to know plenty of spoilers read the wiki loads and plan every day and every season and then try to play it to the letter which i couldn t do i never could get everything done i needed and it made the game almost throughout extremely stressful and unenjoyable to enjoy this in a relaxed manner you have to not really care that much about the outcome of things which defeats the point of playing a game in my mind fishing i love fishing in games especially wow but the fishing in this game for me at least was mind numbingly boring and rage inducing even headache inducing i mean even more annoying than actually fishing i m not sure i really mean that about actual fishing i m just getting salty but i definitely mean it about sdv fishing while this is a fairly short bad list it is a pretty damn strong one i mean i pretty much say i hate the whole mechanic of the game but stay with me on this the goodpretty much everything else art style love it music and sounds love it tons to do i mean just so much content it is insane loads of hiddens stories characters depth lore vibrant oh jeez just so much going on so much thought consideration and love for every aspect of the game it is clearly a labour of love anyone can see that and not a minute was wasted quality so smooth and glitch free you would think a team of long term professionals worked on this title no just one guy with a whole lot of love and passion for his craft and game constantly adding not only is new content always being worked on and added to add a richness to the world but also multiplayer a multiplayer that had to be retro fitted no easy task in fact damn near impossible i would have thought so yes it was a long wait and took much longer than expected but all good things take time and are totally worth waiting for i rather it takes a long time then it ruin a game so you know it will be implemented with respect to the main game diversity i just can t get over how much is in this game how much you can do find and get involved with and every aspect has such incredible depth that it allows for different play styles artistic types min maxers story lovers sim lovers combat mining lovers puzzle time management lovers and more they all have something in this game for them conclusiondoes the good outweigh the bad hell yes is it worth the price tag 100 i highly recommend this game and after one extremely long series on my channel i will be coming back for a second series but just know i wouldn t call it relaxing
