i never read the harry potter books and only saw the movies so i don t know if this game encapsulates the feeling you would get reading the book but it made me feel like i was a student at hogwarts and being mischievous as an rpg this game has some bare bones mechanics compared to a true rpg the skill tree is an after thought only have maybe 3 useful things in the 30 40 talents the gear system is basically collect mostly trash items with no filter on pick up to avoid filling the already small item bag i have seen games that implement a weight limit so your character can t hold a house worth of items in weight on their back but having 20 items limit before upgrading it with the annoying merlin trials is stupid plain and simple said items barely give you anything interesting besides better stats there is an upgrade system but that requires you to either hunt for the supplies or interact with the garbage beats breading the fact that wands don t give you different bonuses based on their materials or handles is waste potential the story is pretty cliche but i liked it what i didn t like was the side content that 9 10 times made you go fetch something or kill something to recover an item so basically a fetch quest with 2 steps instead of 1 the supporting characters were ok but some had really annoying voice actors and having to hear them talk during their garbage quests made me think why i continued their quest the world is beautiful and by far my most favorite thing in this game i loved walking the halls of hogwarts getting lost in the tight walkways of hogsmeade and just flying around the country side discovering new places that i have never seen in the movies the people who designed the world really put all their soul in this and i love it rarely you see something like this in conclusion i recommend this game for the world and design just a bit for the main story it s a must buy for every fan of the harry potter series just be sure to grab it on a sale the best sale i have seen is 50 off
