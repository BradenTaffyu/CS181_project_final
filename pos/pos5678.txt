2023 an example of two characters i have played recently thor odinson i spent quite some time making thor odinson had him looking the part and all the right stats start the game and we get to our first settlement i was in desperate need of some soldiers to help me traverse the map to being some trade runs as settlement one hand no units i set off for a village just next to me a small band of looters 4 of them stop me and ask for my money or my life or words to that effect hah i said i am thor and attacked so anyway that was that and thor god of thunder son of odin was dead from a blow from the almighty weapon known as a stone thrown by some pleb in a rag ok so meet bob i spent no time at all making bob as i was a little disheartened about poor old thor ing god of blablabla who died to a pebble bob survived his first day and created a small 20 soldier party this let him trade and build his party into a party of 1 scout 1 surgeon 1 captain and 40 ish soldiers bob was offered a mercenary contract which he took so now bob was working as a merc with 40 soldiers and several companions after a year a ing year bob became a vassal to the king of the kingdom he was doing merc work for he was granted a castle after an epic battle to take the castle from the toga wearing bath loving freaks of the empire bob buys a bride as in the daughter of the king for 50 000 and well the toga loving bath taking freaks attacked my castle won took me and my bride prisoner i dont like to think about what they did to her god forbid maybe they made her take a bath i escaped she didnt i tried a valiant it failed and so ended the story of bob at the hands of some random enemy with a sword this game is using a system i have wanted in games i play like elite dangerous and many other games it has the option to be iron man so no save scum and it has a built in births and deaths option the births and deaths option is brilliant and i have been wanting something like it for a long time if you die without an heir its game over and you have to restart if you live to a rip old age your gona die of old age doing this on iron man and adding a small mod that makes combat deaths for the player and npcs be the same is perfect the devs should add this as an extra hardcore option fantastic game with what looks like many hours of game play for me that means 1000 at least so yer its a great game and worth buying
