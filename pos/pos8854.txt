2020 horrible bad good beautiful magnificent though dated stellaris still looks good and with the help of the modding community it can look like an absolute gem oh god my eyes meh smooth excellent smooth overall though ship movement isn t always like this especially at higher game speeds forget it refund it wait for sale full price buy it yesterday since it s been around for a while stellaris can become expensive because of its many many many expansions the base game however is reasonably priced and more than worth the buy since general game updates that come with dlc also apply to the base game potato medium high end quantum computermedium on average but even the toughest processor will struggle in bigger galaxies in the late game it all depends on how grand you want your grand scale tactics game easy medium hard easy to learn hard to master why do you hate me warning peripherals will die the game certainly has a steeper learning curve than most though this has lessened over time with updates to the base game and several game play elements overall the game is decent when taken at a slower pace and practiced against ai empires there is enough depth to last a lifetime really short 0 4 hours short 4 12 hours few hours 12 24 hours long 24 hours stop living and do this instead a single playthrough can last anywhere from a few hours to several days or even weeks it all depends on the size of the galaxy number of opponents difficulty and other related settings overall there is no real end to the game since there are so many different ways to play and literal galaxies to discover nothing to see here move along define story good fantasticthe story depends heavily on the chosen empire you start with and the choices you make as you play stellaris works well as a roleplaying game where you make the choices for your empire several dlc expansions add to the story is various ways and modders have provided many more hours on top of that none a few a lot infested kill it with fire stellaris has never been free of bugs but most are small or non intrusive and quickly fixed by the amazing developers that still actively support and develop for the game single player yesmultiplayer yes edited for spelling
