2019 a very relaxing simulator game you drive a semi truck around delivering cargo you also can manage a garage buy and upgrade trucks and trailers hire drivers and manage a cargo delivery empire and if you re like me trying to find way to speed without getting caught by the speed cameras and the 5 0 and yeah you can just turn that system off but where d be the fun in that but the main draw of the game is the beautiful scenery and the fun of just driving around it gives a very lovely view of california nevada and arizona with new mexico utah oregon and washington with possibly more coming available as dlc very nice for those of us that haven t really got to see the west coast overall i view this game as being kinda zen it s strangely relaxing if you ve had a rough day and just want to unwind
