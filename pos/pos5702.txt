2023 i wanted to finish the full game i wanted to play to the end conquer the map and retire in the mountain i used a mix of settings between standard and realistic to up the difficulty mid way through the game then applied a few qol mods to improve the gameplay into late game and tried a few item mods that were supposedly lore friendly but didn t add much value short of a variety of looks for the player and his party that did not extend to the npcs so the world was still quite repetitive by region i had 4 play through s the first 3 to learn game dynamics what s changed from m b 1 and how to exploit game systems to my advantage to create my own kingdom as you ll see on many other comments and reviews after kingdom stabilization there s not a lot more game play other than color painting the map little by little as kingdom battles ebb and flow the game is fun no doubt but if you re a completionist and going to the very bitter end is your thing without easy difficulty you re going to get bored for the last 3 4s of the game the game has a lot of dynamics that create a difficult early game mid game and early late game crawl however once you master those dynamics the random event counters are extremely low with rebellion and other factors mostly preventable and tribute surrenders and easy system to exploit in your favor give the amount of cash you were able to amass and how low you conquered a kingdom which was in decline mods used diplomacy wanted to gain and maintain and ally but got too powerful too quickly so never got to leverage that feature dismemberment mod realismimproved garrisons realism flexibility with kingdom expansion especially before bringing other clans in but easily exploitable to give you too much of an advantagemod configuration menu mod req stabilitybutterlib utilities mod req stabilityuiextenderex utilities mod req stabilitybannerlord software extender blse utilities mod req stabilitytotal hours played 455total individual kills 5500game years to complete conquest 25total game hours for the 25 years 180 factoring in wars battles decisions and planning time paused recommend 10 10 but would like to see more non battle factors evaluated for m b3
