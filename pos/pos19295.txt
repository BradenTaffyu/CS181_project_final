2022 i ll preface this that i am exclusively a single player i never play these online so my comments are in regard to campaign and mostly random maps or challenges against ai being a fan of the age of empires series since near when the original first released i was always naturally disappointed at the closure of ensemble studios which was likely the greatest rts studio we ve ever seen in the time since it has been refreshing to see what the hd and definitive re releases have done with each game in the series and in addition i have stumbled upon various rts games made by relic studio and been very impressed at how well they played and the style they would typically follow see not all strategy games are the same some are turn based some are too detailed too high level too complex or some are too simple too zoomed in on specific characters and such there s always been very few that offer the right blend that age of empires offers in the style of gameplay it does relic clearly understood the job when they took this on this game immediately upon launch felt pretty naturally age of empires all i can describe as a long time fan of the series is that this just had the right fit and feel it has age of empires style and heart to it it s interesting how they kept some elements well known to the franchise while adding some slight tweaks that really only just build on that legacy without ruining the experience some slight examples are like sheep auto following your scout or the new twist to a relic being held by a monk providing new benefits and alternative play possibilities additionally they have done an excellent job providing incredibly unique qualities to every civilization and the civilization specific challenges definitely help you experience most of these features for each different civilization some minor things i might criticize about the game are that the camera is zoomed in just a tad too much now i m not asking to zoom out ridiculously and ruin the experience or anything but where it currently is set is just a bit too close and i d like to be able to zoom out only a little bit more to enjoy a wider view of my civilization just being there i also wish they could have kept the aoe iii de feature to auto scout but perhaps that decision was made consciously i may just be lazy but still want a fully explored map so that used to be a nice feature finally i do wish there were a bit more variety to the existing maps because ultimately once you play a specific map type more than a couple times you begin to notice is fairly similar every time and then additionally i m looking forward to and hoping they add more types of maps to choose from for random games knowing what has been doing and is still going on for the other aoe remakes i m certain they ll be adding more content to this game for years to come every gamer should try age of empires and this one shows that relic could rise to the challenge that ensemble left behind ensuring i am still a current fan of the series coming back for more yet again even after more than 2 decades of loving age of empires
