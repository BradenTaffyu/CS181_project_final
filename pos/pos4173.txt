2021 sts is a masterclass ccg it s got good and lengthy progression has a reasonable difficulty curve has interesting and unique cards and relics lots of variety and this is all without mentioning the workshop support sts is a game i find hard to not recommend to nearly anyone it s probably weird that i ve mentioned slay the spire in my doom 2016 review yet i didn t review sts at the same time the reality is that i did review this at the same time but i forgot to post it ha but if i were to have reviewed them together i would ve inevitably mentioned doom as well i mention these two games together because i feel that they both were for me at least a breath of fresh air with shooters the scene is littered with countless titles some practically identical to others and singleplayer versions aren t as common as they used to be for card games the online ccg explosion has been great but the rat race of either needing to spend money or play x hours weekly to keep up as a free to play player made me feel burnt out i played hearthstone almost every day for 3 years but even though i still enjoy the game i just can t play because i m tired of the grind and if you commit to spending money ccg s are expensive hobbies between 2017 and 2019 i really couldn t find the next thing that hooked me until i was told about slay the spire and doom slay the spire is a roguelite but only in the absolute strictest sense while there are permanent unlocks both in the sense of playable characters and cards relics the game doesn t get that easier you just get a lot better unlocking the different cards and relics is just an additional way to make you feel like you re making progress as the game whoops your butt and you learn every run starts from the very bottom with a simple deck and while encounters and card offerings are random much like a true roguelike you can learn the groove of a typical run so even with randomness you know what s coming most of the time this is an indicator of a strong roguelite experience even though this does mean you experiences between one run and the next will not necessarily be as varied as some more diverse roguelites learning slay the spire is a challenge but is definitely manageable what makes sts so great is the same thing that makes into the breach so great being able to strategize against an opponent by knowing exactly what they re going to do having as much time as you want to think about your move and still facing a challenge it s brilliant and multiple strategies with each character are possible and you can often pivot to one direction or another based on card offerings even midway into a run once the base game has become less of a challenge too you can begin ascension mode which progressively adds more and more challenges to the game you can also do any one or combinations of custom runs that are really sick share seeds of particularly cool runs try the daily climb and yes i m dead serious workshop mods i mean c mon that s just ridiculous that a game with already this much stuff also has workshop integration there are new cards new characters new modifiers new relics the whole gamut it s a ridiculous value i haven t even dabbled much in ascension and i put the game down at 100 hours at least for the time being a criminally underrated part of this game by the way is its soundtrack i catch myself laying in bed washing dishes working at the office humming the themes all the time they re quite relaxing but also thematically great my number one complaint of slay the spire is there is no action tracker or history to look at after playing a card let s say for example you re facing a boss and think you ve got a guaranteed loss but suddenly he hits you and it deals 0 damage and then he takes 12 and you win it would be cool to know what caused such an event right of course you can always mouse over all your relics and cards and buffs to read them again but oftentimes the interactions in slay the spire are interwoven and without a sort of history you can t effectively see what led to what happening this would be the most notable improvement to the game in my opinion one great aspect of history in slay the spire however is your ability to check old runs see their seeds and even compare your runs and scores to friends and others in a variety of ways it s just one more icing on the cake type of addition that really makes slay the spire just a fanatastic purchase for both roguelite roguelike and ccg fans and that s it it s that good i promise you and if you don t believe me just look at what its success and design has inspired i honestly think you can confidently say that monster train one step from eden and dicey dungeons all have at least some slay the spire inspiration in them these are also very successful games in their own right and deserve their due praise but its just as much as a testament to how sick slay the spire is 9 10
