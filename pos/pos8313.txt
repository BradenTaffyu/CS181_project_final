2021 one of the best if not the best city builder survival rts game it will test your patience and resolve many times but the finish line is well worth it beautiful graphics and music almost no bugs crashes in 600h of game play i like this game so much i went for 100 of achievements which i never do with any other game the only thing i wish the game had was another level of difficulty after extreme wholeheartedly recommended
