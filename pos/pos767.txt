2020 wonderful game at first you think the graphic is not good and so on but you still feel like you re in the game even if it s 2d pixel graphic and over the time if you meet all characters you take them into your heart you want to know how their stories ends on nexus you can finds thousands mods and you can play it like you want i played it with someone coop and it was really fun i absolutely recommend it for everyone who likes farming games with little stories edit 2023 still recommended
