2020 absolutely love this game whilst i enjoy drifting in other games i got bored from the lack of maps good physics customization etc so i decided to buy a new drift game carx is pretty fun so far you have a lot of options for customization the massive tandems with your friends and people you don t even know are awesome there s so much more i can say but i ll keep it generally short i just hope they add more future dlcs soon along with new cars
