2023 i was wrong about fallout 76 i had completely dismissed this entry into the series years ago and i probably would never have played it if it weren t for friends and the humble choice i vaguely remember the criticisms from its launch and they are still completely valid it s a typical bethesda game absolutely filled to the brim with bugs and i m not talking about the radroaches but i would be lying if i said this game wasn t fun gameplayapproaching this game expecting heavy rpg choices will leave anyone disappointed this is no fnv however what it does well is bring a light fallout theme park to a multiplayer action format actually seeing other players in the world makes it feel alive playing with friends is a blast there is always an event going on and combined with the folklore culture and mythology of appalachia this creates for a very engaging and unique experience you can play in first or third person and solo or in teams of up to four persons it s very easy to join random teams and doing so provides more benefits even if you never play together for world events you don t even need to join a group just so long as you re in the area you will get credit for completion there is a lot of flexibility in character choices beginning is limited but it doesn t take long to start collecting enough levels to unlock perks cards and skill points perks can be changed on the fly literally mid battle if needed and don t worry about spending skill points either because they can be changed at a dedicated machine infinitely the most prestigious loot is randomised and can have between one to three extra traits legendary items can t be scrapped like ordinary items but can be traded in for currency specifically related to rerolling traits and purchasing more legendary weapons there is a moderately deep crafting system which mostly revolves around the collection junk just enough balance that you might have to consciously collect specific items but not so much it s a tedious bore coincidentally if you die you will only lose items classified as junk performance and bugsmy fps continues to be all over the place i have never been able to get a stable 60 fps i don t crash every session i play but it happened enough that i prepare for it now especially after playing solo one session i crashed shortly after dying losing all my collected junk servers will occasionally freeze up and npcs will be stuck in place without attacking even after their death they re playing a gory version of musical statues enemy ai often seems borked easily tricked by stealth even when you don t have any stealth perks equipped stairs will confuse them and if you re able to jump up to a high spot you can take your sweet time chipping away high enemy health communitythe first few hours playing i met some of the friendliest people i have ever met in a video game they were literally bending over backwards to be nice giving out weapons and other useful items they also loved showing off their houses and i m always a sucker for wanting to see a person s creativity within games most people keep to themselves outside of small interactions but the in game emotes are so warm and expressive you can almost have entire conversations only using them servers are split into pve or pvp with a maximum of 24 persons at any time custom private servers are locked behind the fallout 1st subscription there are a few trolls trying to pvp on pve servers but they can t really do anything unless they are actively engaged with just make sure to store your junk before doing anything stupid tradeeconomy is busted given that this is supposed to be a post apocalyptic game you would have thought food materials and tech resources would be immensely valuable but nope worthless everything is so plentiful and constantly respawning server hopping is a valid strategy for the few items that you can t find easily the most valuable things appear to be plans from previous events and seasons and occasionally weapons armour with very specific traits people who own these typically want way more than what a newbie could afford and people who wanted them had already farmed them before they became rare for everything else keep looking til you find someone selling them for pennies explorationthe map ends up feeling really small because of the instantaneous nature of the fast travel previous open world bethesda titles have similar problems but a lot of quests in f76 have you revisiting locations and this exaggerates this feeling it s a bit of a double edge sword being able to teleport to your friends is a must but you can accidentally skip a lot of content exploration without purpose feels underwhelming the landmarks themselves are amazing but unless you have a quest or a specific reason for being there you re unlikely to be rewarded with useful items c a m p and monetizationhonestly the player housing c a m p is one of the best additions to fallout 76 you can choose almost anywhere in the world to plant your roots and yes it s clunky and awkward to build but there is access to a lot of items to build a decent little hovel without additional purchases using real money i love my little pancake house atoms are the real money currency they are used to buy mostly cosmetic items from the atomic shop you can earn a decent amount just doing in game challenges and progressing through the season pass i ve managed to earn about 5 000 so far to purchase them directly would have cost me 31 99 fallout 1st monthly membership includes an additional 1650 atoms every month at a cost of 11 99 that s more than world of warcraft personally i think this is not even remotely worth it you can earn more than enough cosmetic items through the free season pass the biggest appeal to actually purchasing it after speaking to others comes from the infinite junk storage but it really shouldn t be it feels like the antithesis of hoarding habits many who play open world games end up adopting and the cynic in me says they re artificially creating problems and solving it with money moddingi was gobsmacked to discover that some mods work with public servers my experience is second hand from a friend as i never downloaded any but amongst the mods they had included improved load times and performance a text based chat system that worked cross server visual notifications for nearby items such as bobbleheads magazines recipes etc achievements and endgamecompletionists be aware there are two reputation grinds one achievement that will require a second playthrough and then troglodiced kill 100 trogs with an auto axe trogs are an enemy only found in the end game raid like instances called expeditions the recipe for the auto axe is sold by only one npc for 1 000 stamps neither the auto axe nor the recipe can be traded with other players to earn stamps you have to play through expeditions but before you can start an expedition you have to do three specific dailies to charge up a battery the first expedition i completed earned me 3 stamps the most you can earn is 10 stamps per expedition 8 if you are not the group leader endgame in general is rather lacklustre and grindy revolving around doing the same daily quests and daily weekly challenges working towards completing the season pass there are big bosses but defeating them rarely feels like an accomplishment however i ve still put over 150 hours into this game which is nothing compared to some i do not regret it and will happily still be checking in from time to time
