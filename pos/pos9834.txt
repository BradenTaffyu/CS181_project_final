2018 early access review rimworld quite literally one of the best games i have ever played let me tell you but one story about my colony i had put it to ironman mode that way i couldn t just revert a save if something tragic happened i didn t expect much from this colony i expected it to get wiped out nearly as fast as i actually made it however this was not the case the usual struggles in the beginning happened the food shortages the mental breakdowns the injuries from raids however i had made a prison almost immediately in order to recruit slowly but surely i recurited people the colony grew i added beds and luxuries my colonists were mostly happy so happy i was able to rid many of alcohol and drug problems except this one squirrel that was hooked on luciferium i got the colony up to almost 20 people total i had an amazing compound it was built inside a large mountain which made it good for holding out on seiges one thing i did not take into consideration were bugs those damn things kept appearing inside the base it would only be a hive or two which could be easily taken out until one spawned in the medical room one by one my poor scarred and beaten colonists went inside and fell to the ruthless bugs they had survived for four years had countless medical procedures infections limbs lost and had still made it but the bugs this is what destroyed them as each colonist fell i felt my heart being torn to pieces i felt for these colonists as the last one died i felt destroyed but that is the game of rimworld this is only one story of countless amazing playthroughs i would recommend any day shame the only survivor of the colony was an overpowered squirrel hooked on drugs
