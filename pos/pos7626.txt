not very deep and rather easy to play i like that i like that the game doesn t force a certain play style you can play however fast or slow as you want the game also introduces the game play elements one after another in the campaign makes learning the game really smooth another good thing is how easy it is to move around whole rooms and generally remodel reorganise makes it easy to just place something without stressing about perfect placement it s easy to optimise later on
