2022 over the course of six years i have at time of writing this played total war rome 2 for a total of 926 hours i don t think there s another game i ve spent so long in except for maybe skyrim rome 2 is to me what rome 1 is to a lot of people i have some incredibly fond memories playing this game and it s one of a precious few that i always come back to it s just new enough that it doesn t feel painfully dated and just old enough that it doesn t feel frustratingly dumbed down to me this game represents the golden age or pax romana of total war games it has that chef s kiss special something that i have found almost nowhere else if you enjoy ancient rome or ancient civilizations in general this game is for you if you enjoy real time battle simulators this game is for you if you enjoy turn based strategy this game is probably for you more gritty and in depth than civilization in many ways but not as complex as imperator rome do with that what you will the dlcs are also a lot of fun and i ve spent a lot of time with them some are admittedly better than others sorry i m not good at writing reviews for games i like this much but this is an s class one for me for sure i can t promise you ll like it as much as i do but i hope you do quo usque pro roma ibis
