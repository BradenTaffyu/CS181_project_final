2018 i will be dividing my review into three sections those are pros and cons dlc and modding since the creation club issue seems to drive people away pros and conspros looting looting containers is possible while on the move most junk is no longer completely useless junk and redundant gear can be scrapped for materials that may be used for upgrades and settlements companions karma is replaced by companion affinity you no longer have to consider karma when you want to do something instead certain companions will like or dislike your actions gear modifications modifications can be crafted for weapons and armor you have more options than fallout nv provided ghouls some ghouls will crawl through gaps or rise from trash piles to name a few to get you they feel more feral and this was one of may favorite additions to the game neutral install location if you have a solid state drive with enough space it is recommended to install fallout 4 there to decrease loading times settlements there are designated workshop locations where homes and forts can be built settlements can be attacked and items can be stolen from the workshop inventory not from containers there are mods that will remove or add consequences from settlement attacks legendary there are legendary enemies and items added to the game legendary enemies drop a legendary item with an added effect but are harder to kill if you are don t like the legendary enemies they can be disabled with mods voiced protagonist your character is fully voiced some people like it some don t if you don t like it there are mods silence or alter the protagonist s voice leveling leveling is uncapped and the perk list is now a perk chart i think it is cool but some don t like it and there are mods to fix that if you want to keep the chart know that you can scroll down some people didn t actually know this cons story i think the story is good there are four possible endings but they all feel very similar inventory after awhile holotapes notes and other items become hard to find in your inventory this is especially annoying when a quest requires you to listen to a holotape there are mods that will help by adding sorting prefixes dialogue a new dialogue system replaces the old system most players prefer the old system there are mods to convert the dialogue to the legacy system dlcfar harbor i recommend a new island covered by a radioactive fog can be explored there are new enemies items and settlements there are various endings that do have quite the impact on what happens in the island nuka world i recommend an amusement park controlled by rivaling raider gangs there are new enemies items and settlements you are forced to be evil in order to get the most out of this dlc but there is still a possible good ending automatron short quests but adds the ability to create and customize settlement robots vault tec workshop short quests but adds a settlement where a vault can be built contraptions workshop no quests but elevators conveyor belts logic gates machines displays ball tracks and more are added for settlements wasteland workshop no quests but concrete structures traps creature cages arena platforms and more are added for settlements high resolution texture pack i do not recommend this pack is technically a dlc so it is here it requires an additional 58gb of free space the texture changes are only slightly better there are also players reporting to be crashing to desktop while using this pack there are mods that do just as well or better while taking up way less space moddingcreation club accessed from creation club on the main menu paid mods are found here many of the mods are overpriced but some might be worth checking out if you can t find an alternative anywhere else bethesda mods accessed from mods on the main menu free mods are found here there are some interesting mods here that won t be found anywhere else navigating the menu is kinda clunky nexus mods accessed from your internet browser there are modding communities such as nexus that still allow you to get mods the installation of mods from here is a little more complicated but very easy guides can be searched using your browser
