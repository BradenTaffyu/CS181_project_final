2022 early access review project zomboid is a casual simulation game that invites players back to the halcyon days of 90 s middle america where your first and greatest friend was always yourself at it s core the game is all about self improvement and exploration see the expansive and picturesque sights of knox county kentucky in simple but compelling isometric graphics from the humble and honest working town of muldragh to the expansive streets of louisville being a simulation of course your character has needs food and water keep your health up through even the most strenuous of treks through the woods proper care must be taken to ensure you manage the dynamic weather of kentucky s summers and winters your character suffers from a rare genetic abnormality that causes them to suffer crippling depression if they don t touch grass every four hours luckily the game has all sorts of useful skills for your character to build allowing them to live the true outdoorsman life earn that perfect body or even just engage in simple diy projects at home the choice is yours one of the finest features of this game is its sandbox mode allowing you to adjust various settings it really allows you to play the game the way you want to do so whether you want it to be a challenge as you constantly manage your needs or just a casual stroll through the woods they even include a sandbox setting that lets you populate knox county with zombies a humorous addition to an otherwise serious life simulator that i m sure the developers had quite a bit of fun messing around with overall project zomboid is one of the chillest most relaxing games i ve played in a good long while sitting in my trailer with books and cooking show reruns in the background bring me back to simpler days back to before the 2008 financial crisis before the pandemic before adulthood and the crushing weight of expectations dragged the last vestiges of joy and possibility from a life that in truth never really contained that much in the way of potential and was never going to in short i give project zomboid one of my highest raitings a i m never going to be able to afford a home out of 10
