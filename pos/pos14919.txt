2020 early access review its a mixed bag if im honest the game is very fun but it has blatent flaws that will hopefully fixed by upcoming updates the destruction is in fact fun but my major problem is with how inacessible it can be weapons maps and upgrades are only availible through progressing in the story and this applies to both the campaign itself but the sandbox mode too for some reason this means that just buying to fool around with the weapons is impossible if you dont want to do the story and this is where the next issue lays the campaign is difficult it starts of promising with you having to go around the map blowing oyur way to diffrent objectives but its very quickly apparent that the main gameplay is doing several things as quick as possible with an incredibly short timer my main issue is that theres no difficulty and 1 minute is incredibly tough for some of the missions its all possible but your fighting a long boring battle half of the time there are a few good missions but they are diamonds among the rough personally its your call its a fun game for sure but wether itll suit you depends on how good you are at solving its puzzles maybe wait till its out of early access editrecently workshop support has been added from what i ve played this makes the game more worthwhile if you are on the fence community content looks awesome so far
