2016 product received for free early access review the ultimate survival game i did beta testing since the beginning of this project and i m still having fun with this game trying to operate a tractor or a sewage truck without knowing what you re doing feels about the same as in real life not even mentioning the attention to detail in engine and car building everything works with the same logic as real life too it s fun and rewarding to try and figure things out yourself it takes time and frustration but it s worth it feels so fresh to play a game that doesn t treat the player like an idiot and offers real challenge surviving in this game is actually relatively easy if you behave and drive responsibly but it s oh so tempting to clown around i d advice you to not spoil yourself and look up everything on the net remember kids the journey is more important than the end
