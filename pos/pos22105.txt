2020 the third and so far final game in the dark souls saga dark souls iii does not disappoint although it makes quite a few changes from the previous games most of them are welcome ones a few examples 1 dying isn t as punishing your health bar only drains about 20 when unembered compared to ds2 where you could lose an enormous chunk of your max health especially if you died repeatedly 2 stamina is a lot more forgiving allowing you to dodge roll more without getting exhausted and taking a huge beating you aren t forced into putting a bunch of points into stamina just to survive faster bosses chain attacks and can instead allocate them elsewhere 3 the estus flask health potion item can be used while moving while you should still use it sparingly since it does disable dodge rolling until the animation nears its end this means you can avoid some lesser attacks and create distance while healing up 4 embers this game s equivalent of humanities and human effigies which maximize your health bar and enable co op among other things are a bit more common at least when compared to the effigies from ds2 5 combat in general feels a lot less clunky this did come out after bloodborne so it makes sense that they sped up combat a bit as a natural progression of the series it s not as fast as the bloodborne combat but it s the most fluid and fastpaced it has been in souls so far all these things and more should make dark souls iii a bit more welcoming to newcomers and it seems to have worked dark souls 3 was very well received by fans and became bandai namco s fastest selling game ever of course just because the game is more accessible that doesn t mean it doesn t provide the same kind of methodical challenge intricate level designs and fascinating world building that the series has become known for personally i found most bosses to be more enjoyable and memorable than anything from ds1 or ds2 i think the overall design has been vastly improved since the older installments no bed of chaos or seath the scaleless here although there were times when a few of them bordered on frustrating it was mostly in the optional areas or dlc and as such can be put off until later when you feel ready there s no blight town either the closest we get is a short swamp area near farron keep although there are still a few poison dart enemies in the cathedral of the deep as well as the grand archives but what is a souls game without anoying little bastards with blowdarts in terms of narrative you revisit some locations from the first game and as always there are some returning favourites among the cast but the game itself takes place far later in the timeline and it serves as a sort of finale however as should have been expected we are left with even more questions than answers in the end the story is open to interpretation and there are several people far more knowledgeable than i who have done so on youtube i personally recommend vaatividya s videos if you finish the game and wonder what the heck just happened i had a wonderful time with dark souls 3 and ended up spending almost as much time on it as the other two games combined if you wonder what all the fuzz is about and want to try your hand at a souls game i think this might be the best place to start even though the original game has its charm dark souls iii should be much easier to pick up although it is a sequel the timeline is so convoluted that i don t think you d need to play the other games first to enjoy this one instead you can tackle them in whichever order you d like now lets hope demon s souls and bloodborne will finally come to pc
