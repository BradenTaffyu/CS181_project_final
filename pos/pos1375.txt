2016 early access review lots of consistent updates servers with fun vanilla mod lovers both can enjoy this overflow of zombies give survivalism a new brow of furrowing within the realm of worry kill yourself in many different waysthis game is quite fun a zombie survival with pvp this game can be frustrating but not as bad as other survival games this gives a new take on survival with an isometric view and loads of items i ve been playing it on and off for years there are lots of updates but they are slow and has never ceased to entertain me
