2015 i don t want to sound like i m bragging or anything but this is the fifth end of the world i ve survived early first impressions settlement building a fantastic addition to the franchise i spent 15 hours just building my first settlement the basics are finally complete i feel like i could spend 100 hours on it and still want to do more can t wait for mods i plan to surround my house with outward facing treadmills let the zombies come environment massive varied game world with countless interesting characters and quests beautifully finished ingame humour incredible story so far great music if you get bored of questing you can spend countless hours just exploring the main questline is linear but the world isn t let me mention massive again 39 hours in and i feel like i have only seen 10 of the world and no i m not joking combat lots of new focus on combat faction system and settings vats system is improved and more fluid does not break immersion comparison to previous fallouts lots of major and minor improvements to the fallout formularetains the atmosphere and structure that made its predecessors great expect more of an adventure fps rather than an rpg this could be a negative to some folkes dialogue currently a certain stat unlocks more persusasive dialogue being good to your companion can open relationship dialogue good but could be more complicated value completionist expect to spend over 200 hours easily replay value is good the different factions make you want to see the other endings a few bugs are present not the radioactive kind 10 10
