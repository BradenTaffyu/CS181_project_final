2019 even without mods new vegas is a masterpiece of an rpg with some of the best writing and characters i ve seen however vanilla new vegas suffers from poor gun play low res textures reused assets from 3 and many bugs that can definitely hinder the experience due to obisidian s unfair deadline though this doesn t mean it s bad by any means i believe vanilla is just dated and overall i say it s a 7 10 or an 8 10 by today s standards fortunately the new vegas modding community is still alive and well with the addition of mods this game can become a timeless masterpiece that can add new weapons shaders entire questlines armor you name it there s probably a mod for it mods will drastically improve the experience and i d easily give it a 9 5 10 or even a 10 10 due to the sheer amount of possibilities
