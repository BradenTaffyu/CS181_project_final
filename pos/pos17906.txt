2023 there s a good game in there somewhere and i don t think its as far off as you might think as morphias once said he s beginning to believe and in all honesty i am well either that or i am blinded by faith high level summary get past the ui the shop and some missing key features and the core game is actually game really fun the devs look to be moving their road map to focus on what the community want after go live more maps etc etcmore in depth below let s get most of the bad highlights out of the way first most of the issues around this game come from some bad decisions at key times the key one for me was the rolling out of the shop as one of the first major updates this was a pr nightmare even if it was in a shippable state the income relic must have actually been made by the shop and has probably been offset by the downward trend in game sales so it was a false economy also skins aren t that good and their price point is far too high fps high this has resulted in steam and reddit going mad about the game if we for a second leave the hate circle jerk that is reddit at times valid opinions i will agree but leaving the eco chamber for a minute what relic tried to give us in comparison to coh2 which please remember was far worse of a release than this far worse is a game that is comparably double the size of coh2 4 playable factions and 2 campaigns my summary of the released version of the game is that the size of the mvp minimal viable product might have been the issue in essence they tried to deliver 2 much as part of mvp and it meant the final version came across as unfinished from an outside view dropping the dak faction and the north africa campaign a year before go live and then making them free l c 6 months after release would have been a great idea this would have allowed them to relocate those development resources into just a nicer ui replay visible ranking system balance polishing the rest of the game so the good the core games are fun rolling with a group on 4v4 or 3v3 is a lot of fun and now we have seen some balancing patches come out we are seeing a broad meta start to be established i hope these patches continue nothing better than balling up the tanks and plowing into the enemy line as you try and blitz krige the enemy or the zule bull horn strat works just as well the north africa campaign was good and clean fun and the italian campaign what i have played of it seems an interesting take not quite as good a ardens from coh2 but i think it has far more replay ability community engagement the game has from its offset really engaged with the community i have a game that i felt like i wanted we will once it s all done correct theatre more factions new features some old missing but hopefully they will be back tank crush but generally it s a game i have felt involved with which i think games need to do more even the new bug fixes get their own live steam the devs seem to be taking on board the feedback the balancing patches are coming quite regularly and i think they are quite well thought out not a pendulum type fix s which we used to happen in coh2 also they look like they have adapted their road map to focus more on maps and bug fixes which i know the community want so i write this with hope and to stem the hate eco chamber that we are seeing atm give them a chance to make it right coh 2 was worse and turned into amazing game thanks in part to the community but still
