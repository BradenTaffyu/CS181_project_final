hogwarts legacy is a nice way to immerse yourself in the wizarding world exploring hogwarts castle is fun and the castle is filled with details together with a great story it s clear the developers love the source material for me however hogwarts legacy s biggest flaw is its open world apart from the few hamlets scattered about the world is dull lacks interesting landmarks and is filled with repetitive activities this makes it tedious to beat the game to 100 completion in short i suggest finishing the main story maybe reach the true ending but don t complete it
