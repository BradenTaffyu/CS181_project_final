2016 this review is painful to write i loved harvest moon so much right up until yesterday when i reached a lot of sad realizations hm you were so cute and accessible your values and atmosphere informed some of my most deeply held ideals and then i started getting too used to you your tropes settings and characters remained constant and while i will always have fond memories of the times we had together and your comfortable familiarity i have changed and you have not hm you were a pioneer but your soil is no longer as fertile as it was i need to grow i must move on to a land where it is understood that tradition is kept alive by change where i can test the things you taught me and experience whole new challanges as well fear not you are not lost to novelty stardew valley is your child and you set a wonderful example for its generation you have kept something important alive and passed it on thank you harvest moon for all you have done thank you and goodbye
