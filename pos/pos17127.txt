2021 don t get overwhelmed by all the busy scenes and complexion this is the finest total war experience in terms of content and replayability to this date the only downside is the dlc system it s too complex and pricey for some of them you need to own the previous game which is a shame because dlcs are still kinda overpriced on their own overall a lot of content is locked behind paywalls but the base game is so rich that these mfs get a pass
