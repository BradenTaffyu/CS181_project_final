2018 i bought fallout on disk before i had a steam account i bought it again to have it forever that is how much i enjoyed this game yes i bought it twice lol the game is that good that you will play it over and over again the main story line if you choose to call it that is interesting and the game allows alot of freedom to do whatever you want and go where ever you want the world is pretty huge the graphics of fallout is amazing too it works for me and alot more credit should be given to the developers designers of this game the game play of fallout is very much like oblivion elder scrolls and skyrim if you enjoyed those you will definitely love this one beautiful game to play and collect worth your time and money
