2019 early access review overview project zomboid is proof that no matter what the visual style is any game can be extremely compelling fun and immersive to play when it s game mechanics sound design and atmosphere join together seamlesslythe team behind it s creation the indiestone are passionate about making a survival game built around a fully functional and realistic feature set based in a grim zombie apocalypse and they exceed in spades on the verge of release of one of the most ambitious build updates yet the game is about to receive huge new additional features such as 3d character models animations temperature clothing simulation and a lot more what started off as a very basic in comparison to the game now early access concept has flourished into a feature rich survival simulator which can be customised and tuned exactly to your liking alongside sandbox and challenge modes there is also the main mode the way the developers intended to play although if you want to make world warz or the last of us then you are more than able gameplay upon choosing the main game mode you will start with choosing a town to start in and after the character creator here you can choose if your character had a former profession and any additional skills balanced via a need to outweigh the pros with cons such as being afraid of the outdoors or even being deaf from here you now enter the new character customisation screen where all kinds of options can be chosen for both appearance and clothing your character has various skills all of which can be levelled be it proficiency with certain weapon types or his understanding and ability to repair cars skill books litter the map as well as crafting recipes which all will help your characters ability to survive grow then once you hit start you will appear somewhere in a semi fictional area of the state of kentucky back in the glorious 1990s just after the knox event outbreak and from there on you are entirely on your own unless you are playing multiplayer of course when loading in the game presents you with the line this is how you died and it states that because you will almost certainly eventually die whether that be from being eaten starving to death or even suicide you will die the only goal the game gives you is to survive and how you do that is entirely on your own wits run hide barricade or take the fight directly to the zed menace and last as long as you can soon the power and water will be shut off food will begin to spoil and nature will begin to take hold of what was once civilisation and there is no doubt the zombie menace will keep growing at your disposable is a vast array of craft able items from homemade explosives to simple nail baseball bats all the way to a deep building and barricade system where you can fortify or build entirely new structures gather food fuel and other supplies to get through the various seasons and their brutal weather patterns as zed s aren t your only threat all survival games do the basic food drink sleep and maybe temperature needs project zomboid outdoes almost all of them by deepening those systems such as a lightweight but in depth tracking of your characters nutrition an entirely new thermal insulation system which takes all kinds of factors into account and the most unique of all is having to manage your characters mental state every survivor has what are called moodles which represent what your character is experiencing with easy to understand ui symbols such as his pain level happiness or even what degree of intoxication he is at i can t recall many survival games that has the important aspect of your characters mental condition after that is the game s medical system which goes into wonderful levels of depth like rimworld but not that far yet smash a window and climb through without clearing the glass well you might get some glass shards embedded in you and god knows what that amount of pain will do to your character you are free to go wherever you want and survive exactly how you wish whether that be by fortification at a prison complex or by a nomadic trek across the enormous landscape which contains all kinds of environments and hidden locations you d expect to find in kentucky live out your zombie survival fantasy however you d like atmosphere the game has come a long way in terms of it s atmosphere both visually and audibly alongside a swath of in house made music wherein individual tracks can be disabled if you don t like them the game has a lot of environmental sounds and effects like the humming of refrigerators or the dripping of water from a tap to weather effects like fog and snowstorms which all combine together to heighten the survival experience and make it that much more terrifying then there are the sounds of the zombies themselves which help build fear of encountering them the moans of large hordes are heartstopping and the distant cries of people being killed off camera are gruesome to listen to even in early access the game is building it s story up as well throughout your survival at the start of the outbreak both television and radio broadcasts will fill you in with news as well as shows that can teach your character skills it is non intrusive storytelling that you can listen to or ignore at your own desire conclusion if the isometric camera style has put you off of buying please reconsider and give it a try this game manages to make survival incredibly intense without having to rely on pvp gameplay which are still present but not the centre point of the gameplay compared to games like scum or dayz being chased into a house by a raving horde and barricading yourself upstairs in a bathroom whilst hundreds of zombies smash through the doors and windows to get to you is terrifying you could go out in a blaze of glory give up and drink bleach or keep fighting for survival and jump out of the window and try escape with broken legs your gameplay or story as it should be called will be different every time when you succeed on a looting run or manage to finish planting your crops in time for summer it s incredibly rewarding a very memorable session for me was when the multiplayer first released and the server had been running a while so most stuff was already looted i found a guy in the same starving position as myself inside a pizza shop and i had no idea if he was going to attack me instead we teamed up and over the course of an hour or so we sneaked through an infested town and eventually managed to find a single can of dog food which we shared and shortly after got separated by a horde your survival creates a story like rimworld which can and certainly will be enthralling give it a try it is the most complete and fun early access game i ve ever played and there is so much more to come
