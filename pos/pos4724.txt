2022 i played this game around the year it released on playstation definitely one of the most interesting games i ve ever played therefore i decided to buy it on steam as well it only took me about 140 hours for 100 achievement completion and i m honestly willing to do it again if i were to get it for vr people s most common complain has to be how different it is to older titles but with no frame of reference i had no issues with it this game definitely stands the test of time especially with all the available mods out there a must have for any open world rpg fan 10 10 looking forward to the next title in the series yes i m excluding fallout 76 lmao
