2023 these are just my first impressions i ve played both coh1 and over 2000 hours in coh2 my first rts i ve ever played was warcraft 2 graphics 7 10 goodthere s something still weird about the graphic art style but it doesn t bother me that much it does need some work and fine tuning though audio 5 10 okthe audio is underwhelming i know it s supposed to be more realistic but it doesn t sound as beefy like coh1 2 audio gameplay 9 10 greatit s the same gameplay i love with a lot of quality of life improvements such as rebinding the horrid arrow keys to wsad i appreciate the strategic aspect and decisions of the campaign too story 6 10 decent so farthe italian front is an often overlooked part of ww2 so the new setting is welcome while i don t like how the story is told so far it s serviceable starcraft 2 has a much better story with better cutscenes and storytelling this game looks really indie by comparison content 8 10 very goodthere s a lot more content starting out in this game compared to how coh2 started out coh2 started with 2 factions with an underwhelming campaign it took a while for them to add the theater of war missions and ardennes assault campaigns which are the real treat i appreciate that this game starts out with 4 factions that have a large variety of units and has 2 better campaigns overall 7 10 goodi can understand where the negativity is coming from this game feels unpolished and cheap compared to the last entries but i also feel as if people are judging this game too harshly off of how finished coh2 is now and forgetting that coh2 was really really barebones when it was released 2 factions 1 bad campaign that i still haven t finished to this day and bad skins on units this game has a long road ahead of it and a lot of potential assuming relic supports it it should be worth it in the long run is it worth 60 no unless you don t care about the audio it s worth more like 40 45 in its current state because i had more positive things to say about the game and can see the potential of it i guess i ll give it a thumbs up
