2018 early access review strategy rogue like card game youtube video addicted to slay the spire 50 hours of gametime views 414 very few games can keep me entertained for the amount of hours i ve spent in slay the spire perhaps i m crazy slay the spire follow my the rogue like mechanics are done very well every playthrough is completely different and you tend to change your strategy based on what cards you get and what relics you find very addicting gameplay challenging even minor encounters are worrying as you don t want to lose hp as it doesn t regenerate on it s own loads of strategy elements that require you to think carefully each turn extremely high replayability from achievements to ascension challenges after 50 hours of gameplay i still enjoy the game and have more to accomplish a bit short only having 3 acts once you complete the game once with each character only 2 currently overall if you are a fan of strategy games card games and or rouge likes you will almost certainly enjoy this gem
