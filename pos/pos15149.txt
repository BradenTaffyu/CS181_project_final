2019 let me preface this game with this if you are a sim racer walk away if you drift on asetto corsa walk away if you take pc driving seriously walk away if you drift in real life and are expecting it to be anything similar walk away this game is not a realistic driver at all cars handle nothing like you would expect them to but what this game does do well is fun it s an amazing arcade drifter and to be honest i have more fun playing this than i do play asetto because i quite frankly can do what i want and not care it s a fantastic game to unwind to wanna send a car into a wall at 300 km h and drive away go for it wanna drift at stupid angles and still drive out of it be my guest this game is an arcade drifter if you are looking for a sim you have come to the wrong place this game is absolutely incredible as an arcade drifter i can t recommend more me and all my friends have an absolute blast
