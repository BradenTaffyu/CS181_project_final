2022 very good game fun to try and fail to get to the mun and all that however if your under 12 like me i would not recommend it s a tad bit hard it s hard to make and design shuttles and ships let alone flying this is a teenage and up game in my opinion unless all you want is to watch it blow up or get off earth and back down again however if you do or you are a teenager or older it s an very fun game to play when you get bored it s hard to keep playing without ultimately quitting out of boredom so i d recommend about an hour of this game at a time
