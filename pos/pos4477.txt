2020 while the base game is fun the real reason to get this game is for all the mods oh the glorious mods these range from game of thrones to star wars from a vanilla overhaul to napoleonic and medieval wars best of all you don t need a super computer to run it i can run it very well on a crappy laptop that has a stroke trying to bring up an email 20 20 would play again
