2020 76 when it came out was a great co op survival scrounging crafting game that was also a pretty bad fallout franchise entry what i mean by this is that if you compared it to previous fallout entries the rpg character interactions meaningful choices were very lacking and it was very buggy as well even by bethesda standards the core gameplay loop of fight loot scrounge level up craft was all fully intact and arguably the best iteration of it yet and as a survival game having the open world multiplayer aspect grow into the original fallout formula was incredibly comfortable if what you desired was a survival game that was pve focused with great crafting and leveling fallout 76 was a massive hit once you got past the bugginess if what you desired was a role playing story experience you got not a whole lot and then had to contend with a very buggy game what wastelanders does is present a much less buggy though still a bit buggy version of the game and massively flesh out the role playing aspects of the game making it feel like a much more solid fallout franchise title the end result is a great survival game and a decent fallout game for the survival fans just be aware that this game is really not pvp focused for better or worse there s in world pvp but most dont bother with it and the battle royale is rather forgettable but the pve co op experience is my favourite survival experience to date and at least it is not undermined by the constant threat of raiders wiping your base while you are offline p
