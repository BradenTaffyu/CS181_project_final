2018 early access review this is not a game for people who want to be babied along the process of building a car this is a game that will punish you with every move you make from realising you have to actually sustain your own life to making an wrong turn and making the headline of your local obituaries but the feeling of completeness once you have finally built inspected tuned and raced your car is incomparible to many other games this game has something special something other games don t have and that is character this game has a list of developers which you can count on one hand developers a developer who interacts with the community and entices you to want to keep playing by keeping you up to date with features coming in the next update i would most definitely recommend this game to everyone but i just can t you must be prepared to work hard and not have everything happen instantly if you can accept that then buy this game you don t have to know much about cars just don t expect the game to tell you about them either as the best way to learn is by figuring it out by yourself there are many guides out the to help you through if you are stuck after playing this game for more than 200 hours and enjoying every minute of it i thought i was time to write this review
