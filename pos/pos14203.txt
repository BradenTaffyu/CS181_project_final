2017 they should give away degrees in hr management engineering chemistry and physics to players of this game just to name a few personally the field i think i ve learned the most about so far is relativity because playing this game you realize how time is really quite a relative thing 80 hours in feels like i m barely scratching the surface and they keep adding regular and great content i feel the learning curve gets steeper as you keep going and ultimately it s almost mandatory to develop some very advance and self sustainable systems truly hardcore stuff unless you look for tutorials or are very patient or a professional engineer lol but there s a lot of game here even before you reach that point it s 2023 now fully released a while back and it still just keeps getting better
