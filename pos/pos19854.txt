2022 i am a 49 year old father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father to my son who is now 14 my son recently downloaded age of empires ii de and in less than a week he had already played for over 20 hours this was terrible for me as it was already hard enough for me to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching videos on tiktok so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him i loaded into the game did the tutorial but i was stuck on what you where supposed to do i asked my son for help and he hosted a game for me to join i loved it as it was the best time i had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought my son and i closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house as well this game reminded me that there s fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories
