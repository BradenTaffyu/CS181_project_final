2022 i don t really review games and i have a fairly wide taste from rpg and strategy to action and story driven games i could not put this game down for a week straight i have loved every minute of it even though i felt at some points the story was a little cliche i never felt like it was trying too hard to push outside of what it is and honestly that s great i actually became invested in the characters and definitely spent way way more time designing my armies and strategies than i thought i would if you enjoy these sort of tactical games i can t imagine any reason you wouldn t love this one
