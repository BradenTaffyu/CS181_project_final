2018 early access review my summer car i don t know why i like this game this game is tedious annoying difficult opaque and complicated i mean seriously the first thing i do when i start a new save is go grocery shopping in a toyota hiace what sort of game is that but i love it at over a hundred hours and counting fast it s one of the more played games in my library there are lots of games i spent way more than 15 on and played for much less time msc is finnish as all hell i m not finnish i don t even have any finn in my blood norske and prussian here but i do live in a somewhat rural area so i can relate not to mention even a bit of exposure to a foreign culture in a game however parodic is a good thing and there s more than a bit of exposure here the dialogue is entirely in finnish the map and architecture are all finnish duh the english subtitles and translations leave a bit to be desired though they get the job done i imagine because the game is not designed for us americans it s designed by a finnish man for other finns and i ve seen comments from finns who grew up in the period in question summer 1995 most of them say this was my teenage years that s praise in my book yes it s tedious perkele i m nearly out of sausages and my hunger is climbing time to go shopping yes it s annoying but it s sunday the shop is closed yes it s opaque didn t know that a spoiler wiring malfunction in your car can cause a fire too bad it just did yes it s difficult don t know anything about engines good luck yes it s complicated distributor timing valve timing carb tuning and more but those things make it all the more rewarding when you turn the key of your new car and she sputters to life only to blow a piston because you forgot to set the camshaft but hey that s how it goes right honestly don t look at my summer car as a game look at it as a life simulator finland summer 1995 with game like elements because it will piss you off it will take your notions of what a car simulation game should look like and throw them in the toilet but it will also make you proud of yourself after you wipe the oil off and successfully start your engine for the first time it will make you look at your blocky polygonal grandma with love as you listen to her rambling and it will make your heart race more than an action game would after you narrowly survive getting sideswiped by a beer truck doing 150kph on the highway seriously it s 15 buy it even if you only put in a few hours before shelving it until it s out of early access you still spent less per entertainment hour than you would actually buying consuming a case of beer and a pack of sausages
