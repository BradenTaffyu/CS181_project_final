this is not a review this is my storyi am not good at farming simulator games so on the 1st day spring i had no idea how the farm worked there is no tutorial and my iq is very low i spent my time rummaging through the villagers trash apparently they didn t like me going through their junk on the 2nd day spring a guy named willy gave me a fishing rod what a cool man i started fishing like a madman collecting more trash and a few fish i tried to talk to the villagers but i always ended up gifting them junk by mistake which made them even angrier this went on until the 5th day spring the mines were unlocked and i got a cool sword i went inside and my busy schedule digging through trash talking to villagers and fishing suddenly changed i had to make room for my new hobby slaying monstersin the mines i found a slingshot while practicing with it i accidentally shot pierre the guy who sells seeds in the face and of course he got mad on top of the anger he already had every time i came home i felt bad my whole farm was full of rocks weeds logs and trash my chests were packed with fish monster materials and even more trash it s safe to say that the villagers didn t have a very good impression of me my farm looked worse than a dump one morning i woke up and the trash was blocking my path literally so i had to clean up the farm a bit i got so carried away that i made the place spotless i decided to try out the other tools to see what they do and ended up planting my first parsnip seed hell yeah days went by but it did not grow thanks to the rain i realized it needed water i never imagined that planting something could be so complex and tricky unfortunately i never got to harvest that parsnip just when it was about to sprout summer came and it died thanks scorching sun i recommend the game even though my days as an amateur farmer are tough everyone in pelican town hates me but honestly i don t care why should i worry about being hated by people who believe that earth is inside a giant tomato according to what i read about their religion while digging through their junk
