2019 hello steam user who is wondering if this little visual novel is worth their time i m going to tell you right now that the short answer is wait a minute this game isn t a visual novel wow i m reviewing my first non visual novel game and it s the great tower defense classic plants vs zombies pros the concept it s pretty simple and silly zombie apocalypse happen but luckily you are a horticultural mad scientist with an amazing lab enough warning with a very resourceful if not sane pot wearing neighbor who s willing to help you survive the oncoming waves of the oddly polite undead hordes the simplicity and the absurdity is what makes this game both memorable and fun the mechanics like the concept it s also pretty easy to grasp how things work zombies coming from the right try to enter your house that s on the left side put plants down to stop them rinse and repeat of course that doesn t mean it doesn t get more complex later on but the game is good at slowly increasing the difficulty level without making it too much of a slog or too challenging to fast the humor everything from your crazy neighbor s rantings to the plant and zombies themselves and everything in between is designed make you laugh never has the zombie apocalypse look so adorable half the time i actually feel kind of bad killing the zombies with cherry bombs and hot chili peppers while the other half i want them to die because we keep eating my perfectly arranged lawn if they weren t insisting on eating my brain i would love to be friends with these guys they certainly know how to party replay value the replay value for this game is quite high because even after you defeat the main story route there s also plenty of other modes and mini games to keep you entertained for several more hours not to mention the steam achievements to earn as well cons no michael jackson zombie unfortunately this version does not have him and instead has a generic dancing zombie that replaced him the music cuts out sometimes i don t know if this is just my version s problem or a problem with this addition in general but sometimes the music just randomly shuts off right in the middle of the game only to start back up a few seconds later it doesn t happen that frequently so it s more of a minor problem but it s definitely annoying when it does happen the aspect ratio i know this game is older but when they released this addition they could have fixed the aspect ratio to make it more widescreen neutral the music it s really distinctive in my head but it s kind of repetitive so others may not care for it all around this is a pretty fun game for all members of the family if you want a fun lighthearted little tower defense game that has a bit of strategy to it then this is what you re looking for also that music video that music videos makes me laugh every single time who knew sunflowers could sing
