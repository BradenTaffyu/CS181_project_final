early access review update nearing 100 hours in only now have i exhausted the majority of the game s dialogue truly unique in a game like this friday nights at the inn is my absolute favorite that and the saturday market dialogue makes other games feel lacking in comparison i can even forget to visit the inn on a friday night and the dialogue will just pick up wherever i left off the next time i show up it took me well over a year in game to exhaust most of the dialogue of one of my favorite npcs c i spoke to them every day and got new and fantastic dialogue each and every time i still get new dialogue sometimes the way characters seem to remember events and past conversations gives the game a nice dash of immersion too npcs will comment on newly donated museum items that would be of interest to their character as a minor example i just want more of everything more dialogue more heart events more mine levels more powers more festivals more soundtrack i know much more is coming and i can totally see myself spending another 80 hours in mistria by the end of it i d gladly pay for additional content too this game just feels like a gift what a pleasant surprise feels better than stardew at times dialogue is shockingly its best element a blessing of a game
