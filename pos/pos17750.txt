2023 pharaoh focuses on many features that total war under ca horsham has forgotten or never thought about all of which come together to deliver an experience that s actually worth playing instead of piles of more which turns out is just the same with a different flavour of monster energy for now i ll just go with a list outposts bring a lot of mobility into the game as you can traverse your territory quickly and cheaply unlike alll other tw games where you had to drag your high end armies through safe territory for multiple turns are additional building slots especially useful for landmarks so they don t clutter your main settlement give a region more strategic depth make a lot of historical sense troy s resource system is back not just dark magic which is identical to money in every way apart from being purple so you can have meaningful interactions with your economy i ll take that over dragons every day of the week seasons years matter and don t just kneecap your movement and character progression sure aging characters is realistic and you can do a version of crusader kings in old tw games and attila but it mainly limits what you do it takes away your top generals hinders your upstarts from grabing cool titles and limits how you move on the campaign map because if you end up outside in winter desert summer you lose your army in pharaoh that s not the case but unlike warhammer where you re just counting down to domesday the seasonal cycle is front and centre and it all ends and begins with shemsu hor when your court plots resolve and your abilities refresh and you have to plan around that there is also crop yield but even i do not care that much about that areas of recruitment it s logical and makes armies more diverse which is fun you know why i never play troy on historic because that scraps the only aor mechanic in the game and really why even bother conquering new territory if i cant even get cool spicy troops there actual unit stances tbh it s not perfect but they re back victory conditions don t suck arse you don t need to conquer rome or whatever for no reason or research longer than any sane game lasts you just get points for certain conquests missions and feats and different point threshholds for different victories finally i can finish a tw campaign without dragging it out extra 50 turns of conquering pointless territory courts legacies and religion are also fun but that s more in the camp of faction mechanics in sum it s a good total war game that knows what it is and what it isnt ca sophia looked at the tw formula and put back in what was missing and took out what nobody needed anyway also so far it works no game breaking day one bugs so far this is very faint praise but considering the current state of gaming is it s something but don t get me wrong there are some things even i would like improved the dynasties adresses a fair amount of these but not all of them so i corrected my review as it contained wild misinformation
