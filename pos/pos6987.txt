2020 early access review hi folks is a bit of fun i have over 600 hours in game i wish steam allowed a hmm recommendation rather than just yes or no if you are looking to buy it then there are plenty of youtube videos which will show you the game play one thing i would say is look at the number of comments that say it is better with friends i ve been a gamer for around 40 years and can t really think of any game that is not better without friends it is quite fun and challenging to start out but once you pass a certain level it just turns into a grind the story was actually quite interesting once you hit the first structure hinting at a world that global warming had melted the ice causing the sea levels to raise it explained why you were afloat in an ocean ok it was not exactly accurate about what would happen but was fun for a game my main problem with this game is that in my opinion we will never get to utopia it is going to be one of those games that will just add a bit of content every now and again to keep a bit of interest up especially to youtubers that will promote the game although it seems to be decreasing for 15 it is a good game so i have to recommend it however i ll make a prediction that the game will not be out of early access this time next year personally i d prefer they actually finished the game then work on something else or a 2nd session just my opinion trikky2
