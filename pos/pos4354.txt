2018 i remember the day i found this game this was back before i had a busy steam account before games really started swinging toward digital purchase those were the days when i still made impulse trips to best buy just to see what new products had popped up in the pc gaming section back then best buy had a decent selection and it was fun to wander the long lanes of games sometimes with my brother picking through those bulky plastic boxes and looking at the pictures and reading about the features in tiny print on the back i don t remember there being much in the way of youtube reviews or online resources for checking out a game in those times i d never heard of paradox or taleworlds or this game until the day i found it i just remember seeing the cover artwork the frodo gorn hybrid atop his steed staring down at me through the rain i remember the promise that face provided and how over the years it has been fulfilled i remember reading the words in big medieval print mount blade and thinking oh wow what is this it wasn t warband yet but the decision wasn t hard to make it was reasonably priced for the time and i had always been a fiend for medieval style games but these guys these paradox taleworlds wizards were selling me a ticket to an open world medieval experience something i hadn t had very much if any experience with fully 3 d open world games was a new offering for me i bought the game installed it i fought bandits in the streets i fought wars across the country challenged champions on the field conquered lords in tourneys protected villages from bandits scoured cities for goods and work and good soldiers i met companions whose names i have not forgotten looking at you baheshtur even though you left us in the end i remember glorious moments against impossible odds and thunderous charges across dune and hill and forest up walls and onto ramparts into courtyards bathed in sunset gold and red death online play emerged with the release of warband along with graphics overhaul and some other neat tweaks and a band of us came together for war my brother my cousin my friend we fought in shield walls and cavalry charges stormed castle walls and cleared them to a man i will never forget my time with mount blade and how it gave me hope in one of the darkest hours of my life also i hear they re making second one idk tho
