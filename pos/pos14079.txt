2020 this is the second game i love from klei after don t starve together stumbled on it a few years ago and it s been amazing even from the start i kept playing it getting bored of it almost forgotten about it and then returned to play it again did that entire routine about 5 times now so it s fair to say it s a game you can play over from scratch and it is always an interesting experience and even after 400 hours i still didn t get to build do everything there is to do so i m gonna keep playing it and the development that went into it from early access to official release has been amazing constant new features and bug fixes great job guys their games is the ultimate proof for me that you don t need 50 gb disk space or to pay 60 euro to get awesome gameplay
