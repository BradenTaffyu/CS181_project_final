2021 super fun game with a lot of possibilities but some of the dlc such as seasons should be part of the main game the dlc is too expensive and i only get it when it s on sale ea should really reduce the price on these dlcs because the bigger packs should not be the same price as the main game it is literally just a money grab for ea that is my only complaint other than that i ve had a lot of fun with this game there are a lot of mods available you can download to enhance your experience or torture your sims the game is well made and i love how the building mechanic is set up there are a lot of customization options which i love i love this game and everything about it but ea please decrease the dlc costs
