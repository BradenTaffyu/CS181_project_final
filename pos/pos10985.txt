2023 product received for free game is great and i think it s gonna be around for a long time you just can t build this quick or this good in cities skylines 1 which i m going to compare it against the frist game is my favorite game of all time 10k hours playtime and this is in my view a good successor i played cs1 since that game was launched in 2015 and i could tell you all about how that game is not comparable to the cs1 we got today with all the user generated content i ve so far sunk 300 hours into cities skylines 2 and during that time i have completed several incredible cities from scratch look up my steam screenshots for proof this is something that just wasn t achievable for me in cs1 during the same time scale performancethis game has performance issues right now nobody is denying that none so bad that they prevent me from playing and enjoying the game thoroughly i trust the devs will do all in their power to improve the game post launch but that doesn t change the fact that i already like this game alot even with all the current limitations i m also on pretty modest hardware where most parts are from 2013 cpu intel core i7 4770kgpu asus rog strix geforce rtx 3060 ocram patriot extreme performance viper 3 32gbmobo asus z87 pro atxssd samsung basic 840 series 250gbsettingsyou may want to tune the settings properly to have the best gameplay experience possible the best settings i ve found to tweak for performance gains are the following set level of detail to low this may double your fps crank it up to high temporarily if you need high detail far out satelite screenshots disable dynamic resolution it doesn t do what it did in cs1 it just makes the game really blurry consider lowering resolution 4k will reduce your fps significantly compared to 2k turn off depth of field lower volumetrics and cloud qualitiesfor full transparency i will say that i got this game for free as part of the content creator early access campaign and this is how i ve already played 300h with that said this is my independent and honest review the game is great even with all the issues it still has i will highly recommend the game for anybody who is serious about city builder games if you re not sure if the game will run well on your hardware you can try it and refund if it doesn t work out for you
