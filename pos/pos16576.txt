2017 early access review finland simulator strangely fun and each time i play i find myself losing hours of my life its silly and fun but also really annoying in some places but i felt so accomplished once i got the car running and was able to drive it for a few seconds before the drive gear fell out forgot a bolt whoops dthe controlls can be a bit hard to get used to at first and the driving takes some learning but the game has a charm of its own that i feel like you should experiance if you like this type of game i call them work simulators like harvest moon or stardew valley euro truck farming sim etc i blame robbaz for my purchase of this game but i don t regret it 10 10 would fall in septic tank and die again
