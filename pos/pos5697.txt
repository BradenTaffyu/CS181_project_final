2022 early access review mount blade ii bannerlord is a great game in alot of ways but it falls short and is disappointing in several key areas if you are someone who liked mount blade warband for it s multiplayer and you never played much single player or didn t really enjoy the single player experience and you are buying bannerlord specifically for the multiplayer experience stay away please do yourself a favor and move on if you are looking for a good medieval multiplayer game where you can fight other players and hack and slash with your friends consider chivalry 2 or mordhau or even for honor you would be far better off simply put bannerlord s multiplayer is bad the hit boxes suck the connection is terrible every server lags the maps are bad the combat feels off the spawns are terrible the gamemodes have subtle changes that don t make any sense overall it s just a giant mess all of that being said if you are someone who liked warband s singleplayer experience you want to play bannerlord s single player and you are looking for a cool refreshing medieval rpg game that you can pour loads of hours into as you rally your armies and carve out a chunk of the world for yourself then look no further bannerlord s singleplayer is really good bannerlord takes everything that was great about warband s multiplayer and throws it out the window and takes everything about the single player and builds upon it the end result is a detailed in depth single player journey that is a great deal of fun
