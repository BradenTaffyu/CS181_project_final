early access review i bought this game thought it was trash refunded it tried it again years later thought it was trash let it sit in my steam inbox for months tried it again finally understood what its all about and now i love it unfortunately the devs didn t balance the xp system go to sandbox settings make xp gains 5x turn infection to saliva only and zombification rate to never that way if you get bit you get sick but never die makes being bitten a bad thing but not a game ending thing turn all loot rarity to extremely rare or insanely rare have fun
