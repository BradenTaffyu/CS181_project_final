2018 finally after 110 hours i have completed my first souls game taking all the time in the world to truly immerse myself in the world of dark souls this game has done something for me that barely any other game has been capable of doing making me feel genuinely powerful emotions this is a game about life and death if you like me back in april 2016 on my xbox had never played a souls game before you ll learn very quickly that death is a frequent occurance but this game is still fair something that hidetaka miyazaki genius who was the director of ds1 and ds3 said in an interview that has stuck with me is that he doesn t see the game as difficult but moreso challenging this way of thinking really changed the way i see games no and now it s hard for me to go back to other games because of the challenge and sense of accomplishment gained from overcoming a challenge in this game and that s where the the emotions come into the picture the intense feelings that i have gotten while fighting boss spoilers the nameless king is something i haven t felt in a boss fight or a fight in any game really i died so repeatedly while fighting this boss and when i finally slew the bane of mine and many other player s existances spoilers completely optional boss too spoiler i realized that my hands were shaking my breaths were fast and shallow and i was sweating that 7 minutes fight made me truly appreciate how amazing this game is around this point which is very late game is when i really got into the lore of the game buying dark souls 2 sotfs and i m going to pick up the remaster of the original for more stability than the original this game got me into now one of my favourite series in gaming as i m a sucker for good stories and depp lore this game s world really enthralled me all in all this has been such an incredible journey for me about 2 years down the line from console to pc to a new chosen ash this game will always have a special place in my heart and i hope it can do the same for you this game is so deep and complex it can make some of the most incredible things happen things that you will remember for years the way the combat is weighty and slow but still fast paced and exhilarating is the perfect way to make thrilling gameplay that always has you on the edge of your seat deciding whether to press on and risk death or to head back to the bonfire to spend your hard earned souls this game is phenomenal and something that i believe is a masterpiece of indirect storytelling rpg mechanics akin to d d and gameplay that makes you feel like you truly accomplished something meaningful i would recommend this game and the dlc get them together though they work so much better together than separate any day at full price this game is amazing
