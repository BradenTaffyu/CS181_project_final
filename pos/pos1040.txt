early access review spent hours clearing out a military zone on one of my first modded playthroughs ended up with a ton of loot packed up in my vehicle my character was exhausted and sleepy so i figured one night s rest in one of the tents wouldnt hurt saw the sick moodle pop up and worsen as i watched helplessly unable to wake my character up when he finally did wake he died instantly furious i looked it up to see if it was some kind of bug but quickly found out that my character wasnt a fan of the dead corpses lying around inside peak realism 11 10 experience would recommend to masochists
