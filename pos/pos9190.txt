2016 stellaris is a grand strategy game set in space made by paradox it s perhaps the first strategy game i have played in a very long time when i was younger command conquer games were some of my favorites and also age of empires but during the years i jumped into different genres i guess i haven t played paradox s earlier games much at all but i absolutely love stellaris in stellaris your goal is to build a galactic empire when you start the game you have the option of choosing from about 8 pre defined species to start your journey as or you can completely create your own species which i enjoy doing there s about 6 species groups and 60 70 different species to choose from home planet type design of your ships buildings your traits that define your race like breeding speed are they militaristic empire or peaceful ones i maybe used one hour on first time to design my fox people it s really fun before starting game you get to choose the galaxy size galaxy shape from few options ai opponent amount etc max amount of stars currently is 1000 and it is huge youtube video play wait or avoid review of stellaris views 24 589 play wait or avoid reviews cover the latest indie games early access games and aaa titles in a way that doesn t rely on scores anyway there are a lot of things you get to customize before you begin conquest also there is a thing called iron man mode which i didn t realize to put on first it s like a hard more and you only have one save game the auto save so there is no returning back from mistakes it also enables achievements the gameplay is fun and there are a lot of things to learn it s just a pure joy watching the solar systems exploring new areas and slowly spreading your empire it can feel overwhelming first the kind of slow pace in this game is great you will encounter many new species and will they be your enemy or friend that is up to you combat isn t very detailed but that is okey the tutorial also for is good and the ai voice helps a lot along the way if you choose so multiplayer is sweet friends can join your game and take control of one ai species so you can conquer the galaxy together or you can start a new game completely soundtrack of stellaris is quite epic and it s very enjoyable to listen to while exploring ost reminds me of movies like interstellar and tron legacy or games like mass effect and deus ex human revolution so fans of those will surely love it a good music is important with a long game like this in my opinion anyone who loves sci fi and strategy genre pick this game up you will maybe like stellaris too i can imagine spending hundreds of hours with this i d play it non stop if i only didn t have so many other games to play too it s a stellar experience
