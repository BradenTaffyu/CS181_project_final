2023 hello fellow reader i m going to write a rather hefty review for this one so for your ease i ll separate it into 3 sections my personal opinion pros and cons tips for new players 1 my personal opinion oxygen not included oni in short is a somewhat hardcore 2d colony builder that scratches the industrial engineering itches perfectly make sure your creativity gland and patience is warmed up and you re ready to dive into oni s world the game s early and mid game are very decisive in how your colony develops into it s late stage and are thus enticing and important usually if you can t get past the early burdens and find it hard to have fun early on the later stages aren t gonna help you that much sorry in terms of graphics which are cute mechanics content performance and overall gameplay i rate this game 8 75 10 i believe scoring a game 9 10 or higher requires it to be in a different generally speaking better league unfortunately oni is not perfect and i will mention the issues in the pros and cons section 2 pros and cons high content value that comes with the game s challenges buildings managing exploration etc pretty graphics that grant visual aid for a better comprehension of the surroundings materials gases etc multiple viewing options for better collecting data and information in your colony world such as temperature overlay automation overlay etc the pace of the game is almost controllable through creative designs and researches meaning you can either rush the game or live like neanderthals for a considerable amount of time mod support after playing oni for 150 hours you will be eligible to obtain bachelor s degree in industrial engineering metallurgy electrical engineering computer science management chemistry aerospace engineering and architecture insufficient bad item building explanation can cause confusion imbalanced late game mechanic only in the base game which i m gonna hide it under the spoiler marker just incase annoying high meteor shower rate can make space expansion very frustrating priority system sometimes doesn t work as it should especially during yellow and red alert phases game lacks a few important qol stuff that you should add through mods minor graphical bugs in the late stages of the game performance can become an issue in the dlc 3 tips for new players i ll try to share as many tips as possible without spoiling the game remember this game is all about creativity if you re having issues with the challenges of oni i suggest you create a sandbox world alongside your main world so that you can quickly test your creations and designs without wasting time energy and materials in your main world a large chunk of the enjoyment comes from seeing your own designs succeed use online sources only as a tool of inspiration when necessary don t copy paste everything you see online oni is a game not an assignment to be quickly done with i suggest having these mods installed to improve your gameplay bigger zoom show building ranges always check your overlays having germs and temperature under control from the beginning is way better than having to deal with them in later stages once they ve grown out of control be mindful of unsustainable resources look for renewable materials energy sources to ensure your colony s long term survival i recommend the spaced out dlc for newcomers over the vanilla world comments will be allowed to share more tips pros and cons thanks for reading update 1 mod clarification removed pliers mod from suggestions as it has been just added to the game thanks klei
