2020 abu labl dabukatu abab gugaloobabooafter years of waiting sims 4 is on steam finally i ve waited for this day so much sims 4 is a perfect game to relax or just failing at your sim life just like your real life or maybe you want to realize your broken dreams or deepest desires play it then it s good old sims but unfortunately it has some bad old problems since the very first game i couldn t understand and it was annoying me badly why the time goes so fast that you spend half of the day in the bathroom making meals and eating but this so far the only one significant negative point i could think of character creation is greatly improved you have much more freedom to create your character you can alter your body greatly adjust the weight lots of customization options and if you add mods you basically can create whoever you like there s also gender options preferences so lgbt people won t feel neglected here you can also pick few perks for your sim positive or negative it s up to you your life goal your temper and so on there s a lot replayability value in this game due to how different your sim can be each time after creating your sim as you already know you pick the house and start your life there are life goals job relationships my favorite activity so far is beating my neighbor every few days i don t know why anger issues probably of course most the time passes when you re at work and sleeping so just like in real life there s not a lot of time left for something else feeling tired and don t want to start talking with people go troll teh forums or give money to charity which apparently was a scam then go outside beat your neighbor again and insult him then go play piano while other people do pushups beside you come back home call the girl have some fun time eat leftovers and go to sleep or maybe you want to live in a cute world by building your perfect house decorated with unicorns and rainbows ok lets get serious the map is pretty small and while there s a lot to do and achieve there s still too little content i kind of understand and agree with dlc expansions this is not a yearly franchise the game is supported for years so having dlc s is not a bad practice plenty of very successful games do that and community loves them they add content you might be interested and you re not forced to buy a new game each year from seasons pets to vampires there s also some cosmetic dlc s which are not necessary at all i love this dlc model but the problem with it is the pricing dlc s a greatly overpriced yes it s good letting you choose what you want while supporting developers but seriously these prices are insane dlc s like seasons university pets should either be included in the game or sold at much lower prices the ones like star wars or vampires are different thing they feel out of context and more resembles real additional content not everyone is interested in those so it makes sense selling them separately and maybe at slightly higher price there s a lot of dialogue options and actions so you can approach different people as you wish maybe there could be slightly more choices but it s not bad i don t know if it s just me but managing needs feels easier in sims 4 in previous games i had problems with various needs besides bladder and hunger of course here i can easily keep my sim happy modding community is huge for this game there are really good mods out there mostly cosmetic stuff but you can even mod drugs violence murder and sex of course it all depends on your taste but i associate sims with innocent and cute game for escaping the real world so mods like this seems out of place but hey they are there and it could be fun from time to time graphically the game is wonderful it s far from revolutionary on a technical side obviously but it looks great for its art style and overall aesthetics small details like emotions food your pc screen and other small things have enough detail performance is very good it runs smoothly without any lag or stuttering this was the reason why i couldn t play sims 3 even after applying all the fixes the lagging was annoying ultrawide is supported out of the box i m playing on 3700x 2070s 32gb 3440x1440 and getting 90 fps sound same as graphics is great talking is usual sims blabbering in alien language which is really funny but you can easily understand if the sim is angry happy etc from the tone of his voice there s also music you can listen to radio or play music yourself there are few genres to choose from but i miss metal of course and maybe more songs overall playing instruments sounds so good sometimes i slow the time and just listen great songs there if you love sims it s obviously a good choice because there s simply no other game which would offer something like this but the main game lacks content so you probably will need couple of dlc s to enrich the fun or maybe simple mods will be enough anyway at a sale price it s a no brainer one thing i really wish and that would very simple to add are achievements please ea do it prosgood graphicsgreat performancegood customizationcutereplayabilitygood sound design musicplenty of
