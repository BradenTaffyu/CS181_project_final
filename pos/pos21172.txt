2018 not to be vulnerable but i play this game whenever i m sad and ive developed quite an appreciation for it the gameplay itself is super fluid and the visuals are all super cute and colorful my favorite part though is the exploration the map is quite large with tons of nooks and crannies to explore each area usually adds something new to the game whether it be a new species of slime new crops unlockables gordos or just a secret area in general there are also a bunch of objectives you have meaning there is always something to do personally for me getting to the top rank of the 7zee rewards club took the longest the wilds and the nimble valley also may take a while depending on if you take your time or not collecting the resources i only remember running into one glitch when the wilds first came out i believe i posted a gif of it somewhere either way everything else is solid the whole game just has this cheerful atmosphere due to the soft environments the calming music and the fact that i have free range and can do whatever i want with my ranch sorry im not very goot at making reviews but i really do recommend this game
