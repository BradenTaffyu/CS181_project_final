2023 early access review spoiler free reviewedit 11 25 2023 still the goat legendary game now with even more animation caves of qud hardly needs an introduction it s reputation precedes it it s a game with near infinite mechanics that mesh and interact with each other in a meaningful way all in the gameplay style of rogue i would even call it the definitive traditional rogue like not to be mistaken with a roguelite you may notice that this game also has a theme in their negative reviews i ll explain those later is one of those game where no matter how you play it no matter what you change and even if you play the exact same way every time you ll leave your run with unique stories scenarios and new knowledge to exploit it s practically designed to let you exploit the hell out of it it s best experienced in classic mode but you should definitely play in wanderer mode to have saves or even use debug settings to just give yourself quicksaves to get a hang of the game you will need a numpad to play the game proper but mouse is an option and the devs even made controller feel good in a traditional rogue like it s seriously impressive how many options you have to play learn and adapt to the gameplay all you need to know before playing is to use the look button and to bring a thesaurus this game s writing is immensely good with the heaviest purplest prose ever put in a game looking gives you knowledge and knowledge is power if you find an item that doesn t tell you directly what it does just equip it anyway it ll almost always become more clear with some time take notes on the steam overlay or on paper too it will greatly increase your enjoyment of the game read the books with yellow text in the title especially corpus choliys once you get a hang of the controls don t be afraid to use the auto explore button if you re convinced just play it don t let the early access stuff scare you this is a complete experience with reliable constant updates and a well fleshed out gameplay loop you might even find it quickly become one of your favorite games or even just something fun to do while listening to a podcast or long video i know it is for me oh right if you re wondering about the weird ass negative reviews talking about communist devs discord bans or q girl s character existing a youtuber made a video about this game that has an immense amount of views that video can be entertaining but the video creator was also kind of a to the devs which many of his followers saw as an example to continue themselves you can safely disregard any negative reviews that mention any of the aforementioned things as reactionary thinking they re cool and edgy check their gaming history they re still playing this cool ass game and that should speak more volume than their crying and pissing thank you freehold games you made something truly special here
