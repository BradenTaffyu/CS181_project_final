2020 before i begin a warning this game will consume your life and you will be very happy about that fact i have about 500 hours in the game spent doing just about everything that i could i love this game 9 5 10pros the writing easily the strongest suit of the game so many memorable lines so much thoughtful lore so many companions and npcs that felt like people 10 10 truly a cut above when it comes to worldbuilding and writing an interesting setting you will grapple with tough moral decisions as the game goes on and the game allows you to take the path that might not be the best for everyone not to mention the all roads comics and the speech checks for a little extra lore and wild wasteland perfect the music you have two main music options the radio which plays a set of 50s era songs while occasionally peppering in news pieces from around the wasteland or the ost which is excellent big iron will always hold a special place in my heart but so will the haunting ost with its western music roots the exploration the mojave wasteland and new vegas feel like they should the desert is deserted but still has life in all the cracks caves towns camps you name it new vegas is the old world reborn the height of post apocalyptic society both feel like they ve been through a nuclear war and the world is trying to pick up the shattered pieces as you find more and more remnants of the past quests the lifeblood of any rpg the main quest is about the fight for power over new vegas waged by the ncr the legion and mr house himself you the courier in the employ of mr house are quite mad about being shot and you traverse the mojave to set things right along the way you meet more groups of people and you have the opportunity to help those groups leaving places better or worse than you found them plenty of quests are unmarked but nearly all are worth trying once a lot of these quests will require thought on your part about how they will affect the world around you and how your character would deal with it dlc worth every penny the three main dlc add about 20 hours of story each more if you explored fully as well as new perks and companions plus cool lore gun runner s adds better guns and the last few allow better roleplay options cons crashes you will never truly get used to these there are a couple guides on using the nvac mod and i would say do this did genuinely frustrate me into dropping the game in early hours but with some tweaking they became mostly minimal and only occurred once every few hours combat while new vegas triumphs in storytelling and meaningful choices trying to kill someone is nearly always an incredibly tedious venture melee is very rarely fun and is nearly useless against certain ranged characters meanwhile aiming a gun is a difficult system at the best of times with the sole exception of stealth sniper rifles for the most part however it s pretty bad vats helps with this a little but at the end of the day combat is not good on the whole fallout new vegas is one of the best western rpgs of the 21st century and there is so much that you can get lost in i played until i had every achievement had done every companion quest everything i could think of in dlc i ve played cannibals and pacifists and lesbians just to mess with cass stupid and intelligent strong and weak there s so much to do and so many secrets to find if you love gunplay this might not be the best game for you but if you can best past it you ll find one of the best written games around
