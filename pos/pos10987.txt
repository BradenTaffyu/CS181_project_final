2023 this is probably going to be an amazing game once the issues are resolved however i would like to make it very clear that the skylines community are not a bunch of idiots we realise we have been missold a game that is still in beta release as a gold release at full price because paradox publishing need the money to keep the developers employed this has annoyed me its as if everyone after covid 19 lockdown are scamming people in economic survival but its the one thing we have all shared as a global community and would all understand i m not slamming the devs or even the publishers i m just pointing out that we are not idiots and know this game is still in beta and shouldn t have been released as a gold release we all know this and are a bit upset you didn t think we would notice we have i would recommend this game once it reaches the gold release standard and actually functions as advertised in the trailers it will probably take at least 6 months or so until it is fit to purchase as a playable proper game its not the devs fault they have done an amazing job with a very complex game and i understand why paradox have released it in order to make the business function but they could have released it as a beta game at half price until it was fit for gold release got the skyline community to test it and give it fantastic reviews and fixed all the issues without all the hype and great expectations even the modding communities would have fixed half the issues for free and the asset creators could have posted images of assets to come hindsight paradox of a community that likes to be involved and improve upon a brilliant game make use of your community don t exclude and gaslight them
