2021 this is not a perfect game the pacing is a little wonky at times it is fairly tedious and full of busy work the game isn t terribly well balanced there are probably thousands of little negatives anyone can come up with however make no mistake this game is a masterpiece a game dripping with undeniable amounts of passion i have never seen a game have the story is phenomenal the horror elements expertly contrasted with a care free fa ade the soundtrack brilliantly balanced between emotional and gamey every inch of this game flaws and all comes together to create one of the most beautiful and haunting games i have ever played you will laugh cheer smile worry cry fear all in the first few hours then the cycle repeats until you stop laughing cheering smiling until all you can do while playing the game is fear or cry don t worry the positive moments take up just as much screen time if not moreso or worry because it only accentuates the pain anyway this game deserves your money it is a slow burn it might bore you at first i beg you and everyone else to play it through even if you need to drag your feet through it it will be worth it for the story alone
