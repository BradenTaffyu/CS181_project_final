2023 i m a stay at home mom to 4 boys my husband s coworker is an avid hunter who suggested this game to him just for fun saying that it was how he gets his fix when he can t be out there doing it himself my husband liked the game well enough but often i found i was more into it than he was asking him when he would play again all the time so i could watch lol he got me a controller for pc and told me to just go download it myself so here i am it s a fun way to pass time when the kids are down but they enjoy watching me play too something you can put down for a while and come back into it having just as much fun as you did when you left off life got the best of me and i stepped away for about a year but the thoughts of the piebald moose i found kept coming to my mind and i m back on another kick
