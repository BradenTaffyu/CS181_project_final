2020 early access review it s definitely early access lot s of features not fleshed out poorly explained honestly more like not explained at all and there s probably a year or more of work to be done before this game needs to be released for finial launch that being said it s got all the structure of a truly amazing game from a developer whose managed to create great games in the past it is playable but you can tell it s very much so early access from how powerful you are with archery from the very beginning to how difficult it is to successfully be a merchant i m recommending this game because it s currently on sale at release if you re going to buy this game at some point in the future and you ve got the money now you might as well get it on sale
