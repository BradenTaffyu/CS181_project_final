2020 war war never changes ok in fact the total war series changed quite much often to get better sometimes for the worse empire and it s clone armies i m looking at you anyway arguably one of the biggest changes was cas turn from historical to fantasy warfare by far not all fans of the series were happy about that and some still are not but hey you can never please everyone but they implemented it quite well the heroes were born for one which can influence every battle quite more drastic than every general was ever able to also storyline elements from warhammer lore were implemented the quests which pepped up the dry warmongering days quite a bit last but not least ca used the biggest advantage of the fantasy world to it s full extend variety if i mentioned empire above of course many of the historical games shogun three kingdoms etc had the problem of very similiar looking and feeling sides and armies in warhammer they lived the variety of the world to it s fullest so that you even have different uis for each faction and quite different gameplay tweaks this way each playthrough with a different faction feels quite different and offers you new possibilities and tactics this is what they continued also in most of their dlcs and what needs to be appreciated to keep a game alive in over three years with really new content in nowadays fast living gaming society at once i only could name paradox for a similiar longelivity of their products by providing fresh content without speaking about mmos etc ofc graphically and technically the game improved quite well too as at the beginning there were quite some ugly animations and ofc bugs which are mostly corrected by now so that you can even have a nice multiplayer campaign by now the one and only drawback for me is cas typical endgame modus operandi in bringing some new and overkill enemy as final boss here the chaos invasions i never liked this forced way but this can very well be personal taste conclusio if you like total war gameplay and or warhammer fantasy you should give the game a try and look forward to the third part which hopefully will bring among other things the diplomacy improvements three kingdoms had rating 9 10ps 100th review goes to a deserving game
