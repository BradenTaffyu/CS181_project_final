2016 many people leave the game running to clock ridiculous numbers of hours and say something stupid like it s okay i didn t i ve clocked each and every one of these hours with actual gameplay or modding and testing and it is far far more than merely okay if you ve been living under a rock and you still haven t gotten around to playing this yet you re missing out i can t even count the number of characters i ve played through to varying stages of completion probably in the forties by now with tale of two wastelands porting over all of the fallout 3 goty content if you own that one too the hours i ve clocked and the numbers of characters i ve played have tripled sure it s buggy the graphics were outdated when they came out let alone for 2016 the 50 s schtick wore thin enough in fallout 3 and they tried lampshade hanging on it in this one but all they wound up doing is showing how stupid it is to run around with a lampshade on some questionable design decisions sometimes linear plot invisible walls vast tracts of empty dialogue that sometimes vastly misses your actual motivations where s my because i don t like being used option when playing the wild card but this game is ten times the roleplaying game that fallout 4 even dreams of being and twice the game that fallout 4 actually is
