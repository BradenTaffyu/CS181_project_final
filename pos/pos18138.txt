2018 great game for what it is if you are into the total war franchise then this is definitely something for you but wait to buy until on sale i had to wait 6 months but just couldn t get myself to pay 59 for 5 year old game pros great looking graphics attention to detail on many levels besides just fighting units resource management part of running your empire good characters can have real impact developing your different cites provinces can be done very differently and diversely depending resources and what tech tree you develop good fun with extra added political part of the game experience agents spy champion delegate can have real impact in game and very diverse in their use what skills they have cons ai is atrociously stupid barbarians greeks egyptians all of them just charge head long into your nicely set up roman legions they never flank with cavalry or skirmisher wait for you to attack or use ranged missile units catapults etc effectively neither do they utilize landscape or other natural features you attack an enemy that hugely outnumbers you and instead of taking advantage of the landscape high ground hiding in woods and the fact that you must attack them to not lose because you initiated combat you will lose in 60 minutes combat time if you just stand there the enemy should just wait and pelter you with missiles and wait for you suicidal hopeless attack instead they will rush you so that it is them instead experiencing above described attack naval battles i don t even bother to cumbersome and it all comes down to ramming boats i just auto resolve all battles attacking settlements cities is still something that is hopelessly bad when coming to maneuvering the unites around within city or towards walls as in every other tw game blood and gore dlc in a game that is all about warfare really summary if you like the tw franchise and building up an empire in a historically well done period as the roman one and isn t to bothered about the real time strategy fighting then this is a good game for you i d wait to buy it until it is on sale as its worth 20 but not 59
