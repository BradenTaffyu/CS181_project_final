2021 ok i will compare don t starve and don t starve together in this review so if anything sorry for spoilers i honestly think that don t starve together is a great co op game while i also find it well it s difficult to explain it is different from the original don t starve it is strange because the developers actually added more lore and more plot because of don t starve together but for me it always felt like the coolest part of the story was inside the original game it was because of feelings i had while playing through the adventure mode where you have to beat five worlds in a row and reach the end it wasn t exactly the end end but i guess i never felt anything plot related while i played don t starve together even though i greatly appreciate how the game works and all challenges and all gameplay mechanics i just think you won t be able to find story related feelings unless you re good specifically at that at finding story related feelings inside co op games which i guess isn t impossible since people like league or overwatch or what not game mechanics are just great in this game and i value that a lot and soundtrack is perfect to my taste i didn t actually want to give well rounded opinion and tell about each and every aspect of the game but i wanted to share my specific point of view since it s the most interesting type of reviews for me personally do note that i spent tons of hours playing this game with my friends and boy we were having a blast
