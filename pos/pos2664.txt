2023 another masterpiece from projectmoon the game might look and feel overwhelming at the beginning there s just so much information displayed here and there normal battles are basically simplified version of library of ruina battle while abnormality battles battle against scp like creatures mostly follows how it was in lor the story in this game is just amazing they really did great job portraying each sinner s back story even the filler chapters between each sinner chapter is interesting there are prequel games to limbus library of ruina and lobotomy corporation but even though it takes the same settings as the previous pm games you can hop on to limbus and still enjoy its story altough playing library of ruina and lobotomy corporation will make you have better understanding of the world setting and battle system if you haven t tried library of ruina i d recommend playing it especially if you like deckbuilder game but for lobotomy unless you re into management game you can check the story recap for it since it s a very hard management game and i don t think majority of people would like to play it to the end nevertheless lobotomy corporation is still a good game
