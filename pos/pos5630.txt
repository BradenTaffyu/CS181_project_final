2021 early access review tl dr conclusionthis game is a jarring overambitious mess but watching your character grow from a baby into a unique leader watching your army grow from a band of young recruits into unique and devastating fighting force that would make any man in its way pray watching your friends and foes form and the world around you change because of it are things i would say only this game has been able to give me no other as with many early access games my relationship with this game is one of love and hate so much of this game is stuff i ve always wanted in games like this and haven t seen done well pretty much anywhere else smaller scale unit tactics with more focus on the individual and the feeling of actually being there in a medieval battle simulated and dynamic systems like economy logistics morale intuitive unit progression even combat physics to calculate how much damage is being done by a particular weapon at a particular speed with a particular type of strike through a particular armour rpg style skills with really creative perks and progression that very subtly and effectively makes you feel like you and your character are improving together etc now all of the things i just mentioned i would say put this game above many other strategy and battle sim games because they are things which increase immersion they help put you in the shoes of your character and feel like you re playing in a living breathing world the strength of this game is its depth and immersion if any of you reading this have played this game at all you ve probably noticed something very wrong with that statement this game will constantly rip you right out of your immersion and make you very consciously aware that you re playing a video game the combat physics don t make any sense half the time there s been an up to date realistic battle mod on the nexus for the majority of this game s existence which fixes these issues making combat far more satisfying and i m shocked the devs still haven t addressed this walking around towns and villages which should be where immersion really shines feels like you re walking through a ghost town with statue npcs with terrifying expressions who don t say anything and a town ambience mp3 being played through hidden speakers in the facade houses dialogue between characters may as well be non existent with visual novel text boxes with bland writing and the most nonsensical dialogue skill checks i ve possibly ever seen the repetitive monotonous nature of putting your men into the same positions and the same formations at the start of every battle every 5 minutes these things are scratching the surface of the list of things that give constant immersive whiplash while playing this game i understand these things can come with early access titles but with this game supposedly leaving early access this year i don t see enough of these issues being addressed and i m concerned that tw is running out of time and or budget i m not acutely aware of how game development works but i m slightly baffled that they seem to come out with new armours every patch when more items is the last thing the game needs right now i worry the loud minority of the reddit page etc are giving the devs a false image of what players care about i couldn t care less if imperial armour is unbalanced or if the long glaive is overpowered during game release when every npc i look at makes me feel like i m playing a parody maybe i m in the minority too but to me it really feels like the devs have their priorities mixed up and that this game will remain very much unfinished during it s 1 0 release which is a real shame considering how much i love the unique feeling this game can give me in its strongest moments the concept is so brilliant but as much as i want it to i just don t think this game will ever reach its full potential that being said i will continue to love this game and try to contribute feedback where i can for likely years to come and will recommend it for its strengths nonetheless
