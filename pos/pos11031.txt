2023 at first i was disappointed with the game but after playing it for a while i have started to like it much more than the original version even without mods this game is pretty good so far i like it much more since you don t have to worry about mods breaking your cities while still having a lot of good mods implemented into vanilla cities skylines 2 eventually when mods are added i will update this review
