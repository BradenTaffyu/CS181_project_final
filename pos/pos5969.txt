product received for free i still miss the sims 3 it was more immersive the sims 4 is a downgrade in many areas no open world removed colour wheel and pattern options it s been out since 2014 but still have not added cars bikes and other vehicles in the game life simulator the sims animations are wonky everyone acts like cartoons it ruins the immersion needs more maturity dlcs are overpriced most of them contain content which should have been included in the base game itself it just feels like there was so much potential to this game which was wasted there are many things that are an improvement to the sims 3 like the build mode cas clay like looking sims ui multi tasking inclusiveness etc it is a good standalone game when not compared to ts3 and its nostalgia shout out to the modding community they are the ones who keep this game ever interesting ea should pay them xdanyways the base game is free so that s a win for people who had not already purchased the game enjoy
