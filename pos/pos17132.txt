2017 product received for free introductionso the time has finally come for me to write about another sequel which has surpassed its predecessor in nearly all aspects the gaming industry does fare better than its film counterpartin this regard total war warhammer ii is currently my favorite in the entire creative assembly series and this was not to be expected in all honesty in fact i have to admit that i was quite skeptical at the developer s decision to explore a full fantasy setting when they first announced total war warhammer in 2015 it took me another year to finally play it once msi had bundled a steam key for it along with a new motherboard i bought from them as a history buff and fan of the warhammer 40k series i really didn t think that the warhammer fantasy setting would succeed but i was proved wrong simply the introduction of magic and all sorts of monstrous creatures would have never been a formula for success on its own ca had to integrate games workshop s rich lore and adapt it to the total war series signature hybrid genre of real time battles within a turn based campaign strategy gaming at its finest given the right circumstances such as sufficient development time proper quality assurance and last but not least learning from past mistakes while listening to what the established fanbase desired total war rome ii took many months after its launch and even more patches just to be playable on most systems but total war warhammer and now its sequel which i m writing about are quite stable from day one that is a very important step forward and while total war games remain pc exclusives and dependent in equal measure on cpus and gpus i knew that i had to play test them far longer than the time i allocate to most review projects i was not disappointed story while its precursor focused on the warhammer old world part of the eastern hemisphere total war warhammer ii went for a larger scale by including the entire western hemisphere and thus featuring the new world lustria naggaroth the ulthuan archipelago and vast swaths of the southlands from the deserts of araby to southern jungles of yuatek in case you didn t notice already the warhammer fantasy world is mirroring earth s own continents and oceans with the single exception being ulthuan which is in more ways than one a reference to the mythological sunken land of atlantis it is not only a change of scenery but also an opportunity for armies to take full advantage of the new types of terrain and the subsequent attrition which may assist or hinder the various warring factions depending on their racial affinities jungles deserts and frozen wastelands may prove an enemy as worthy as a well trained army if you re not carefully planning your campaign as with the intial total war warhammer the sequel also has a central theme and potential threat that requires the players constant attention instead of emphasizing on massive chaos invasions we now have to cater to a magical tornado the eye of the vortex is the name of the new main campaign and unsurprisingly it offers an excellent dynamic between focusing on the regional or player induced objectives and the one goal that truly matters gaining full control of the vortex all four playable races and their subfactions wish to exert their influence over this supernatural barrier created by the high elves in order to siphon the chaos taint while also preventing the resurgence of the nefarious daemons naturally not all races have the same intentions for the vortex but they must all subdue their rivals before claiming the final victory i shall of course focus on each race in as much detail as i can in the gameplay section below suffice to say for now that i enjoyed the vortex campaign far more than simply staving off one chaos doom stack an allegory i use to describe a full 20 unit roster that is also overpowered after another defending or attacking the vortex you ll still have to face auto spawned full stacks yet having to contend with them in sparse succession is the key to victory in this case divide and conquer my friends there s no denying that the entire map and racial choice seems more exotic more diversified from one cardinal point to another the save games are now better stored and categorized by faction so you can efficiently play with all races at the same time if you wish it s not the real time switch between these sovereign states like in crusader kings ii but it is a step forward from having all save games stacked upon each other proof that even small user interface changes can have a large impact on the overall experience graphicsthere s some debate online over the used graphics engine s name since some refer to it as warscape and some as simply being tw3 what truly matters is that it s proprietary to developer creative assembly and it is a visibile improvement over the series predecessor at launch total war warhammer ii had some minor frame rate drops which were fixed rather fast i m having the same solid performance now while playing the game maxed out on 2k resolution it s remarkable that while the battle maps aren t any bigger than in total war warhammer in the sequel they are far more detailed siege maps are especially a visual delight whether we re talking of the aztec like pyramids of the lizardmen or the sprawling castles of high elves you ll be witnessing fortifications that truly put to shame anything erected by the dwarfs or the empire of man apart from the maps the hud saw a nice overhaul which now implements the racial bonus malus system pertaining to the selected faction and the diplomacy menu has also been streamlined minor details from the campaign map become noticeable once a race captures all the settlements within a province and various objects and structures begin to appear within a few turns for example you ll be seeing a lot of warpstone meteorites and mine shafts or burrows once skaven corruption reaches a higher echelon within newly captured provinces or even neighbouring regions the influence bleeding effect is taking a literal meaning in this case vampiric corruption also features some extra visual assets that make the map stand out incremental improvements for certain yet if you ve played total war warhammer for a decent amount of time you ll notice and appreciate the changes implemented by the sequel audioeverything is top notch from the epic soundtrack to the convincing voice acting that s being portrayed in the same kind of diversity as the visual assets themselves the quirks and mannerisms of each faction are lore appropriate speech patterns aren t the only aspect that adds further personality to each faction leader and minions but they are the most prominent early on i couldn t find a single flaw in the audio department as a fan of epic music in general terms total war warhammer ii features more than a few tracks i d listen even outside the game gameplay verdict summary rating are below in the comment section
