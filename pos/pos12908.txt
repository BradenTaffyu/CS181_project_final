2022 the game is pretty satisfying you ll be heavily entertained by the core game and mods for a few hundred hours if you re into ragdolls gore and physics with mods it seems to add 100 200 more hours of fun when you reach 600 700 hours the fun seems to majorly slow down at the time of writing this the last update added to the game was two months ago in august which was a small update with nothing really significant i believe that if this game continues to add good content consistently the game will continue to remain fun and relevant in its current state the game urgently needs new maps npcs vehicles and syringes i would also recommend somewhat of a tutorial in the beginning of the game to teach players how to use the technology that is handed to us to make a simple contraption or two the game has lots of potential to become endless fun but the dev s need to continue to expand the game with the help of the community of course as someone who played this game for 800 hours i know that this game has the potential to reach twice as many hours maybe find a way to add a little bit of lore to the game as well then i see it becoming a cult classic it s a very cheap game so give it a play
