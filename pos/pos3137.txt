2016 early access review this game is a clear upgrade from d os but if you ve not played the game there s some things you need to know before buying this is a very traditional d d styled rpg this means that there ll be a lot of reading a lot of exploring puzzles and the game is generally quite difficult if you don t pay attention as an older gamer this is a massive throwback to the games i played as a kid but if you re into hardcore non stop action games this is not the game for you with that out of the way if you re an rpg fan and you love getting lost in a up and amazing world this is the game for you
