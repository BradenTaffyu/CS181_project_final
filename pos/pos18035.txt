2019 i never write reviews but i feel like i have to do it for this one this is right now a great game no matter what anyone says so far the best tw maybe with the exception from attila i have over 300 hours on rome 1 so i know what the franchise was the problem about this game and subsequent tw games its his very greedy publisher decisions too many minor dlcs to a very high price we can all agree it is outrageous on the other hand we are on steam and this game is on sale quite often i ve purchased it and all the dlc that interested me for about 30 40 which is a fair price for the product the game es very stable now still looks really good and it s really optimized some mechanics have poor balancing like spies that can starve to death small factions without any cost is a good example but for the most part they are engaging and fun i think it was a good step overall and a breeze of fresh air right now also diplomacy works pretty well it was not the case on near release battles are really fun and fluid and you can work out many strategies the best ones in the series for me also the faction pool imo it s awesome and the campaign map feels huge also there is a ton of npc factions which makes you appreciate the diversity in tribes back then the mixed reviews are deserved for it s disastrous release and greedy dlc policy but that doesn t change the fact that it is the best tw experience right now for me 8 5 10
