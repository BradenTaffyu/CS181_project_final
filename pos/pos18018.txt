2022 i think i have a fair amount of hours to say that overall this is a really good game and so far my favorite total war game however in saying that i do not believe it is the best total war game while i love it very much i fully acknowledge that previous total war games twice it s age still were doing better in many aspects of play and enjoyment though i don t think that means this game is a total let down as i genuinely love it with a passion and my complaints while sometimes major aren t deal breakers my first main complaint by far is difficulty this game is often times far too easy as some factions will not stop steamrolling once the ball is rolling rome itself is apologetically overpowered and while they are the literal name of the game the problem resides that it makes rome almost unfun to play if you know what you re doing as even a 12 man garrison of a random town in africa will often have over a thousand legionaries more than capable of holding of 4000 of a mid tier enemy army which leads further into difficulty as the ai will almost never field high tier armies often opting on some occasions for mid tier armies and almost always resorting to a low tier spear units that at best roadblock you from progress for 5 minutes to some this might be a bonus but i think it hurts replayability very much you can only have so much fun killing spear units that do a whopping 13 damage to your 105 defense 60 damage javelin volley throwing maniacs known as almost all mid tier sword units let alone the high tier ones you d surely field after decimating spear armies for so long what should be mentioned is this is not always true as for some factions the difficulty is actually quite good because the early game is challenging which makes the mid to late game steamroll feel rewarding almost all celtic factions suffer from public order very badly and as such make it very fun as you have to manage your budget and armies accordingly to prevent revolts empire divided for me personally has the best rome experience as aurelian s rome is horrifically hard early game and the subsequent unholy steamroll that follows if you don t give up is immensely enjoyable a few other complaints i have are missile units feel very poor compare to older games in regards to sound design and animation this is admittedly small but noticeable i encourage you to watch medieval 2 gameplay of archers vs rome 2 you ll notice a very noticeable decrease in quality in sound design animation and even graphically a game almost a decade older outperforming a new game in the same franchise is borderline unacceptable i am willing to forgive it as ultimately archers in rome 2 i believe preform far better than in medieval 2 in terms of combat effectiveness usually being honestly op in some scenarios if you really focused on bonuses just for them in mind but i digress on to some positives that make me come back to this game a lot rome 2 has many many factions a total of 117 dlc included however many share a lot of the same roster and culture but often field a few unique units and buffs to them exclusively regardless of the of the samey kind of feeling many factions can offer you due to similarities it still is a lot and even just half of them being good is more than enough to satiate someone s lust for replays however i want to immediately highlight 6 in particular i think deserve recognition 3 i ve personally played and 3 i think look extremely unique and fun dlc included factions i ve personally played 1 kush desert kingdoms dlc ca went far too hard for the desert kingdom dlc in general all of the factions are glorious but kush stood out to me in particular fielding one of the most unique rosters i ve seen and that is almost always capable of being improved all while being in an amazing start position makes this faction an absolute treat to play 2 aurelian s rome empire divided as mentioned this is rome but challenging i imagine many won t like it on that merit but to those who do aurelian s rome was one of the most difficult and rewarding campaigns i ever played in a total war game 3 the roman republic rise of the republic once again rome but hard very hard however it usually steamrolls very quickly once you take care of the pesky but numerous neighbors immediately hostile to you the roster being of the very early roman republic which most would hesitate to even call a professional army feels incredibly different from base game rome and empire divides factions i plan to play and believe will be very fun 1 carthage carthage is the only playable punic faction and one of only two factions to have 3 dynasties to choose from to get a variety of different faction bonuses this coupled with it s free upkeep merc army capabilities with enough dedication makes it seem like a constantly changing and unique army builder 2 nabataea desert kingdoms dlc a desert faction that embraces hellenistic culture and solid cavalry a dream come true for me as hellenistic and desert factions are by far my favorites the roster including pikemen desert hoplites and axe and sword units seems like truly a treat to behold for battles that in the income trade bonus is actually amazing if you really take advantage of the mediterranean 3 macedon probably the ultimate greek faction giving you all of what you could want with what i believe is the best pikemen in the game coupled with hopelites and fairly good cav the hammer and anvil was never better than with this faction overall i think i ve ranted on enough about this game perhaps to an unhealthy degree my ultimate take is i love this game and i almost wish i could go even more in depth i however do fully admit it might not be for everyone and that s okay i give it a strong recommend and think the desert kingdoms dlc empire divided and rise of the republic are very worth while dlc purchases if you do so happen to enjoy thank you for reading if you did
