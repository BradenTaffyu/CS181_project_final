2020 quite a deep game and quite addictive if you were to compare to project cars 2 its inferior in some ways for example livetrack in pcars2 and the night driving isnt as well lit in acc and the variety of cars is lacking as you would expect from a gt series racer however it does make up for it in some regards with the realistic feeling handling that to me does feel better than pcars2 but not by a long way its the steady but slow progression you make getting faster and faster that makes you come back for more personally i feel the ai is done slightly better in pcars as i was rammed quite a lot when first starting out in acc however as you get faster the ai ram less i have a feeling that its just low speeds where your car can accelerate or decelerate much faster that gives the ai less chance to react team customisation is a great feature and the types of hotlapping and racing variations is very good overall as a pcars 2 fan im suitably impressed with acc and it definately is a game i will play alongside if not more than pcars 2
