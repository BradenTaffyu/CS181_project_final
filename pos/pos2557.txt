2023 tl dr f2p friendly you can ignore the gatcha fomo nonexistant hard content can be ignored with no loss good story and characters edit with the recent walpurgis night event it s worth mentioning that there is a bit of fomo now as the event things can only be gotten from the gatcha until the next walpurgis night there should be 1 every 4 months but this isn t a big issue for anyone with a bit of patience or good luck if you re considering playing this game but are worried about it being a gatcha game just play it the game has it s problems since this is the first time project moon is making a gatcha or mobile game and everybody i ve talked to agrees that it s the most free gatcha game of all time there s no need to get duplicate characters there s no need to save your pulls for the limited time character in fact you can completely ignore the gatcha mechanic by spending your lunacy the gatcha currency on energy refills and simply farming the mirror dungeon until you can buy whatever e g o or id you want as soon as they re released the battle pass just makes grinding a bit easier and gives you early access to some battle pass e g os they re added to the shop and gatcha once that pass period ends and people have beaten basically all of the content in the game with just the base ids and e g os you get though it is a lot more difficult not to mention you can use friend s ids e g o as a support if you just need 1 id to make your team work as far as the gameplay goes yes it s confusing at first and yes the tutorial doesn t quite make sense but the story is a treat and once you ve spent some time using the combat system you ll slowly start to get used to it you can always look up fan made guides to the game s systems but the game gives you almost all of chapter 1 and 2 to get used to the system before giving you a real challenge and you can always level up your id s and brute force your way through most of the main story fights if you only care about the story one other way that limbus company is miles better than most other gatcha games out there is there s genuinely no fomo since the events are part of the main story they stay in the game you do lose some materials and cosmetics but nothing that would impact your gameplay the luxcivations dailies can be skipped once you ve beaten them once to simply claim the rewards the battle pass ends at level 60 and is the easiest thing in the world to complete it does give resources for levels after 60 and i m at level 282 from just dailies with 62 days left in the pass at the time of writing the hard content currently in the game consists of 2 things mirror dungeon hard md2h and refraction railway rr the mirror dungeon has a normal mode you can use to get the 3 weekly bonuses 250 lunacy for each bonus 750 for all 3 but you can run the dungeon in hard mode for rewards 1 time a week for 22 5 levels 15 base 2 5 for each weekly bonus you have left this is what makes md2h more time and energy efficient and if you don t feel like grinding out the game to get id s md2h makes it easy to get a good amount of rewards with minimal time especially since you can just quit after level 3 and claim the majority of the rewards you lose some pass xp but get all the lunacy refraction railway is the other part of the game considered hard it s an endurance gauntlet where you have to go through multiple hard fights in a row saving your resources and e g o so that you can beat it in as few turns as possible luckily for most people you can actually take as many turns as you want to beat the railway if you only care about the rewards last line they gave a guaranteed 3 season id extraction ticket and getting a low turn count is only for cosmetics and bragging rights not to mention you can borrow friends id s for this if you ve made it this far i would quickly like to mention that the story and writing for this game is a treat the reason you play project moon games is for the story first and the gameplay second limbus company has us follow the sinners as they journey through the city trying to collect golden boughs the sinners themselves are well written and have great chemistry together while the antagonists in the story are also well written and have their own goals they re trying to achieve unlike some other media the villians in this are actually competent and it s only with a lot of luck and skill that the sinners are able to actually complete anything it isn t until chapter 4 that they get a bough off of mostly their own effort instead of getting help lucky with the way the story is going you can expect limbus company to start by focusing on the sinners lives and what led them to become the way they are as you basically work through their trauma trauma dungeons to get the golden boughs as you do this you ll be introduced to more of the city and the different factions we ll be dealing with as well as their goals slowly becoming clearer
