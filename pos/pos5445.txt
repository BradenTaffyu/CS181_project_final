2019 early access review on my fifth day of being hopelessly lost in the sprawling rust wells i happened across a small group of scavenging arconauts they mumbled incomprehensibly and offered me overpriced trinkets but no help whatsoever they soon became the only constant in the diverse labyrinth of caves in which i found myself they strolled around passively flaunting their routine understanding of the cave s layout by the eighth day i took to killing them for sport i figured nobody would ever know and the artifacts they d found carried the promise of compensation when i could finally make my way back to argyve in joppa he owed me anyhow i petulantly thought after all it was for his damn wire that i went to the rust wells to begin with on the 10th day i found a tattoo gun and a couple canisters of ink possessed by irony i marked the backs of my hand with the image of a broken compass so that i might always remember my hopeless trek through the rust wells with triumphant fondness the next route i tried led me to a large pack of glistening unseemly slimes i channeled all my rage and hopelessness into the confrontation my carbide blades streaked blue light across the cave walls as i charged into the fray the first one i touched killed me in one hit this is the third or fourth quest in the game i ve barely been beyond the starting village buy this game
