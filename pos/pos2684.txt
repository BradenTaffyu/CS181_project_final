2017 i was tired of games that only tests your reaction skill i was tired of games that say it s 60 dollars only to have randomized loot boxes or micro transaction implemented later in time i was tired of games that were advertised to be wide as an ocean but ended up being shallow like a puddle then divinity original sin 2 came out each encounter is well executed and designed flawlessly enemy design is varied and leaves my friend and i saying wtf is that often every time my friend finds some epic loot we cannot wait to identify it to see who can make use of the item quests are a joy to do and often leads you to find more quests that s filled with important decision making every choice you make has an impact on the world and i have been sent to jail multiple times for making the wrong decision for 44 99 you are not buying a game but an experience an experience to truly go on an epic adventure fights are never easy but once you learn the satisfaction of besting the enemy combatant that you failed to take down multiple times you are left leaving for more glory currently playing on tactician mode i am not sure if anyone is going to read this review since this is my very first review with a positive rating my other review is for fallout 4 creation club so you already know what rating i gave but if you are looking for a game with challenge depth and quality give this game a try i have been playing this game for over 102 hours and i have a feeling that this is only the beginning
