2017 as thou this may not be the best total war game it s definitely my favourite one right from the beginning you have a huge option of factions to choose from most of them are wastly different for example the suebi tribes are barbarians but if you compare them to the arverni also barbarian tribe you find that their units have maximally one similiar unit which really gives good sense of replayability to all factions this tw game also has your generals spyes aging so your main upgraded general can die of old age right before his battle thus maybe even losing the battle for you because your newely recruited general doesn t have as much experience or morale as with all tw titles as you progress deeper in the campaign your empire expands you have higher income but you also spend way more on many armies new buildings to protect your realm you can finish the campaign by many goals warfare economic victory more then when you finish your campaign you can also play new free campaign emperor augustus which is set in the roman civil war adds few more cities to the map if you don t like singleplayer you can also play the amazingly constructed multiplayer where you can fight 4v4 battles with huge 20 or 40 unit armies obviously by playing againts players you can create tactics that would normally never work in singlepayer to defeat your enemies overall this game had a lot of problems on its release but the emperor edition upgrade really made this tw a game that you would gladly return to from time to time
