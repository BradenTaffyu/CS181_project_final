2016 stellaris is the new game from paradox the publisher developer of such titles as europa universalis victoria and crusader kings this review comes from someone with almost 500 hours on eu4 200 in ck2 and over a thousand in eu3 and vic2 each my steam hours are deceiving for those two games now here are the questions people ask when they first hear about it or want to know about it is it as hard as x paradox game and is it like civ the answers are no and no stellaris is a 4x game cleverly disguised as a grand strategy game exploration in the opening stages of the game you explore using science ships your surrounding systems while finding new planets to colonize and encountering events this is a typical space 4x mechanic and exists in most other games of the genre does this compare to other grand strategy games not really even eu4 s search function in the new world is different how is this distinct from other 4x games the events are more varied and better written and have far more interesting fluff colonizing colonization is a very simple build colony ship send ship wait mechanic as is similar to other 4x games actual land and building development is like a cross between civilization 4 5 and galactic civilizations 2 3 every planet has different tiles that you build buildings on each tile giving different static resources or none at all and you assign pops citizens to work each tile as they grow and spawn on the planet over time based on food surplus or migration from other colonies this is all very standard 4x there is not much that makes these features very distinct and it is done in a very standard way pops now comes the first mechanic that is even vaguely grand strategy pops and how they function every pop individually has four things a species ethics happiness and ethical divergence ethics are a feature in stellaris that begin based on your empire s governing ethics and vary from spiritualism to materialism to militarism and pacificm these are the reigning values that determine a great deal about the paths of tech you will go down to how your pops act and how other empires perceive you pops begin with these ethics but they change over time as generations are want to do ethics you can do all sorts of things to encourage or discourage this ethical divergence and whole populations of your original species may become wholly different from your core populations this mechanic has the most depth of any mechanic in the entire game in addition to these ethics you have a couple other tools available to you if you so wish to reign your empire as they require slavery and purging slavery makes pops work better in manual labor tiles such as farming and mining but work worse in tiles with research and similar things purging is literal genocide or xenocide want to imperium of man your way and purge all xenos go for it i was proud to see paradox allow that as they ve been historically wary of slavery or genocide but i guess aliens are less real than the actual slavery that happened in africa and america fu paradox don t revisionist history however even if this has the most depth it still has less depth than the pop system in vic2 tech the other entirely unique feature is the tech system tech works by drawing from a deck for 3 or more with modifiers cards which you can pick from to start your next research assignment based on three different research paths that operate parallel to one another after picking the tech you want to research the other two go back into the deck to be drawn later this means you may miss out on a tech for a while if you choose to skip it making important decisions early on even more pressing this becomes a lot less interesting in the lategame when most techs are already researched and there s a lot of repreated techs that fill up the lists so i hope more hard decision techs are added later ftl ftl travel has three methods all three of which are standard 4x tropes warp warp to any system in range cooldown warmup slowish travel time hyperlanes can only travel between connected systems fast minimal warmup and cooldown and warp gates build gates in systems huge range very fast little cooldown limited by aforementioned built gates these are very standard and if you ve played any other 4x games you know how they work war warfare is standard as well and the ship designer is a simple slot based affair where you stick weapons and modules into a design and it spits out damage and armor values on a generic ship model of which there is only one per class this will most certainly be expanded in an expansion though i would have liked to see something more indepth such as galciv s or star ruler 2 s systems it has a few different types of weapons that each are countered by different things this mostly matters in the early game because lategame weapons rek everything but aren t quite on the level of really late game galciv things diplomacy the game does not have very robust diplomacy i would say it s even slightly below par with other 4x games and most certainly extremely below par triple quad bogey with grand strategy games almost all of your relations have to do with your ethics and government types rather than logical tactical neccessity or events embassies are a boring shallow feature when there is nothing you can really do with it it seems entirely up to the ai who it wants to ally with and there s not too much you can do to affect that and if you go militarist well good luck finding allies additionally when you do have an ally you have to declare war together or not at all not being able to declare war on my own is an annoying and backwards restriction i can understand the restriction in the larger federations but i should not be locked to the wishes of my ally should i want to venture on something myself you can easily get around this by offering him a planet but then simply not giving it to him at the end of the war since apparently the ai just doesn t care exploits ai the ai is mediocre or even bad in most cases though it has that perfect micro that pdox ai often has where it can snipe things that you would never normally think about just because it can but when it comes to actually making good decisions it falls on its face performance performance is okay until the lategame when a lot of things are happening where it hits the really fast hopefully this is improved in time random events my primary complaint is the complete lack of non surveying events when you aren t surveying or observing pre ftl species there are just very few events that occur randomly and have something to read or think about this is the sprinkling of grand strat that even when you re waiting around for things to build you typically get a steady stream of events to read or do things with with the occasional big event you really have to deal with or think about with several of the quest lines being currently broken and the only other long event lines being the end game crises this is one of the big reasons as well as the lack of diplomacy as stated above the midgame is so reportedly boring war after war isn t fun and internal issues are sparse with so few events we ll certainly hopefully get more with expansions but that requires them to keep putting more of the grand strat wool over the 4x core rather than submitting to the masses who just want space civ overall it s a solid 4x game and a refreshing take on a genre space 4x that has been stagnant for years does it beat dw in complexity oh lord no does it beat galciv in raw gameplay not really does it beat other grand strats in flavor and atmosphere no so what is it a pretty good 4x game but a terrible grand strategy game maybe it ll be a proper one someday but not now awoo
