2021 robots are born their creators bring them into this world they are given names they are given purpose they are expected to contribute to society the sathori lizards loved machines more than most so much in fact they made themselves cyborgs slowly sometimes painfully through the crawl of the years when possibly not even the smallest trace of organic reptilian matter remained what they called themselves would syndicate their empire the undying circuit a goal as much as a descriptor probably machines that last for eons for ever expanding outward into the stars documenting catalouging analyzing assimilating it s humorous then that the concepts of irony and luck are lost on the robotic community how else to describe a machine empire that was simply not ready for it s time for when the galaxy councils found them their tech was good but not good enough to compete with the two largest empires in the known universe at that time who over the centuries would take turns battling the machines sometimes synchronously the last millennium of their existence was a near constant state of war but to a machine war is just another computation another set of data banks to fill to analyze they were mineral rich but planet poor in the billions of parsecs of space they explored and tamed the countless star systems surveyed and studied they were only known to have colonized 4 planets beyond synthon the machine world from whence they came a cruel jest of the gods had they had any that their expansion into the south yielded untold petabytes of data of resources but rarely spots they would make use of them who knows how the universe would look had they gone a different direction could even the qopinjaxi have survived if the machines had arrived earlier what unknowing throws of fate fell our way that tipped the balance control over the bottleneck star system raltry cannot be overstated the timely arrival of the legendary kabbloc husk squadron to not only save the star base at amlitzer but to shatter the machine naval might that had been eating systems for centuries or the decision of the commander admiral mayatl to disobey the command to rest refit his depleted fleet and instead surge outward into the abyss leading the machines own reinforcements on a chase through the stars that allowed us the time necessary to understand this enemy to create countermeasures that would be used against them and other rival empires encountered long after sending intel back until even the deep space scanners could no longer reach them despite the years and the living metal statue outside the naval college bearing his name myth has them running still and speaking of myths there is another brannamath the unconquerable robot planet the unknown lost 5th syndicate colony rumored to be somewhere in the deep deep reaches of empire space it was bombarded almost continually for 200 years generations of sailors were said to have cut their teeth on the mission to subjugate this world only to retire in failure if not dishonor untold thousands of ground troops were sent in transports to do what fusion missiles from space could not sacrificed to the assaultobot legions that could not be overcome that then simply reused the detrituse of battle to assemble more legions finally overlord lop dolf ii could stand no more he ordered a cease and desist the squadron was disbanded written in the books as destroyed in combat but whose remaining soldiers were sworn ordered on penalty of death to silence the emperor had the star system wiped from the charts and it was treason to even speak it s name there are records even of the penalty having been meted out for that offense but conspicuously leave crucial details from the accounts the only weapon that could possibly have finished them having been outlawed by the council ages before perhaps they were undying after all this was my first run through the game i was eventually crushed between two empires i couldn t compete with while they continously took back to back turns warring with me and even sometimes at the same time and sometimes at the same time while they were allied eventually one of those empires became the pre eminent one in that entire galaxy while the other was devoured from the back side while expending all resources helping to grind me into the dust mistakes were made and i learned a lot but the stars beckon with more stories sweet game
