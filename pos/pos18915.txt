2019 extremely fun strategy game its mechanics are hard to learn but there are plenty of tutorials on forums and youtube to help you get started the huge downside is the paradox dlc policy there are some old dlcs that are required to have the best experience possible but there are several that offer very little for a high price it seems that paradox is churning out dlc way too frequently with very little thought put into them i strongly suggest looking for guides to determine which dlc you want need and wait for a sale to get them
