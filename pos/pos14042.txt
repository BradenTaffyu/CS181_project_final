2020 this game is fun yet challenging to play it s definitely a game you won t get right the first time you play it s a game you play again and again and want to play again and again each time finding a slightly better or easier way to build your base and postponing your dupes from dying i found myself making a base playing for a few hours and then having the colony collapse because i overlooked some crucial system or neglected to research something in the tech tree in time no biggie just start a new game and don t make the same mistakes it definitely has a learning curve the game allows for your creativity to run wild in building up your base from practically nothing exploring new biomes expanding your base managing schedules and some dozen other minutiae and solving problems your base encounters how will you get the right resources in time how will you survive the vacuum of space how can my rocket make it to space how will you save your innocent dupe from boiling alive why am i out of oxygen again oh god all the machines are broken the mods you can get with this also help enhance the gameplay experience that s not to say the base game is lacking but the modding community is awesome and has so many quality of life mods and other assets that can change the feel of the game play modded play vanilla your experience playing this game is wonderfully up to you the developers also frequently update the game it also teaches you quite a bit about the cold unforgiving nature of science allowing you to experiment with running a base on an asteroid full of clones it s a great game that requires you to hone your problem solving and planning skills
