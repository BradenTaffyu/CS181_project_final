listen up gamers let me lay it out straight garry s mod is an absolute masterpiece of creativity and ingenuity when you stay far far away from those godforsaken darkrp servers now before you jump down my throat let me clarify gmod itself is a sandbox of endless possibilities the ability to create build and manipulate almost anything within its virtual world is nothing short of mind blowing from crafting insane contraptions to unleashing chaos with friends the core experience of gmod is unparalleled but oh the darkrp servers they re like a festering wound on an otherwise pristine landscape these cesspools of toxicity and immaturity are a blight upon the gaming community forget creativity or genuine enjoyment it s all about power trips rule breaking and a relentless pursuit of virtual currency you want to see the worst of humanity dive headfirst into a darkrp server where the chat is a cesspool the admins are power hungry tyrants and the gameplay is about as enjoyable as a root canal so here s the deal get garry s mod revel in its boundless potential but for the love of all that is holy steer clear of the darkrp servers trust me your sanity will thank you
