2023 excellently crafted truck driving simulator while the game looks incredible and is very immersive on the pc most of my playing time was actually on the steam deck it s the perfect low effort relaxing game to pick up and play and put back down as needed while going through the routine of life growing your business empire of drivers and trucks adds another layer of bliss to the experience as an achievement hunter the game can be viewed as a cash grab since 100 achievements requires at the time of writing this buying 14 dlcs for all currently available states with more to come however i feel the time and enjoyment i got out of it justified the expense especially since i got them all during sales
