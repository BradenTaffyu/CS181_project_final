2017 tldr great game realistic weapon vehicle physics many mods cpu heavy a great game for many tastes those who like hardcore realism can find different communities to play with following rules there are also quick and easy pewpew servers out there that don t even require mods and offer quick action you can also find many single player mods full of action if you re not into online gameplay in the end however the game leans more to the realism side since the weapons and vehicles are greatly affected by physics and infantry movement is not quite as simple as in more arcady games personally i ve played mostly wasteland on stratis for the quick and simple pewpew and quite a bit of playerunknowns battleroyale as well the predecessor of the standalone game the game is rather cpu heavy due to a lot of background physics simulation so keep that in mind however the gpu does not have to be very beefy single player will offer better performance due to performance in servers often being capped by the capabilities of the server mod and amount of players online on a server i have i5 4690k and gtx 1060 running on 1080p monitor and playing on ultra most of the time above 60 fps previously i had gtx 970 which also had no issues running the same setup now this isn t exactly a poor pc but i figure someone might find the info useful honestly with many graphics settings switching between ultra or low makes no difference in fps at all because the game is surely going to be capped by the cpu unless the gpu is just really weak like or dislike the game this is my 2 cents and i hope it helps you decide wether to get the game or not
