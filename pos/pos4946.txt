2016 after playing 250h i am both happy and disappointed with my experience i hate the fact that they dumbed down the rpg elements compared to the previous titles it now feels like an fps experience in a rpg setting it s hard to complain to much though since some of the episodes in the game are the most thrilling experiences i ve had in a game for some time
