a much maligned gemit s a shame that this game was overpriced and over hyped at launch because it s a triumph of historical total war design that delivers a great focused down to earth experience top tier historical flavourexcellent campaign mechanics the court system ancient legacies the legitimacy mechanic do a great job delivering the feeling of playing as a bronze age tyrant while working within the total war system these systems communicate a ton of historical flavour while being much more engaging and rewarding in a game design sense than i find most campaign mechanics in tw warhammer or indeed the empire mechanic of tw three kingdoms you will feel like you re scheming and vying for power in a fractious court seeking to wipe out your enemies on the field of battle and then wipe them from history with a chisel usurping their monuments and royal tomb surprisingly satisfying combatbattles are far less flashy than other recent tw titles but still have a brisk pace and reward good tactics they actually remind me of shogun 2 in that they can be very quick and all about getting into decisive favourable engagements where your units counter theirs they do require a certain re learning of tw basics as there is no cavalry nor artillery however once the player gets used to the troop types available and gets access to troops with some advanced stances the battles really open up it s gorgeousagain in a grounded way but the maps the art style play with 2d unit cards the sound design it s all stunning just the right level of stylised and with a tw flair and i will never get tired of iolaos asking does anyone else like fire caveats players with zero familiarity with or interest in the bronze age will want to look elsewhere this is a game for people who have at the very least enjoyed the egyptology wing of their local museum battles become much more interesting once you have a variety of troop types and some elites players like me who reflexively prioritize their economy might struggle i genuinely thought the battles were super boring for several hours until i tried starting as tausret who starts with chariots i heartily recommend playing with a mod to make the campaign ai more aggressive and dynamic but if you aren t using mods are you really playing total war to sum upi hope you buy this game i think you ll like it and my heart goes out to the developers who delivered top notch work and got screwed by sega pushing this as a full price headline title tw troy didn t click for me but in my opinion the devs took all their best ideas from troy perfected them and put them in this love letter to both total war and the ancient world i really hope they get to stay together and keep putting out this kind of work
