2022 as a lifelong star wars fan i have been playing this game since it s launch back in 2012 when my now wife was just my new girlfriend i have been around since it s beginning and watched it evolve over the years off steam i have sunk in around 2 000 total hours in playtime and have almost every character class play through finished besides the sniper and smuggler classes all that said i ll try and keep this short this star wars game takes place a decade or so after the treaty of coruscant was signed during the old republic and about a few hundred years after the story of revan during kotr and kotr ii take place revan is mentioned in this game however i ll spare further spoilers for fans gameplay is mmo centered with tab targeting combat which is pretty obvious from the start however the voice acted story cutscenes and ease of single player questing makes this truly one of the only mmo games that has a true single player experience more so than ffxiv or elder scrolls online and i say this as a die hard ffxiv fan with a lifetime of hours played in that franchise alone the way they created the story aspect of the game takes away any sort of feeling of grind it is not by any means a slow process to go from level 1 75 in both the xp contributions and the lore rich immersion each class has it s journey through the galaxy as well as story and story choices bioware is most known for these choices will also effect your alignment to the force say for instance if your dark side character makes a morally good choice and vice versa these choices and alignments will also play a role in the story as your playtime increases lots of free xp boosts can be obtained by completing really basic achievements in the game and the story class missions alone these can boost you up quickly at level 10 15 or so you also get access to flaspoints which are the games version of multiplayer dungeons these reward big xp and gear drops relative to your class also if you sub for only one month then you can also get every expansion up to date including all the flashpoints and other account wide character unlocks and features even after you cancel your subscription later on even after that first month character customization is nearly endless in this game with many different outfits weapons mounts pets and gear selections for each class that adds a lot of in game variety in terms of the general player aesthetic there is an in game player market system called the galactic trade market where your extra gear and drops can be sold for in game currency lots of social features such as in game cantina gatherings rp roleplay guilds end game guilds pvp guilds with both individual player housing and guild flagship housing where your guild has possession of it s own capital ship i ve played this game in bursts and seasons like any other game in my collection six months to a year here a year off and then i ll come back the following year but one thing does remain the same i keep coming back as a star wars fan the new television series the mandolorian and the book of boba fett has brought in a new influx of players enjoying the game so if that is you i recommend giving this game a shot i think you ll enjoy what it has to offer the game has been out for a long time but from what the team has shared they have no ambitions of ending this game any time soon and have some disclosed updates for this game later on in the future as well as a new expansion coming out next month in february i believe i hope you have fun in the galaxy and may the force be with you
