2018 early access review so i ve spent a little bit of time playing this game i remember when it was just a minecraft clone set in the zombie apocalypse it s become so much more over the years with continued support from a small dedicating modding community and developer team the game as it is currently is the closest thing you ll get to knowing what it is really like to live out that fantasy about surviving the zombie apocalypse a normal few hours of gameplay will start with scavenging abandoned buildings for weapons materials and food if you re lucky you won t have to fight the zombies but even if you do they re manageable as long as you keep your head on straight and watch your surroundings after you get some gear chop down some trees and find a place to live you get to the fun part open ended zombie fort creation do you just make a big wall and hope they lose interest before they break it down do you spend the effort to dig a trench and fill it with spikes or maybe you just want to make a bunker and hold your own with a gun or bow it s up to you and your friends playing this game with others is definitely one of the strong points i ve spent many hours crafting new forts with friends roaming the landscape and eventually murdering them when they get a good item or have some spare food i want i ve also put in a lot of solo time in this game but base construction as one person can be pretty tedious and hard to maintain some of the nice additions of this game is the amount of customizability you get when it comes to creating your own apocalypse you can force the zombies to be slow or fast you can make them strong or weak numerous or few etc i love that they don t force you to endure only fast zombies or make you have to gun down hundreds more games need to give the options back to the players overall i would definitely recommend this game for anyone who has ever wondered if they would be able to survive a zombie apocalypse while it lacks the depth or complexity as other zombie games zombicide for example the simplicity of the game is one of its strong suits it feels so good to be able to set up a whole fort in less than an hour and be able to explore a huge randomly generated map
