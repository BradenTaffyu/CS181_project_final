2016 i ve been a long time fan of the tw franchise but wasn t enthused about rome2 and i didn tplay attila however tw w had made an incredible leap forward with it s engine story telling and presentation i love the difference between the races till now factions were pretty much texture swaps with a few units getting bonuses and possibly a limited amount of unique units that looked a lot like other units now we have different models different animations different army structures different economies different play styles completely unique units the addition of spells and flying creatures shake up how we used to think about fighting in this game there s lots of game play additons here as well ai that will actually keep their word and have different temperments massive amounts of personalization for your characters abilies equipment and followers you can change your equipments around and gift it to other heros or generals heros can now take part in battles the leveling system is a lot more incrimental giving you more choices your main faction leader has individual quests that unlock incredible items ca also did a great job of sticking to the games workshop ip of the old world it feels like warhammer over all huge thumbs up more to do more and different ways to do it and a metric ton of replayability
