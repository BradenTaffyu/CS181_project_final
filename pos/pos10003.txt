2017 early access review nearly 50 hours in and i ve yet to have a successful colony in fact i don t think i ve even had a colony make it past 2 years yet let me describe my last attempt i was in the borreal forest for the first time i usually go with just the temperate forest since it was my first time picking this biome i decided to pick a spot with a growing season of 20 days since most boreal forest maps are only 10 days i was doing really well and had lots of rice and meat stocked up for the upcoming winter i was about 15 days into the growing season and my corn was going to be ready to harvest by the next day then overnight i get the event cold snap all of my corn dies overnight while my colonists slept no bid deal i felt like i still had plenty of food to get me through the winter winter comes and i get through it just fine and spring hits now the beginning of spring it still doesn t get above 0 celcius so i still couldn t grow anything and i was starting to run low on food not desperate yet though lucky for me a herd of caribou waltzes into my map i send for my hunter to hunt 2 of them as that was going to be all i needed now with caribou you ve got about a 50 50 chance of them either running when you start hunting or the entire herd attacking you i got the latter my dog april served as a decoy and i got my colonist back close to my turrets and the turrets basically wiped them out but not before my colonist litterally lost his leg oh well i wasn t too worried he is just gonna be a little slow from here on out right after this i get raided and one of them has grenades i didn t realize this and so i had my colonists clustered together 2 grenades and all but one of my colonists can t walk and are in need of rescue the turrets finish off the enemies and i start clicking to have my one standing guy rescue the others thats when i realize the one standing guy is the guy that just lost his leg long story short he couldn t move fast enough to save anyone there was also thick snow on the ground and eventually collapsed and my entire colony died sigh time to try again
