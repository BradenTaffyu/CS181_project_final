2016 i myself am from the uk so you would think that i d be more into european trucks however i m more into american styled trucking because they have so much more to offer and they also bring a lot more to the trucking industry with variety i m extremely surprised with the amount of feedback that scs software have been getting for the creation of american truck simulator i understand though that the seperate multiplayer client for the game isn t quite as popular as ets2 which is done to a few obvious reasons 1 mp was first created for the game 2 there are more european drivers on the game and 3 ets2 has a lot more content to offer since it s been out a lot longer than ats i m thoroughly enjoying the new re scaling that that scs software have done and cannot wait to see what they have installed for us within the upcoming months years if you were thinking about purchasing this game but wasn t sure due to the popularity of it at this moment in time i would say buy it these types of simulation games take time to peice toegther considering they are basing the game off of real like destinations and scenery i mark this game 10 10 as i ve always been impressed with the quality of work that the company set out to achieve
