2018 100 hours of play and i have completed all the achivements but is it any good yes it s a good game but i m not sure if there is enough to drive me back to return and play this more while there is initially a lot to do in the game once you have researched everything the game becomes a little repetitive build lots of gp offices and occasionally add a new treatment room when your existing ones start getting large queues and that s it really the game really does capture the spirit of theme hospital and if you even remotely enjoyed that then you will likely enjoy this game i m hoping for some dlc or expanded content or even some modding to add more to this game so that i can return to it in the future even a scenario or map builder would be nice because while i enjoyed the ride i ve done everything there is in the game money well spent though edited it seems my wish was granted new dlc is out and at first glance it looks like a reasonable offering for the price may hold off until a bit closer to christmas although no longer having all the achivements is mocking me somewhat
