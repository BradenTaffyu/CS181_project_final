2017 early access review got a fungal infection that slowly spread over my entire body spent a lot of time gather parts to a cure until i realized my spore spewing infection was more beneficial to keep than remove free armor at no cost to dodge spore clouds that damage anyone that attacks me sure now the sentient plants who are racist toward the humble fungi hate me but who needs those nerds 10 10 would be a host for friendly mushrooms again
