early access review i hope the developer sees this i just wanted to say thank you for this game its a gem it sucks you in i don t need to put on music or be distracted with other stuff to enjoy this ill look at the clock and its 10 pm look again and its 4 am yall have made such a gift ive been playing on and off for a few years to see whats changed and whats added but without fail every time i pick it back up im always where i was a esper tinkerer i have 300 hours of just a esper tinkerer i cannot fathom how many more hours i will play this game trying new things i will never get bored of this the price for unlimited randomness and the math for how many builds you can actually make cause me nausea im so excited to see where it will go when its fully released
