2022 7 years ago 2015 i played this game a little bit on ps4 first just cause i had the collectors edition with the pipboy in it anyway i also bought this pc version and played it a lot i really like the setting etc but still my personal favorite is and was fallout 3 cause i really loved the beginning of it fo4 also has a nice start but nothing beats fo3 on that i m a completer means before i even touch a new main quest i try and do every single possible side quest this is how i always play these type of games and will do in the future starfield as well but this also leads to my biggest problem i never finished it back then i played hundreds of sidequests and every main quest until i reached a point of no return the point where you have to decide i hate and love these big decisions so instead of deciding i simply stopped at this point somehow june 2022 i saw the first gameplay of starfield i must admit i m a bit hyped what can i do for distracting myself yes fo4 so i finished all endings but without overwriting my pre decision save now i saw them all only thing to do now is walking around build settlements etc present day result still a great game with bethesda typical bugs here and there now let s wait for the next big decision in starfield will i stop there at the point of no return probably not again
