2022 masterpiece of its genre it s the xcom2 we deserved and so much more probably the best modern tactical turn based game with all the quality of life features all of them even the ones you didn t think you needed fully customizable experience and difficulty with tons of options and that level of freedom and choice translates into the gameplay too as a design philosophy a deep original and very satisfying rpg system in the masteries feature that i absolutely love with mind blowing customization possible so many additional features taming beasts robots that you just unlock while playing can totally skip out on for hours then realize is an option opening up the strategic and tactical possibilities more and more in unexpected ways 200 hours of content for an old veteran of tactical games like me it means a lot for the price not bad story i didn t skip as much as i usually do some characters are super attaching and it s nice to see them grow and evolve and even though the dna is clearly anime and it shows in lots of places it s not overwhelming or too stupid it s done right and usually i am very sensitive to that a great dev team humble focused and productive 100 recommended for the full price
