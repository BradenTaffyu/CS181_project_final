2019 this game is almost certainly the best addition to the entire total war series since shogun 2 it s also very likely that this game has gotten me into both warhammer fantasy 40k on the whole albeit i already knew about some of it via my friends so be prepared for that if you re joining purely from a total war player standpoint the blood for the blood god ii blood gore dlc is an absolute m u s t it really adds to the effect of someone being eaten by a dragon or any other large reptilian for that matter also a big reason it is separate from the actual game itself is that certain countries with certain censorship regulations would ban the game if it were simply included so the dlc just gets banned instead
