2019 probably one of my top recommendations on steam rimworld is a strategy game that is easy to pick up and learn while still being in depth enough to challenge more experienced players the game itself may seem very simplistic but after several playthroughs and nearly 300 hours at the time of my review i can say that there is a lot more to rimworld than initially meets the eye this game was very lovingly crafted and it shows and is definitely worth looking into 3
