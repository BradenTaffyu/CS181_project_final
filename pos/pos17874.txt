2023 well i guess i m on the wrong side of things right now but i ll admit that i ve come to really like coh3 for validation i started playing coh1 there are it s hiccups and it s definitely not okay to release an unfinished game sega and relic it s fun and the gameplay keeps bringing back in every other night the community is still fiery and toxic keep it that way
