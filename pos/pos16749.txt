2018 i really like this game but there is a lot left to be desired if you re interested in a game about house flipping or just like simulator games in general you ll like this game and if you re like me you ll like it a lot because it s perfect for podcasts and music but also if you re like me you ll want more out of it as it is it s a decent game that semi lets you live out what it s like being a house flipper the jobs are very fun with a very clear ui that lets you know what you need to do in order to complete a job on top of that there s a lot of cool secrets to discover when you get into the actual house flipping portion of the game it was really fun discovering something like a hidden room on the minimap and knocking down the wall to find something very cool it s in these moments where you find out what makes the houses unique that the game really shines unfortunately there s also quite a few negatives to be had here as well for one i found the customization options to be lacking they only give you so many sets of things to work with that once you get into the actual house flipping aspect of the game there s very little that you can do to customize the houses for example there s a very finite amount of paints and other cosmetics to choose from to the point where felt like i was designing the same exact type of house by the end of it related to the flipping portion the clients and their wishes are very obtuse and not well defined to where i was just making random guesses to find out what different clients liked what does a family room have toys a lot of space a tv this family with a gaggle of kids really wants a big family room and i would give them that if i knew how to design it but i don t this brings me to perhaps my biggest issue with the game the room system is kind of garbage the rooms themselves are never concretely defined there s never a list you can check off to make sure that it actually qualifies as a room or not sometimes i d put a bookcase in a place and that room would register as a home library and other times i d put a bookcase in there and it would just register as nothing there was one point where i took the living room furniture out of a living room and kitchenette combo and the room became a big kitchen what s the difference between a normal kitchen and a big kitchen what amount of room is needed for a big kitchen are there certain pieces that are better for a kitchen big kitchen and kitchenette your guess is as good as mine because i have no way of determining this to use a similar example what qualifies as an office nothing in my playthrough ever registered as an office the best i could get was a home library but then a client would bellyache about how they needed an office i would do that if i knew the perameters for making one on top of that outside of costmentics you can t really change larger things about the houses you flip you can knock down a few walls and add in new furnature but you re sol if you want to make an addition to the house because you can t knock down the outside walls or add anything like a basement attic or even another floor you can t install piping or anything of the sort in any rooms so any bathrooms or laundry rooms are delegated to their respective places within the houses that means you re if you ever want to make something as simple as a laundry room speaking of mountable objects you aren t able to mount decorative sinks to the sink areas so you re left with the one and only ugly mountable sink if you ever decide you need to renovate a bathroom and you destroy whatever sink is in there simply put i think this game needs a major ui overhaul at the very least make it so that what makes a room a room is more clearly defined maybe put up a list of what is needed to make a room a room like a living room needs a couch a coffee table etc the grandest version of that design would be something like a blueprint mode where you can designate which rooms of the house are for what and what to change and or get rid of like a planning mode but fitting with the whole theme of building aside from that i want lots more customization options maybe instead of prefab paints have there be an option for the player to choose whatever color they want from like a color gradient or something hell maybe even make swatches of paint that you select from instead of the buckets to give it a more professional feel more options of hardwoods and carpets would be nice and for the love of god wall tiling and panneling is so dang tedious putting down floors is so easy why is putting up a wall like pulling teeth it got to the point where i just straight up painted some of the bathrooms because i didn t want to deal with the panneling process god help you if you re putting up panneling on the outside of the house too where you can almost never find a space to put the like 3 panels down an overhaul of that system would be greatly appreciated overall though i didn t wanna come at this game as hard as i did in this review i mean you do notice that even though its mostly been negatives that i still rated this game positive right that s because in general i enjoyed my experience it works well as a very passive experience that you can just put on some music to and just chill out i seriously wish the devs would fix the issues i have but as it is it s a very solid game that i d totally spend 30 hours of my time on again
