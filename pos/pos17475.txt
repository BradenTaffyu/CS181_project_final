2016 when i first heard about a fantasy universe in a total war game i shook my head in disapproval i was stuck in the mindset that tw need its origins in real world history and realism boy was i wrong the squalor food and aging is removed to give room for the fantasy to shine and it delivers you no longer have to worry about your mighty captain in this game lord becoming a victim of aging or falling in a surprise battle your legendary lords will always be there if you can avoid a 5 turn assasination wound recovery and you never feel your progress getting lost or wasted it s honestly great it means that you can put your entire heart and soul into becoming the mightiest lord without worrying about inevitable death needless to say that this fits a fantasy universe perfectly as a new feature your lord is now a single person instead of being part of a squad which works wonders you will no longer suffer from random unlucky deaths of your lord by simply being unlucky with who dies in his squad the single unit now works off of a pool of hp which eliminates that element of luck that haunted killing a captain in previous tw games as the game progresses and your lord earns levels through glorious combat he will get some unique questlines to fulfill in order to gain high tier loot such as powerful weapons and armor really satisfying and worthwhile to complete usually with a fun battle including cutscene to end it diplomacy is miles apart from all other tw games way better with ai that actually doesn t seem to be controlled by your dog and actively engages in diplomacy those were som quick thoughts 100 recommended as the best tw game so far
