2023 rimworld scratches the same itch as dwarf fortress but to such a better degree that any time i fire up df i end up quitting and just going to play rw instead sorry dwarf fortress i do still love you i admit that despite the hours i ve put into it i m not good at it in the sense of being good at winning i don t have the prettiest bases the strongest weapons the fanciest throne room whatever but the thing you should understand about rw if you re on the fence about it is that yeah it s a game it does have a handful of win conditions but more than that it s a story generator the story can be as high or as low stakes as you want to make it and if you re enjoying it congratulations you won rimworld regardless of any other consideration even if your goal is to get your colony into space and you succeed you can just keep playing with the remaining colony members on the planet if any in a completely dead colony you can quite literally just watch time pass until you get a random joining colonist event and begin play again the end is never the end until you decide it is there s a learning curve for sure but in my estimation it s not as punishing as other games in the colony manager genre assigning tasks and areas is fairly straightforward most of the real difficulty comes from learning to manage your wealth so that you don t accidentally have massive raids steamroll you before you re ready to handle them learning to manage passive defenses so that when raids do show up you aren t overwhelmed and learning to design efficient bases so you aren t wasting half your colonists day running across the map for a handful of wood once you ve got those down you re already halfway there anyway on the hypothetical list of games i d take with me to a deserted island or in this case a space colony on the edge of the known universe rimworld easily makes the list which is just about the highest praise i can think of for a game
