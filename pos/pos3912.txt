tl dr discount shadowrun is better than anything that ever came out of the original for better or worse i ve played well over a dozen of these types of games in recent years turn based urban warfare this time with magic though without the blackjack and hookers which is odd given the crime based setting i have to say this game is in a league of its own the terrain design is miles ahead of the competition both in terms of the way you interract with it and in map design the missions are absolutely massive and i love it pathing oh god the pathing not only do you have the option to manually avoid obstacles but your characters will automatically avoid hazards and enemy attack zones and it feels so gooood the mmo esque grind and progression curve feel right at home in this kind of mission based gameplay and it adds loads of replayability and long form gameplay and you will find yourself gazing at the overcomplicated mastery boards and crafting menus for hours to try and make your next build idea a reality the ai does as the ai will i don t have much of an idea so i ll be quick the fact that people will back off and heal chain their attacks and beasts will run off and hide is a nice touch i love the fact that your faceless police support is actually useful carried me through my first mission two boys in swat gear against the world yeah and i ve seen them kill a boss that my team couldn t even approach without letting him move xd actual stealth mechanics i mean it s nothing to write home about but it works you can ambush people the only thing i have a problem with are the various grind sets and psy stones i m not a fan of gimping my characters to farm more efficiently and the psy stones themselves can be pretty hard to get to given how relentlessly the beasts keep coming in they re also very restrictive being designed for one specific character each and noone else can equip the full set i suppose i was expecting more than 2 classes per character for instance why does a witch list a requirement of being female when there is just one male magic focused user in the entire cast somewhat redundant information given that you can t make your own characters the story is passable you will find minor translation errors ranging from that s not the word used in that phrase to that doesn t sound anywhere near as smart as you think it does it s somewhere around the level of warcraft 3 nothing to write home about but servicable as a justification for a bunch of massive battles in this case a bunch of crime rings it s kind of missing voice acting even if it s just in uhm is that korean as a bunch of scenes could be much better hearing the characters voice their concerns there s a decent amount of repetition at times inconsistent for instance giselle and jeanne talking about the rookie and who told who what and when was straight up confusing and unnecessary this really made me sour on joel which is a shame given that it was arguably the best scene even with just the sound of anne spamming healing for the love of god isac do you not know a single other person in the entire office that s about all i have to say thank you for making an amazing game i just bought the dlc and plan on playing a bunch more and checking out anything else you put out we need more games like this
