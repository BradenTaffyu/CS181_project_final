2020 early access review do not buy this game for multiplayer i used to really like this game but it s been almost a decade of them lying about working on multiplayer just to keep putting singleplayer further and further ahead of it to the point where multiplayer will probably never catch up i guess i m just sick of the lies instead of saying every week for years that multiplayer was coming soon you should have just said we don t give a about our original player base and would rather spend our time roping more people in with our false promises than actually developing multiplayer either put out mutpliplayer or dont just stop lying about it because it s disgusting and it s theft and eventually you re gonna be the next no man s sky if you dont behave yourselves
