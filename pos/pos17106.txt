2021 where to start this game has rekindled my love of gaming a representative scene in this game picture an army of mad steampunk ratmen firing gatling guns and flamethrowers into the charging line of lizardpeople riding dinosaurs all while a crew of undead pirates are firing artillery from the side lines their captain watching from overhead riding an undead dragon if you know nothing about the total war series it is a 4x type game at heart but army battles are carried out in real time this format turned out to fit perfectly with the world of fantasy warhammer in this game and its predecessor the sheer variety of the factions be it elves dwarfs orcs or lizards is unparalleled in any other strategy game i am aware of in my first 500 hours with this game i have had time to interact properly with maybe half of the available factions my first entry in this series was rome tw back in 2004 but i did not take a deep dive until this title i have to admit that it took some 20hours of struggling to understand even the first layer of what the game wants from me with all its interacting systems but easy difficulty is forgiving as a learning crutch just looking at the store page you might think the dlc policy of this game is predatory not quite as bad as it seems for starters the base game is gigantic and will certainly last you many dozens of hours secondly all dlc contains either factions or subfactions with corresponding unit additions so you are missing no functionality or systems and if you don t own a particual dlc it is still represented in game and you can fight against it just not play as it finally the developers usually releases a piece of free content with every paid dlc so the base game has grown significantly from its initial release until now oh and if you own any content for warhammer i it ports into this game with updates add to this a thriving modding community that seems hell bent on adding any and all bit of old tabletop warhammer ingame and i could easily see myself playing this game and having new experiences after several thousands of hours the only thing i see stopping me from playing this game is the hopefully soon upcoming third game bottom line excellent game will play again
