2020 xcom players and other turn based fans who are not used to the jrpg turn based system this review is for you i m also one such player so hopefully my insights will be helpful to you take note that my experience playing has covered both early access and post release online and offline there are lots of summary reviews already so i thought i should come up with something more detailed this review consists of 1 intro 2 how the game works 3 pros 4 cons 5 neutral and 6 outro 1 introthis game is a hybrid of skirmish type turn based games like xcom fallout tactics and jrpg turn based games like final fantasy you have a hq where you customize characters buy weapons and craft things you do into missions in various locations it s narrative heavy and in order to progress you ll have to do story missions however there are also various side missions honestly this game is the best surprise i ever had in years the surprise however did not come right away because i almost refunded the game i m not used to the initiative speed system in an isometric turn based tactics and the anime ish universe isn t my cup of my tea although i really love the artstyle but i gave it a shot an early access no less and it was one of the best decisions i ever made on steam 2 how the game worksnow let s talk about the game it has a slow start you have to spend about four to five hours playing as albus main character and sion lightning guy while being accompanied by the police force who are very basic shooting units however every so often you will play missions where you get the chance to play other interesting characters some of them you can add to your team later it seems dull at first but once you have added more characters into your team and get the ball rolling that s when it gets really interesting now you have different characters with various skills that you can modify to suit your playstyle this skill system which is the heart of the game is known as the mastery system this is what allows you to come up with very flexible character builds 2 1 the mastery systembasically with this system the only thing that limits all the possibilities is the character s own class for example let s take a swordsman you want a swordsman who is tanky aggros surrounding enemies and counterattacks everyone that tries to melee hit him you can do that or you want a swordsman who s fast and approach enemies quick you can have that too or a swordsman who mainly strike enemies with ranged elemental attacks yeah you can have that and that s only for the swordsman class you have mages fighters gunmen throwers and many more each class you can further modify into totally wacky variations seriously for instance i have a sniper who basically won t stop shooting as long as she can one hit everyone in full health and a glass canon lightning master who chains lightning attacks masteries are skills that you get from defeating enemies masteries work as standalones but can also be combined to produce stronger versions and sometimes completely different types of masteries there are active and passive masteries although some skills are limited to classes hackers healers etc or elements fire wind etc most skills are universal you can imagine masteries like materials take this analogy say you have a knife and a gun you can use the knife and gun on their own but if you combine them now you have a gun with a bayonet say you have a grenade launcher you can use it on its own but you can also attach it to your bayonet gun that s how the masteries work the mastery is the heart of the game this is what makes the game shine 3 proswithout further ado here are the pros of the game this game is being made with so much love and care the developers are some of the most wonderful people on steam they re tight on budget but they work actively for the game listening to the players and implementing many feedback and for 2 years has managed to keep a fine balance the players community is also very welcoming come join us in the discussions flexible character builds thanks to the mastery system this seriously needs more elaboration but doing it more will add 3 5 pros in this section and that s too much word count i have such a blast tweaking the builds of the various character classes in the game unique and memorable characters the characters have their own unique personalities story wise even the bad guys don t feel that distant they too have their own plotlines my favourites are albus heixing ray giselle and isaac despite the anime ish vibe the game does not resort entirely to common character tropes i don t watch them but it s popular where i come from and even i notice how cliche anime can be there are various missions that let you take control of the bad guys for a while in order to see the stories from their perspectives they have their own unique skills but also share some common ones with your characters both your characters and enemies share the same skill mastery pool unless the enemies character class do not exist in your roster this is very important because it makes it fair the missions can be very challenging there s no permadeath but you can t really make ill informed decisions here it s more punishing than most turn based games i ever played except xcom tactics like flanking and covers play a huge role masochists ahoy unfamiliar tactical style to us the game doesn t have the turn system of most western tbss it uses the initiative system each character including the enemy has their own turn based on their speed this introduces new tactics like delaying a specific enemy s turn and prioritizing enemies not only based on their power but also their turn the flexibility with the builds add a thick extra layer to the tactical decisions you ll make in the game it s not only about what you do in the field but also your decisions on your character builds again the mastery system you have so much flexibility with builds so much so that some characters can either synergize perfectly with each other or not and that s entirely based on your playstyle and how you customize these characters there s much more strategic layer such as district jurisdictions but not enough to explain in a steam review 4 consyes the game does have flaws they are far outweighed by the wonderful stuff but they re very much still worth mentioning battles can get far too overwhelming you will often face difficulties just from being outnumbered when the enemies are too many it gets tiring waiting for your characters turn because enemies usually outnumber you greatly the game does not take too kindly to separating troops which is usually the core strategy in turn based games where you need to split up to flank and scout the stories can be too ambiguous the game has multiple stories and despite its many distinguishable and memorable characters things can get confusing it s nothing that a good storyteller cannot fix but for now this is the state of the game s storytelling the 3d models have mixed accuracy a lot of them represent the characters looks very well others not so much different ray s and jane s 3d models especially 5 neutral some characters feel generic at first but eventually as you delve deeper they ll begin to reveal deeper and more complicated layers of their personalities the english translation isn t as bad as it used to it s nowhere near perfect but it s pretty decent unless you re too picky it s far from being a dealbreaker 6 outroah word count is my enemy here to conclude highly recommended if you love games like xcom shadowrun and if you want to explore the elements of jrpgs such as ff and valkyria chronicles
