2015 i would whole heartedly recommend this game pros amazing music wonderful graphics even if it s not a new witcher 3 of course excellent gunplay i never used v a t s before and the new gunplay system makes that easier than ever weapon armor modding system is fantastic and wonderful as promised engaging sidequests and an interesting main story what little i ve played of it the settlement building system is quite fun if a little wonky at times if building a corner to your hut don t use the pre built corner place a wall down then place a roof and the corner can naturally be built with another wall that was my first hour of trying to build so hopefully i save somebody the same frustration while there are some bland characters looking at you garvey there are far more colorful and fascinating characters i know a lot of people don t but i actually really enjoy the voiced protagonist while the conversation options are somewhat lacking compared to previous fallout games the depth of the voice actors performances for your character more than makes up for that cons a few bugs one which i ve experienced twice now in which my companion is perma stuck in the laying down position like they re hurt it s an easy fix though just shoot them until they re really down and then get them back other people have experienced some game breaking bugs but thankfully i haven t yet minor minor minor performance issues some frame rate drops inside of lighting heavy buildings due to their new lighting system that could definitely use some patching it s not unplayable for me it s a drop down to 25 28 fps which i can tolerate but a little annoying at times the library and corvega were the worst offenders for me hands down other than that there s occasional stutters when in the commonwealth but so few and far between that i hardly notice runs great otherwise on med high settings with the patches that i hope are incoming for the lighting i hope that i can drop the medium and run on the high like fallout initially recommended sort of going back to the bugs post my guns occasionally like to take what feels like a decade to pull out when switching between them using the hotkeys in battle it ll put away the old gun and not pull out the new one until i ve taken a sound thrashing from the super mutant i was hoping to blast away with a shotgun if i had one equipped whilst not game breaking i do hope that gets a visit the switching works fine through the pip boy and also through the app but the hotkeys can hesitate and hesitation hurts a lot i can only run so fast since it also disables my sprinting while frozen in the gun switching limbo overall tl dr 10 10 would and will commonwealth again
