2018 one of the great rpgs of all time high level of polish very satisfying combat satisfying choices with consequence unbelievably good co op enjoyable story and characters an original and inventive world there s no rpg that feels like this it is impressive what they have pulled off i would recommend fane and lohse in terms of origin characters in your playthrough as both of their stories were interesting and further developed the rest of the playthrough i also had ifan and the red prince each was also enjoyable
