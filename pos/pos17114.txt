2017 total war in its finest oh really this is the second installment of the trilogy that envelops the world of warhammer to total war franchise and ca is doing a marvellous job so far the game learned from the past mistakes and remedy things that were wierd wrong or just uncovinient but there are also matters that are still the same pain and anguish like in previous titles overall the game feels already like an improvement valued datadisc of old times where datadiscs were distributed on cd s and had been worked on for years promised a lot of content and proper dlc rather than a separate new game this is exactly it a big addition to concept from warhammer 1 warhammer ii is a just more enjoyable to play offers a new big map and overall portrays a much better characterization than the earlier title the in game cinematics are just bliss for a fan of warhammer the promise of the combined campaign mortal empires and or a more like sandbox mode is most intriguing and i sincerely hope it will be implemented in full some of the issues remained as mentioned before the long loading times the dlc policy so damn many times cried about in the forum section somewhat clueless ai if you come with some cheesy or un standart strategy early release optimalization issues siege battles personally i don t really complain that loud about sieges heretic i know in conclusion the game is solid and if you liked previous game this one is for you with an extra sauce also all three parts of the trilogy should be combined to some degree this naturally goes with more troubles game engine must remain the same as well the optimalization must go insane to work with so many data even on mediocre rig dissclaimer you don t like fantasy or price tag on this total war game don t buy it then wait for the next historic title already work in progress or wait for sale easy abolition of this theme would make your money related game review less dumb also considering amount of content licensing of gw damn pricy and not copy paste factions than in historic ones i can fairly understand they want to make some dime out of it quality is there people i got my worth of aaa title in literally hundreds hours of gameplay which other franchise can offer me that which other can make warhammer world live storyline new and original game win objective as well the cinematics that goes with it general gameplay smooth action newbie friendly with proper step by step tutorial great graphic early release could use more optimalization though campaign and enviroments more shipping action and treasures in the sea new races playable lizardmen skavens high elves and dark elves for two faction lords each races from wh1 as minor ai factions and hopefully fully implemented on combined map also new races have all some twist th new lores of magic a lot of changes thankfuly to more good than worse level 40 cap more unique skill trees for legendary lords you don t deploy your heroes to get passive bonuses etc etc ca listened to community and modders plenty of stuff obviously tweaked by community or inspired by popular mods battle maps more variety of features in enviroment when you fight flc free updates and content to come dlc policy new content addition extra things you don t really have to own them to enjoy it your game ai will have new faction lords units etc anyway but its expected for game to have fair amount of these same game engine but more polished its obvious though that this is needed for compability of trilogy early release version of game optimalization siege battles yeah yeaht this old rant again 9 5 10 queek is the best queek wish to kill green things and beard things queek wish to drink their blood and rip their flesh queek do this for gnawdwell this is what gnawdwell wants yes yes
