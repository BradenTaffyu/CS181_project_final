2019 after hours of gameplay spread across two steam accounts console edition which runs a modified 1 7 and a cracked version of pre 2 0 i wanted to give out a review that tries to accomplish three things 1 give a pretty basic what to buy guide for people looking to purchase the game2 give new insight for all 2 0 changes to any returning players who were disappointed with the new changes to the game 3 laydown ways to improve performance in game i m a new player what should i buy the game on sale it s pretty pricy and i honestly don t find the base features currently worth it however the game is super cheap on sales and you can pick it up then optionally if you have friends interested in 4x games or who currently own stellaris i d recommend trying a multiplayer session in the game space is always better with friends utopia dlc just like the base game it comes super cheap when on sale due to it being older adds a ton of fresh mechanics in the game that makes midgame more enjoyable distant stars before 2 2 i would have just recommended leviathans and distant stars for later with some new additions in 2 2 distant stars is pretty on top of leviathans i feel and adds a big amount of mechanics for early midgame note if you have a friend who owns stellaris and some of its dlcs you can safely skip buying the dlcs all together and just do a multiplayer session with your buddy hosting stellaris like other paradox games supports dlc sharing in multiplayer i also heavily recommend your games to be played on a medium galaxy huge large galaxies are pretty overwhelming with the amount of empires and chug later in the game unless you have a strong computer i ve found medium perfect for both performance and enjoyment as it s the perfect size to be involved in most affairs and a good amount events have a fair chance to trigger i ve just bought the game and some of its dlcs i liked my first couple games and have been enjoying it so far what should i buy next leviathans adds some new boss fight monsters that you can take on in midgame also adds a new lategame event that s pretty wack usually very cheap synthetic dawn adds playable robots which is about it really off the top of my head also adds some new voice advisors which is nice ancient relics makes early midgame even more spicy with new events for your science ships would have added it higher but due to it being a newer expansion it won t be as cheap on sale apocalypse expensive but much cheaper than before on sale adds raiders titans world crackers and some other stuff it sounds cool but all of this stuff either has the chance of being cool or comes at a time where it isn t cool megacorp if it wasn t newer i would have put it above apocalypse prices might have changed for it on sale since it s almost a year old now but don t know really it adds megacorpations which are really fun in multiplayer and fun in singleplayer along with the slave market space vegas and other things plant human pack unless you wanna play as a space potato orc cactus i d just avoid getting these humanoid pack does add three new advisor voices and some new remixed music of other tracks though galaxy edition look unless you really love space spiders don t get it at all i ve stopped playing since x was removed or changed what s changed and why should i play again i myself miss some of the old 1 9 mechanics and do still prefer some of the mechanics back then but i ve come to appreciate some of the changes or at least understand why they were changed for the better looking into previous versions of the game again so what s changed and why 2 0 changesthe most controversial i felt was to ftl travel before 2 0 you could take warp gateway travel for your starting form of travel instead of hyperlane i felt the change to unifying it to just under hyperlane was needed with the new galaxy generation and the encouragement of the new claim system it allows players not to worry about three different entry ways in their systems and just focus on one starports replaced frontiers planet starports this made influence more of a form of currency rather than monthly drain you need to spend starports could also be upgraded to house certain functions and were no longer limited to just being over a planet this made border gore less of a problem i felt and made more flexible choices in planning i do miss some of the old planet starport functions though wargoals before they worked strangely you could declare at any time and had to reach certain thresholds for demands this meant that when an empire declared on you you wouldn t know what you had on the line and what needed to be done the newer system demands a goal giving an idea for what you need to do to win not lose humilation war don t take heavy losses conquer keep hold of the systems they demand ideology war planets are the most important thing to hold onto here ship builder did anyone really like the old ship builder like i missed it a little but going back and comparing it then to now makes me question the complaints about the new one a little there s probably something i m missing for 2 0 changes but i hoped i covered the big ones here2 1 changesi don t remember much about what changed in 2 1 only thing that cross my mind is the anomaly change which i was angry about a little but understood it later how getting a precursor to spawn literally 20 years in game and anomalies were super easy to cheese and rush 2 2 changesthe only big negative change besides performance ai which i ll dig into a bit below was the planet trade changes new resources if there was anything else changed please do tell me planet this was the change that i feel people say it s a huge downside when it s really just the tile system but with some extra bits in it the tiles have just been replaced with unlockable buildings at certain pop numbers and you occasionally need to build a district house inbetween said certain numbers other then that it s the same thing just need to manage two other pretty easy resources new resources alloys and consumer goods to give a quick rundown on what they do alloys are the thing that build ships now not minerals while consumer goods are just spicy food tbh both are exactly like energy from before you run a bit low at first but some new planning growth tech shoots the production up and you sudden have excess this time you have a new galaxy market to sell your excess goods on speaking of spicy food food itself was changed so it s more than i just need 1000 5000 and i get the max amount of effects national plentitude is the new pop growth boost and it drains your food more monthly it s a great change tbh trade routes oh boy this is a monster i kinda wanted to die when i first saw trade routes i have to manage my ships to patrol constantly or i lose money it seems so overwhelming at first but you ll eventually learn a great way to manage trade routes you ll be making sick profit and training your admirals patrols do this now outside of wartime real quickly takes a few decades to get used to and everyone has their own creative methods to manage it well alright what are these performance issues you mentioned performance ai it s been noticeably poorer for some people in recent updates especially at the launch of 2 2 the issues made the game nearly unplayable for the first couple weeks of megacorps launch and took awhile to get going eventually patches made performance pretty great for medium large which is honestly enough for the full meat of the game recommend huge only for multiplayer lobbies with good computer tbh
