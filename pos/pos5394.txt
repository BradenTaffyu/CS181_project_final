2018 early access review i bought this game a couple years ago and it s since easly slid its way into my top five games ever and certainly my number one game in terms of hours played if you have any inclination to immerse yourself in a fantastical world that through excellent writing feels even more real than any hd graphics aaa game please give this matsterpiece a shot pros tremendous writing mostly easily digestible in bite sized chunks available in the form of poetic written descriptions of literally everything in the game but also through deep plot as well as in game books complicated systems that layer together affect each other and engage with the world in a believable fashion really really really excellent sountrack like really i don t know why more people haven t talked about this it s great well done procedural generation with the added benefit that it feels even more real in a game like this wherein the graphics are as much symbolic as they are directly representative q girl who is a gift to both qud and our worldcons most of which don t even count becuase they ll be fixed upon full release very steep learning curve will likely need to sink many hours into the game getting started if you don t use guides the wiki though this adds to the realism and there s a cheat option to turn off permadeath which worth it if that s what you need to experience this masterpiece diffcult controls if you re new to oldschool roguelikes though they ve hired loren schmidt to update the ui so temporary probably i m a huge fan of ttrpgs if you are too you know it can be hard to get that same fix of realism and immersion when you re not able to play this game is what i play to get that it feels more real than a book or a aaa game and is more interesting than many of either soooo uhhh yeah i d say i recommend it
