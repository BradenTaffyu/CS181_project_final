2021 definitely has it s shortcomings but a definitive improvement on the last game the aviaries and lagoons alone give the game some great variety my only problem is that aviaries aren t available in the jurassic park era despite the cearadactylus being from the novel and pteranodons being introduced in the jp dlc in the last game there s also some problems i have with sandbox mode but those are being worked on i m sure dinosaur combat is also far too frequent and you ll constantly be sending out mvus to combat one injury or another even if the dinosaurs themselves are completely content i understand that this is to add extra challenge to the game and keep players occupied but it could do with toning down slightly all that said if you enjoyed the last one you ll love the improvements made in this one edit all of the issues i had have been resolved
