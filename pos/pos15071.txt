2015 early access review the one thing don t starve was missing was co op and for that reason alone this is definitely worth full price amazing fun can be had with friends on this working together to survive winters fight off hound attacks explore further into the wilderness etc a major plus is also the mod support the person hosting the server subscribes to a mod sometimes the players have to as well and there are very few issues and the issues are usually related to a single mod instead of compatibility issues my only complaint with don t starve also applies to this there still is a significant frame rate drop the further you develop your base or whatever multiple farms bee boxes flowers bees butterflies on the screen in a very small vicinity halves the frame rate until you leave the area the way around this though is better management of your base i e building separate areas spread out for each whatever instead of everything in a small space still incredible fun if they didn t send out beta keys i d instantly buy multiple copies and send them off to friends
