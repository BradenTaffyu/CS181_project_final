2022 finally time for me to add my two cents to this i ve had this game for years now but was never sure if it was the right time to add to the mix not really sure how this review will go technical or play it by feel or a little bit of both first off let me say i ve been a truck driver for 25 years as of 2022 lost count of my mileage but suffice it to say i ve put in enough miles to have visited the moon a couple times anyway enough about that onto the game pros for the sake of brevity let me say this american truck simulator captures the romance and beauty of the old school truck driver this wonderful game allows you to set aside all the real world bs involved with the industry and just go out on the open road and move some freight from a to b as you see fit if you ve always dreamed about owning that large car pete or kw w900 this game allows you to do that all you have to do is get the tractor then hook a load and off you go to see the beauty that exists here in the central west and southwest usa but without the real world stress and complications it s a great way to unwind or just spend some time chilling out put on some tunes hit the road and watch that wonderful scenery roll by cons take these next bits with a grain of salt i do this iirl as my job so i tend to look at the game from the real side of things engine torque is all wrong that right there is really my main gripe trailer combinations and allowances make me laugh a bit but then i remember to step back and remind myself this is a game do what you want to do and lastly and this cannot be fully considered a con the map compression messes with my head most of the places on this map i ve been to so the 1 20 ratio sometimes leave me going with but my final recommendation if you have been looking at this game or have it on your wish list do it doo eeet we have an active community here and scs is always on the ball bringing new content for the rest of us not to mention being socially active and responsive and to all my fellow gals and guys that are out there in the real world stay safe brothers and sisters keep the shiny side up edit cleaned up grammatical errors
