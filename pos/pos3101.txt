2020 this is the pinnacle of rpg gaming no doubt it has everything that a true rpg needs and much much more its beautifull immersive complex relaxing as it is tense the music is very good as much as it s surroundings and environment the lore is evermore intruiging and will not leave you unsatisfied characters are well thought thru so are the dialogues and decision making there is so much depth to each single character in this game even the npcs the writing and storytelling is so so very well done its amazing how long i ve been sleeping on this game as a new player its not an easy game to get into but once you figure it out you re bound to have one of the best gaming experiences to date i m no man to analyze all of the combat mechanics and skills attributes and point them out here but boy oh boy you are in for a treat on that one combat itself is extremely fun and tactical theres so much things to consider and you can really go ham on skill trees and attributes aswell as gear and character development there is simply too much to point out and my brain is way too fried to go over them but the diversity is immense zero to little restrictions on how you want to go at it or build your party there is simply no uglyness to this game and i very highly recommend it to anyone who loves rpg in any way
