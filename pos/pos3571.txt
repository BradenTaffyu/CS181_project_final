2021 short review memes a flower that is a jerkwad arsehole pixel graphics and a sitcom like feel it s also easy to get smashed by enemies especially in certain situations standard review i ve not really ever played a game quite like this so i ve not really much to compare it to but if seinfeld or similar were made into an rpg it would be something like this it s meant to seem more comedic than dark and serious and it pulls that off very well even if there are some elements that are not clearly explained and or can be figured out easily the battle mechanics are quite unique i ve never encountered any other system like it being able to spare one s opponent is actually a nice touch though it never works right off the bat apparently there s also the defense system which for me is one of those things i m fond of but i d improve upon in a couple ways 1 larger box for multiple enemies since they all attack at once and it really makes it difficult to avoid attacks at times 2 more chances for healing when being kind merciful often times one grabs the green only to get hit for more damage than what was healed and that s just bad especially at 20 max hp the different soul heart types are neat and those i d not alter in any way but damn are you slow as molasses when you do platforming blue caused me to overestimate many of my jumps eh nitpicky ah yes the main character very ambiguous kinda reminds me of another novella main character i love only much cuter and far more benign on the surface nothing is said about their past before the trip down into mt ebott and the fact that everyone refers to the main character as they them is a really good idea considering the main character is the silent protagonist type is there really a protagonist here what name did i give the main character jess not sure why you actually care but yeah there s a lot more i could say but it would be considered prattling so play it it s worth getting worth the frustration worth flowey s condescending and very inaccurate wisdom
