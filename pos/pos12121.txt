2023 iracing is a video game iracing is also an experience like no other this is not a game that lets you hop in and out of legendary cars all day where a ferrari feels identical to a porsche but with some sliders tweaked every car in iracing feels completely unique every track surface feels distinct your first 3 months in iracing should be spent in one car with no deviation this is track day time trials series competition and endurance racing there is controller support but you ll most certainly be better off with a mouse or wheel if all of the above sounds appealing to you and you want to replicate the experience of racing in the real world this is your best option hands down on the official matchmaking side iracing creates some of the best and closest serious competition for those looking to race outside of a league even at the lower ranks you will rarely encounter intentional wrecking and ramming the consequences of poor behavior in iracing are significant and most are on their best behavior though like any multiplayer video game you may want to mute voice chat if abrasive personalities bother you leagues and endurance racing is in my opinion where iracing really begins to shine leagues exist for just about every sim out there but in iracing the players you connect with can lead to team participation in official endurance racing unless you happen to know two to three other people who play iracing at a similar level to you this is critical for participating in events some of the best time i ve spent in this game has been with a league but it s made that much sweeter when you can participate in official races with the people you ve met and raced with for an entire season this is motorsport and this is as good as it gets for oval and road there are a lot of people who consider iracing it is certainly not for all of them but if you want to compete every week join a community and have an experience that you can genuinely not have anywhere else welcome home
