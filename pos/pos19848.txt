2020 really well made remaster the graphics are great and really hold up well for today s standards the textures and recreated models look great and still don t remove from the art style theme and feel of the original the online is great the addition of servers really makes a huge difference no more stuttering due to other play s bad connections the servers are well located too the online experience for me and my group has been buttery smooth so far qol improvements the qol improvements are great the most significant one for me was the auto farm reseeding i couldn t return to the hd original edition after playing later entries like aom and aoe3 due to the lack of auto farm reseeding also it has a toggle option for people who prefer the old system the gameplay stays true to the original there have been some great balance changes overall however some countries still remain pretty op however regular and weekly balance updates have helped address that overall a great remaster of a classic that i grew up playing
