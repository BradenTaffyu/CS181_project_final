2019 i started playing this because my then 7 yr old was looking for help i had bought this as a kiddie friendly harmless game for her to play on at first i bounced off it i just wasnt interested enough then on the second try something clicked i actually bothered to properly use those first freebie seeds i started gathering and foraging i fixed the bridge i began a monopoly on selling sea detritus and slowly but surely i began to plan my farm multi hours later i am a farming heavyweight i am married in game i am a father in game i have found ghosts no fish can evade my skills i run into lvl 100 in the mines with no fear and sometimes i like to get the bus to a desert the town loves its new community centre and i bask in the glory of knowing that i made it happen pretty much single handed the museum is a testament to my adventuring and i managed to get the mayor his pants back you must try this its great move to stardew valley your farm is waiting
