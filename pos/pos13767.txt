2017 received this game as a gift from a friend who really wanted to play arma life with me and i obliged loved it at first until i started to notice the community was full of and can t get over the fact that some girls like to play the same games guys do people harassed me calling me transgender or a 12 year old puberescent boy all because i am a chick on a pc trying to play a military simulator they use their degrading commentary to take me down and it s irritating especially when i m trying to communicate over voice where enemies are located what the objective is and basic teamwork skills as soon as i speak into that mic i get awkward comments like are you a grill girl and someone tends to jump in and start degrading me saying things like she s probably a transgender or a 12 year old boy conclusion is i recommend this game it s awesome it s competitive it s extremely addicting if you like all these things in a game this is a must have downside is it s just not very female player friendly if you re a chick into military simulator games purchase and play this game in caution and be aware that you will get targeted and harassed and bullied for having a vagina
