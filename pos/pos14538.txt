2019 after 100 hours this review is a hesitant recommend at first i had trouble feeling immersed in this game it just did not seem to have the civ magic formula however after coming back to the game after many months i gave it another shot and found that it really clicked with me so much so that i will say all the non war components are excellent the problem is war the ai is just too terrible earlier civ games i can forgive for such terrible ai but i would think the developers could do better by now for example if the ai would just do the most basic action of garrisoning a ranged unit inside the city it make conquering the city much more difficult instead the ai will leave a melee unit inside the city or no unit at all thus making the conquest far too easy because war is so easy it therefore makes for the most effective strategy when an ai is making progress on another victory objective such as religion culture science etc then simply build a small force and take their capital boom that ai is no longer competitive and you have just acquired their extremely valuable capital with little effort i am not going to write a not recommend review after 100 hours obviously it was worth the sale price for me however unless the next civ game has significantly different reviews regarding the ai i will likely pass on purchasing it the poor ai has been a problem for the last few games and it should be fixed at least a few basic strategies could be implemented such as the ai keeping a ranged unit within the city to defend
