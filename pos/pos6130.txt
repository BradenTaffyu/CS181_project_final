2020 if you have the sims 4 in origin and you have expansion packs at there you can again buy the game from steam and buy the dlc you don t have so you can play in an integrated way you can merge expansions there were 2 expansion packs in the origin i bought the game and 3 expansion packs from steam and now i m playing with 5 expansion the only problem is that you buy the game twice which i think is not a big problem cuz prices are ok in steam and about the game it s the sims you know just legit with dlcs
