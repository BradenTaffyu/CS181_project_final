2019 dark souls the best hits now that sekiro shadows die twice is right around the corner there is probably a no better way to sweeten the wait than revisiting arguably most widely recognized from software production dark souls 3 it is one of those games introduction to which feels somewhat redundant on the other hand if you are somehow unfamiliar with the souls franchise or its most prominent instalment it is truly a high time for you to catch up alas dark souls 3 is a critically acclaimed action rpg game best known for its high level of difficulty and climactic boss fights this combined with the fairly complex combat system and a not exactly cooperative camera became staples of the souls franchise it is worth noting that dark souls 3 is a far more direct sequel to the first part of the series taking place in the same kingdom hundreds of years after the events of the first game dark souls 2 on the contrary took place in a different kingdom altogether and was only loosely related to the previous game even that only after the release of the scholar of the first sin edition early years it is relevant to establish how exactly dark souls 3 is related to the other from software releases as this is where the main thought behind this review comes from namely dark souls 3 is a compilation of previous from software games rather than a new title in its own right paradoxically this is not only precisely what the fans wanted it is also the reason dark souls 3 is the easiest to approach of the series with essentially 4 games worth of experience including both demon s souls and bloodborne from software boiled away everything the player base didn t like rather than tried to go in any new direction the outcome is ds 3 being the most distilled from software formula experience to date the road there was based on trial and error let s assume that dark souls was the groundwork for the rest of the franchise it was remarkably clunky from both movement and camera work standpoints it required making frame perfect maneuvres with a truck on an ice ring to say the least it took practice but what in souls series doesn t on the other hand it had highly praised organic world the premise of the vertically built game was simple but it allowed locations to blend into one another in a heaven to hell aesthetic sadly technical condition of the game as the pc port was a complete mess and even most popular fan made fix got banned at one point it had a huge following but there was a lot of room for improvement then came the dark souls 2 and creators grasped the opportunity to innovate in a different time and place lorewise it seemed fit for rules to change death penalty was changed into hp reduction enemy respawns became limited multiplayer component got improved and magic greatly expanded vertical construction of the world was changed into horizontal with a main hub of majula splitting into 4 roads each leading to major bosses and thankfully bonfire teleport was available from the get go then again horizontal construction of the world was far less fluid and most memorable bosses of the game were present in the dlcs the main game included way too many gank bosses with what should be a highlight of the title often turning out rather mediocre there was an interesting addition of new enemies appearing in new game though there weren t that many players that went through multiple playthroughs to experience this despite possessing greatest variety in terms of viable builds and equipment dark souls 2 didn t reverberate with the fanbase so well as its predecessor did not without controversy it is seen by many as the worst entry in the series prepare to die again with such background it is no surprise that dark souls 3 revisits the place of gwynn s legacy with returning characters and locations either visually inspired or flat out the same as in the first game dark souls 3 blends two previous games leaning heavily toward the first but there is one other key component to the mix bloodborne s much higher paced combat it was a huge novelty to the souls series making the combat system and movement overall incomparably faster and more fluent this direction is further highlighted by new weapon category that can be best described as special introducing unique and often extravagant movesets to each of these specific weapons with moves that can make the player feel nothing short of being an anime protagonist coming back to the first game seems like having an engine removed from your race car and being cordially asked to keep participating in many ways dark souls 3 feels like a cut back on changes introduced in ds 2 with those replaced by a solid those of fan service to the enthusiasts of the first game especially the latter goes without question just to name a few examples both onion knight and patches return as npcs also two of the game main bosses are strongly tied to the first dark souls one being literally artorias fan club and other residing in anor londo furthermore numerous iconic looks from the first game return in dark souls 3 given that armour stats make the least impact on the game in the entire franchise ds 3 submits entirely to joyful cosplay of the fashion souls dark souls 3 s world is built much like ds 2 there is the main hub of firelink which sprouts an essentially single core road splitting into several side routes along the way though most of location transitions are handled much more smoothly that said the hub is handled in a far more immersive fashion with numerous characters visiting the shrine not only all the essentials are in a single place but gradually filling up firelink shrine also gives a solid reference on your game progress lastly dark souls 3 remains consistent in the series approach to telling its story that is hardly doing it at all the player can either follow popular fan theories or making up their own based on scarce snippets of information that can be derived from visuals and item descriptions arguably the general premise of dark souls 3 is ending the story that began with the first game showing a true end of the world the silver lining one of few things truly ingenious to dark souls 3 is its absolutely striking visuals it is the most picturesque instalment by a longshot dark souls 3 s bosses are also a huge highlight all of them having 2 phases additionally with the general tempo of the game increased the fights are more intense and satisfying than they ever were paired up with soundtrack specifically made to match the fights dark souls 3 delivers the sensation of a truly epic undertaking while being a little obscure dark souls 3 offers large amount and variety of npc questlines and interactions perhaps ds 3 is a somewhat uninspired game and in certain areas such as the number of valid builds or magic is a step back in regard to ds 2 it remains a tremendous game given the series notoriety for its difficulty it is not a title for everyone though if you are not afraid of rising up to the challenge over time this game is a must play also if you were to pick a single title from souls series this is the one to go with not only it is the most polished but it also has by far largest multiplayer base dark souls 1 atmosphere and dark souls 2 improvements by your powers combined i am dark souls 3
