2021 this game has been designed by professionals which is obvious by all the details this 81 year old can play the game not as good as others but enough to enjoy it i love the close ups and the background noises the battle scenes are also brilliant my only objection which is huge huge huge is i have no access all of a sudden to dlc because the game is controlled by ubisoft ubisoft seem determined to annoy there paying steam customers as much as possible why even to play the game you have to more or less sell your soul to get onto the game password for this password for that its totally stupid at my time of life i sometimes forget things and i certainly am too old to start putting my hand up to leave the room which ubisoft seem to want to do i wanted to buy some of the settlers games and further dlc for this game but i am a nasty horrible steam user who has absolute faith in them and do not want to go through the jumping of hoops to purchase a game besides which jumping is no longer in my port folio if you do not mind the jumping of hoops you should buy this game it is absolute quality and a superb city builder with magnificent story lines and a everlasting length of gameplay
