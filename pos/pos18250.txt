2021 so many times i ll see the dismissive and insulting put down of a game on here it s a poor mobile port and i mean in a lot of cases they re not wrong a lot of junk does get pulled over from mobile and often with an inflated price tag too and often done quite lazily happily while this is very much a mobile game it is a shining example of how to do it right and just because it lives on mobile it can exist here too right off the bat this is obviously a tower defence game so of course it works well on mobile screens however it is not a lazy copy paste of other games it very much does it s own thing and after at least 5 other main entries they ve refined and added so much to make it a compelling and quite deep game all round plenty of maps and the towers in this game are the monkeys who have different abilities you have your basics here the basic single shot type the area of effect blaster the elemental or explosive attackers too but it s more diverse than that it s by no means a simple rock paper scissors that so many tower defence games descend into where you have to pre empt the next wave and build towers to suit no this game has monkeys which can only be used on certain types of land and in later stages the land gets rather minimal too have really diverse capabilities to combat enemies like camouflaged balloons that only they will track or reveal or metal balloons that require a sniper or cannon type to pierce so the balancing act here is much deeper and entertaining especially when you get to harder difficulties the enemies in the game being the balloons themselves and they are many there s something lovely and cathartic about hearing shedloads of balloons get popped at once and this lends to the enjoyment well later waves will often become overwhelming instantly if you ve made poor choices in tackling them as there s just that many that come in waves but despite this it s fair if you mess up you learn what you did wrong and fix it next time on top of this there s a basic levelling xp system where levelling up rewards you with xp points to improve your monkey s abilities slightly again this is a great help with harder difficulties and later maps and i feel is really well balanced you earn about at the right rate as you play it s so easy to get that bit wrong on top of this there s added frippery like cosmetics and ui changes and so on if you wish for it as well as daily weekly and monthly custom challenges and seasonal events these are usually rewarded with different skins or heroes or sometimes new monkeys themselves all in all it s not only well polished well paced and deep enough to keep coming back to but it has enough there for repeated play even if you finish the main game which i ll point at out 60 hours in myself i still have not finished so as tower defence games go this is right up there with defense grid sanctum and some of the other shining examples don t overlook it as a mobile cash in because it isn t if you like tower defence you will absolutely love this especially if you like the cute aesthetic ninja kiwi seem well involved in keeping up interest with the events and challenges so i doubt anyone would tire of this quickly at all
