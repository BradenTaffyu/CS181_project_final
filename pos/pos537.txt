2023 stardew valley is a very very nice relaxing and fun game it gives to player interesting gameplay including a lot of different things to do from completing tasks to just freely exploring the world from farming to fighting with monsters in caves there is always something to do actively in this game or just listening of pleasant music the variety of locations and the change of seasons looks great each npc has its own unique character their development is very interesting to watch and of course one of the best parts cute pixel graphics all of this you can enjoy with your three friends in co op mode i highly recommend it to everyone
