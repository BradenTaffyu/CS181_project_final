2016 after spending 50 hours on it i figured stardew valley is due for a review story characters while not heavily driven by the story stardew valley sets up your farm life and fills it with many solid and fun cutscenes you ll also run into a few nuggets of lore occasionally every villager in stardew valley is unique and worth getting to know 9 10gameplay the farming life has never been better i fell in love with farming then with fishing then with mining all these are valid methods of keeping a steady income in stardew valley so i had fun devoting days to different activities while also completing different quests and requests from the villagers also there are mods which i haven t even gotten into yet 9 5 10sound relaxing colorful and happy music kept me humming while doing my daily work the sound effects were also bright and they fit in perfectly 9 10replay value i played stardew valley for 45 hours in that time i completed 1 5 years got married earned quite a lot of items and money and almost finished the community center that might satisfy most i plan to do it all again with a few mods 8 10overall score 8 9summary personally i had a ton of fun with stardew valley and will never forget this game thanks to concernedape for this awesome game i love the crap out of it everyone should at least try it begin your life in stardew valley
