this a fantastic live service game and is a terrible gacha game no fomo apart from one event no vertical investment in units no rng for scummy builds artifacts relics etc actually fun turn based combat unheard of for a gacha also the fact that you can just grind currency for new units for absolutely free and 10 99 every three months for the bp is the whole extent of spending for 90 of players that choose to story is absolutely fantastic and just keeps getting better and better art is phenomenal music by studio eim and mili is banger after banger basically live service library of ruina if i had to drop every gacha i ve played to keep only one it s limbus hands down it s p e a k personally endorsed absolute kino
