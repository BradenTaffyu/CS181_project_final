2023 so this game initially is a great time waster for people who just want to grind something 40 hours is more than enough for me to recommend a free game so pick it up and give it a go but the reality of the game starts at tier 5 at that point its up to you if you want to stick with it let me explain in a wall of tedious text for the first portion of the game you are pitted against other new players and bots up until tier 4 where you start getting introduced to the 2 tier higher games meaning half the team will be tier 5 and 6 leaving you a much weaker this doesnt sound too bad because you can just play well and win through tactics right what if i told you there was a thing called troll armor what this does is add areas to a tank where you cannot penetrate period but for tier 4s this areas is basically the entire tank while you are left unarmored so in reality you are below worthless you could on the other hand scout for the team but the issue with that is the higher tiers have greater spotting range and camo since they are in the longer tiers to climb they also have equipment and crew that drastically improve their advantages further in short you will have 0 impact in this game 0 impact low xp which longer and longer times to upgrade to t5 then you get to tier 5 its still the same problem as you will now face t6 and 7 but you can now start adding equipment to help reduce the advantages they have over you but the troll armor will stay more or less the same you are better off learning the tanks and their weakpoints and 99 of the time running away unless they leave a weakpoint open which rarely happens you will probably instantly die to the higher tier even if you get it aim is also rng so even if you spot a weakpoint you arent always going to hit it even if you do you arent always going to pen it unless it is a pure weakpoint and in tier 5 a well known thing is seal clubbers people who played the game for hundreds of hours but stay in t5 with the t5 meta tanks maxed out ready to destroy some newer players who arent aware of all the weakpoints yet strategically the basic play t5 is at the start cross as much dead ground as possible to get to a secure tactical position once you ve arrived you then wait for the scouts who are now more comfortable with the line being further forward to start making their moves and spotting tanks in the open this allows for the artillery to do its thing from the back lines once the heavies have arrived at the positions with the medium tanks they will start to crawl forward and breakthrough or camp till the enemy makes a move mediums try some fancy pop shots and keep the heavies flanks guarded overcoming the heavies weakness mediums are also open to reposition depending on how the map starts to look pretty basic stuff ofc it can get a bit more complex but nothing insane sadly in my experience rng and troll armor is the biggest deciding factor in the skirmishes most fights are standoffs that last for most the game which makes it more like a game of hide and seek than a fast paced combat game it can get pretty boring waiting around if that s not your thing because it will happen many games half the team doesnt even leave the spawn area and just hides in bushes waiting to pick off anyone who makes an advance into dead ground and lets be honest someone has to eventually unless you want every game to time out with no action but yeah the troll armor is incredibly bad some tanks are immune entirely unless you can get behind them to a tiny vent which if you understand how terrain works its mostly impossible especially when the only ones who can move fast enough to get there have lower armor so the trade isnt even worth taking majority of the times as i said the mediums will be there to destroy you the moment you consider it remember if you cant do damage then you get no xp so its pure hell you cant impact the game and you cant increase in tiers i would much prefer to hit them for 10 damage on an armored part than 0 at least then you get something so there is a way to overcome some troll armor and thats premium ammo it used to cost gold to fire which is the real money currency but now it costs high amounts of silver for new players this isnt sustainable you need to be playing in at least t7 to get a decent income and too increase that more you need a premium tank i havent yet used the ammo for obvious reasons since i only have t5s so i cant say how effective it is but i assume some more points become available to hit on tanks that previously appeared to be immune needless to say i wont bore you anymore short explanation is troll armor removes alot of the tactics slowing the game down to a crawl you constantly face seal clubbers and higher tiers which makes you feel helpless and the community is about as toxic as one can get their egos are so high they think camping in a game for 10 minutes translates to skill ignore them if you decide to play you will only get better and they will not show don t tell if anyone is more knowledgeable about the game feel free to correct anything i said that s wrong or give ideas on how to beat troll armor i m sure it will help players who decide to try the game out
