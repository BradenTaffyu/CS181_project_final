2016 re written review hi guys i m here to tell you about dark souls 3 this review is slightly more applicable for those who have played through the previous souls games but is basic enough for people to get the jist if they haven t dark souls is a mesh between a horror survival adventure game it s a game with an extremely visceral combat system that is extremely fair and true to hitboxes if you swing your sword and it clips past their shoulder it wont do jack weapons and movement within the game is tight and your trusty sword and shield are your best friends so what s so special about dark souls 3 well dark souls 3 has a fantastic world filled with delight obscurities and a variety of locations creatures and bosses that will have you thinking the game is built around the notion of a single goal which is to acquire the souls of the lords of cinder by slaying them you aren t given a whole lot of direction and there is definately no hand holding if you like using your intuition this is gonna be up your alley as well as the other souls games so what are the pro s and con s of the title pros detailed world surprising amount of indirect lore and depth runs great some people have issues which is a shame but it s a minority it sucks but this is launch it s gonna happen smooth 60fps with the option for 4k textures makes this game a pretty one fantastic sound design from gurgling death sounds to boss music the ambient and orchestral sounds are superb swordplay and general combat is tight as ever you are making full use of the controller with a huge amount of dynamic situations and variety replayability it s a souls game and the souls games are renound for their replayability interesting characters and questlines npc s are very memorable even if their interactions are breif yet very concise neutral points here goes the world is linear not as linear as dark souls 2 but not as interconnected as dark souls 1 this isn t a bad thing dark souls 1 was interconnected but gave the impression that everything was tightly packed and squashed together dark souls 2 tried to give the sense of you travelling throughout a whole land instead of a small chunk however the levels often lacked the variety was their but the complex nature of dark souls 1 individual areas was lacking dark souls 3 makes a very nice mix of the two there are many branching paths and a huge amount of verticality in the game whilst still giving you a sense of direction covenants which are the games factions seem to be as niche as ever they are ever more accessable but still provide not a whole lot of content by themselves early game tends to favor the knight class a lot and while there are many viable early game weapons many will stick with the longsword for a while not a problem but doesnt create a huge amount of variety cons while more accessable this game is still hard to get into if you re new it s worth the try but many simply dont understand it it s like marmite if you love it you really love it but some simply just don t like it that s fine netcode issues this is a pretty big one right now dark souls matchmaking uses a dedicated server system to initiate the multiplayer but multiplayer itself is p2p it s a fantastic system that in dark souls 3 works very well you can also password sessions but the netcode of the game has trouble handling packet loss and its quite a big con enemy invaders or even your coop friends can be stuck in a limbo t pose showing no animations whatsoever they are sometimes able to be invincible or see the world in a completely different way many times i have invaded or helped with a boss and they just phase right through me but i can still do damage it s a huge problem right now for only the multiplayer portion of the game definately worth the price and you will enjoy every minute of it if you are a fan of the dark souls games there is a lot of homage to the series as it is rumored to be the last game dark souls not souls game buy it
