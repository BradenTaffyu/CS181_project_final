2015 early access review i ve never played a better game than project zomboid i play this regularly both single player and on a 360 controller coop with my girlfriend its an amazing experience to try and survive together even more so against people online on our own locally hosted server the pro s amazing dev team that really care about the end product even with the setbacks they ve faced in the past they kept going good replayability and customization there s a lot to do one day we will have ai vehicles and hookers in fact forget the hookers big community who keep modding the game and the developers are using some parts of this to advance the games development multiplayer updates that really add to the game each time plus its actually updated unlike some other titles news via their website every monday that lets you know what they re doing to the game can also sign up to the news letter usually quite a nice read cons it can get repetitive building and killing zombies haha who am i kidding it never gets old the only objective is to survive so you do need to either have an obsessive hoarding disorder lol or simply enjoy surviving to get the most out of this gameedit bit of advice if playing co op always check the oven
