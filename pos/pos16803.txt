2018 i hemmed and hawed over getting this game glad i did it s surprisingly fun it genuinely made me laugh outloud at least twice due to unexpected surprises gags the latest update that allowed for us to move the bathroom fixtures made a huge difference to the game it finally encouraged me to knock down enough walls to upgrade that skill things i d love to see in further updates barring the usual plaint of workshop please a choice on the house flipper being male or female not a huge thing but seriously my arms aren t that hairy landscaping gardening because those weeds outside drive me nuts for some of the unique to certain houses items in the buy list having a washer without a dryer is strange the ability to paint the furniture i m doing that in real life it d be great to do it fast in a game so i can whine about how hard reality is honestly though it d be great to repair match the furniture more especially the green sink cupboard wiring in stoves gas more surprises with new houses buyers i do love knocking down walls to uncover hidden things it d be neat if some of the buyers refuse a house because the exterior looks horrible some more siding options would help let us edit add new windows coving lintels fireplaces over all great relaxing game nice not to have a sim type game without ultra micro managing
