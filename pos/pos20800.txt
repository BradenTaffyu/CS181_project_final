2023 allow me to begin this review by saying that as a harry potter fan since i was a kid practically grew up with the books hogwarts legacy is the harry potter game i ve always dreamt of allowing me to finally visit hogwarts as a student myself having my own adventures instead of following the plot from the books the story is set around 100 years before the books you play as a hogwarts student who just recently got accepted into the school and as a fifth year no less while this may seem weird as one would expect to start from first year it s both explained in the story and honestly allows the player to jump straight into the action instead of going through the basics anyway at the start of the game you re just about to depart to hogwarts alongside professor fig who s been getting you up to speed with some basic spellcasting things don t go precisely well on the journey there and you end up getting involved in the latest goblin rebellion honestly i can say i enjoyed the story though the best part of the narrative comes through the companion sidequests while there s four main companions with a certain involvement in the main story one for each house only three of them get their own personal side story when it comes to gameplay it s an open world action adventure game with some light rpg elements while there s dialogue choices throughout the game they don t really affect your relationship with other characters nor do they lock you out of content well you can choose not to learn the unforgivable curses combat is done through spellcasting while at first you only have a basic cast as you progress through the story you unlock new spells including as i mentioned above the unforgivable curses now the game basically allows using them willy nilly and there s no consequences for going on a murdering spree of course it can be excused as you re fighting dark wizards and evil goblins beyond that you can also get a broom to get around the map no quidditch though or even a hippogrif mount there s also different skill trees in the form of talents which give you different upgrades and while you can craft equipment you can upgrade certain pieces of equipment also a great plus is that you can change the appearance of your gear to that of any other gear you ve found so you don t end up looking like a madman wearing mismatching clothes there s lots of stuff to do in this game beyond the main story and the side quests perhaps too much at times as it can feel a bit tedious going for 100 completion there s different mini puzzles in the form of merlin trials broom races and at one point in the story you unlock the room of requirement which works as a sort of base where you can brew potions or grow plants to use in combat plus you also get to rescue animals and put them in your own personal shelter treat them well and they ll give you resources of course it can feel a bit morally questionable how you rescue animals to get their resources but the game makes it look like you re at least treating them fairly and you can even release them to the wild graphically it looks gorgeous hogwarts itself is very detailed as are the surrounding areas and the map is huge too not only do you get to explore hogwarts the forbidden forest and hogsmeade but there s also plenty of little hamlets spread throughout the map all with their own little collectibles merchants and side quests the sound design is also very good the dialogue is well written and the performances are all very good and the soundtrack is excellent some tracks resemble the movies but the game has its own style as well now to talk about hogwarts itself it s fantastic the design of the castle resembles that of the movies but there s still many details you d find only in the books including characters peeves the poltergeist makes an appearance here as well as the different house ghosts since you can go to any house they all get a very detailed common room and a positive i have to note about the game is how they made slytherins not be complete jerks sure it s always seen as the evil house but over here while they re still very ambitious folk most of them aren t hateful people just a bit of overachievers the professors you meet are also great characters and while there may not be as many lessons as one would expect in a game that s all about being a hogwarts student you still get a nice taste of student life all things considered i must say i definitely recommend this game and it s certainly a contender for my personal goty though we ll have to see what else comes out this year
