2021 introduction fh5 is basically an improvement over fh4 in every single way playground games have taken user feedback from fh4 its 2 expansions and its live program and implemented it in fh5 to improve the experience looking at fh4 it s very likely that this game will also be supported for around the same time graphics and audio the visuals have received a significant improvement over fh4 with the inclusion of higher fidelity car models and world geometry made with photogrammetry the new global illumination system provides more accurate lighting in most conditions the 12k skies captured on location are back in fh4 with 10 times the sky presets available in fh4 providing a wide variety conditions to drive in ray tracing is available only in forzavista but can be enabled in gameplay with a cheat engine hack notably with all these improvements over fh4 the spec requirements are still relatively modest with the game performing well even on dated hardware without sacrificing too much on quality sfx have received a big improvement over fh4 with higher quality recordings as well as a greater number of them providing a lot more unique sounds to the wide selection of cars car upgrades now affect the sound of a car meaning cars sound a lot more unique as every player customises their car differently ray traced audio has also been implemented bouncing sound off of the environment tress rocks mountains etc to provide realistic echoes and low tones one of the important features of any horizon game is the soundtrack and pg have curated an excellent selection of tracks along with many original tracks made in collaboration with artists they ve worked with in the past specifically for the game all the radio stations from fh4 are back with timeless being rebranded to eterna gameplay the handling model is the most important aspect of any racing game horizon has always followed the simcade approach providing simplicity to casual players and complexity to experienced players fh5 improves on the handling model by making the cars feel more weighty and responsive and the new changes to the suspension model makes it easier to drive off road wheel support has also received a big improvement adding support for more wheels however hand over hand steering is still missing driving modes and raising lowering the roof in convertibles in freeroam has been added however currently the feature is limited to very few cars and hopefully the number will increase in time the new weather events in the form of tropical storms and dust storms make the world feel more dynamic and add interesting challenges to the gameplay by affecting visibility and traction these storms can be seen from a distance and players can choose to drive into them or avoid them the same is true with the seasons system previously in fh4 players were forced to play in snow or rain depending on the season however in fh5 snow and rain are limited to certain parts of the map allowing players to opt out of them expanding on blueprints and super 7 from fh4 the new events lab feature gives even more control over custom game modes and props to users allowing for even greater user generated content to be made events lab allows players to set their own game rules and create actions using if then type actions campaign and progression the campaign is now called horizon adventure and adds a lot more progression compared to previous games players must earn accolades which are like mini achievements for completing various actions in the game which then unlock points that can be redeemed on various activities that further the campaign the way that it s been set up allows players to earn accolades from any activity they liked doing and are not forced to do activities they don t like accolades provide incentive for players to play the game in different ways and explore activities they usually don t indulge in the accolades leaderboard encourages competition amidst players to rise the ranks the season system returns from fh4 with a slight redesign to adapt to the new location the traditional seasons spring summer autumn and winter are now simplified and called hot wet storm and dry the festival playlist which ties in to the week long seasons is back with a few tweaks and the promise of including user generated content and making more substantial changes to the game world such as the world makeover for christmas adding snowmen and presents to smash around the world multiplayer online adventure is now called the horizon open and does not feature ranked racing might change in the future eliminator has been added into horizon open which is the battle royale game mode first introduced in fh4 and quickly became the most played online game mode horizon tour is a new game mode which involves team vs team racing against ai the extremely long loading times in fh4 sadly carry over to this game along with the inability to mute in game voice chat whether the new handling model changes makes awd and meta car builds less over powered will only be made clear with time forzathon live events from fh4 have now been renamed to horizon arcade with some changes the changes made to arcade has made it unplayable as the lack of participating players combined with the small time limit and big score requirements makes completing the event almost impossible as of the time of writing this review players are expecting connection issues which should be fixed soon which edition should i get the game has 3 editions on offer standard deluxe and premium standard and premium offer the best value with deluxe only adding the car pass over the standard edition if you re new to the franchise the standard edition offers the best value if you re a horizon veteran and know you re going to put in a ton of hours in premium could save you some money on dlcs you ll end up buying anyway if you bought the standard edition conclusion fh5 can be seen as a refinement of the formula that worked so well for past horizons one of the best handling models in any arcade style racing game breathtaking visuals and a soundtrack to complement it mexico as the new location is a great choice providing a wide variety of environments combined with the new weather events adding more dynamicity with this being playground games 2nd live service program and their history of listening to community feedback the game is sure to improve over time and receive new and interesting content over its lifetime tl dr if you liked fh4 you ll love fh5 if you re new to horizon games this is a great one time experience even if you don t stick with the game but chances are you ll get addicted also skip the deluxe edition update this game deserved to be nominated for goty if not win the award
