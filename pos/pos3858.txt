2018 early access review troubleshooter is a game that still needs a lot of work but has huge potential made by a small team who is very active with the gaming community when i buy an early access game it is more to support the game that i feel like i will like rather than to play it early normally i buy the early access game try it a little bit then come back to it when the game is fully released however in this case i am having trouble not playing the game even in its early state the game is very fun still needs a lot of balance and translation work but the creation team is making constant updates and improvements to the game seriously look at the update log on steam these guys are busy cranking out updates and patches at an incredable rate especially for how small the team is i am really looking forward to the games full release keep up the great work guys
