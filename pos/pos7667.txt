2019 early access review ah beamng probably one of the hardest games to write a review for with the vast amount of stuff this game offers like driving cars this game has cars it also has trucks there s also a van and a piano there s also a functional cannon like crashing cars you can do that whether you chuck it off a cliff slam it into a tree crash it into another car or yeet it into a destructible brick wall you re almost always to get realistic results each and every time like driving you can drive sometimes at over 300 miles per hour you can also drive at many places including but not limited to italy utah the u s west coast the u s east coast and a flat grid you can also make your own places to drive though its a pretty complex process not satisfied with the standard game you can get mods including custom vehicles such as dog really really really tall van big tires and a foam block wall there are also mods that add new places to drive to the game such as really long highway ski jump designed for cars and a couple of maps that cant really be described using text worried the game wont run on your system alright thats actually a reasonable thing to be worried about this is a very hardware intensive game but it can run on rather low end devices albeit poorly chances are if your setup is from 2014 or later you can probably get 45 fps at most maps at the end of the day this is a really fun vehicle sandbox game i d recommend it to anybody who likes cars or games with really good destruction physics
