2020 early access review since i have played this game my life has never known peace the developer is in fact an transdimensional shape shifting lizard god that tight beams thought pollution directly into my brain via microwave radiation installing this interactive game is your unwitting consent to malevolent carpal micromanipulators scrawling ancient sumero aryan death glyphs directly into the walls and floors of your consciousnessi cannot stress this enough the developers of this title are actively practicing psychoideological terrorismgame is great this is a negative review
