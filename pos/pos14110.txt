2018 early access review very fun and addictive as visible by my play time possibly the best base building game with a bit of chemistry and science mixed in your duplicants are most likely gonna die on your first run but the replayability is amazing it only gets more replayable from the constant updates that the game gets every couple of weeks it had alot of bugs and probably still has some but eventually work on every bug the art style as amazing as with every game by the devs klei the music is nice but very much just in the background the game is kinda slow if you know everything but that just means that it won t need all of your focus for all the hours of playing it the game has an awesome community that builds and shows amazing things within the game and makes beautiful art a bonus perk is that the charaters and creatures animations are very cute
