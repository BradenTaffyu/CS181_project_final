2017 love love love this game woops too soon to say the positive ok no worries i got some gripes with it too hahaok so i am a ww2 historian and find this game to be one of the more accurate representations of power within the world at the time of the nazi regime the game is amazing for an rts game but very difficult to play online the multiplayer isn t exactly optimized very well and could take a very long time to even remotely complete 1 game i do love the fact that this game has a large learning curve and you will fail on your first attempt at this game and that applies to each nation you use every single one has its own quirks and you gotta find it and exploit them it actually adds quite a lot to the game the industry is fairly difficult to understand at the start but it isn t impossible to grasp after a little i didn t play the tutorial so thats my own fault but it also takes a while to play through it also each nation has their sweet spot on how you should first put your industry make sure you learn that too my experiance is as follows i have played on iron man and have taken over the world with usa germany russia and japan i have not tried the uk yet and i honestly don t have the urdge to also by taking over the world i mean i had no allies and no help from any ai or player pros challenging its ww2 historically accurate to a certain degree large learning curve mods there always more than one way to win with each nation tech tree is easy to navigate and not difficult to learncons alot of micro managing game starts to lag after a while during the late game repetative and gets dull after a few playthroughs would i recommend yes a solid 8 10
