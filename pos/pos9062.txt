2016 my first 4x ever but it s not the kind of games that especially interested me i also wasn t attracted by 4x because of their visible difficulty but i found stellaris is accessible for noobs as me i am still playing my first play pros lots of empires original species mods support that add empires ships etc nice visuals accessible but not easy as hellcons lack of contents plethora of incoming expensive dlc in order to finish the game update it s shame because late game it s really unplayble i5 6600k 4 5ghz gtx 970 exoc and 16 go ddr4 i got 1 2 fps
