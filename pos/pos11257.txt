early access review ark was a game that people kept suggesting i try over the years and after retiring last month it was one of the first games i attempted to explore with the dream pc i d just acquired i did have to learn some ins and outs of how to get the game to play nice with my geforce package and learned a lot in the process and now i m playing in max settings with my own little world i m slowly exploring and carving out footholds in the game is gorgeous very hard as you learn but there are almost always mechanics you are missing or combinations you ve overlooked to simplify things a good example is when i discovered bolas were actually very useful for the animals that would run away before i could subdue and skin them additionally my options expanded when some bola targets were still capable of destroying me up close whereupon i discovered the sling shot can knock them out for cheap stones as ammo and allow me to safely harvest or tame you can build bases and i suggest using some foundations to get a bit out over the water if you do where larger monsters might not be able to path or swim depending on what they are creativity and using the environment to give you extra safety and shelter in this game is well done but your own ingenuity and interpretation of the mechanics as well as how open you are to experimenting will all be the biggest deciding factors in how quickly you adapt and ascend badam cha
