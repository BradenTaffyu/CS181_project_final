2018 such a great game in my opinion obviously it s a pity that we won t see another game come close the the greatness that was plants vs zombies goty edition sincerely the other pvz garden warfare or plants vs zombies ii can be fun sometimes but it ll never come to the game of the year status that the first one was able to achieve the combination of great gameplay with the nostalgia feeling hits player in their hearts even to this day very impressive if you consider the fact that it is rapidly approaching its 10th anniversary for beginners it is a very intuitive game the tutorial follows the players progression in understanding the game s mechanics and overall feeling the idea of starting with a small garden only one line and slowly progressing to the full garden is ingenious we have take into consideration that it is both a game that adults can play but it has its kid friendly intuitive system that is very important for a game to succeed other that the game keeps it fresh every ten levels having a different theme around weather and different parts of the outside of the house it also keeps it interesting with the minigames throught the last stages of each theme something that was attempted in pvz2 with the themes around the world but isn t done with such a simplicity and awesomeness that we can observe in the first game the game after you finish it includes bonus features such as easter eggs and handicaps if you want to start the storymode again it also have multiple minigames and puzzles in the menu which add to the value of the gameplay and overall experience for veterans of the game you can also play the survival mode which include 10 levels featuring the different themes we see throught the game plus an endless level where you can test your hability to see how far you can go without getting you brains eaten by zombies to this day i still struggle to beat the giga gargantuars also the small things such as the game s eastereggs which cracks me up everytime and the achievement system makes it so you actually have something to go for the game also features sort of a gardening system that you can earn money while you are not defending your house agains t the livingdead the zen garden which is a peaceful place where you can cultivate your plants and see them grow another clever idea in pvz is the introduction of the crazydave character a funny and craaazy personality that allows you to purchase upgrades and overall quality of life items that will help you in battle in conclusion it is not everyday that a game such as plants vs zombies is made i personally have have played it and replayed it many many times and it never gets old i would rate this game from a strong 9 to a decent 10 instant classic status and will forever have a place in our hearts
