2019 early access review however the developers want to frame it truth is the development is taking took too long some of the people that invested in this game back in the day have died before seeing this game come out time is a very valuable commodity and these developers weren t honest when they put the game out for sale disrespecting everyone s investment it has been in early access hell since the birth of early access the game is unfinished and unpolished to this day and even after if they do polish the game to an acceptable degree the time it took to get there was unacceptable the developers are also usually rude and crass with their responses and the community is infested with a minority of toxic fanboys that defend these developers even when they say very rude things to the people who invested in them however not all is bad the rest of the community is very good and respectful if impatient the game systems while incomplete work well in tandem with each other crafting is very enjoyable even if unfinished cars are fun and surviving forever is possible whether that is enjoyable for you or not it is unfinished but in a playable state multiplayer is essential for a good experience roleplaying is ok as well overall my experience was positive the game is enjoyable to someone used to playing games without polish if you need polish in your game however go search elsewhere
