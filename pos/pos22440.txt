2016 ds3 feels like it was created to be at the very least an extended stopping point for the series with three games in less than five years i imagine fromsoftware is going to let this series sleep for a while and ds3 serves an excellent stopping point though there s still a couple of dlc left and no developer does significant dlc better than fromsoft i ll touch on some of the main aspects of the game as you already probably know fast travel is in from the start a la ds2 unfortunately this means world connectivity is ds2 styled rather than ds1 fortunately the level design is outstanding the levels are consistently smart with shortcuts enemy layout and secrets and there s even a couple of cool optional areas there are very few signs of the time crunch that plagued later ds1 areas and there s a lack of the some of more uninspired area design choices of ds2 i ve seen some complaints about the number of bonfires though it didn t really feel like an issue while playing the game and is mostly inflated by each boss area getting a bonfire after beating them so you end up with a few post boss bonfires that are very close to the where the next section begins it feels like fromsoft decided to add bonfires for each defeated boss late in the process so the player never runs into a situation where they die before they can use their souls still there a number of bonfires that grouped close together but they re more there for convenience sake rather than making areas easier that ties into another aspect of the game the return of the level up mistress and area hub in the style of ds2 some people really like having everything in one place that s basically a safe zone but i find it takes away from the game s atmosphere and a nuisance to have to fast travel to a hub to level up or upgrade weapons for me it hurts the sense of adventure and isolation of an area to have to return to the hub so often especially mid level the hub characters you interact with most also have extremely limited dialogue so you don t get much from interacting with them next bosses and enemy design is great both visually and mechanically very little ds2 style large humanoid that rotates on its axis most bosses have multiple phases and they re easily the best designed group in the series there s only a couple of duds and they re not nearly as poor as the weaker ones found in the first two games ds3 is also much better at denying players from simply circling to the right against random enemies the first encounter with a knight will punish the player for doing this and force the player to adapt different tactics since the enemy ai is significantly improved at dealing with this type of behavior it s probably the most difficult game in a fair way in the series i probably died more in ds2 but that s largely because of some poor enemy layouts that favor extreme leashing and quantity of enemies rather than a true sense of difficulty i don t ever try to kite stuff in these types of games so maybe my experience in fighting large groups of enemies varies widely from yours but ds3 s multiple enemy challenges are very well done and the best in the series it also has the best difficulty curve in the series with each new area and boss being just a bit harder than the previous one and this lasts practically the entire game visually enemy boss design is outstanding there a number of times i was impressed with how even the most generic of enemies either looked or acted there are just some great looking enemies environmental design looks amazing too with a couple of vistas that are stunning to look at with one reveal in particular probably serving as the most impressive looking intro to an area in the series in short ds3 is an great game and while i don t think ds2 is bad more disappointing than anything this feels more like the type of sequel that the original deserved though ds1 is one of my favorite games ever if the the quality of dlc is up to par with the rest of fromsoft s games i could see ds3 ranking right up there with it definitely recommended to anyone slightly interested in the series or to those that were kind of turned off by ds2
