2018 i absolutely enjoyed every minute i put into dos2 and would like to recommend this game to everyone who is reading this but i don t want to be tediously lengthy because adding to the sea of praises for dos2 is redundant you search it up and you will find things everywhere like best pc game of 2017 best rpg ever best game xxx ve ever played they are all correct and they have conviced many people to buy the game and share the amazing experience but they haven t worked on you because you are still reading a nobody s review to decide whether this game is worth your money so i guess i have to write a bit moreyou haven t played this game why i get it you saw some screenshots watched some videos and probably you don t like some elements of the game it s nothing like what you ve played before and you thought well it s not your type doesn t suit your taste i know people are way too individualized but what defines your taste youtubers streamers friends game studios no it s yours a true gamer never stops exploring every once in a while you need to step out of your comfort zone and try something different yes from what you ve learned about this game your prejudices are probably 100 accurate but if you haven t tried it please don t believe you won t like it if you ve had the patience to read thus far stir up a bit of courage and buy this game just sit back empty your mind and dos2 will expand it then blow it up into pieces if for some stupid reason you are still reluctant to try this game it would be such a painful loss a shame and a pity for both me and you because then apparently i have failed to convince you and you would have missed the oppourtunity to enjoy hundreds of hours of divine entertainment that you could never obtain by other means lastly for people who have completed and loved this game but haven t written a review please do it let s get this gem back to overwhelmingly positive where it deserves to be
