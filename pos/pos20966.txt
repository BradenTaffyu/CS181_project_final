dave the diver doesn t have a clear focus which is simultaneously its biggest weakness and greatest selling point no one mechanic ever feels fully fleshed out but they come and go so rapidly that it doesn t really matter the day to day loop of diving for fish then managing a sushi restaurant gets abandoned pretty fast while the game initially appears to be an upgrade style tycoon game it starts mixing in new experiences and minigames really quickly you start going on rescue missions collecting pokemon taking safari pictures feeding cats farming raising chickens meeting ancient underwater civilizations fighting neolithic era monsters playing rhythm games raising tamagotchis playing a mini version of dredge and even going on spy missions while this kept the experience fresh it never felt like it had any depth to it the moment a mechanic approaches satisfying complexity it gets swapped out for a new one recommended at a discount to make a fun couple weekends it makes for a poor tycoon game but still a strong overall game if you can embrace the absurdity
