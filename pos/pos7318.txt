2022 early access review raft ocean survival where you live and build on a raft exploring islands the ocean and gathering supplies very much a grinding game storyline is still in development challenging or more relaxing depending on the difficulty you choose co op fun with friends some bugs and world glitches but the game can autosave every 10 minutes meaning if you run into trouble you have world backups beautiful graphics the game runs on lower spec pcs even lower settings look nice still graphics really pretty there is also a creative mode has a hunter gatherer aspect gave me minecraft vibes so if you like open world survival you will enjoy this game seagulls are mfs and the shark ate my ass like groceries edit 75hrs in and still fun asfedit 119 hours in you can still have fun but iv gotten almost all the achievements and theres not much left to discover building your raft is the main objective after that so for now it s kinda like in minecraft where you have everything you could possibly need not as enjoyable but still a great coop game when they update i will add another edit
