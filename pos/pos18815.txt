2018 of course i recommend europa universalis iv it is one of the best games out there the only frustrating element about the franchise is how the developer paradox games a swedish company uses it i will review the game below but i would like to start off with the biggest turn offs to eu4 dlc point 1 yeah there are 26 of them on sale you could get all of them and the base game for about 175 if you think paying 175 for the complete version of this video game or any video game for that matter is way too much then you are absolutely correct most of us play the steam sale game and convince ourselves that we are prudent shoppers since 2013 when eu4 came out most of us have spent at least 150 on this title it is ridiculous and i am ashamed of myself my advice is that you simply wait ten years from the release date of a game and then get the complete version for under 10 if you can t do that then you are part of the problem dlc point 2 paradox operates out in the open you can see everything they are doing if you hate it then show self control paradox does not just have a base game and expansion packs like normal developers do these guys intentionally remove or leave out content from their games so as to package them for up sells paradox has this thing it calls a content pack this is where they withhold minor cosmetic details from the base game or expansion pack they just released and then try to sell it to you for 3 to 8 depending if it s on sale yes dinky little skins and portrait pictures are mercilessly used by paradox to make extra money off us every single expansion pack is released alongside a content pack they used to sell the music separately too but now they ve bundled it into its own collection dlc point 3 a similar up sell concept is the immersion pack these are relatively new from paradox but offer them another up sell opportunity these cost a little more than the content packs usually up to 10 these basically flush out one particular civilization society or geographic area just like the content packs these are not worth the cost and should be part of free content updates or saved until europa universalis v you do not get what you pay for while the expansion packs broaden the whole game the immersion packs broaden smaller elements of it the content packs put color between the lines this is how eu4 costs 150 for each of us the forums the reason why i don t go onto video game forums anymore has a lot to do with how paradox interactive runs theirs maybe things have changed since i quite going there back when eu3 was still hot but i really don t care the european online culture is typically quite low brow but with a faux tough attitude people say the stupidest things on there and it is hard to find a vocal person who is not a left wing extremist or some ranting atheist these guys yeah mostly guys typically slide their little shots into their posts and signatures and things and the environment just looks like a trash heap heck paradox requires that you register their games with them in order to use their website and that s just if you want to read what someone else wrote and otherwise not participate sometimes i would get assistance from the forum moderators or the game s developers but for the most part it was very obvious that these were greedy european minded people who view their customers more as fish in a barrel than as the lifeblood of their company to be honest the vast majority of us let paradox treat us that way with their outright stupid business practices so we deserve some blame when we complain about the remarkable idiocy of paradox interactive and the way they treat their market we should simply stop doing that and then spend our money elsewhere stop giving your money to paradox interactive let them go out of business support other developers as the consumers we have the power to control their practices right now jerks like paradox take what we are giving to them their games are fun but 175 video games means that you need to discipline yourself and stop feeding these greedy dumb asses who treat you like a prostitute the review all that said i will now write a review of europa universalis 4 the base game while franchises like this one with a million dlc packages driving the cost beyond 175 typically have intentionally weak base games eu4 is an exception the developer does in fact update the game still they are making money off of it so why not the updates play into their content immersion and expansion pack releases so the base game is still a great game like i said before europa universalis iv is one of the best games on the market right now for the entire complete version today in the year 2018 i would spend no more than 30 on it i usually don t spend more than 13 on any video game personally in terms of graphics we are dealing with a geographical presentation here it s just a map of the world with the largest inhabitable parts being the part with which you can interact the different nations are differently colored each with their own artificial intelligence ai computer controlled managers the units that formulate the armies or navies are simple drawn skins that only act as markers on the map eu4 is not about well drawn buildings blowin up in huge explosions as your main character cuts off heads it s like a huge board game where you manipulate up to hundreds of provinces that each have strategic value it s a strategy game so graphics are functional not glamorous the music is pretty good for the most part i personally think the best music pack is the free yuletide one but they are all done pretty well in general the music matches your nation s personality which is pretty cool you can also change what s playin when you want to the elements of the base game that are super fun are the ones that lead to nation customization the politics and diplmoacy plus the initial setup growing from a newb country to a thriving empire and engaging in things like trade and warfare you take calculated risks that sometimes go your way enabling you to enjoy the game handedly when you fail you are humbled and flustered finding yourself doing things you wish you didn t have to if you re anything like me you are less into warfare and more into expansion which usually requires some rough and tumble however i play at lower level difficulties which are more my speed and tolerance level i have played multiplayer before and that is pretty cool as human players make for more interesting diplomats in all i highly recommend that you buy europa universalis 4 my advice is that you pay for the entire complete version in a few years for 30 total if you want it now you will pay almost 200 for it which no video game is worth the base version at 20 is still not the best price i believe the base game if good enough to play by itself without all the add ons and i would only advise that you pay 10 for it it might sound like i am being cheap but the reality is that this is a video game have i logged a hundreds of hours on this game yes is that worth 200 no not to me anyway and given paradox greed and maltreatment of its market base which we tend to welcome sadly it puts a bad taste in my mouth to support these guys even if i benefit somehow buy eu4 the base game for 10 or 15 buy the complete version for 30 or 40 respect yourself
