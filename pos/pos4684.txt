2021 as someone who has played both nv and 4 extensively completing both multiple times let me try to make things clear if you want an rpg with a great story good dialogue options fantastic factions and an overall feel like your decisions matter in a major way i d recommend nv however if you re looking for an fps action shooter with a giant open world bursting with random encounters and missions to explore and fight through a weapons and armor customization tab that would make any gun lover piss themselves and overall diverse gunplay gameplay 4 is your game fallout 4 gets a lot of hate for not having the same rpg type gameplay as the other titles but i personally feel that the fps action mixed with a few rpg elements make this a really fun and unique game by itself it has flaws and it definitely has bugs it s a bethesda game what did you expect but i always find myself coming back to it and constantly finding new weapons and missions that i missed the previous playthroughs
