i ve played and loved most fallout games new vegas remains my favourite despite my personal gripes with it such as no sprinting mechanic in an expansive open world game without mods but i won t get into that right now fallout 4 brings new mechanics to the series that were much needed such as sprinting crafting better ai better sneaking etc alongside a bunch of stuff i didn t think i d love in a fallout game but with that came a lot of stuff that just brings frustration and minor annoyances i ll give a little background on my journey with this game i first played fallout 4 on ps4 when it first came out i was 17 and had just played and beaten 3 and nv for the first time after hearing my friends in school raving about the to be released game and having watched a friend playing nv my brother lent me his xbox 360 copies of 3 and nv to me after getting past the learning curve of 3 due to never having played a game like it before i was enthralled during the entire playthroughs craving more and was extremely excited to see what the next game had in store flash forward i had beaten the base game level 70 80 or so a beefy sole survivor kitted out with a gauss rifle and an abhorrent amount of stimpaks and the dlc s were coming out each dlc besides the workshop expansions had me hooked and coming back to the game daily even after beating the base game far harbor and nuka worlds maps were bigger than i initially assumed and i decided to get everything i could out of them after doing this i was like yeah i m gonna get the platinum trophy i never ended up doing that truthfully but i still did nearly everything i could do within the game on ps4 i had a real tough time getting the 100 happiness in a settlement trophy despite following multiple guides it was always stuck at 97 99 but i did eventually get it then i realized oh there s trophies for the different factions so i took a break and was going to eventually start a new file and save at the right time to get those trophies without having to replay the game multiple times i eventually came back and started a new file but then life got in the way i moved out of my parents house at the age of 19 lost my physical copy and was never able to return unless buying the game again now at the age of 26 i saw it was on sale for like 12 with all dlc s on steam after having not played in years i thought i d give it a go starting up again it s still really enjoyable playing on pc actually feels a lot better and i m still planning to eventually get every achievement but i m gonna get some negatives out of the way here that have probably been voiced a million times over for one and the most common complaint the dialogue options can be really limited and your options don t tell you exactly what you re going to say which can lead to you missing out on something or even getting yourself into combat needlessly the sarcastic option in particular can be really hit or miss and sometimes you just say a stupid joke sometimes you end up pissing off the person you are talking to the companions should have had no collision i love dogmeat but when he gets in my way while i m trying to walk through a doorway for the 8th time in that one building i want to chop his adorable lil head off they can also be damaged by the player and during a melee build run that can be pretty frustrating due to you wasting a slow heavy axe swing on your companion rather than the legendary mirelurk you re trying to quickly kill before it gets another heavy attack in on you the building mechanic is atrocious you have a wide variety of materials and stuff you can build with but when i can t place a wood platform down without looking in a totally different direction than where i want to place it something is wrong there and some of the material costs can be astronomical you could play this game for days without finding any good loot you want better armor in your first 60 hours good luck finding it it s mostly chems stimpaks ammo and caps along with a lot of low level armor and the same gun with a mild perk that does less damage than the one you currently have a last minute minor negative here i guess not that big a deal as many won t notice unless wearing decent quality headphones but some voicelines sound really weird i noticed this while speaking with piper for the first time with my audio mixing headphones but some of her voicelines just sounded like they were ripped straight from a discord call muffled and somewhat distorted but some sound like they re in a studio booth clean and crisp was just a weird thing i noticed and thought i d add but not a huge deal at all aside from some of these downsides and that s not all of them i just wanna make sure this review isn t 10 pages long i think there is a ton of great stuff in this game the quests are usually pretty satisfying specifically the companion quests because it s great to get some background on your companions and help them out the gunplay is fluent and satisfying in a lot of ways the enemies feel very real and some feel like real threats with no real way to cheese them unless you try hard enough when i first encountered a feral ghoul in this game i nearly my pants at how well they are animated better than most zombie games have done it by a longshot deathclaws are extremely intimating even at higher levels with how they weave around your line of fire they even pick you up and tell you you re my now before tearing your head clean off in one swoop the power armor in this game is cool as hell though sometimes the animation to get in and out of them can feel a bit slow it adds to the feeling of their sturdiness and power and being able to mod power armor in so many ways can be really rewarding though expensive the overall world is great to explore i may not see as much impactful environmental story telling as 3 or nv but it s there and some of it is really interesting the unique encounters can be really cool such as this one mine cave area you begin hallucinating what happened there before the war and if i remember correctly haven t found this place yet on the pc version no quest leads you there so it s an extremely interesting find to end off the positives i ll include a positive negative the character creation is way better than previous titles with specific sculpting areas on the face but there absolutely needed to be more hair options there is 2 maybe 3 good female character hair options i like to make nonsensical characters from time to time but when i want to make a nice looking female character i always go with the same 2 hair options default or the one that looks like default but a lil curlier because the rest look awful aside from that i always end up with someone looking mostly different from the last overall i think this game deserves more praise i believe there s a lot of ways it could ve been made better but the stuff they got right i hope to see in future titles i personally think it is one of the best open world games i ve played with a load of things to do and multiple ways to do it can t wait to get deeper into the story on this file and maybe pick up some stuff i may have missed all the way back in 2016 17 get this game if you like open world shooters with a lot of likable characters exploring and looting and some really great enemy design 8
