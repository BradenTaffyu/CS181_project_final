2018 theme hospital 2 0 first of all i have read alot of the bad reviews of this game and they are pure moans people who want easy lives and never wanting a patient to die ever in their entire game and perfectionists or people with ocd or some sh tthis game isnt like that people are gonna die alot but it doesnt stop ypu from achieving your objectives or running a decent profitable hospital i dont know how many people who have bought this game live in the uk and if they have ever heard of the nhs but seriously if you want a theme hospital this is it i dont know where else in the world it would take weeks to see a gp or to die before your planned treatment date this is more of an nhs simulator than anything so if you think this game is not realistic become a uk citizen and try our healthcare system jokes aside it s pretty much like the original theme hospital game it has a way you need to play it in order to become good at it you need to let deaths slide you need to send people home you need to monitor your patients and send them to treatment before they die you just got to keep an eye on things all the negative reviews i ve seen are just from people who want an easy life it s not like theme park or rollercoaster tycoon where no matter what you build people are happy and you win this is a hospital i can understand some of the frustrations people have with room templates and not being able to instantly put down the same room layout especially gp s offices but it doesn t apply to every room some rooms you do need to build to different sizes and layouts in order to maximise space effiency and increase room prestige and plus you unlock extra stuff for the rooms as you go along so you d never want them to be exactly the same in a nutshell i dont really understand the negative reviews of this game it seems to me like pure ignorance or a case of it s too hard for me so i ll review it badly to summarise it s not meant to be easy and people will die compared to the origjnal theme hospital there is hardly any difference for me i am just as good at this one as i was at that one you just need to learn how to play it
