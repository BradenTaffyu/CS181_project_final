2015 i love this gamekept dying at the start realised it s cause i was taking on a part of the game meant for the power armour at level 1 with a 10mm pistol that i name pea shooter and there was a death claw yeah after this i managed to explore for about two hours before fast travelling back to one of my settlements to start demolishing everything to build up my base figured i d have a look at the map to see how far i managed to get in two hours i got the smallest amount away you could imagine this game is full of things to do and explore i then spent just over 2 hours building one house filling it with lights beds giving it power making sure there was accessible food and water nearby carefully placing turrets in case of a raider attack or anything like that this game will feel a little weird coming from fallout 3 or new vegas but everything in this game is a huge step forward in a very positive way for anyone wondering i play it maxed out in 1080p keeping a steady vysnc on 75fps at almost all times very rarely will it drop at all if it does drop it s for about a second where i m assuming the game is loading up the next chunk of the map i m on an fx 6300 overclocked to 4 2ghz atm 8gb 2133mhz ram and an msi gtx 970 4gb gaming edition edit don t like fallout 4 wouldn t say i hate it but i don t think i d welcome it into the house fallout 3 is a much better game fallout 4 was lifeless all the quests are the same you get no choice in dialogue other than yes yes no or later honestly i don t know if i ll ever finish this game don t own and probably won t buy any of the dlc
