2019 product received for free hearts of iron iv is a rts game based on ww2 like every other game made by paradox the game is filled with complex mechanics and features when i first started playing i found the game super boring and confusing however around 100 hours later even though i still need to work on battling mechanics i honestly find the the game highly entertaining the possibilities with this game are endless you could play as germany and follow ww2 historically or change its ideology or reform the holy roman empire the dlcs do add a lot of extra features on top of the base game such as new focus trees general traits agencies etc however the game is still super fun to play without the dlc good thing is if you have a friend who has all dlc when you play with them you automatically get them for that game overall to say this game is fun is a matter of perspective if you plan on getting this game be prepared to invest a lot of time and patience into it in order to fully enjoy it if you are not that type of person this is not a game for you you can not learn this game by simply watching a 2 hour tutorial on youtube to enjoy this game you must actually play it get stuck and slowly learn from it the learning curve is steep for this game but once you get past that point the game is extremely rewarding to play each country has a different play style to it and unique focus trees and events
