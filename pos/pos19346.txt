2019 funny how a fallout game without todd howard is the best in the series seriously the story is amazing and while the gunplay is not that great it doesn t hold it back this is one of the best rpg s ever made and i would highly recommend this game putting the vanilla game aside this game also has at the time of writing 22 5 thousand mods on the nexus lot s of those mods are dlc sized and very well made such as new vegas bounties 1 2 and 3 war trash new world parliament and many more amazing mods this game is without a doubt a steal for reasons aforementioned 10 10 one of my favorite games ever
