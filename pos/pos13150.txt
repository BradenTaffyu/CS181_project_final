2018 i bought this game for 16 usd on humble bundle with very little expectations three weeks ago three weeks ago my life was busy and i was not home very often but kerbal decided to put a quick halt to that rarely are there games that draw me in for more than 10 hours let alone have me play for 3 hour sessions but kerbal decided to change that my brain use to think about my future and how i could better myself but kerbal decided to change that this game is excellent and that s putting it lightly designing rockets testing them and repeating several times until you have the perfect craft to get your kerbals to whatever destination of your choosing well your perfect craft might make it to the destination and land but did you remember to save enough fuel for the return home no now you have a kerbal or kerbals stuck on that planet you ve sunk too many hours into getting them to their destination and they ve collected too much science so now you have to build a rescue craft to go save them you better hope you ve landed upright because my rescue craft tipped over and i was forced to build a second rescue craft there are so many real struggles with this game but they keep you interested and glued to your screen this game is really really good i absolutely love how this game combines sandbox missions building and a bunch of other things together to make it one solid game 83 hours in 23 days yikes this game is passing all of my other games very quickly and i show no signs of stopping i ve only been to the mun minmus and two failed attempts at duna that s it goodbye free time hello kerbal space program now if you ll excuse me i have kerbals that need saving on minmus
