early access review totally awesome 1fighting is very immersively intense and the map is huuuuge the coming 42 build has a loooot of nice stuff to come with more content more detailed buildings lightning i would say this game is a mix of minecraft crafting base building diablo isometric 3d character progression dayz well zedz the sims micro management of inventory buildings activities etc one of the devs even worked on the sims
