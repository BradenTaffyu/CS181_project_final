2017 a breathtaking adventure this is without a doubt one of the best rpgs i have ever played and after completing it i can honestly say it has secured its place among my top favorite games of all time cast of characters when beginning the game you have the option of creating your own character or choosing from one of several pre made characters each with their own unique backstories and questlines i highly recommend going this route as these characters and their quests are very well written and interesting i found myself extremely invested in my main character lohse and what would become of her and her companions it s also really interesting witnessing the members of your party each with their own motivations and biases try to work together while also clashing as they look out for their own best interests each character is so well written and perfectly voice acted that it really helped make what is already such an immersive game feel even more alive the dialogue is great whether it be the main characters or random npcs it really feels like everyone has their own unique personality gameplay the gameplay is incredibly fun and i really can t think of the last time i had such a hard time putting down a game you are given a lot of freedom leaving it entirely up to you how you choose to progress throughout the world there are often numerous ways to complete one task depending on just how creative or good evil you want to be to add to this the choices you make actually have consequences and sometimes the line between what is right and what is wrong might not be so clear so you will sometimes find that a decision you made might come back to haunt you in one way or another i loved this and it was really cool seeing how some of the choices i made previously came to have a much wider impact than i had originally imagined the turn based combat system is really well done and there are lots of ways in which you can get creative and use the environment to your advantage each battle is well designed and interesting with each type of enemy presenting their own unique strengths and weaknesses you have to really put some thought into exactly how you design your group providing for a nice amount of strategy both in and out of battle if you find that you have messed up your build there is an option to respec something which i think most of us can appreciate for its ability to save us a lot of wasted time it is also worth mentioning that there are quite a few options as far as difficulty i did my first playthrough on classic which is the default difficulty and found it to be perfect for me there were a few fights which i struggled on but anytime i faced such a roadblock i found that all i needed to achieve victory was to simply reevaluate my strategy personally i love just how rewarding of a feeling this can be and i look forward to doing future playthrough on the harder difficulties however if you re someone who is looking for less of a hassle you will be happy to find that the lower difficulty explorer will allow you to simply enjoy the ride without any frustration the quests are extremely fun and varied some of which require solving puzzles riddles or getting a bit more creative with your abilities and items one thing i really loved about the quest system is that it doesn t hold your hand meaning that unlike some rpgs that basically give you a gps tracker showing you exactly where you need to go this game tends to just point you in a general direction and expect you to figure it out on your own now if this is offputting to you please know i am speaking as someone with a truly awful sense of direction i had a ton of fun with this and found that getting lost while trying to find where i needed to go to next provided for some of my favorite moments some of the random encounters you come across as you explore are the most surprising and rewarding experiences in the game a world that feels real the attention to detail is truly incredible and the world really feels so alive even areas that at first glance appear to be devoid of life might have something hidden especially with the pet pal ability which allows you to talk to animals or spirit vision which allows you to see speak to ghosts you ll find that if you look close enough there is no shortage of things to be seen or done and to top this all off the soundtrack is incredible providing the perfect music to accompany you on what is truly an epic journey the universe that larian have built here is absolutely astounding and they managed to pack so much into this game that it s honestly a bit overwhelming at times between all of the characters and their questlines the decisions you have to make throughout the game and the sheer size of the world it s truly impossible to take it all in on just one run speaking as someone who rarely plays games a second time i m already gearing up for my second trip into divinity original sin 2 and imagine i ll be making even more eventually gamebreaking bugs now that i ve ranted and raved about just how much i adore this game i must point out really the only negative thing i have to say about it and that is just how buggy it can be during the course of my 111 hour playthrough i ran into a number of bugs ranging from mildly annoying to gamebreaking the biggest one of course being the gamebreaking bug which made it impossible for me to enter into a room you need to use to begin the final quest in order to get around this i had to get a bit creative and basically stack items until i could get one of my characters to glitch into said room then allowing the rest of my party to teleport to me while i am obviously pleased that i was able to get past this annoying bug i can t help but be frustrated that such a problem would even exist in the first place for as much as i love this game some of the bugs i faced really took away from my overall enjoyment and i truly hope larian will patch them as soon as possible of course i m sure there are those who played the game without facing bugs but it doesn t change the fact that i was unfortunate enough to encounter them and that some of you might as well my verdict overall i truly love this game and believe it deserves all of the praise it is getting as i mentioned my one and only complaint are some of the bugs i encountered while frustrating such issues can easily be fixed through a patch and it does speak to just how captivating i found this game to be that i continued to press on despite these issues there is absolutely no denying that this was a game crafted with a lot of love and so i have complete faith that larian will continue to be very active in it post release if you re on the fence than i suggest you wait a bit to buy but i imagine it won t take long for these issues to be fixed for 45 euro i managed to get one of the most amazing gaming experiences i have ever had and i encourage everyone who is interested to give it a try this game is a masterpiece plain and simple
