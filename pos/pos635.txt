2021 this game makes me sad because my character is successful and happy and is dating a nice young girl and i unintentionally compared it to my own real life and now i have a low type of temporary depression great game though wholesome beautiful fun reminds me of when i was a kid and played harvest moon back to nature on playstation 1 also hats off to concernedape for single handedly crafting a masterpiece
