2019 i have thoroughly enjoyed my time in this instalment battles a really fun with the romance option and watching duels is really fun especially with legendary warriors the mod ban was unfortunate and i oppose it but the game is fantastic and not worthy of merely mixed reviews partnering with netease was a mistake but an understandable one considering the nature of business in china if you like total war and have any interest in chinese history this game will not disappoint you
