2020 at launch it was just plain boring compared to civ v my biggest problems with it were the strategies that you were shoehorned into every game because of the balance of the game the game has opened up a lot more with the dlc and the balance changes which allows you to be more creative with your strategies the ai is still meh but the game is generally more fun than civ v for me now there is more min maxing in this game than civ v so if you like that then you will like this game
