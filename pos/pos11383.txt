2021 early access review 7 days to die is a simple game zombie apocalypse where every 7 days there s a massive zombie horde you play as a human non infected tasked with the simple objective of staying alive in an abandoned world the pros this game is a love letter to veterans of left 4 dead and minecraft the world is fully destructible and encourages creative base design there s also a really powerful stress test in place that defines if mines or buildings are structurally sound this immediately gives it an edge on other survival horror titles with base building elements i played through this with two friends and it actually was an excellent rpg experience there s 5 trees to invest skill points into where i took the role of the housemaid cooking farming and mining really gel together and my friends really appreciated coming back from a raid with food and minerals available zombies have great variety it s perhaps not as well defined as in l4d but each point of interest has different kinds of foes to slay where most strategies or combat types are viable the crafting and inventory systems are really good hotkeys are always displayed which meant that i quickly optimized my routines when raiding a base or going to a trader the premise of the game though simple is a great motivator to be constantly working on things unlike other crafting games living an easy life will get you killed here the cons this game is not well optimized it runs like diarrhea on most mid range builds or gaming laptops especially after you ve made it through a few horde nights horde nights in particular were unplayable for me my experience on night 63 was about 4 fps and then the game imploded on itself and my ping shot to somewhere over 25 000 ms it s weird that it runs so terribly because my pc fan never really kicked in my gpu never seemed to have issues this title offers random world generation but unless you have the right hardware whatever that is it can take hours skill trees while varied from one another aren t intuitive at all for some reason you have to be an olympic power lifter to be a decent chef you have to completely max out the fortitude skill tree to make machine guns no one knows why the closest you get to a story are trader quests which are copy pasted from location to location i didn t get to do them too often again my game ran like a 1 legged sprinter but i imagine my friends got bored with them very fast there s very little sense of progression outside of what gear you have your level and the day number at the top of the screen the world is kinda ugly i don t mean that because i was forced to play on minimum settings the environment uses a hexagonal voxel but you place cubic blocks it was impossible to align most of the build materials to the environment which made my mineshafts bridges and base look kinda bad my experience spending 100 hours digging was also hampered by hexagonal voxels that didn t clearly break it takes 2 3 hits to break a node but the last hit is really tiny so mineshafts had lots of little perturbances there s no easy way to deal with grass animations and models are missing all food you consume looks like uncooked salmon even if it s from a can zombies use the same attack animations even if it causes clipping this game is blatantly misusing early access it s been available since 2013 in alpha when will it be ready will it ever be optimized for pc why do the devs make radical changes that completely change the game i don t know and that s something the buyer needs to consider the indecisive though the world physics allow for the unique stress system for buildings world physics in general are really janky vehicles are sketchy and water doesn t work properly the trade off is you could settle in the desert where neither of those are major issues the only dialogue is with traders none of which are likable in my opinion however that d be true to a zombie apocalypse in a world beyond the grave the most unlikable people are king the game frequently undergoes major overhauls meaning that combat and base building strategies constantly change i really wanted to dig pitfall traps around our base but fall damage had been nerfed so hard that they were more likely to kill my friends than the zombies furthermore if zombies find your construction to be too elaborate they ll just tear through the walls no elaborate mazes but perhaps that s for the best the verdict7 days to die is a great concept which unfortunately has no direction in regards to a final product at its fundamental level i won t play the game solo because it has terrible performance and single player might be the loneliest experience out there as a whole it s barely playable to budget and mid range pc owners or the audience most of minecraft and left 4 dead belong to however with friends this was an immensely entertaining experience as i found a role to get good at and contribute to the slideshow that takes place every 7 days 7 10
