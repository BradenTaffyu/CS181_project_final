2016 early access review if you ve enjoyed the first divinity original sin you owe it to yourself to pick up this one larian took everything that was great about the first game and made it even better word of warning though it s easier to screw up in dos2 than it is in dos1 literally a minute into the game you can either recruit or kill your first companion simply depending on how you talk to them stealing mechanics changed from dos1 both guards and whoever owns the item will actively seek out the thief you and should they find you red handed throw you in prison attack or simply take the stolen merchandise again depending on how you talk your way out of the situation fortunately even if you choose the violent option the game is still perfectly playable merchants and civilians don t participate in the fight i d write more but i think i ll just go ahead and play some more instead
