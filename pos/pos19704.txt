2015 fallout new vegas has proved to be a high level title regarding the pc version that very little moves away in qualitative counterparties on consoles basically the game still has a well balanced interplay between dynamics typically from role playing and first person shooting with a collection of narrative lines that are incoceranno and will find their point of union in the decisions of the player himself the endless mohave desert awaits players and make them share personal experience and subjective long lived and never boring there are unfortunately some problems in terms of graphics and code cleaning resulting in sudden drops in frame rate and a random bug as well as on consoles though it s very little flaws that affect the value of a product to be considered calmly among the must buy for all fans of the series and role playing games in general
