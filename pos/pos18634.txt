2019 game title bloons td 6genre tower defencedeveloper ninja kiwipublisher ninja kiwiplatforms pc mobileinitial release date june 14th 2018 mobile december 27th 2018 pc so first off what is bloons td 6 bloons td 6 is a tower defence game where things called bloons come down set paths in various different maps and on various difficulty levels so you need to place down towers around the map in order to stop them and each tower has 3 paths with 5 unique upgrades each 15 upgrades per tower in total which you can buy with cash you earn from successfully destroying rounds of bloons and as you hold off the bloons more powerful ones with special powers come around things like the purple bloons which are immune to magic or the ceramic bloons that take a couple of hits to pop so now you have a rough idea of what bloons td is here is my list of pros and cons to help you decide if it s worth buying pros decent graphics the new 3d graphics make the towers look a lot more alive than they were in bloons td 5 towers are very balanced especially in comparison to bloons td 5 there is a handful of super good ones but they are much more balanced than what you d see in the previous bloons td games daily challenges that keep the game fresh which you can do to earn cool rewards and a challenge editor is in the game as well so you can make your own daily challenges loading screens for getting into games are rather short most of the time only taking around 7 seconds at most co op mode with up to 4 players at once earning achievements gives you rewards in game so achievements in this game are actually worth going for because you can get some decent stuff out of it cons monkey money the in game currency which you use to buy things like power ups that you can use in the middle of tough rounds is much harder to come by in bloons td 6 beating all of the difficulty modes of one easy map only awards you like 700 900 monkey money in total and considering you use it to buy a lot of things that ain t great the game has quite a lot of bugs like certain hotkeys not working or the game just straight up crashing for no reason the framerate for bloons td 6 drops quite a lot at the later rounds in the game sometimes dropping even below 20fps and this isn t exclusive to 1 or 2 people either it happens to basically everyone co op mode stutters and lags often no steam cloud saves instead this game relies on ninjakiwi s own cloud save feature which doesn t work as well as steam s cloud saves final score 8 1 10 it s good but co op lag and the various bugs keep it from being perfect
