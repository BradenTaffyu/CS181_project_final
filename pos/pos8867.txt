2020 when writing this review i only have 23 hours on the game and after those 23 hours all i can say that is i had fun playing stellaris for all those hours the game does a learning curve you need to know how to start your nation empire etc most people start off with going all out on their battle fleet then their economy dies this game is a strategy game you must maintain a stable economy fleet power territory in order to really do good in the game it is hard at first but you eventually get the hang of it
