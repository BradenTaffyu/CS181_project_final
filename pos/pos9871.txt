2016 early access review i made the wise choice after reading other reviews to not go with a permadeath scenario on my first build in the end i chose cassandra classic and left it set to base building what follow is the thoughts and events through my first ten hours day one dear god what the hell do i do complicated agggh oh wait building stuffs is here let s see if i can t make a house over by this mountain day two why aren t my guys doing the things i need them to oh there s a thing for priorities sweet lets see if i can t force them to mine into this mountain so i can have a cave fortress day three oh god no it s too early to be raided oh wait it s just one person alright big burly shooter bloke up you go time to shine oh you didn t kill her she s stunned on the floor bleeding to death we ell i suppose i can take her captive and have my doctor look her over at the very least good practise for the future oh how do i make a prison day four captive resting up doctor successfully handled all the wounds wait a minute infection in her leg and torso what do i do just let the doctor handle that i suppose day five immunity 96 torso immunity 94 right leg does this mean the infection is becomming immune to my medicine i better get the doc to amputate her leg at the very least it s more practise waaaaaaaait immunity is at 100 and infection is going down i m a fblooming idiot can we reattach the leg no well let s stick a peg leg on her uh sorry to get off on the wrong foot there day six despite shooting her four times serious infection and a less than needed amputation she s survived now she s laying there captive with a peg leg probably thinking she s been captured by a bunch of cannibals or something since she clearly didn t need to have the leg off i m going to recruit her should be simple right day seven prisoner doesn t want to co operate i can t imagine why my hospitality has been impeccable it ll have to wait because my land is being ravaged by a pack of hyper intelligent beavers uh okay i hope the colony likes beaver meat day eight figured out how to tame a boar beavers are all dead the prisoner has finally decided to join us riiiight as a dry thunderstorm hits and sets half the map ablaze in the ensuing chaos of frantic firefighting our newest recruit tail gets inadvertently set on fire so she s back in bed again recovering day nine fires are all out given everyone a full day of freedom to do with as they please aaaand another raid lovely hang on are those grenades that caveman is lobbing at me there goes my hunter thankfully he scares them off before having to be hauled off to the impromptu medbay day ten just as i finish making a bedroom for everyone and a spacious walk in fridge for my food a trading caravan comes in oh they have a prosthetic leg i ll take that and replace that awful peg leg on tail that ll make up for removing her leg right maybe and now the caravan members are fighting each other one killed the other with her fists impressive my hunter couldn t even kill someone with his rifle remind me not to piss off the town in the cave faction and they didn t even take their fallen brother s weaponry and armour excellent time to give my hunter a nice shiny new sniper rifle and armour set day eleven my poor tamed boar just got attacked by a grizzly my hunter attempted to save it but it perished regardless and the pissed off bear is rampaging amok and oh bollocks tail s just had her arms torn off day twelve tail can t do anything anymore she has no arms and only one leg her mental state is dropping rapidly now that she s bedridden i don t know what to do day thirtreen the batteries keeping power to my cave area just blew up they were right beside my hurried medbay area the problem with tail was resolved through fire day fourteen buried the mutliated body of tail everyone s mood is down the pan my hunter has taken to wandering naked and cloud watching all day my heart is broken i failed that poor pirate girl it would have been kinder to just let her die in the wake of her raid at this point i called it a night what i anticipated to be a couple hours game time turned into an entire day despite all the feels i have right now i fully intend to pick it up again tomorrow and start afresh now i know how the game works i pray i can make my colony something worthwhile if you re on the fence about buying this seriously do it the first half an hour is a nightmare to pick up all the mechanics and functions of each and every button but once you go past that point it becomes a glorious mess of emotions i ve never felt regret like this over a one legged depressive former pirate in my life 10 10 would maim my potential recruits again
