2019 this game is one of the most beautiful games i ve ever played the landscapes and views are stunning and you can walk around for hours and still discover new places i m not a hunter myself so it took some guides and youtubers to get to know how to play the game this is not a run and shoot type of game so if you are looking for quick and much kills you should play another game patience is key in this one and the satisfaction of making a high level kill after tracking that animal for some time makes you want to play on and on the missions are a nice sidestep from the hunting alone and some of them are quite humorous multiplayer works decent and is most enjoyed when playing with friends is it all positive in this review no i haven t experienced it quite myself but after an update most of the time there are a lot of new bugs that ruin the gameplay i have to say that the devs are quick with a patch but that shouldn t be necessary in the first place another negative is the huge amount of paid dlc i myself don t mind buying them because i like the game really really much but i can imagine that s not the same for a lot of other players yes you can play the game without the dlc but for an optimal gameplay some of the dlc is highly recommended all in all the positive points overrule the negative ones and in my opinion this is one of the most fun games i ve ever owned with a lot of replayability the graphics are the strongest part and with more expansions to come this game hopefully will only get better but you do have to be committed to be willing to keep on buying them
