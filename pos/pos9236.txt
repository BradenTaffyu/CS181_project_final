2016 i ll tell you he story of the bisnarth race my flying monkeys and their friends the humans and goat people two of my friends and i decided that forming an alliance to take over the galaxy was a foolproof way of winning and that it would simply be a matter of how long it took well a pretty easy start and several wars later 3 ai species made an alliance and challenged us they hadn t done anything else all game so we were surprised by their sudden hostility and their 9k stacks of fleets also didn t come across too friendly in the end of the great space wars only one of the 3 remained and asked to join our alliance we decided to allow it then finding that he immediately left we were confused by this and saw that he had 1 joined our alliance and had a peace treaty of 30 years applied to joining between all of our empires 2 insulted one of the fallen empires nearby so that they would lose their opinion of us 3 watch as we were dismantled by scarab ancestors who only sought to humiliate us also a ceramic pot gave us divine inflection and led us to further warp drive capabilities 10 10 would play again
