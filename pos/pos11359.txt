2018 early access review i m an experienced players at least i like to think i am let me regale you about the awesome experiences you can have in this game you spawn into this huge world 10km radius map about 312 square kilometers bunch of stuff to explore you have nothing on you but a torch a can of food and a wee bit of water other less important things at that point you have to survive you frantically punch trees for wood grab whatever small rocks you can find punch grass you make yourself some clothing an axe maybe a shovel most of the time you re just running for your life if you re not being chased by zeds zombies you re being chased by zed birds if it s not zed birds it s bloody wolves or zed doggoes maybe even a bear you finally get yourself a crappy shack think aight i can live here for a bit no you find yourself assaulted by wandering hordes you run for your life you quickly learn daylight is your friend night is your enemy you run for your life you finally find a spot you like you start to dig down for your life by this time it s probably horde night you hide down underground hoping they won t get the idea to dig down or straight in because the area you dug down in to was slightly hilly you run for your life you sprain your leg running for your life you almost die from freezing to death you almost die from overheating you re out of food yeah that can of food and wee bit of water didnt last you very long you run for your life your base is finally getting somewhere decent you start to explore your surroundings you run for your life you see skyscrapers they re dungeons btw some easy others exceptionally hard you explore them you run for your life you walk over landmines you blow up 11 10 this game will give you a great amount of scares i can only recommend it as the best survival game i have ever played the only problem i see but it is getting a major overhaul in a17 as far as i can see so it will most likely get much better the ai is wonky as hell we can discuss whether there actually is an ai because most of the time it seems like there is not an ai and over time you will learn how to deal with all the threats and they won t become as much threats as mere nuisances this is when you start to be able to explore the vast world and hold out in your base on horde nights which will become increasingly harder as your game stage progress yeah there s something like 4000 gamestages did i forget to mention screamers i most certainly did they appear if your heatmap gets too high guess what they do they scream what do their screams do attract a lot of zombies you run more for your life disregard reviews complaining about alpha they obviously have no idea how much a game cost to develop and how little funds an indie game company have to spend on development in fact if you don t like bugs glitches and similar just stop playing games all together because no matter what game you play be it in alpha beta or fully released they re full of them and they always will be it is the very nature of games if you can t accept the pace of development you can mod the game to your heart s desire if you can t even do this why are you complaining
