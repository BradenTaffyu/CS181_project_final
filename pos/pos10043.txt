2016 early access review rimworld the 2d colony building simulator by tynan sylvester is justifiably one of the most anticipated releases of july 2016 which had a huge following way before it arrived on steam boasting a rich gameplay that you can mold to your liking be it tougher easier or just plain sandbox where you get to build a pretty base it is sure to please the fans of the colony management genre easily i know i am one i bought the game from the site in august 2015 and easily dropped over 300 hours in it before it launched on steam if you hate reading these are my 15 mins of honey mouthing the game on youtube and for a good reason at that youtube video rimworld alpha 14 and so on and so forth well worth the buy views 130 yeah just listen to me honey mouthing a game for 15 minutes because it deserves it so in true fashion of my reviews let s take a look at the good and the bad the good 1 the gameplay i will never get tired of saying that to me the gameplay is everything and the gameplay of rimworld is downright amazing the developer has made the best colony management sandbox game and let the player mold it to his or her liking 2 selectable storyteller i would like to make it clear that storyteller is a rather vague term in rimworld it simply represents the dangers that the game will throw at you and thus create a story about your colony phoebe allows for easier base building although on higher levels the dangers are just slightly weaker than cassandra and randy just does whatever he feels like including early poison psychic ships 3 selectable difficulty depending on the chosen storyteller you have 5 difficulty levels that will shape your adventure including a permadeath option that saves the game at regular intervals and if your colony dies that s it 4 selectable starting position since rimworld creates exactly that an entire world you get to choose your starting position from a plethora of tiles ranging from tropical forests through deserts or tundras to ice caps every single square of the terrain is generated for you to play on and all of them have their specific climate flora fauna and geography 5 selectable scenarios the game gives you three base scenarios and the freaking ability to make your own you get to select how many people will start with what under what conditions and so on and so forth 6 selectable playing map size consisting of the exact terrain you chose to land on ranging from fertile plains to desert wastes and impassable mountains you may also find some abandoned buildings to claim and thrive in 7 the map of the colony is dynamic you are not set in a static environment where nothing changes the map is teeming with life unless you are on a polar cap and can spawn various events based on the climate the storyteller or the weather like dry thunderstorms flashstorms heavy rain heat waves cold snaps and so on and so forth 8 a plethora of resources for you to exploit and use to improve your base ranging from mineable ores to harvestable trees and tameable animals want to have a chicken farm sure want to have a turtle farm yep want to have a kitty or a doggy or both or many of those you can 9 meaningful research tree consisting of lots and lots of techs adapted to the scenario you selected or made up for yourself in of itself this adds another layer of management to the game because based on what you research the game will take a certain shape you can choose to forego early good clothing and brew beer and make your colonists happy or rush electricity and geothermal power to give them early boost to electricity and have them live in more pleasant conditions it is all up to you 10 meaningful interactions between the colony and the surrounding world the game generates a number of tribes outlander towns and pirate bases with which you can develop relations be it good or bad sending gifts and releasing people belonging to a faction will raise their opinion of you which in term can have them send help when you need it the most or you can just plain anger them kill them and sell their flesh and skin read leather for lots and lots of silver and if that wasn t enough there is even the ability to trade with these people or even signal passing spaceships and buy or sell wares to or from them 11 very deep strategic layer everything from selecting your place in the world through your starting colonist skills to how will you play the game involves a huge amount of thinking and strategical planning every single aspect of the game ties so well together it is insane a single oversight may cost you a valuable colonist or maybe even half your village the game actually rewards good play and punishes mistakes and to its credit not unfairly 12 lots of ways to create an awesome looking base with lots of colors and beautification items constructed by the colonists you are only limited by your imagination 13 awesome value for the money even at its price tag of 28 30 this game is an awesome experience and an awesome value for the money i dumped over 300 hours in this game and i see multiplying that play time by a ton 14 a lot of heart last but not least you will feel really attached to your colonists and be happy for them when they thrive or sad when they die or get badly injured that is unless you like seeing your minions suffer in which case you can start counting the amount of limbs noses and toes that they will lose throughout the game and now to take a look at the bad 1 huge learning curve if you are just starting rimworld i would suggest you play at a low difficulty level and get used to the game as much as you can you really need to set a good system of farming security joy and safety going and improve it as you progress through the higher difficulty levels rimworld is a game of pain and suffering in which the smallest oversight can wipe out half your colony 2 the soundtrack while very relaxing and pleasant to listen to needs to be expanded as themes will often repeat to the point where you may simply opt to reduce the volume to 0 and play your own music 3 no diagonal structures hardcore builders may be rather pissed at the fact that they have a square grid to play with and no diagonal walls and structures which make some shapes look kind of weird blocky and quirky 4 very late game needs optimization you may experience some game lag on very big maps with lots of items be it animate or inanimate on them to its credit the game does warn you of that but it clearly needs more optimization 5 on a more jovial note torch lamps are op man you are really hitting 2 stones with 1 bird not only your colonists lose the in the darkness debuff but the temperature in the room gets raised by a few degrees nerf em now conclusion grab this game without a second thought if you are a fan of any of these genres colony simulation colony management base building city building or are a fan of games that allow you to get very creative in a sandbox environment even in its current alpha state you will get a great value for your money and i expect it to receive glowing and well deserved recommendations from both reviewers and critics you owe it to yourself to try it and experience it
