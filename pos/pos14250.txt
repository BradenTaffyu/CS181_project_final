2021 early access review tl dr buy this game at your own risk it will ruin your life i m a die hard fan of factorio but that being said this game beats it already and it s still in alpha i bought it day 1 and i ve logged 11 hours into it into a single day the building is better the placement of conveyors is better for example you can stack them ontop of eachother and make this massive bundle of complex and extremely satisfying looking conveyor knots i literally can t go on it s 5am and i m going to pass out because i ve played this game all day and night and i wouldn t be able to forgive myself if i went to bed without giving this a glowing review
