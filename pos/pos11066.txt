2022 jurassic world evolution 2 is in many ways a steady consistent improvement upon its predecessor the graphics shine just as beautifully as ever and the models are rendered with glorious detail this game would have been a dream for children of the 80 s and 90 s who grew up with the original films and even today it still holds a great deal of appeal to jurassic park and general dinosaur fans of all ages this time around the team has added dozens of additional dinosaurs providing a greater amount of depth in this sequel the addition of the newly implemented lagoon and aviary elements is what truly shifts this title from jurassic park to jurassic world where the ability to design an underwater aquarium full of prehistoric beasts never grows old the two main campaigns story and chaos theory will lend players 20 30 hours of challenges depending on how much time they wish to spend exploring and toying with the game mechanics while these modes aren t exactly easy neither are they particularly arduous i played though all ten of the missions without any failures or significant hiccups there are a few bugs particularly with some of the aquatic and flying species getting stuck but these were few and far between however they can be catastrophic when they occur the challenge and sandbox modes offer hundreds of additional hours but players should know that research and even expeditions is not available in sandbox mode even without the unlimited cash feature turned on this means that unresearched features and dinosaur genomes will be unavailable until unlocked while playing the campaigns where unlocking them isn t even necessary or always possible for mission completion as such there is a good chance that players will be burned out by the time they even make it to the less restricted sandbox mode one area where the title could stand some improvement is regarding overall detail in terms of small features a great deal of attention has been given to certain areas but others seem to be sparse afterthoughts visitors aren t unique enough and while the new categorizations thereof general nature adventure luxury etc add a bit more immersion than in the original title it s still not enough part of the issue is that guests just aren t interesting enough nor is their presence felt amenities can be packed but with no guests on the sidewalk guests rarely walk into various attractions and when they do they ghost through doors there is little variety and even the park employees behave no differently than general guests which seriously hampers overall immersion the same can be said for the ranger teams levels and skills added to each would be ideal especially if players were given the ability recruit specific park workers with different backgrounds the hybrid dinosaur feature is also once again a bust no players cannot make a plesiosaurus pteranodon hybrid they can make the indominus rex and indoraptor another minor complaint pertains to the challenge in adjusting certain features on the fly as a player s park grows so does its need for improved infrastructure making this happen can often be frustrating sure players can tear down a building and attempt to replace it with an upgraded version but will it fit or will it encounter terrain constraints all too often i found myself creating a new save and reloading just so i could test these types of implementations finally and this partially relates to my previous point building an aesthetically pleasing park can be a little too challenging in some areas more tools or a grid system for creating symmetrical elements would be helpful when it comes to forming your jurassic world just the way you envision an unfortunate byproduct of this current lack of design control causes nearly every park to look just about the same ultimately jurassic world evolution 2 is a solid improvement upon the original title fans of the last game are sure to enjoy this offering and even those who passed it by last time may very well find something to enjoy this time around however there is still much work to be done and hopefully a third entry in the series or at least some solid dlc will bring the evolution series to its fullest potential
