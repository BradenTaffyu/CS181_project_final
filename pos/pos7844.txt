2020 early access review this game is spectacular it is literally the best car simulation game you can get at the moment of this review you simply won t get tired of it i ve been playing it every time i can you just won t get bored while doing so there are so many options so many vehicles with hundreds of thousands of parts that you can change there is a traffic system there are many ai configs unique maps many gameplay modes structures thousands of mods realistic gearbox and by far in my opinion i have a logitech g27 steering wheel and a gearbox the most realistic driving experience you can get other than real life the force feedback actually works so well it s impressive how you feel everything going on with your car they also update it frequently with bug fixes i d say i experienced some sort of bug only once or twice in my 220 hours of gameplay and not to mention their frequent big updates bringing lots of new features every few months and the best you don t need a last generation expensive pc to run it on high graphics your mid tier computer might be able to run it flawlessly on high configurations buy it worth every cent
