2014 early access review this is zombie survival but it couldn t be more different from the other games on the market in the same genre for starters its top down view not first person this doesn t take anything away from the experience though i ve been made to jump a couple of times from walking into a room that i didn t know had a zombie inside what i love most about pz is that it s truly a survival game even without the zombies society has crashed which means you have to scavenge to survive searching through houses caravans schools apartments etc to find food water and supplies but it s not just hunger you have to contend with your character can get bored stressed scared angry even too hot or cold depending on the conditions for those who survive the first days you can craft items like walls and doors even grow your own food and become self reliant with the iwbus multiplayer soon to be released this game will only get better
