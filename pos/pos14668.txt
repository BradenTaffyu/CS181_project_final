2016 it s difficult to truly judge a civilization game this early for more than a few reasons but among them include the level of depth in the game that makes first impressions difficult to accurately form and the fact that civilization games tend to start out of the gate significantly weaker than they end up being weeks months and especially years post release that being said i would like to throw a strong recommendation for anyone on the fence about this one while still outlining a few issues that may or may not convince you to at least wait it out right off the bat though the biggest question does the game feel lacking after playing civilization v with both expansion packs surprsingly no it doesn t in fact i was very impressed with how many mechanics were not only carried over from civilization v but dramatically improved upon faith was a neat add on in civ5 providing nice perks that made it worth the effort to get involved with religion however in civilization vi religious benefits aren t dramatically different but the whole religious warfare aspect is much deeper there s something incredibly satisfying about being able to fight a religious war with units without the bloodshed of a full fledged war the unit variety is smaller and religious units obviously can t attack anything but other religious units but it provides a surprising amount to do especially during the mid game city states feel much more fleshed out you actively compete for their loyalty without needing to constantly run around completing quests that may or may not either go out of your way or worse result in unwanted war or hatred from other civs and or city states this was improved upon in brave new world but civilization vi absolutely tops it by making the loyalty itself a mechanic you can directly contribute to while keeping quests as an alternate way to gain loyalty great works and culture feel just as fleshed out as they did in brave new world making great people such as writers and painters feel valuable by contributing great works added too are relecs which work much the same but just goes that not only was nothing lost but a little was gained the world congress isn t in civilization vi right out of the gate but if firaxis is to be believed this was due to not being entirely sure how to best add it just brace yourself and don t be surprised if it s in a paid expansion pack the new mechanics work very well and give you a much stronger sense of control city districts are surpisingly strategic especially later in the game when you start buffing their output specifically via adjacency bonuses even something as simple as builders building instantly but having limited charges makes the act of improving tiles feel more meaningful since you re actively seeking improvements with a finite resource however this is also where one of the biggest issues of the game start to glare their ugly head transparency or a lack there of is a major concern the new mechanics add a huge amount of depth and breath of life into the game but the mechanics both new and old seem to have taken a major step back in terms of ease of visibility for important stats information like district output housing amenity income great work locations etc are difficult to find assuming it even exists and is often burried and consolidated into generic numbers making it unnecessarily difficult to keep track of and micro manage them it s almost as though the game treats these mechanics as less important than they really are and tooltips are a lot less helpful than you d expect them to be either displaying generic information seemingly useless information or relevant information or just not displaying anything of value that you can t already see by just looking at it the game also has a surprising number of glitches or ai quarks i ve seen cases where certain overlay features will get stuck on such as traderoutes cluttering your view trade deals seem very broken in that on more occasions than i can count i ve asked ai for a deal that they thought was better only for them to actually ask for less or even offer me more i ve also been actively either dismissed or praised by other civilizations for not having a high gold income when my profit margins are very strong i ve even encountered an issue where a civilization will declare friendship with me only to declare war on me two turns later all and all the game holds a remarkable amount of promise i have little doubt that these issues will be ironed out in civ6 just as they were in civ5 that being said it can t be emphisized strongly enough that this game released in what feels like a far far more complete base game than civilization v did when it was first released if firaxes trend is anything to go on it s very easy to imagine that this game has the potential to be the absolute best civilization game yet
