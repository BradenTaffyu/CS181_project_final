2019 in short hoi4 is a very fun game and possibly the best from paradox s library but be prepared to spend mechanics the mechanics like stability and war support and the sheer amount of variables involved can make the game overwhelming for new players once you become more seasoned at the game it becomes easier to manage and even simple as with most other games be aware if you are thinking of purchasing or have recently purchased the game it s going to suck learning them research is fairly straightforward but the technologies for designers can be complicated especially in the late game focuses trees are variable from fun to boring dlc the thing i tend to despise about this game is the absolute need for dlcs that add little on their own each dlc tends to add a new mechanic or two a handful of focus trees for the region of interest and some new music ai the ai is absolutely braindead simply put they do things that make zero sense and only harm themselves that is all i have to say combat this is what distinguishes this game from other wwii strategy games the combat system is in depth and a dream for players who want to control every facet of their gameplay experience you manage your army navy and air force in full including the manufacture of equipment planes and ships you have to ensure that your divisions are supplied your frontline is stable your airforce and navy aren t vulnerable your logistics situation is handled and more few hoi4 players will point to any reason other than the combat system as to the main reason they bought the game
