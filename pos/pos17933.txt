2018 would i have recommended this game when it was first released not a chance would i recommend it now you bet your sweet latin arse at launch this was a buggy mess lacking the complexity of previous games especially in the politcal family system now after 5 years of constant patches and updates which are ongoing ca have finally made a game worthy of the total war series battles are fun and require a certain amount of tactical thinking without dragging on for a tedious length of time like they did in empire the campaign map is gorgeous and well populated with factions if somewhat lacking in unit diversity especially among the germanic celtic factions although this has been a complaint with the series as a whole if i had one gripe it s ca s crappy dlc policy of selling you content already in the game at launch this was a solid nope from me but on sale they re just about worth buying okay two gripes as much as i love the updates to the political system they ve recently released i do question the timing of bringing major overhauls to a game which is 5 years old and not even close to being the latest tw title the updates affect mods which generally isn t an issue as modders update to accomodate but there are one or two mods i really enjoyed that were broken by the updates if you re considering buying this for the first time though these shouldn t be deal breakers for you
