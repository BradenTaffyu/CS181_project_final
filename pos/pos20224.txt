great game came in after bg3 thirsty for another crpg not the same production value but a lot of fun a bit unbalanced combat too easy on normal but still fun being op too a lot of reading but as a first foray into warhammer 40k universe it got me thoroughly hooked on it playing on my 4080super i7 14700f 32gb ddr5 with everything maxed obviously gonna run well but mostly been playing on handheld lenovo legion go 800p 1600p windowed integer scaling frame gen with lossless scaling with great success
