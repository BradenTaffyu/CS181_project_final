2015 early access review it s all the fun of minecraft with better graphics less lag and something i think i ll never see in minecraft challenge this game is extreamly challenging so if you are a person who likes relaxing casual games then don t buy it if you like a challenging survivle game though absolutly buy it there s no better game
