2015 old but has massive depth of content recommended for immersive role players combat in general and melee combat in particular is very polished and open for an older title everything can be controlled such as directional blocking without overcomplicating the mechanics involved character creation is meticulously in depth initial backstory creation works seamlessly with selection of primary attributes in a way that makes the final product always feel refreshingly unique story is about as open ended as can be to the point where the game essentially has no story and is something of a thirteenth century sand box title the player has complete unadulterated freedom the game encourages the player to recruit and build a personal army as he she progresses and the mechanics put in place for doing so are well rounded and complex extremely easy and satisfying to mod highly recommended sorting and commanding one s troops is key and the player would do well to benefit fromt he excellent command mechanics of the game strategy is massively important and competently implemented economics of the game add another layer of challenge to the game trade and balancing one s income against one s expenses are both crucial elements to consider multiplayer is fairly standard run of the mill stuff but it s still densely populated and everything seems to connect well the charm of the game and its solid combat system keep the players coming back in droves after more than five years politics which are interesting and engaging in scope end up being a somewhat weaker feature in practice as npcs are largely static during negotiations this does break the immersion slightly as it seems that your successes are based purely on stats and not on the actual implications of one s choices quests often become tedious and repetitive tutorial is underwheling and largely insufficient to introduce the more in depth mechanics that will be used outside of combat visuals are outdated and didn t stand well the test of time even for the year of release the textures and polygon counts are well below parlockeproposal s big day outcommunity groupcurator pageserious steam reviews subreddit
