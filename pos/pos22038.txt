2021 yes indeed it is called lothric where the transitory lands of the lords of cinder converge in venturing north the pilgrims discover the truth of the old words the fire fades and the lords go without thrones when the link of fire is threatened the bell tolls unearthing the old lords of cinder from their graves aldrich saint of the deep farron s undead legion the abyss watchers and the reclusive lord of the profaned capital yhorm the giant only in truth the lords will abandon their thrones and the unkindled will rise nameless accursed undead unfit even to be cinder and so it is that ash seeketh embers i am a big souls like fan thanks to dark souls iii the first game of the genre and the series that i have played i have been planning on writing a review about this game for a long time now but never found the perfect timing to do so now that the game is having a discount and probably there will be plenty of people coming to give it a look i decided to write this review like i did with my dark souls remastered review on steam i will separate this review into 2 main parts the technical aspect and the story plot lore of the game technical aspect firstly i would like to say that this game has not the same mechanics as dark souls i and dark souls ii they end up being faster paced and also a lot of hitboxes issues have been improved with that said due to the date of launch of the game it s is obviously getting better graphics and textures 2 aspects that the previous games weren t strong at being fromsoftware the company that we are talking about the scenario the ambiance and the designs are of course on the point and perfectly fit in each occasion of the game giving the player the same immersion given on the other soulsborne games being even more detailed on that aspect places like high wall of lothric irithyll of the boreal valley the ringed city archdragon peak and kiln of the first flame will mostly pass to the player a feeling of astonishment due to the amazing landscapes and atmosphere that they have while on the other hand there will be areas that will give the player the feeling of progression and curiosity about what is to come like road of sacrifices cathedral of the deep farron keep catacombs of carthus and actually most of the other places to visit just like dark souls i areas in dark souls iii like archdragon peak and untended graves will be hidden and will only be discovered with certain triggers the music can be really amazing at some bosses but at others it can feel kind of boring which is a negative trait when compared to dark souls i s unique compositions by motoi sakuraba that being only my opinion though the combat mechanic varied a lot from the previous games to dark souls iii now there are specific habilities and possible combinations with each weapon presented it synthesized ideas presented before in the other previous games and ended up making a pleasurable result and as said before faster paced lastly to conclude this topic dark souls iii is a game that will not feel somewhat tiring when compared to the other dark souls it balances every aspect already mentioned and does an amazing job to entertain the player for the first run until how many times one will feel like to play it again and again and again in my case 4 runs have already been completed story plot lore it would be impossible to put together every piece of lore in a review thus i will be summarizing the main plot unkindled the player is a composition of the ash from the once fire devoted undead that has given itself to the flame and its duty remains the same the game starts off presenting that the fire fades and that the lords go without thrones giving that we are in the same universe set by dark souls i and ii we are left with speculations until finally arrive at conclusions by progressing in the game the whereabouts are the same as dark souls i however there are slightly different things that might give the idea of the passage of time hundreds or perhaps thousands of years have passed since the age of fire and mighty new lords of cinder have linked the fire to maintain it even though there are controversies on the time aspect in dark souls iii the time seems to be simultaneously blended with the abyss and dark of long ago in which the concept of time doesn t exists and also the present that is experiencing the undying cycle of the fire legacy which would probably be a base for proving the theory of the end of the world during the filianore cutscene in the ringed city in which there is a burst of light indicating time and consequently a time skip beyond the living of anything as for the main objective the player would have to kill the 4 lords of cinder that neglect themselves to link the flame once again because it would be useless and that they would die in which way the only one that remains in the firelink shrine is ludleth whom has long ago linked the fire and now is just waiting for his end on his throne for that he is known as the exiled the objetive of killing those lords would be to acquire the necessary power in order to link the fire killing every lord of cinder and putting their ashes on their thrones will let the player travel to the kiln of the first flame the place where the battle against soul of cinder happens a manifestation of every lord soul until then not only in terms of new lords of cinder speculations and lore the game creates its identity but there would also be the side bosses encounters that reveal individuals or even groups that shaped the dying world of dark souls iii e g pontiff sulyvahn oceiros etc in terms of dlc ashes of ariandel and the ringed city lore wise speaking it presents a rich story completion and also the grand finale for the series with the final boss fight against slave knight gael an undead like you seeking the blood of the dark soul for his lady s painting who would be going to paint a new world for humanity conclusion i cannot put in words my passion for the game i can simply recommend buying it with or without a discount it is worth each time played and each credit paid i do not even possess a high knowledge about the game yet but i am still discovering and reading about its deep and amazing world got some free time get dark souls series to play and you will not regret it
