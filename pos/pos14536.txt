2021 i have been a fan of the civilization series ever since 1991 the series has gone through a fantastic evolution becoming graphically more vibrant more challenging and more interesting then why am i disappointed in the newest installment few reasons 1 in this newest version the amount of micromanagement to grow your city has increased a lot 2 the maps are much smaller consuequences a you will much earlier be hampered in your expansion plans because of city states or other civsb your cities will much quicker be squeezed close together thus hampering really big cities c you will engage in warfare much earlier in the game and either have long running wars or constantly be told civ abc denounces you 3 no automated workers under the new concepts this may make sense but it doesn t really make sense to improve a tile only to find out that was the only valid tile for that world wonder you want to build all in all yes get it on a discount i hope further civ developments will return to the roots of what sid meyer imagined back in the last century
