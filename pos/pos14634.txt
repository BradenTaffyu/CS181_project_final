2019 i haven t written a lot of reviews for games but i feel like i should for civ 6 simply because it has mixed reviews and i want to give my hopefully unbiased opinion on it to start i ll say that i ve only genuinely played the civilization franchise since 4 i dabbled in 3 as a kid but you know i was a kid and it was a bit beyond me at the time so a lot of what i expect from the civilization series is based on that foundation civilization 5 was unfortunately a really big disappointment for me it did have some redeeming features the introduction of 1upt and the art were some things i liked right from the get go even though i ll say the ai can t really understand 1upt as well as it could and i think it should be something like a couple of units per tile instead regardless civ 5 did get some appreciation from me after it s final dlc came out but it was still always hindered by global happiness and no health at least for me so while civ 6 is a pretty big step backwards in the art design at least with the leaders i ended up not minding the world art after awhile it s reintroduction of local happiness and health in the form of housing was a huge pleasant surprise to me i did not expect them to ever go back that way especially after beyond earth was released with just health which was essentially global happiness reskinned it s also easily the most feature complete release the game has had with spies and religion making the cut for the vanilla game on top of this the things it does add such as the government card system the army stuff the culture research tree and districts are all pretty solid in my opinion admittedly i was hoping districts was going to function more like endless legend where you d grow your city out from the core and then you could specialize them but still it s a nice change of pace having more things moved away from the core of the city not just nice because it adds a bit of depth and thinking when building and conducting warfare but also satisfies one of my gripes with the older games where when founding a new city you basically had a ton of buildings to build in the core city all the way from the very first age although this is still largely a thing it s at least lampshaded somewhat i ll end by saying that it seems that what a lot of people complain about with this game namely the ai is a thing that has been an issue since at least civ 4 the ai could handle themselves better in 4 because the armies were stacks and there wasn t a lot of depth required behind warfare but even if 4 didn t have the same diplomacy issues they were definitely present in 5 that s not me saying it s excusable or not a negative for 6 it is and it seems like the developers at least know this and are working on it that s just me saying compared to 5 6 only really shares similar faults but blows 5 away in its added features or changes i hope this review was at least helpful to someone much love
