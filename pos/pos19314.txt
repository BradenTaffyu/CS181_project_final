2022 overall 8 5 10 as a degenerate advocate of aoe iii i was at first disapointed in this 4th iteration but the game with a bit of adapting is by all accounts a good one between updates fixes and addition of 2 civs for free might i add the game is in a good state 1 year or so after its release fans of the 3rd aoe will adapt and start to love it fans of the 2nd aoe will feel more at home from the bat but both will love all the new visual upgrades and overall rejuvenated experience
