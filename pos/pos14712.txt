2017 this sequel sits comfortably between civilization revolution and civilization 5 as such fans of the former will appreciate the cartoony style but might be turned off by the slower pace and greater challenge fans of the latter may think this is too watered down too simplified i appreciate the fact that this game attempts to forge its own identity and improves graphics while still feeling like the other entries while 5 had a huge focus on armies and various combat modifiers 6 focuses more on city building so while the combat has certainly been simplified the cities reach a whole new level of complexity now you have districts that each take up their own tile and placement is crucial because of various terrain modifiers for instance a campus will produce extra science when placed adjacent to a mountain tile the harbor district must actually be built on a water tile the great pyramid requires a desert tile each wonder takes up a tile so you can t just pile them all up in the same city there are so many government types in this one and i feel like they did a good job differentiating each one you can mix and match various policies many of which are not unique to just one type of government because of the new religion system you can now have a theocracy which allows you to purchase military units using faith instead of gold faith is a new fourth commodity which is needed to purchase specific faith based buildings and units but can also be used to unlock a great person early one gripe i have is the fact that you can be very close to unlocking a great person only to have another player swoop in and buy it using gold or faith this happens extremely often on higher difficulties as if they have endless amounts of gold and faith available for that specific purpose on the plus side great people are now split into different categories and there are buildings policies and research projects which allow you to obtain extra points in specific categories so if you re going for a military victory you can focus on getting great generals i think the new religion system is well designed though it is one of the more time consuming winning conditions and it does get annoying trying to hold off endless waves of enemy missionaries trying to convert all your cities plus other players get royally ticked off when you try to convert their cities now here s where it gets tricky you need a great prophet to found a religion each player can only get one but there are a limited number of them and never enough for every player so if you don t immediately start working toward a religion you may miss out also if another player does manage to convert all your cities then it is impossible to get your religion back any missionaries or apostles you recruit are followers of the religion that city currently follows so when your buddhist city gets converted to catholicism your citizens become catholics and the only way to turn them back is to recruit a missionary from one of your other cities that still practices buddhism in other civilization games you use science to unlock new technologies you still do that but now you have civics which are unlocked through culture this is cool because you can t just unlock everything through science alone and you re also not unlocking just one new thing at a time in addition you can speed up the process by meeting certain conditions another new system worth mentioning is amenities in a nutshell you need to mine farm or trade for shiny valuable things to make your people happy and productive the number you need depends on population otherwise it takes forever to build stuff and they may eventually revolt so here s what i really like about this game you have to plan you can t just steamroll your opponents through military might you have to make strategic choices not just in combat but in where and how you build your cities which technological advancements and civics you choose trying to fulfill conditions to get them done sooner and maintaining diplomatic relations so you can get favorable trade deals when your people demand more amenities what i don t like about this game is the fact that i have no interest in multiplayer and the ai diplomacy is a bit wonky they declare war on you for the dumbest reasons they get angry when they offer you a completely one sided trade deal and you turn them down if you declare war on one player just once you could find yourself getting repeatedly denounced for war mongering by every player for the rest of the match here s an ironic but annoying example ghandi declared war on me even though he was on the other side of the map and i hadn t done anything to him he kept sending troops on boats and i kept sinking them however when you have battles taking place too close to a city it creates war weariness which lowers amenities so as my production grinded to a halt i attempted to negotiate peace with increasingly ludicrous offers and he simply wouldn t have it eventually my people revolted causing powerful barbarian troops to surround my capital and begin razing my farms and mines so here i am stuck in a war i didn t provoke or start with the most unlikely antagonist and i can t produce troops build up my city or expand my population as you can guess it s more difficult to get a military victory now but ultimately it is for the better it gives you more incentive to actually try to maintain peace and attempt other winning conditions i would simply advise that you tread lightly when considering declaring war because there is no coming back once you start down that road in conclusion i consider this my favorite civilization game i consider it an improvement over previous entires in many different ways and i definitely recommend it
