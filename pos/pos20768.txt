the goodgood way to spend your time if you like magic and hp series in my case i was just curious about the magic i had never read or watched hp novels and movies before after a couple of hours i was enjoying the experience so i decided to watch the movies design and aesthetics of world locations palaces castles villages houses animals magical beasts characters witches sorcerers forests gears dresses magic wands etc are exactly the same as in the movies the feeling of immersion in hp world is very high many scenes from the movies are there hogwarts school is exactly the same as in the movies even better developers did a very good job to design build and furnish the hogwarts castle you can do all the magics you see in the movies and even further dark magic arts included you can fly brooms and magical beasts and even ride magical beasts no quidditch but many broom races hogwarts is a cosmopolitan school with students and teachers from europe and british ex colonies india africa one secondary character is a so called trans you can see that rowling took no part in the development i think that s the reason why you have no characters from the original novels and movies it s just a warner bros production that makes use of the hp world but without hp company the badit s not an astonishing production quality is high but not the highest you can see they saved lot of resources by outsourcing the development to affordable asian studios story and storytelling are cheap story is not bad but not very exciting movies have better stories and characters storytelling is limited to cut scenes and static multiple choice dialogues they sacrificed interactive narrative to puzzles and combats story is just an excuse to make you face lot of repetitive puzzles and combats in terms of mechanics it s a more of the same sort of assassin s creed of magic the young wizard witch is turned into a war machine killing thousand enemies unluckily the bad old culture of games as challenges combats and puzzles destroy the atmosphere and doesn t allow for charming narrative novels and movies are better experiences as always videogames are children of a lesser god belonging to a lower culture just toys not works of art those who are passionate about hp and want to put themselves in hp shoes and enjoy an interactive adventure they expect a story full of magic and atmosphere some mysteries to solve a few magical puzzles at most a few challenges with the bad guys certainly not never ending battles with magic wands where you kill thousand and thousand goblins and evil wizards combat mechanics are quite good i cannot understand the critics nothing new under the sun but if you like combats mechanics are effective obviously if you are searching for hard challenges look at dark souls or mortal combat and derivatives this is a game for a wide audience with easy puzzles and combats a few times instead of fighting you can do some stealth but most of times the game invites you to fight as always lot of useless repetitive secondary missions to water the wine very big game world but very repetitive it would be better to have smaller world and less secondary missions with higher quality interactive narrative i completed 70 in 76 hours you have to reach level 34 in order to trigger the ending scene so you have to do lot of annoying secondary missions to achieve the end when i say secondary missions i mean the camps the tombs the trials the shield missions etc i don t mean the primary missions with your best friends conclusionson one side it s a charming interactive adaptation of hp fictional world on the other side it s a wasted occasion to develop a compelling interactive story too much fighting and killing for a hp interactive experience buy it on sales at no more than 30 euro or dollars rating 75 100
