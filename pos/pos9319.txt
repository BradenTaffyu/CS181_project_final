2016 this game really is heavy in learning and details and and and i really appreciate the ship designer so your fleet is controllable in matters like propulsion energy generating weaponry hull shields etc and another pluspoint you can have more ships than your limit but it costs more to sustain them my friend gifted me this like 2 days ago i thought it looks fun now i have already 20 hours of gameplay on one savegame yeah we might be slow but it is fun allthough i dont like not being able to have war and conquer everything in one go instead you have to set it as war goals beforehand conquer them and cause trouble in the remaining part of the enemy empire kinda weird but it goes well if you dont want to have an everlasting war with the gigantic empire next door with their 30k fleet against your 12k kinda sucks and what is even worse when the 120k fleet flys across the universe just to mess up with the brand new updated 20k fleet edit please improve serverlist and joining actually it s not the worst
