2020 my newly formed colony was being attacked by the red cliff bandits a group of 8 people with proper guns their hideously deformed sapper huerta was trying to dig through my defensive walls realizing that my firepower was inferior i forced my expert constructor di cesare to constantly repair the wall huerta was trying to dig needless to say di cesare kept the wall in good shape after 2 days of struggle the bandits lost all hope and just left i laughed my ass off on the floor
