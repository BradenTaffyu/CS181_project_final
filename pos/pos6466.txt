2019 i bought this 9 days ago and i ve done 63 hours on it since and i m a grown up with a job and a wife i saw it reduced to about 3 50 having joked about this game quite a lot over the last year or so what you drive trucks on the motorway and that s it when i saw it on sale for almost nothing i felt like ok i ve got to see what it s actually like after i ve taking the mickey out of it for months i ended buying a package that included some dlc for about 11 i think the next day i went back and bought all the map expansions except the recent more expensive baltic one the day after that i bought a 100 greatest hits of country music to put in the stereo yeah i know it s euro truck sim but what do european truckers listen to classic rock not as funny today i ve just bought the baltic dlc because yeah actually it s well worth it this whole set for only just more than one eu4 expansion that really is it though driving trucks on the motorway autoroute highway for hours on end it s astonishing but somehow it makes a really great game very calm yet somehow also very addictive you can do it with one hand while you re drinking a beer unlike in real life also unlike in real life if you crash you can just load an autosave the driving fines are a bit annoying especially for traffic lights that change when you re too close to stop or cars that decide to pull onto a roundabout and ram you when you re half way round and in default settings it s much more pleasurable driving in britain or france where the speed limit is higher than the 56mph limiter on the truck than in everywhere else where you have to constantly keep your eye on staying under 50 but you can switch all that off so then hammering down the autobahn at 85mph in a 45 ton juggernaut is quite something or even better flat out through town centres ignoring the traffic lights although you do tend to get crashed into if you do that and all of it in the company of dolly and tammy and the gang i really like this game i totally recommend it the only complaint i have is that my truck i ve only bought one so far has a whine in the engine noise that sounds a lot like a dentists drill younger readers may not have experienced this delight irl i m gonna buy another truck soon and see if that s got it too one thing i ve learned from all this reversing these beasts requires such an innate understanding of physics that my respect for real truckers has grown enormously anyone who can handle one of these things confidently in the knowledge that anyone you hit is probably dead deserves a lot of admiration
