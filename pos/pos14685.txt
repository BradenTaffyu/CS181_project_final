2018 at the time of writing i ve put 38 hours into civ vi and i m surprised it isn t more i m currently in the middle of three campaigns with three friends two duets and one trio there are a lot of hardened civ v fans who won t adjust well i was one of them to begin with however treat civ vi as it s own game instead of comparing it and it s fantastic also in truth i would probably say it s my favourite of all the civ games now if you re the sort of person who plays on epic and needs minute management stick with civ v if you want to play civ have fun go online with some friends civ vi is the better game
