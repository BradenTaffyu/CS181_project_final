2019 2nd time i brought this game as the dev only supports mods on steam i have 70 hrs on gog it s a very solid strategic deck building game the mechanics are well designed and the mods make the game easily 3 times bigger due to all the extra characters you can progress through on top of new content they can provide i honestly feel this could be the best indie i ve ever played i have more hours in another indie game tab but that matches my td tastes strongly this game is great for almost any gamer at any level of strategic thinking the only way to make this game even better with what it already has is to add a mode change progression so that after completing a run on an ascension difficulty allowing to take your current deck into the next ascension immediately this would reward clever deck building which is hard due to card availability is random and massive whilst also avoiding that same starting deck again with a character speaking of which if you could draft your own starting deck on runs to prevent it being completely the same each ascension run that would be really good as well so yea overall a superb game with less things i d want to change compared to every other indie game that is very rewarding with many hours of awesome content
