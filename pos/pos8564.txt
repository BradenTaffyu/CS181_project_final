2019 thehunter call of the wild is one of greatest hunting games made over the many years i owned all the cabela games from the playstaion right to the newer ones i played many hours of the one now known as thehunter classic and i enjoyed it alot i thought no game would beat the cabela 2005 big game hunter game and no game has to this day for me but this game came very close to taking that spot cabela 2005 big game hunter is a very old game and it may be difficult for others to compare it to a game like this but just remember this is imo thehunter call of the wild pro s and con spro s a decent amount of firearms and bows amazing visuals great audio really good feel when tracking a wounded animal alot of items to aid your hunts such as callers sound and wind system when stalking your prey skill system hunt challenges to earn rewardscon s it is missing major hunting aspects i e you can wound a animal and run away with no consequences there is a decent amount of firearms but limited to a few bolt actions lever action bows pistols and shotguns with all the dlc releasing it is making me worry that it will be heavily dlc related and not many ingame updates please release some new reserves without charging us 7 99 to hunt 3 new animals and a new area i dont mind buying the reserves but the game its self should be updated focus on dlc later we need more base game firearms there you go thats my honest opinion on this game with all this i love this game its great and its worth every cent you pay but i would love if you released a few weapon updates firearms id love to see in this game remington r 25 browning bar safari in 338 win benelli r1 remington model 700 any bolt action ruger and the beloved karabiner we all want it dont add these in dlc edit found this funny hirschfelden a screenshot of thehunter call of the wild by rominvictus after all the requests for a karabiner we got a mosen good work devs but really another 4 dollars for some useless guns give us some firearms thanks for reading i hope this helps your decision
