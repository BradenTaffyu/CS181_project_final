2021 absolutely incredible please play this gameupdate lets make this a better review this game is probably one of my favorite rpg games out there while it had a long and treacherous journey to completion i would say the wait has been more than worth it made in rpg maker it is obvious from playing that it was a project created with love and passion evident by the rich storytelling and vibrant character dialogue a gripe others have and that i understand is the battle system it can at times feel a bit stilted and annoying making it boring for certain people the added length that the battle system adds may not be favored by others especially if they aren t used to the rpg genre even with that i very much enjoyed the battle system and it s unique features emotion system use of skills etc i mentioned before that the characters are vibrant and i meant this 100x i rarely find a game where i love all of the characters and enemies in a game but the game somehow found a way every character is unique and special to a point where i feel like everyone who plays it will find a character that they truly resonate with it s very unfair to compare the game to undertale but the characters in omori made me feel more at home and enjoyable then the ones in undertale maybe it s the fact that many of the characters in omori are human or the dialogue to me felt more enjoyable given the dialogue in undertale is comedic and still great at storytelling whatever it is i feel like the characters and their dialogue are a great part of the game the characters add to the great storytelling that the game presents as an rpg maker game the overworld isn t too detailed and characters are represented through small pixel graphics most of the art is found within battles and i very much like the style it uses yet even on the overworld i enjoyed the cutscenes that i found the characters a part of the story is told in a way that makes every part of the game interesting and leaves aspects of the game i still find refreshing i still find new secrets that send chills down my spine even now the game does a great job telling the story which a misconception is that it is about depression that is not the main topic of the story in a way that makes me feel like i m a part of the journey with the main character this review is long enough so i ll bring it to a close remembering that this game has horror elements i very much recommend it to people who are fans of the rpg genre and are fans of games such as yume nikki and earthbound i don t like comparing games like these but it s obvious that omori shares many aspects and influences please buy this game and read reviews that others have to say 3
