2021 do you have slight ocd do you like games like animal crossing and stardew valley because you can put everything right where you want it do you hate cleaning and decorating your own house if so you might really enjoy house flipper i have found in talking with people that most people that love this game actually hate doing these things in real life what makes us like these monotonous tasks in a video game who knows but the game is a lot of fun i think what i like most about it is that it is really relaxing you basically start with a small home office and random cleanup and decoration jobs come across your laptop as a way to introduce you to the various things that you can do in the game such as cleaning gardening with the garden flipper dlc tearing down walls buying home furnishings etc from there you get into the real goal of the game which is to as the title suggests flip houses there are a bunch of houses you can buy even more with the hgtv dlc and the soon to come luxery dlc clean up rennovate to your liking furnish and then resell for a profit from there it s on to the next house and so on the game as stated earlier is perfect for those of us who like a little order in our lives it really is fun to throw on some tunes and just clean and then let our creative side come out some of the mundane tasks such as mowing lawns painting picking up trash and cleaning windows are probably the most rewarding as you see the results of your work right away the graphics while working outside are pretty good but once you get inside the house they are very impressive there is occasional minor tearing but nothing that is too distracting or common you can even use your own photos as pictures for the inside of the house the game runs fine on most systems and i have not personally encountered any bugs i have heard that there are random saving issues at times i would really encourage getting the dlcs to go with it as they add extra jobs functions and content i m really enjoying house flipper gaming for me is a chance to unwind and this game is perfect for that if it s on sale i wouldn t hesitate to pick it up i think you ll be pleasantly surprised 11 22 22 just came to say that i still have a blast with this game devs are always adding new updates and cool themed events great game
