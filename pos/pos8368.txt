2021 i have sunk only about 40 hours into this game thus far but each time i sit down it immediately consumes my entire day as time melts away and i am fully immersed the atmosphere visuals and music are all intoxicating and pull you in as you make difficult choices and learn how to secure the survival of your city there is a real sense of progression throughout the game as you go from watching your workers manually drag coal to the generator to watching them shelter in home as the temperatures drop and massive machines do the work for them because they wouldn t survive outside temperatures all in all i would recommend anyone give the initial scenario a shot and if you like that then there are other scenarios that will put you in new and unique situations i will for sure put at least 20 more hours into this game before i feel satisfied
