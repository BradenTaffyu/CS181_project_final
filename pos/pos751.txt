2016 having played most harvest moon games with friends of mineral town being my absolute favourite i can say with 100 certainty that this game is everything a harvest moon fan could hope for every single aspect of the game feels incredibly fleshed out and well balanced crops are varied and the farm map is huge giving you the space to do whatever you want my only very minor issue with the game is the fact that you can only save by going to bed meaning you ll sometimes have to cut a day short if you have to stop playing for some reason a must buy for people that enjoy the harvest moon series
