2017 early access review game is looking good so far but before coming out of early access the agro really needs fixing friendly npc characters agro against you after the battle is over even if the fire poison etc they are standing in is of their own making i have tried to keep several npc s alive through fights only to have them turn against me during the conversation that automatically follows combat because they have taken damage from fire few other smaller issues i have noticed occasionally characters abilities are greyed out during battle quick save and reload seems to fix this random teleport bugs you click to move and one or more of your characters instantly moves to another location far from the rest
