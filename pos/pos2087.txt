visions of mana is a beautiful margherita pizza it s a classic that jrpg fans will love because it stays true to the mana series and avoids unnecesary innovations like pineapple features open zones set up like a platforming game 5 playable characters with 8 unique classes each and 40 unique costumes in total surprisingly dark story with twists to keep you guessing ng post game content and unlockable extreme difficulty at launch no need to wait for the anniversary update fantastic graphics and it runs great it has a shader compilation step to avoid common ue4 issues flaws lazzy port not many options and some technical issues i haven t experienced but some people reported them in the forums slow start the combat is really good but it takes a long time to get more classes than the ones from the demo
