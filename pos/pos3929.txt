2022 this game is wonderful at the time of review the game is showing overwhelmingly positive for recent reviews and absolutely deserves it before you buy here are some things for you to consider these devs are clearly passionate they re still adding content to the game nearly 3 years later the paid cosmetic dlc is there but the first major update white lion and black witch was free i m actually glad they charged some money for the 2nd one crimson crow and bought that the first sale i saw the redhead girl is not the main character this one for me was not a deal breaker just a little weird the red head with the panda shirt irene you know the literal cover girl for the game the one on every piece of art work you d have seen the self proclaimed hero yeah not the main character not even the first character to recruit to your team the main character is mild mannered and polite albus reminiscent of your standard fair protagonist from a slice of life anime rather than a brutal crime fighting turn based tactical jrpg there is grinding not a deal breaker for me i enjoy playing the game and repeatable missions grinding isn t even required to complete the story of the game if you really don t want to do it however if you want access to all customisation options in the game and to make your characters as powerful as possible you will be grinding there are a lot of systems in play it was honestly almost a little overwhelming just how many systems are in play here to name a few there s an item crafting system a skill talent customisation system masteries drone crafting and mastery system beast capturing and masteries for them too just the mastery system for just human playable characters alone is a massive undertaking to understand as a new player while there may not be many in game resources to help you understand it the game does a good job of introducing these elements to you slowly you have plenty of room as you are learning to try things and see what works there are some great guides here on steam to help you if you need them there is a lot to do in this game as mentioned above with multiple systems at play that means there is a lot to do in this game you will get incredible value out of this game if you do a price versus hours played comparison no english va for many of you this is either a non issue or even a plus but do note that the voice acting is entirely korean with english subtitles this can also make some minor story elements a little confusing or leave you wondering the translation is pretty good but not perfect they seem to have translated all the words and sentances but context and social norms are obviously going to be very different for western audiences final thoughts this game is easily one of my favourites and easy to recommend worth it at full price an absolute steal on any sort of a sale
