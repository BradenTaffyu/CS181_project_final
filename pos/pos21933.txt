2020 the dark souls franchise has become a very dear one to me the entire game is less of an rpg and more of an experience when i started the games i was but a wee lad wanting to try something new my stepbrother had bought me dark souls and i began playing and from there my concept of videogames changed forever i was fully immersed in the ruined kingdom of lordran and its take on a declining empire is amazingly shown without any direct knowing of the lore another thing i greatly enjoyed was the combat it was gritty unforgiving and most of all fair this formula carried onto the second game and although the world wasnt as flourished as lordran it was nice to get into a new game and do the trial by fire that is a souls game now we get to the review of the game itself and to say the least it is truly what separates boys from men the world of lothric is like no other and will stand the test of time as one of the most beautiful and fleshed out worlds ever there is no part in this game that was created as an afterthought to the original intention and it all melds together into this lifelike realm filled with both malicious entities that only wish to bring you pain and npcs that ease it with interesting dialogue a big portion of this game however is the combat and its amazing depth no enemy is ever going to be a pushover and will do everything in their power to stop you from completing you quest but notice how i didnt say that the enemies were unfair the bad reviews about this game would make you think so but every enemy has a weakness and its your job to utilize them to the best of your ability your not without tools for this task however as every weapon can be used with great efficiency and precision and can be upgraded to make you the most badass dude ever trust me when you re farmer johnson slaying enemies with your fully leveled up pitchfork you ll understand for me though the best part of this game and of the entire series in general is the experience i play this game for the most part with friends and it is truly a journey like no other when with the fellas the stories you tell from this game are like no other and brought me and my comrades together as true friends all in all i would recommend to anyone brave enough to touch this game to get the whole series
