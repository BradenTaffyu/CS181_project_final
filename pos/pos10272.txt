2017 early access review let me set the scene you ve played this game for about 3 years before it even came to steam and still now when it has over 10 000 very positive reviews you feel that its had such a positive impact on your life it doesnt contribute to your career or hunt for sexual partners in any way you feel like you owe it at least as much as a genuine review i travel with work and ever since i got this game i have always made sure i have this game ready to go on my laptop with the latest version at the very least this game has helped me realise what a terrbile human i am when confronted with situations out of the norm if you buy this game it will help you to develop your self loathing and misanthropy further 10 10
