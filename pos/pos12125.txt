2020 i ve only had this three days and i ve already run up 21 driving hours got my d class license in road and ovals and i still can t decide which i like better fortunately i don t have to my first laps at laguna seca in the mx5 were in the 1m51s i could see others regularly doing 1 42s and i had no idea how they were almost ten seconds quicker after lots of practice and several races where i barely avoided getting lapped my times improved to consistent 1 46s and now i m in the 1 44s and occasionally breaking into the 1 43s there s an awesome feeling of accomplishment when you get a sequence of corners right and my goal is to get into the 1 42s consistently sure there s a monthly fee and yes a lot of content must be purchased but it s much much cheaper than buying a real race car and maintaining it
