2023 i am a 54 yo father probably one of the oldest people playing this game i am a single father to my son who is 14 now my son got this game for christmas from his uncle so we installed it on his computer and he started playing by the end of the week he had 24 hours on this game this was horrible for me as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my son as he is always out with his friends or just watching youtube so i decided to make a steam account and get this game to see if i could maybe play alongside him loaded into the game made my character and world and started playing but i was stuck on what you were supposed to do i asked my son for help and he helped me loved it as it was the best time had spent with my son since my wife had died this game has ever since brought me and my son closer again and now we actually spend time together outside the house together as well this game reminded me that there s fun to be had in everything and it has brought both me and my son many happy memories thank you 3
