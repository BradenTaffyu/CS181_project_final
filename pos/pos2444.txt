2020 let s talk about fallout 76 the worst game launch of this era i have 500 hrs on the game i m level 301 and this is my thought on the game and yes i love this game but i m gonna be honest on this review firstly the game was released too soon or bethesda forgot that modders were fixing all the bug for them because the game has bugs a lot not gamebreaking for the most but some bugs can be boring dont go back to your desktop during a loading or you ll suffer a resolution bug and please todd howard it s 2020 i shouldnt have to restart my game to change my resolution settings graphics are good but not great as always bethesda kept the creation engine same as fallout 4 skyrim which means the textures are okay but not what you re waiting for a game released in 2019 luckily bethesda has a great touch and the level design is really really good appalachia are beautiful and the multiples areas to explore feel unique and they worth your time to explore and discover their hidden storygameplay is almost the same as fallout 4 if you liked it you ll like this one the perk system is kinda different tho and you re not able to be good with everyweapons like in fallout 4 endgame the game has a great bestiary maybe the largest of every fallout unique creature from appalachia s folklore that i ll let you discover if you want some pvp go for nuclear winter even if this mode isnt fun but has some cool rewards if you re willing to grind it otherwise you cant be killed by random players if they shoot you you recieve 1 damage and if you shoot back a duel between you and him will be made with real damage this time for the content if you didnt liked fallout 4 and dont like games like ark rust reign of kings this game might not be for you the camp system is great if you like to build your own house and search for plans and building materials i didnt started wastelander content yet but i m very confident about it and the fun grind it ll bring to my experience i ll update this review after testing wastelanders update in conclusion i d say that i recommend this game but not to everyone and please just make your own opinion about this game i was hating it when it was announced and when it was released but when i played it for the first time i just fell in love with it give it a chance and if you dont like it it s your right but let other people enjoy it they just released steel dawn one of the best dlc bos is back again i love that story
