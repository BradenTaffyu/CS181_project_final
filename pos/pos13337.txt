2015 as a 30 something year old person with little education but a love for science space and engineering this game caught my attention while in alpha a few years ago at that time i knew of the equations and methods used to get things into space albeit not grasping the details to any extent they were not familiar but also not foreign i opened ksp and joyfully set to building what i thought would be a simple but effective rocket ecstatic when completed i excitedly smashed the button to launch the view of my creation on the launchpad gave me chills with shaking hands heart racing i gently pushed the space bar the rocket ignites with a powerful firestorm for a fleeting moment my eyes found jeb in the bottom corner of the screen he was terrified panicing i center my eyes on the screen fingers ready to steer my way to space and victory six seconds into flight the rockets begins to rip apart parachute deployed and pulled taught from force of the rocket s climb rocket parts scatter in the aftermath of an explosion i look to jeb preparing myself to see his corpse mutilated and burned on inspection i see he survived the look of panic on his face has become horror the rocket s capsule is tumbling end over end climbing in altitude muscles in my arms spasm as my person slips into shock my mind reaching for help begging for training and emergency reaction to kick in floundering tears in my eyes i desperately begin to smash buttons on the keyboard my head is locked on the screen eyes vigorously searching for a button to fix everything to save jeb from his certain doom my heart sinks as seconds pass and nothing seems help all of my fingers are finding buttons and pressing the capsule apexed and started its decent tethered to kerbin by gravity s unrelenting pull i lock up panting short breaths staring at the screen i cannot blink i cannot look away the capsule strikes the ground a dialog appears on the screen confirming jebidiah s death i have since killed many more kerbals slowly learning the ropes i understand more about rocket science than i ever expected i have had successful missions to the mun minmus duna and jool if you are brand new to this game the best advice i have is to not turn the snap to feature on when building things in the vab and start killing kerbals you will be amazed at what you learn
