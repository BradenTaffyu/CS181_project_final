2016 fallout 4 is pretty alright i guess fallout 4 is a game directed by a tiny leprechaun whom you should never trust for he will lie to you and steal all of your hard earned gold instead you should put your trust in me for i am a kind and honest hobo who will warn you ahead of time before stealing your shoes bethesda games seem to be a mixed bag on one hand they are vast and open and you can spend hours just exploring and rummaging through other people s things on the other hand they seem to be programmed entirely by interns and have the depth of caked mud but my opinion doesn t matter to anyone except for me but since i am never wrong and the best at everything i ll still puke out words at you until i m finished no matter what i say you re still going to buy the game you gullible attractive hunk of a man woman you to be as fair as possible with fallout 4 is to split this review into two parts much like the titanic i ll start with the bad and then get to the meaty bits where everyone freezes to death i mean the good parts to start yes a lot of features that have been iconic to the fallout series since the 90 s are gone which is garbage yes the game sometimes has a hissy fit when you alt tab yes a lot of the textures look like i was the one who made them and yes the game has no right to run as bad as it does considering mgsv could probably run on a toaster if you asked it nicely enough the main story is also probably the most boring in fallout history considering at one point you were fighting an army of super mutants led by a crazy meat computer and the other one you were doing battle with the genocidal remnants of the us government who looked rather dashing in their suits of armor looking for your son is like a reverse fallout 3 where you were looking for liam neeson and actually feels like a step back compared to the political cluster that was new vegas the commonwealth itself also feels cramped and actually kind of primitive compared to their interplay counterparts and there s a lot of pointless retconning that only exists because the writers couldn t be asked to use the wiki good job guys but dirk you incredible sex machine vital to the salvation of the human race you might inquire if you dislike all of that stuff what do you like about fallout 4 thank you for the compliment first of all i liked the weapons although they took out a good number of them and equipment repairing is gone the firearms themselves have this really nice blocky look to them they look like they fire bullets that can take a man s head off is what i m saying they also added a more in depth weapon customization feature probably to make up for maintenance being taken out of the game the shooting feels like it was handled by the machine game guys the wizards that conjured wolfenstein last year it feels weighty and meaty making it leagues better than the first person shooting in the last two modern fallout games at least in my opinion it also helps that there s a snap function for cover where you can walk up to a wall and press the aim button to peak around it giving fallout 4 a basic but viable cover system that can help you avoid getting shot in the face but from what i can tell it doesn t really work with chest high walls and only with walls though i may be wrong i was never a fan of power armor in 3 and nv opting to rather use the ranger and riot combat armor instead to me it just felt like putting on a shirt rather than an advanced piece of military hardware and it never made sense to me why you would need training to put on something that was just as floaty as wearing normal armor or clothing while they took out the need for power armor training in 4 they at least made up for it by making the power armor cool as hell it works like a vehicle in a way with frames acting as a base to modify using power armor parts fallout 4 s power armor not only makes you taller and larger and more appealing to cute girls but it also boosts your defense strength and other things power armor is treated like what you think power armor should be treated like huge lumbering death machines that run on communist tears and patriotism i mean fusion cores which are made with patriotism and the joy of free american children this is the part where you salute there is also this change halfway through the story mode where the brotherhood of steel invades the commonwealth in search of the institute that thing they i think talked about in fallout 3 once or twice this new element makes it clear that they re going into a military operation and they intend to wage war and it shows boston itself turns into a quasi stalingrad of sorts with mutliple factions fighting from street to street trying to relinquish control from one area to another with vertibirds flying around super mutants raiders mercenaries and soldiers fighting one another for total control it gives the commonwealth a real sense of danger and struggle between the factions that fight for control of the ruins that look suspiciously like my bed room bethesda games are a mixed bag you either love them hate them or have no strong feelings i m part of the third while i dislike all of the cut corners and lazy design choices they seem to enjoy when bethesda does right then they do right for every mistake or blatant disregard they had for fallout 4 it s evened out by ideas and changes that just work well with the game they created i will admit that skyrim grated on me after awhile it wasn t long until the game felt almost empty and boring but fallout 4 feels like a pleasant surprise like a half eaten hoagie in the bottom of a dumpster though it s nowhere near the best game in the series because fallout 2 still exists it s still just the right amount of good to make up for all the bad also for some reason some weapons are magical dropout 4 high school redemption gets 7 nuclear holocausts out of 10 hey wait where s ron pearlman the curator
