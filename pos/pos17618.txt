2016 total war warhammer reviews before dlc very postive total war warhammer reviews after dlc mixed what i m shocked this game is everything that i ever wanted in the total war series franchise the game itself is a great happy marriage between total war and warhammer ips it is such a shame that people are coming out hating the game based on the fact that it has dlc in my opinion the base game is worth it for the price it currently is the dlc is well thought out and created with passion i ll happily purchase it because the ip is just so great on both sides creative assembly took the warhammer fantasy world and recreated in their vision in such an amazing way for someone that has been following the warhammer franchise and own a couple tabletop armies which sadly i don t play anymore i just can not say anything negative to creative assembly about this particular title i wish more people reviewed for the base game opposed to the dlc and expressing their opinion specifically about the game itself not pitch forks about greedy devs creative assembly has always shown that they want to satisfy their clients and have always stated that this game would have dlc nobody complained about it then why now
