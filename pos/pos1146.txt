2015 early access review you start off as a survivor in the apocalypse with nothing but your shirt trousers and shoes luckily you spawn in a house which appears to be zombie free giving you a chance to search for some food and a weapon you wander around checking each draw shelf cupboard finding nothing but a pen can of dog food load of clothes and some nails you ve been in the apocalypse for a few months now but luckily electricity and water are still on you check the fridge for supplies and find some uncooked chicken and watermelon this won t last you very long but it is better than nothing you decide you have to go out and look for more supplies if you plan on surviving any longer in this world as you go outside you spot one zombie looking away from you the only thing you have is a pen but it will have to do you sneak up behind the zombie and jab the pen in its head instantly killing it searching the body you find a diamond ring in the previous world this might have been worth something but in this one it is worthless you walk towards the opposite house and peer into the window seems clear you open the window and climb in scavenging the entire house you find some supplies and a baseball bat your first real weapon sweet but it looks like you had your back turned away for too long a zombie sneaked up on you luckily you turned around just in time and pushed it on to the floor and smash its head seeing it is getting dark you decide to close all the doors get a bite to eat and then go upstairs to bed you wake up to the sound of gunshot in the distance you look outside and see a horde of zombies walking towards your house it just isn t your day looks like some of them spotted you and they are now banging their faces on the door you rush downstairs and open the back door only to see more zombies you turn around and run back upstairs ripping your shirt and trousers off turning them into a rope you slam the bedroom door closed and throw the rope out the window you quickly climb down the rope and run off down the road in nothing but your boxers and shoes since you are sprinting you re making a lot of noise causing even more zombies to start running towards you you smash a window of a nearby house only to have the burglar alarm go off bringing even more zombies to your location you can t go back now you jump into the house dive into the corner they start pouring through the windows and doors no escape no hope you take out a pencil and notated writing your final words onto it you have one last meal a sip of whisky and whip out your bat for one last stand they burst down the last door and charge straight at you you whack at them but it is no use they grab and surround you pinning you down you open the health tab to see everything flashing left arm being eaten right leg gone then finally you pass i initially dismissed this zombie game as i thought it was going to be a 2d version of dayz how wrong i was project zomboid exceeds my expectations having everything i desire in an indie game unlike dayz pz is much easier to understand a lot less buggy and more vast in the zombie apocalypse while the ingame map isn t randomly generated it is large enough to keep you wandering for days but there is an online map pzmap crash override net which helps you to pinpoint your location quickly what you get in the game however is randomly generated anything you find in one play through may not be there in the next but as one would expect certain items will be found in certain places by this i mean if you find a food shop you will be more likely to find a load of food if you find a construction site you are more likely to find a bucket full of concrete and a sledgehammer etc i ve only had it for a few days but i m loving every bit of it some of the best things in the game currently are health system you get shot in the shoulder you re going to need to pull the bullet out disinfect the wound stitch up the wound and bandage it pull out the stitches too soon and it will reopen viewpoint you see from your characters view point not yours if there is something behind your character you won t see it until it is right on top of you you may hear a groan though giving you a chance to retaliate traits you character can be altered to survive different situations one trait will make your character stronger giving you extra damage carry weight and knockback while another might make you less prone to getting sick this will cost points which you gain by picking negative traits which give you more points depending on how severe it is so the total is 0 or more jobs you can pick a job you had before the apocalypse currently you can pick to be a police officer fire officer construction worker night guard ranger or unemployed all but unemployed give bonuses corresponding to the job for example a night guard will need less sleep than everyone else police officers are better with guns currently they have plans to add even more jobs update more jobs are coming next build projectzomboid com time over time things will change the power and water may be on for the first few months but after that will shut off leaving fridges ovens microwaves taps and lights all useless this means you ll either have to start making camp fires to cook and containers to collect rain water or finding non perishable food and bottled water over time everything will also decay the first month in the apocalypse will look quite tidy but a year later everything will be overgrown cracking etc shelter when you need to rest you can t just go in a house and jump in a bed zombies may see you and start crawling in your house while your asleep unless you are in a zone with no zombies you ll have to hang up sheets by the windows to stop zombies from spotting you in your house this also stops you from looking out while they are closed so you ll have to rely on hearing to be extra secure you could barricade all the windows and doors safety once you got a nice house barricade the windows and the doors you might think you can stay in there for a few months the game however might throw random noises in some direction like a helicopter flying over by or a gun shot causing zombies to go towards the direction it came from this may be towards your house threatening your safety although they haven t seen you you haven t seen them either it could be 3 zombies outside moaning or 50 they may be on the other side or right in front of your doorstep the only way to check is to look out but if you look out you might be seen skills you can level up as you use items or do certain things these include how fast you can climb how fast you can run how well you can give first aid how well you can cook how good your aim is how well you can barricade etc this can create roles in a multiplayer server one player might be the cook while another the doctor if you love zombie games i definitely recommend you buy this beware this is still in early access so you won t have the full game and there will be bugs although haven t found any at all yet compared to some other indie games this advances quickly previous update was on the 8th of september current one was released unstable on 3rd of november and properly released late december i am quite pleased with it this game was gifted to me by a very kind stranger but if i knew it was this good i wouldn t have spent all my money on other games and i would ve spent it on this while i can see it may not be everyone s cup of tea it is certainly one hell of an indie game
