2016 with almost 300 hours on this game i muse admit that i m a little addicted there is something with doing simple farming that really relaxes your brain that i just love i have roughly 80 games in my steam account and this games seems to be the go to when i just want to relax i recommend this game for any age and i enjoy that the price is well worth it i was almost a little turned away after te first winter hit since i caught myself with nothing to do but after the first year i was able to learn the ropes and prepare for the next winter so i had things to do in my opinion this game is 9 10 and i love it
