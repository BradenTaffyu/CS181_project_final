early access review truly one of the best factorio like games of all time with the combat update it really comes close to surpassing factorio imo the development has been constant and a pleasure to see and the quality of life updates really show that the developers play the game themselves as a big nerd myself seeing much of the tech grounded in real physics and fringe physics theory really makes me happy 10 10
