2016 i ve been a total war fan since shogun tw was released back in 2000 i ve been in love with the series ever since but boy has it been a bumpy ride as a fan of history i must admit i was a bit disappointed when warhammer total war was announced now though i think warhammer total war is one of the best total war games yet the world and races are represented excellently you really feel immersed in the world and faction you play even though i am not a warhammer player the tactical and strategical elements are as important as ever and even the single player units stats get updated regulary and every faction feels unique tactically and strategically i hardly ever write a steam review but i feel i needed to for this game i see a lot of negative reviews because of the dlc which i think is unfair the base game is an excellent title and the dlc only adds to it the dlc makes me come back to the game despite the fact that i have already finished the sp campaign several times i mean come on the game is given new life every time new characters factions are added to the game is the dlc expensive it s not outrageous compared to other games and hey i m no accountant to know what dlc costs to make if for whatever reason you are penny pinching you can always scour the web for cheaper cd keys or wait for a sale
