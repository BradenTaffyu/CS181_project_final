2022 i made a mistake when i first bought the game the first few hours were great but then after that i just got bored i was just like where the hell am i seen this already and ahh yes in forza horizon 4 the sad truth is that i do not really see the point buying this when you have and played with forza horizon 4 the game is exactly the same but it has a lot of improvements and a new map and basically that s it the problem is that i already spent 100 hours in the predecessor game and this one just got boring worst part is that i bought the premium edition although it only cost me 62 99 instead of 99 99 and never touched it since october 19 yikes maybe at some point in my life i ll play it again but not now in my honest opinion only buy this game if you did not played fh4 to death otherwise you will end up in the same shoes as i am
