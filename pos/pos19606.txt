2015 a huge world to explore lots of quests and decisions tons of items and great replay value are reason enough to pick up this fine roleplaying game very few changes appeared since fallout 3 but a strong storyline and partial improvements make new vegas great to play take it as an alternative to fallout 3 and you won t be disappointed overall fallout 3 s story was better but new vegas s story is interesting as well if you can stomach character with amnesia stories and has a better combat system personally this is one of my most favorite games rpg at its finest the entire new vegas gang not made by me community created artwork for fallout new vegas by burn main game all dlcs a screenshot of fallout new vegas by burn unlocked all achievements
