2018 early access review for those that love simulators this is definitley worth a shot i received a free copy myeslf and then ended up buying the game because i love this game and want to watch what becomes of it pros for me i can swear in finnish best car assembly mechanics i ve seen in simulators thus far actual survival mechanics needing to eat drink and wizz to survive ability to do other work such as firewood cutting and delivery sewage collection and the occassional pick up and delivery for drunken finish men must work for money to get food and survive can be a menace to society drinking and driving flipping people off and wizz on them cons for me i don t have many cons for this as i m assuming that there is more coming that would solve my pet peeves these are some some floors in the house are still green and looks like grass when hitting escape and loading the menu it does not pause the game unable to return to last save point i get this is a life simulator but this would be immensely helpful to me playing the game things i would love to see a map that i can take with me map showing where the shops are free roam painting with the spray cans i d love the ability to just spray my own colouring where i want and draw my own symbols different summer cars i d like the ability to choose what my car is at the beginning adding new variety to the game and different complexities for replay value ability to purchase parts and build other cars to avoid driving the hayosiko and the satsuma i m fairly certain more is coming to this game and i look forward to seeing what comes through
