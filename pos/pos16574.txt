2018 early access review this is one of the greatest games out there the developer is actively working on improving the game and adding content on a regular basis there are a lot of game developers that ostensibly call their games simulators those products tend to be poorly made and incredibly grindy my summer car is not one of those products every part of it is fun even the frustrating bits like just finishing your car build taking it out for a test drive and then have some decibel drongo collide with you at 150km h on the highway if you survive you pick up whatever you can you drop it in a pile fetch your van and start all over again this is a game where you can see the progress you ve made unfold before your eyes you can even see disaster strike fantastic
