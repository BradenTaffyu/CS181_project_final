2020 really addicting and therapeutic love cleaning up dirty houses renovating them to look nice and checking off all the tasks on the list it s so satisfying i bought the garden flipper and hgtv dlcs because i just want to play more i was really sad when i realised i had finished all the jobs from my inbox when i first started playing the game i didn t know they would run out i wish there was more jobs i enjoyed doing them a lot also would love it if there was a multiplayer feature it would be so fun to house flip with friends
