2015 fallout 4 is a great game with its own flaws and shortcomings on offer is a great new sandbox to explore scavenge and survive in with great mechanics both new and refined that keeps you going for just a couple more minutes only to realize that it s almost 4 o clock in the morning fallout 4 feels like it s all about hoarding items every item now has some gameplay use and the process of acquiring those items are more fun then ever thanks to improved shooting mechanics and a rewarding weapon modding system that helps instill more value and personal attachment to your equipment however fallout 4 has taken a step back in the role playing department gone are the skill checks for dialogue options from the new vegas only to be replaced by a bioware style conversation tree and voiced main character at best the story is a step up from fallout 3 and a cast of interesting companions helps to keep things interesting but at the end of the day this is a step back in the freedom of approaching quests your own way and serves to only limit the player fallout 4 is safe bet for anyone who loves the exploration aspects of the modern games fo3 and nv combat and crafting and don t mind or prefer the approach to story for anyone who really really values the roleplaying aspects that are lost then safely pass on fallout 4 or wait to see what mods will bring to the table
