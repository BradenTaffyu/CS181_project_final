2021 what can i say more about fallout 4 i already spend about 150 hours on ps4 version and still haven t found all locastions on the map now i started again on pc i grew up on the first two games back in the late 90s and being able to see fallout from first person view is just amazing the open world alone is so much fun to explore you can spend days just by doing that and not even caring about the main story line building the settlements is a huge fun on its own and at some points the game can be absolutely beautiful oh and did i mention huge modding support if you like post apocalyptic setting and rpg games this is definitely a must try
