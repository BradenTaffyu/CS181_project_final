2019 on paper i shouldn t like this game at all i love fast paced games with high skill ceilings and i m typically drawn to multiplayer games this is a slow turn based deck building single player rpg so why does this game work for me rpgs typically are grindfests that reward players for hours spent in game in the form of level ups instead of rewarding skill or strategy strategy is without a doubt the primary focus in this game enemies always telegraph their intent and you even know how much damage they ll do there is no random crit or random whiff bs here because of this fights are much more complex than the typical turn based attack the ones with the least health first strategy the order that you try to take down enemies is heavily based on what they re planning on doing to you the pacing and learning curve of the game is nearly perfect other than some cards being locked when you re low level you ll quickly start to see patterns in what is and isn t working for each character and it s fun trying out new builds based on what cards show up you can see the map and generally know what you re getting into from the moment you pick your starting point there s still some randomness in what will actually be there but you at least know the risks of choosing your path from the very beginning of each stage the game makes you feel clever in and out of fights the order of drinking potions and playing cards feels just as good as realizing your card and relic choices are coming together even better than you hoped every once in a while the stars align and somehow you ll build a deck that just feels so insanely op then you ll somehow manage to not see a critical flaw in your plan and have it all fall apart or accidentally play a single card out of order and die because of a 1 hit point difference it s so fun trying to find that perfect balance each run there s tons of replay value thanks to the procedurally generated runs 3 characters and a 4th character currently in beta multiple build strategies per character ascension mode and a daily challenge mode
