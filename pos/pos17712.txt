2016 this game is a great time for both vets and newcomers to the total war franchise to keep things concise the fantasy setting really lends itself well to the total war franchise as a whole allowing for lots of creative units based off of games workshops warhammer fantasy battle and a new fresh world to campaign across the map is nice sized for a vanilla game the units are extremely varied and fun each faction is very unique and the game is beautiful and much more optimized than rome2 attila the one downside is the lack of statesmanship leaves much to be desired building chains are more varied than rome2 but adjusting taxation and a few other intricacies have been dropped hoping to be added at a later date diplomacy is the same as it s been just a tiny bit more robust with options like confederations overall i give the game a 9 10 losing a point for lack of deep statesmenship that can be fixed a later point in time
