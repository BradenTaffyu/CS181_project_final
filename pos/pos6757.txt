2014 ultimate driving simulatordecided to completely rewrite my review since the game evolved so much over the 7 years i ve been playing it euro truck simulator 2 is probably one of the most popular simulators out there and it s awesome maybe it isn t a true simulator but that s probably the reason why it attracted so many people don t get me wrong i don t have anything against it not being true to life simulator it s extremely fun and relaxing yet challenging at times the game is basically driving from point a to point b and that s it sure it doesn t sound fun from the first sight but when you try it you want more and more you can also manage your own trucking company hire employees buy garages and expand your business through europe although after some time money isn t an issue anymore and that aspect becomes unimportant physics force feedback and interactivity is average but at the same time it s realistic enough and this is the reason why it has such a huge appeal both casual simmers and hardcore simmers find it good and enjoyable i strongly recommend playing this with a wheel and shifter it adds a lot to the game when it comes to immersion and if you have a headtracking device or vr it s even better i see some people about lots of dlc but seriously come on guys it s a game from 2012 you should be happy it has dlc and is still supported after so many years and yes i want more dlc it s what keeps this game alive not only it provides income for developers who then can dedicate workforce for improving the game but it also adds a lot content quality content also huge respect for doing charity dlc over the years it became so diverse driving from country to country really feels different different road layout signs architecture and landscapes you ll never get bored playing this because the maps are beautiful and scenery is constantly changing it has huge variety of trucks so everyone should find something they like customization options are there too you can make your truck look however you like from interior to exterior there s so much stuff to add and make your truck yours in other words original now the graphics when this game launched it looked like crap and ran like crap too now when hardware has improved a lot even a mid range pc can run this on 100fps but the most important thing about graphics is that this game received two graphical overhauls the last one being amazing which makes the game look so much better hard to believe it s an old game compare this to fernbus simulator which looks like crap compared to ets2 and that one runs on ue4 and the recent update barely impacts fps trucks look extremely good both outside and inside environments lighting and sky looks great too maybe tress could get an overhaul too huh they look pretty low quality sounds are not perfect but can t say they are bad i d say they re good and i m happy with sounds but there s always room for improvements especially when it comes to sounds it add more immersion oh and workshop support you can download mods straight from the workshop if you think there s anything missing overall and amazing game by amazing developers who never gave up and kept improving the game if you enjoy driving just buy this it s must have proslooks greatfunevery country is differentgreat for casuals and hardcore simmersmodding supportlots of dlc sgreat performancefreedom to customize everythingconssounds could be improved even moreneed tree overhaulfollow my curator page for more
