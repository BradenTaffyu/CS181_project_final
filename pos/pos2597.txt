limbus company reviewdon t feel like reading the whole thing down at the bottom is the conclusion and score given to the game reading time introductionlimbus company is the third entry in the project moon series after lobotomy corporation and library of ruina the game is a gatcha with a strong focus on world building and story as the player assembles a team of 12 sinners to face off against the horrible situations and grotesque creatures of the project moon universe storythe story of limbus company is strong in general with meaningful dialogue and excellent voice acting for a newcomer it might be hard to understand a lot of what is said if they skipped the previous two games as limbus assumes the player knows what happened before and what is going on certain terminology will be impossible to comprehend unless you played previous games and some certain references and homages will be lost as well the story is a tragedy and a comedy at the same time a screenshot of limbus company by nirhildija each chapter focuses on a sinner exploring their traumas ambitions and hopes that focus on a singular character allows for smooth development while also giving the player enough room to get invested in the sinners as their story unfolds however project moon has lost some of their magic in this entry as the library of ruina s world building and story as superior to that of limbus by a great degree despite that the plot is enjoyable and perhaps once limbus s story is wrapped it might become a contender for ruina but i doubt that be the case gameplaythe gameplay of limbus company can be straight up confusing to newcomers to the series and even those that played previous games it is split into two parts automatic fights and focused fights in the former players will drag a set of skills while units target whatever enemy they desire without the player s input resulting in a loop that rewards well thought strings of skills and the resonance bonus they provide face off against powerful creatures a screenshot of limbus company by nirhildija in the latter players will fight bosses usually in the form of abnormalities from lobotomy corporation or other abominations as they become able to select targets for skills such as body parts or adds the combat does have a good deal of rng into both encounter types but a player that uses their unit to the best of their skill and meets their potential can diminish the rng influence by quite a bit there are also powerful moves called ego which need to be unlocked or purchased for the amazing versions while the free versions can be quite lacking requiring some investment on the player s part soundtrackthe limbus company soundtrack is decent but it shines during boss fights as the artist mili who has provided her voice for previous project moon games partakes in limbus company her voice along with her music is so powerful that it heightens the immersion of important moments in the story and awakes emotions in the player with an explosion of feelings the music also helps reinforce the atmosphere of the current situation and it has special meaning in its lyrics regarding characters the world or experiences replaying the soundtrack online or facing off against bosses in the mirror dungeon reinvigorates the player by taking them down memory lane for the highlights of the game encounters longetivity mirror dungeon is an infinite grind loop that players can do to get powerful characters and egos should they choose to embark on a grind that will take around 60 70 hours with a battle pass assuming you start the story from the start at the same time it gives the game replayability as you can always take new teams farm new identities characters and use new powerful items in the roguelike mode unleash ego s to get the upper hand in battle a screenshot of limbus company by nirhildija at the same time for better or worse this is a gotcha that means you can play this game forever unless it closes which i doubt but to get your dream team you are going to have to play for at least 6 months or pull an obscene amount of money into it the battle pass is cheap and rewards the player with egos and goodies plus the possibility of getting 4 6 legendary characters if they complete it that s it it gives an incentive to play without putting a lot of money regardless it will take time and multiple battle passes to get everything just right conclusionlimbus company is an amazing game that while doesn t quite measure up to library of ruina does give a solid story with interesting characters and a gameplay loop that is enjoyable if you are a free to play player this game is very generous for a gotcha if you like to invest money it is also worth it to put something into the game for those who are a bit lost in the story perhaps it would be a better idea to play previous titles before limbus or see a summary of lobotomy corporation and library of ruina online 10 10 masterpieceif you enjoy and find the
