2021 early access review this is probably the best hyper realistic survival zombie game to date im not joking around here if you are a zombie lover and don t have this i would walk away from you during a dinner we are done finished blacklisted the amount of tiny details in this is staggering you can customize if you want traditional zams or perhaps feeling some 28 days later fast zombies set the outbreak date and start during outbreak day or start years into the plague and watch as the map becomes overgrown and zombies start to decay the progression is leveling up you re skills to unlock new recipes to craft and combine this with a mod named hydrocraft which adds tons of things to do you ll go nuts you ll learn to cook various foods which have their own calorie system and you ll learn carpentry to build you re on forts if you want there s a whole mental system weather yep if you love to roleplay its almost endless to much to explain my personal fav is that its relentless no handholding you can get injuries scratches sickness but if you re bitten nothing you can do i think you can set how the infection works also if you re survivor dies and you start a new game on same file you can find them undead and put them down lastly i recommend superb survivors which adds npc s to the game so you re not the only one the mod is slight bugged due to the main game updating so then also add the mod subpar survivors which patches superb even then its not super fleshed out its still worth it imo you can then forge groups together and really start to roleplay giving some members duties so much little details of surviving i cant explain anymore the vanilla game is also beta but honestly i haven t noticed anything game breaking yet its criminal that this is only 15 guys n gals pick a good weekend and buy this its incredible much love to the indie stone and modders 3update as of 12 20 21 the subpar survivors is broken and unclear if the author will fix multiplayer has been added however as with all mods pray the authors update to work with single and possible mp also thanks for the awards pple 3 merry christmas
