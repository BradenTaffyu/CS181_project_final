2014 i m going to rewrite my fallout new vegas review because my old one was monkey ass fallout new vegas is in my top 5 favorite games of all time and definitely my favorite post apocolyptic world its one of the best open world games available and i can t recommend it more full price or not this is truely one of the greatest games of the last generation and of all time i played over 100 hours of fnv on my ps3 before i became a pc gamer i ve now put in 55 additional hours and i m still not done with it i m not even close to playing through the amazing mods and quests this game has there is easily over 100 hours of content without replaying any of it its absolutely unreal how much content is in this game and how fun it is to play it all the story of fnv starts with you getting shot in the head pretty weird start but it works it makes me interested why did i get shot who shot me why did he shoot me over you find all this out over the course of the story that plays itself out greatly on top of an indepth main quest you have detailed side quests to go along with it the side quests do a great job of tying the story together while also telling its own i don t want to go on forever here but if you want comparisons the story in fnv is exponentially better than the story in fallout 3 and i enjoyed the story in fallout 3 quite a bit the combat system works in an interesting way while you do have the basic fps mechanics you also have vats which makes it work in sort of a psuedo turn based way you target certain body parts tell your guy to shoot then he does its pretty satisfying especially seeing an opponents head go flying in pieces off of his body pretty satisfying combat i do wish sniping was done a bit better i feel like when i m trying to snipe opponents from far away vats doesn t really want to cooperate which is unfortunate pretty much my only complaint about the combat this last part isn t really about combat but it is gameplay so i ll mention it here the game implements a hardcore mode which forces you to eat sleep and drink along with making combat more difficult and companions killable i ve never done a full hardcore playthrough but i do enjoy the mode for the most part killable companions is though i use a mod to keep that part off this is getting really long so i ll make my last point about the world this is probably the major weakness of the game if i was to point out any i don t really think there is anything majorly wrong with the world but at the beginning it sort of feels like you can only go one way if you try to go north you re almost guarenteed to get slaughtered unless you turn god mode on mid level about level 15 and on you can pretty much go anywhere in the world and you don t have to worry about dying the world feels good and exploration is fun but it definitely feels like its forcing a linear path for the first 1 4 of the main quest fallout new vegas is my favorite single player fps of all time and if you ve never played this gem you should pick it up immediately i promise you ll love it buy at full price
