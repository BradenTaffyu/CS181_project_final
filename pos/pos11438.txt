2021 early access review this game is the pinnacle of the survival crafting genre yes it s still in alpha yes it has bugs and flaws but i keep coming back time after time to start a new game because it s so much fun i m over 600 hours in and i only paid 5 for the game on sale a few years ago i can t wait for alpha 20 to drop so i can start a new game and experience it all over again i just wish the developers could get some triple a funding so they could turn 7dtd into the triple a game it deserves to be if you re reading this and you re a venture capitalist please give tfp a hundred million dollars you won t be disappointed with the results
