2016 product received for free a couple facts im old been gaming since 82 i ve been a writer a coder a tester but above all else a gamer my favorite type of game is strategy and i ve spent many thousands of hours playing every sid meier game that has ever came out from pirates railroads sim city and every civ i got a copy of this game for free which was neat because i was about to order it but i have been on a mailing list since like 92 and i guess it was my turn first time heh what i liked game felt very familiar right away i didn t struggle to understand anything that was going on the districts are explained very well and actually make sense i never did like being able to cram every single wonder into one city in previous civs i mean it made for a great city but really where were you putting all those things depending on which civ you choose you can have anywhere from 5 to 6 districts per city from a selection of arts entertainment industry science faith etc etc each of those districts can house many different types of buildings specific to your civ and what direction you are trying to go in with that city also wonders are linked to districts and by land formations you can t just build them anywhere so city placement tile purchase and city layout are very strategic diplomacy i read alot of negative comments about this how the ai is insane and makes no sense in fact i d say 75 of the negative reviews are about this however i can say that 100 of the people complaining about the diplomacy simply don t understand it civ vi diplomacy is insanely complex and deep every leader has his her own personality matrix plus 2 agendas one public and one hidden the public agenda is always the same lets call it the civ agenda the hidden agenda is more like the leaders personal goal looking out for him herself not so much their nations interest you have to get close to a nation through gifts trading etc to be granted secret access to their policy to see their hidden agenda if anything you do goes counter to any of their agenda s they become erratic and paranoid think south korea and north korea they co exist but barely or china and taiwan civs take their sovereignty super serious in this one even the hint that you are making an aggressive move makes them paranoid build a settler fine move that settler one hex towards empty land near them they freak remember they are hipocrits too oh and gifts are your friend give them small amounts of gold every so often units and combat the combat in this version is about the same as in the last you do have some support units and there is a whole faith based combat system but honestly most of the refinement can be had here its not great but its not bad fit and polishi do wish they had gone a different direction than the cartoony graphics of course one of the first mods i used was the westeros reshade filter which helped a ton another issue is when playing a 12 ai map turns take forever to resolve sometimes 2 minutes which is crazy but overall its a solid base game and i think it will only get better as they patch and refine edit i wanted to edit this to add a couple things first off i have had alot of people saying this game was buggy i have a decent pc windows 10 home 64 bit 10 0 build 14393 14393 rs1 release inmarket 161014 1755 language english regional setting english bios bios date 10 20 10 09 47 36 ver 08 00 10 processor amd fx tm 8120 eight core processor 8 cpus 3 1ghz memory 16384mb ram available os memory 16330mb ram page file 6269mb used 12724mb available directx version directx 12 card name amd radeon r9 200 series manufacturer advanced micro devices inc chip type amd radeon graphics processor 0x679a dac type internal dac 400mhz display memory 11218 mb dedicated memory 3053 mb shared memory 8165 mb current mode 2560 x 1440 32 bit 60hz monitor name viewsonic vx2770 series monitor model vx2770 series driver file version 21 19 0137 0001 english driver version 21 19 137 1 anyhow i have not had one crash one bugged ui hang or any other glitch other than the long turn times mid late game sure the game needs refinement sure it has some bugs but to label it as a glitchy bug laden pile of garbage as so many have is outright false i suspect they are using mods perhaps incorrectly or edited files themselves maybe their systems need more memory i know alot of people try to game on laptops now that is simply something that won t fly in this game not unless you sprung for a 1600 gaming laptop with 12 gb of ram and a dedicated gpu just saying edit 2 wanted to edit my review to add my current favorite mods i am using that makes the game well perfect imo you can find them all on civfanatics improved tech treejfd s rule with faithmoar units modtougher city statestundra farmsunit report screenwonders no adjacencyyet not another maps packcqui
