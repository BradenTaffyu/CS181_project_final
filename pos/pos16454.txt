2019 early access review don t let the simple graphics fool you this game is a masterpiece you re a young finnish man in the year 1995 your only real goal in this game is to eat urinate sleep shower and fix your car if you don t know anything about engines or cars you will be very confused at a first look but don t worry there s plenty of guides online that will help you with anything you need if you haven t noticed already this game is much like real life f cked up the wiring tough sh t start over didnt screw in one of the hundreds of nuts tough sh t start over there s no shortcuts this game will make you want to put a bullet in the back of your head but after you ve finally fixed that damn car and meanwhile developed a chronic alcoholic liver disease from god knows how many beers yes you can drink beer in this game you will feel true accomplishment and all those hours of f cking up and not knowing what to do will pay off now you may wonder what is there to do after i ve fixed my car well what isn t there to do drive around the small finnish woods and explore the small town boat to your little island and grab a beer while watching the sunset compete in a rally race with your car the list goes on in conclusion this game isn t your typical quick dopamine fix but if you are willing to work hard just like if it was real life it will pay off in the end
