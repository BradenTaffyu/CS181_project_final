2021 after about 150 hours of our campaign my co op partner and i have finally beaten this masterpiece of a game i have not played the first divinity or any other rpg game similar to divinity so i can t make any comparisons the game supports up to 4 people in a campaign but i only played with one friend so we controlled two characters each there s a perk that buffs you if you re playing solo and don t pick up companions which you should use if you are solo there s a lot of freedom in the game with all the spells and builds you can go with one of the most exciting things for me while playing was getting a good weapon or gear tailored to my build there are lots of different equipment that can alter your combat strategy by a lot the combat itself requires a lot of strategy actually and i would say it s somewhat challenging to learn this game does not hold your hand when it comes to combat you ll make many mistakes like accidentally buffing healing an enemy or accidentally damaging yourself in the beginning enemies don t scale with you so you re supposed to be in certain areas at certain levels and the game doesn t tell you where so side quests are kinda mandatory in order to stay strong enough for specific regions there shouldn t be much trouble if you re advancing through the game being the same level as the enemies it took my friend and me around 5 hours to beat the final boss though but it didn t even feel like it cause it was so fun one thing about the freedom it gives though is that you really gotta explore everything if you don t figuring out certain side quests or puzzles will be pretty tricky quest logs can be rather vague sometimes and don t entirely steer you in the right direction there s also a perk that allows you to talk to animals which was fun to use but it rarely actually helped us so it felt like a waste of a perk point although it didn t help much i feel like not talking to the animals severely takes away the amount of dialog in the game it s also the only perk unrelated to combat at all an add on gift bags allows you to do it without the perk but it disables achievements story wise the game does a great job a really engaging story with a roller coaster of twists if you were only to do the main story quest line which you can t unless you re pro at combat the game isn t actually that long there are so many side stories that you can do though and depending on your choices you could possibly alter the ending credits scene where it shows you everything you ve done i didn t encounter that many game breaking bugs in the game maybe like 1 or 2 there s a lot of things that aren t necessarily bugs but rather game logic that doesn t make sense things like the ai healing an undead character they take damage from that despite technically not knowing they re undead you can actually cheese battles by doing something such as playing dead or preparing a fight before you end the dialog with the enemy of course there were some minor bugs here and there but it s a tremendously massive game so it s bound to happen a big complaint that i have to mention is that the audio for the final battle sounds so terrible they tried to make it echo and stuff because of certain circumstances and it sounded bad enough for my friend and me to completely mute the sound effects for the entirety of the battle honestly not a big deal but probably the most annoying thing i encountered during the game i hard recommend this game it s so much fun and easily replayable i may have beaten the game but really i feel like i missed certain things that i can pick up on another campaign this game is absolutely worth the money
