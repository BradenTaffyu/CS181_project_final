2017 allow me to ask you a simple question fallout 3 or fallout new vegas i know i know this is something we think every day but i want you to really think about it which game is better fallout 3 or new vegas back when new vegas was released many critics said it was the equivalent of an expansion pack to fallout 3 and passed it off as just more of the same without being anything special yet now many people argue that new vegas isn t just the better game that it might be the best game in the fallout series of course i m not one to throw stones in this debate i ve only played fallout 3 and new vegas so i can only give opinions on this much smaller debate god i m making this sound more important than it actually is so i ve never been a big fan of fallout 3 i enjoyed the time i played it when it came out and then i played the goty edition on my second playthrough and i ve considered buying it a third time but i m always reminded about the stuff in fallout 3 i didn t like further emphasized by an interesting video called fallout 3 is garbage and here s why if you re not easily provoked i recommend this video it really reveals the in fallout 3 s design obsidian is a very underrated gaming company in my opinion they ve made a couple of my favorite games and what they did with new vegas was similar to what they did earlier with knights of the old republic they took an old idea that was good and tweaked it a bit to make it so much better added better writing and shoved in a ton of bugs and glitches hey i didn t say they were perfect i said they were underrated so new vegas is made very similarly to fallout 3 but small tweaks by obsidian have made this a wholly different experience firstly the story is a massive improvement fallout 3 failed to connect with me because it felt far more like i was following in the footsteps of my liam neeson dad without feeling like i was creating my own journey sure there were some clever ideas and fun setpieces here and there but the story as a whole was kind of flat and that s mainly because the writing handled the conflict from the enclave and also between good and evil in a traditional black and white view of morality fallout new vegas is a story of choice the city of new vegas is ruled independently by a silent overseer named mr house but from the east rises a new foe caesar s legion their roman dictatorships guides them to conquering new vegas in the name of order they aren t malicious moustache twirlers they have clear motivations and justifiable reasons for why they re doing what they re doing along with them is the new california republic sticking stubbornly to old world democratic ways as a decicive battle begins to rise you must choose the best possible fate for new vegas keep it under mr house vote for the ncr s control conquer it with caesar or find your own unique path there is no clear right or wrong which makes the decisions feel more personal rather than me sticking to a traditional good and evil mentality like the bullsh karma system in fallout 3 of course on top of that the side quests handle this similar morality as you are given difficult decisions on what is the best to do do you choose to destroy or build each comes with a cost and a repercussion when chosen and it s very believable of course not only did the story keep me playing for 70 house f that s depressing but also the gameplay is very addicitng you customize your own character as the courier and embark your quest as is expected with most rpgs but the leveling system is so easy to manipulate in order to beef up your character to their best possible stats and all the hidden locations secret weapons and amazing side quests kept me hopping from one objective to the next the world of new vegas is also much more aesthetically pleasing than fallout 3 s grimy green and dirty brown washington d c new vegas has bright blue skies and massive golden deserts lying beneath it during both day and night the mojave is constantly a dynamic and enjoyable place to explore and there s enough variety to the world to keep you wanting to explore the whole area while on foot if you plan on buying the ultimate edition you ll also be getting several dlc packs including the 4 added story packs i ll give a mini review each of them dead money fun trip going back to having little supplies and learning to survive it s a bit on the hard side though especially at a random middle point in the game and some obnoxious speakers scattered around the map but the story is pretty decent and the sierra madre looks amazing honest hearts much cooler in concept than execution the world of zion looks amazing especially with the added weather effects but the story is clearly another conflict of two different ideas on how to confront a problem and you choose the option without feeling very invested because the story really loses steam when you realize that it s 80 fetch quests old world blues it s pretty enjoyable the intro is too cringe y and long of a start until you actually starts playing the game until you get over the first hour difficulty hump where you try to find the right weapons that actually affect your enemies but the world is kooky fun to explore and the ending was oddly unexpected but still believable that and the new weapons are very useful lonesome road definitely my favorite it adds some much needed backstory to the courier which i think is more of a fault in the main game for not having that but the divide is incredible it s a hard play through especially when considered to the hoover dam battle but the ending is satisfying to watch unfold if you don t get any of the dlc packs at least get this one of course there are some problems too the game crashed on me more often than my dad s jalopy and there were a couple bugs and awkward conversations with something blocking the other character s face that and the voice acting isn t the best a lot of actors play their roles very same y and don t variate their voices enough so that most everyone sounds the same despite this i think fallout new vegas improved massively on the initial formula set up by fallout 3 by adding in more mature moral dilemmas a more interesting world and some fantastic ideas for quests sure there are some problems but this is a game i played in my past that has gotten better with age for sure i m giving fallout new vegas a 9 10
