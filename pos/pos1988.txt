2022 if you love games like kotor and mass effect then its absolutely for you its a fun mmo to play with friends but if like me you have no friends then its also a great game to play by yourself d it has 8 great stories to choose from and also a handful of new expansion packs it is f2p but i would recommend getting membership for the full benefit if you are that way inclined
