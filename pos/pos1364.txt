2019 early access review i decided to finally buy this game after years of having it on my wishlist and trying it out back in like 2014 2015 it was great then but i couldn t get into it now oh boy now it s unlike any zombie survival game like dayz or h1z1 or 7dtd it s better and it s only getting better the performance is amazing the multiplayer is amazing mine is a bit laggy due to me running a server and playing all on one 2 8ghz processor but hell i can do it no fault of the games graphics the art style of this game is timeless which is great it s a bit pixely as the art but that s the point it runs really well on maxed settings on my 1440p monitor in single player multiplayer is a bit buggy at max zoom due to me running the server too but again no fault of the games content endless literally you will die a lot in the beginning until you figure out what to do i personally tweak my sandbox singleplayer to how i like so it s not too much of a grind but still grindy enough to feel rewarding sound depends on what version you play the most recent released build 39 or 40 i think has really a good soundscape some of the sounds could be a bit more realistic and some just straight up need to be changed sawing hammering noise but hey it s a beta i m not docking points for just undeveloped progress because i know it ll be there in the future developer updates in the beginning i felt they were slow i ve had this game on my rss feed for years and it seems slow going i honestly haven t payed that much attention to it so i can t really have an opinion on it they re very active in the community which is fantastic so i assume they re always busy while i would like updates more frequently i would also like the devs to live fulfilling lives while they still enjoy making the game so it doesn t become a chore though some days i m sure it does overall 9 8 10tl dr buy this game it s not perfect but it s damn close spend the first few hours dying and respawning trying new things try multiplayer if you have friends buy the 4 pack and gift it to friends like i did if you have the money it s worth every damn penny i spent and more keep it up devs this game will go bigger once it fully releases the animations update is spectacular even if it s a bit buggy at this stage
