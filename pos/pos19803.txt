2015 more and more i return to new vegas as the absolute paragon of how a game can resist the show it all in one playthrough mentality taking your actions and choices and moulding them into a meaningfully different unique to you conclusion that describes how your time in the mojave wasteland affected not only the fate of characters you met but entire factions and regions of america in the years following the game s conclusion obsidian provide a masterclass in storytelling engaging and memorable quests meaningful choices and fantastic post apocalyptic survival gameplay fallout has always been about the world that was burned away as much as it is about the world that rose from its ashes and obsidian never forgets this dark humour abounds twinged with a kind of sadness but also with profound musings on what it is to be human what it means to lose your history and culture and how we might replace these things among the ruins of the civilisation of yesteryear a fantastic job is done of resisting painting the franchise s various factions as simply goodies and baddies giving you the freedom to decide the fate of the mojave without feeling like you have been pidgeon holed down clear cut simplified endings the game refrains from judging the player s morality in a refreshing way staying true to a core tenet of fallout morality is a flexible thing that can mean many things in the wasteland i cannot stress enough that this is a game totally unafraid to bar you from embarking on certain quests as a result of your actions and i must insist that if you play it you fully embrace it it s not about seeing it all it s about the tailored story unique to your character that came about by reacting intelligently to how you played and letting the chips fall where they may in my most recent playthrough i played as an enclave fanatic and this roleplaying decision governed all of my choices what weaponry and armour i wore how i interacted with others the factions i chose to support and attack it couldn t have been a more different playthrough than my first where i decided to be chummy with the new california republic it is hard to describe the satisfaction to be had when a game reacts so capably to your decision making few games have done it as well as here companions are memorable and have side quests which open up their characterisation and make you feel attached locations are iconic ranging from the debauched new vegas strip to the sun baked settlements that surround it the dlc is frankly unmissable chronicling an excellent story thread which is interwoven in each piece of dlc despite them at first glance appearing to be thematically unrelated it s important to play them in order of release for the full effect fallout 3 was an amazing rpg but new vegas reminded me why exactly i had loved fallout so much in the first place closer to fallout 1 and 2 in tone and rpg design new vegas leaves huge boots to fill for bethesda s fallout 4 new vegas honestly remains one of the best games of its generation
