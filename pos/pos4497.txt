2015 pros amazing gameplay combat no matter how you play be whoever you want craft your own story with very few limits quite expansive with insane replayability epic value for the price help another empire grow or start your own and conquer everyone else muahaha cons graphically does not look very good at most times starting out can be a little tough can be really difficult unforgiving at times is so addicting you ll forget what the sun looks like honestly it s great it may not look the best at times but it more than makes up for it in the combat and large scale battles overall i would highly recommend this game
