disclaimer i bought this after all the drama so i went in without knowing any backstory i ve been having a blast so far coming from the older total war games i noticed how smooth and responsive the game played it also plays a whole lot slower than the other games which give it so much more room for tactics games like the warhammer trilogy while still awesome mostly felt like a chaotic clash where the army with the highest stats just wins in this game i ve defeated late game invading armies by using clever tricks like trapping heavy armoured units in mud to defeat it using tier one units it s really refreshing to see that the game focuses more on clever tactics than building an overall stronger army i d love to see these guys make more historical games with fresh mechanics historical total war is finally back in my book
