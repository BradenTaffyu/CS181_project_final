2016 welcome to the usa well two of fifty states american truck simulator is scs software s latest bafflingly enjoyable trucking simulator ats is effectively ets2 with a few improvements and new locations in the form of california and nevada for you to explore with arizona coming as a free update at some point the map scale in ats seems to be smaller than ets2 and while that does mean you get around faster it also means that you can t have long journeys like you could in ets2 which is also contributed to by only having two states ats has only launched with two trucks but there are a couple of others ready to be released once licensing has been sorted out by scs with more trucks in the works all of which will be free updates ats is certainly a good looking game and it boasts visual and performance increases over ets2 both trucks are well designed and look great especially with the shiny paint jobs and the scenery all looks good too the towns and cities also look good but due to the map scale they feel pretty small with the exception of los angeles which is relatively big for the game the ui and menus are all the same as they were in ets2 and are still just as easy to use as they were the new trucks have come with some in cabin differences namely an electronic display and a built in gps both of these have several display modes to choose from which are all pretty helpful being a trucking simulator ats gameplay consists of hauling cargo from one company to another between cities one of the new features in ats is special destinations for cargo which will depend on what kind of cargo you re hauling for example if you re hauling construction equipment you might have to drop it off at some roadworks just outside one of the game s cities on the topic of new features weigh stations are also new and you ll sometimes receive a message to pull off and have your truck weighed when you re passing one back to the actual cargo while there s not as much variety as there was in ets2 with dlc there are still enough cargo types to keep things interesting as was the case in ets2 unlocking certain skills will also give you access to new kinds of cargo such as flammable liquid or high value construction vehicles the maximum trailer lengths have also been increased up to fifty three feet whereas ets2 had a maximum length of forty feet these longer trailers can provide quite the challenge especially when you re dealing with tight turns ats also lets you build up a fleet of trucks and drivers to bring in extra income for you while early on you ll probably need bank loans to buy new trucks once you ve got yourself established expanding your fleet will become far easier despite the fact your hired drivers can only earn up to 20 000 per job having a form of income other than the jobs you re completing yourself is incredibly handy especially if you have loans to pay off garages to house your fleet are available across both states currently in the game and start with three truck slots with an upgrade increasing that to five while you do start with your own garage it only has one slot available which is occupied by your truck so you ll need to upgrade it to three slots before you can hire new drivers the trucks purchased for your drivers can be upgraded customised just as your own can and you can also switch around your trucks whenever you want upgrading and customising your truck is one of the main areas where ats is inferior to its predecessor right off the bat only having two trucks that s not two manufacturers that s two single trucks massively limits the customisation though each truck does have a couple of different presets though they aren t unlocked until you re a higher level and levelling up takes quite a long time customising the actual trucks is also pretty underwhelming most parts of the truck only have two or three different options such as bullbars and some of the options that were available in ets2 simply don t exist anymore such as a beacon hopefully this will improve once scs has sorted out more licensing but for the time being it s definitely one of game s negative aspects the other main problem with the game is the map scale i mentioned earlier a twenty in game hour journey now takes somewhere in the region of thirty of forty minutes depending on whether or not you re in line or below the speed limit while this kind of scale would be acceptable if we had access to the whole us when you consider that a twenty hour journey is pretty much the longest possible journey in the game s current state it s pretty disappointing of course if you do prefer getting your jobs done quickly then you may actually like this but i feel like most ets2 fans will be somewhat disappointed one last thing i d like to touch on is just how relaxing the game for the most part is just cruising through california and nevada with your favourite music or podcast on is incredibly enjoyable and relaxing perfect for after a long day s work or after you ve been playing something a little more stressful if you don t have any music or podcasts to listen to you can try out the game s default internet radio stations or even add your own instructions available in game which feature a wide variety of music genres the game does have some music that plays if you don t have your own stuff but that only plays in the menus and loading screens i did say the game is relaxing for the most part the other part there is when you re involved in some kind of traffic accident or you get hit with a speeding ticket when you ve only just entered the new speed limit zone while incredibly frustrating they don t happen all too often so you should be nice and relaxed for most of your time in ats verdict ats current amount of content may be disappointing but the game does improve on ets2 and will be enjoyed by its fans if california and nevada isn t enough for you i d suggest holding off on buying ats until the arizona expansion is out but otherwise go for it the game s pricing is reasonable after all lone ranger reviews el k
