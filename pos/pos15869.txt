2021 as someone who enjoys the cleaning portion of house flipper more than the decorating and selling parts man this game was a dream come true the game is early access so i can only hope that it ll be improved over time but i think it s a great game if you want to do something peaceful and monotonous for a few hours it seems like it takes 15 16 hours to finish the available jobs my current criticisms are that the game really needs to balance out its criteria for enough dirt having been washed away to consider a segment complete it ll either jump to finished with a substantial chunk left to clean and deprive you of that experience or you ll spend forever walking around in circles hitting tab trying to find the angle that ll show you the minuscule speck of dirt that s left to clean up definitely recommend if you like the cleaning portions of house flipper or viscera cleanup detail although it s a little flatter on the ground so far than either of those edit 160 hours in and power wash simulator might be one of my favourite games ever it is so relaxing to play very replayable even if you know what to expect from the maps and the dev team have listened to a lot of community feedback during early access really excited to see where this goes now it s out of early access and in full release
