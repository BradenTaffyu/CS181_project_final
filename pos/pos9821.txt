2016 early access review so after quite a bit of playing i finally won a play through and i feel good about myself it all started with three colonists a builder a hunter and a farmer thanks to rng they had a beautiful valley surrounded by mountains they set up a very easily defendable choke point at the opening of the valley and it goes from there more people show up along the way and this colony thrives with little threat from raiders and limited spots for bugs to spawn they grow and grow then the diseases hit progress completely halts for days at a time as everyone becomes a doctor in order to survive eventually everyone save the janitor has 7 skill in medicine once the plagues let up the colony gets going again the hunter eventually becomes more robot than man often singlehandly taking out raiding parties with trusty sniper the colony starts enjoying their riches and builds and builds and builds until 21 people are swimming in silver and carpet not even the robots can touch them finally the colony is at a point where shipbuilding is a very real option and start the ground work getting 21 people into space isn t exactly easy on the steel bank eventually people start dying first to go died to a massive raiding party of over fifty pirates just their luck to have two separate factions attack at the same time the next two to go were caught outside when a pack of man eating boars ran between them and the valley our friend the hunter was also with them but he survived his injuries with only requiring a new eye to match his other bionic one after that came the bugs they had grown in a new spot this time one where they werent easily removed our brave hunter shot a hive full of fire and ran to wait out the aftermath the fire spread but it spread too far it felt like it was everywhere and it took the efforts of everyone just to limit the damage people were fighting both fire and bugs as well they could trying to protect the nearby hospital and medicine stash one by one colonists fell only to be pulled out of the fire and rushed to the medical beds they were trying to protect our humble builder ran through the fire trying to save his friend only to be attacked by one last vengeful bug their dual shall be talked about for ages punch after punch blow after blow they fought until the fire surrounded them with no way out our builder downed the megaspider and grabbed his fellow colonist desperate to make it through the flames but alas his wounds proved to much and he collapsed surrounded by fire his last deeds in vain as they went up in smoke the heavens themselves cried at his passing putting out the flames that had claimed three lives that day desperate to forge on the remaining colonist realized that if they dismantled their power grid they would have enough materials to finish the ship working as fast as they can all but two of the cryosleep pods were complete before raiders attacked taking advantage of the now seemingly defenseless colony seven raiders fell to well placed traps while seven more made it to the no longer functioning turrets time was running out and one colonist knew what she had to do calling all five of the colony s pet boars and their one turtle she charged into battle unbeknownst to the rest of the tribe and its supervisor with fire in her heart and steel in her soul our farmer tore into the remaining raiders dropping three of them in short succession with her bare hands she drove the raiders off buying the builders plenty of time to finish the ship ignoring her wounds she climbed into her pod saying goodbye to the brave boars and turtle that gave their lives that day with nothing left in the valley but the two remaining boars and enough food to last them till they die of old age the ship took off never to be seen again 10 10 would ride a herd of boar into battle again
