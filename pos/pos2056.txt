2021 i ve been playing this game off and on since around 2013 and i love every minute of it i am a huge bioware fan and sw fan i remember the first time i discovered this game and i fell in love with it right away although i do miss the old days where you actually had to grind for xp for anyone who hasnn t played this game i d say give it a chance each class has their own story which is fully voiced and like bw games you make choices that affect your story the classes are jedi knight you re the big hero jedi consular more of a diplomatic style trooper republic military story smuggler just like han solo i do find it tries to hard tobe funny on the imperial side you have sith warrior opposite of jk story revolves around you gaining more power through strength sith inquistor opposite of jc story revolves around gaining power through knowledge bounty hunter exactly as it sounds personally i didn t like the story and imperial agent a spy for the empire this here is by far the best story i highly suggest you save this class for last as it ties all the other stories together
