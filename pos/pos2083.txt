at first i played the demo i thought it was stale boring and slow but since i played other mana games growing up and trials of mana i preordered the deluxe edition from sheer nostalgia and because i m a sucker for jrpgs i looked at the posts about the criticisms of the game and also thought some of them were fair reason why they dont like the game or dont want to buy it i was regretting the preorder and wanted to cancel it because of my first statement but after playing about 18 hrs i m enjoying it the maps are huge the combat seems a lot better and more optimized than the demo and the world is beautiful that i started enjoying the game
