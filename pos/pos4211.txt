2017 after 465 hours in game i finally had time to write this review it s a great game if you care more about gameplay than graphics when m b series was originally released in 2007 it was a time when video games starts to become more casual and by 2010 when m b warband was released there are basically two types of games left either it s originally designed for casual gaming for consoles or it tries so hard on graphics to woo players that it basically rehash the gameplay very few developers had tried to innovate how rpg should be created and played and here comes mount blade warband designed on a already out of date directx api with few lightings to impress the crowd i had ignored this game for 4 years before finally getting it and i never regretted since this is the game that shows how sandbox games should be designed unlike the standard standbox games which were always using some rehashed mechanics tower captures endless spawned enmeis for no reason no sense of progression mount and blade series standed out as being the only game since 2010 that had acceptable graphics deep sense of rpg immersion and deep progression on all areas leveling a character should be designed not only just to increase some integer numbers strength agility charimsa goodness evilness and gold but it should also take into account of the player s actions not in the sense bioware had tried let s just change some dialogs if goodness evilness my actions in the game matters so greatly loot a villege steal some cattles keep ransoms for myself when i decided to start a kingdom i found out no one wanted to join my army every peasent charges obscene amount of gold for a simple sword and my kingdom lasted less than half a week it wasn t much latter i found out how being nice to people can be so rewarding in this game befriendly lords of good characters marry a nice lady and solidfy alliance join a faction and help out in wars in return for new land grants help villages and towns and it propspers to allow me to sell more at a higher price maintain good relations with village elders so i have a steady supply of new eager recruits work on leadership skills to unify units under my command once the king starts to get power hungry start a rebellion recruit the good and friendly and allied lords to my cause manage garrisons and taxations lead a military campaign to crush the tyrant and then have than play the diplomatic and military game to conquer the whole ancient europe i can do them all not only actions matter greatly the gameplay on how you perform the actions are so difficult and rewarding the battles are absolutely unforgiving at higher settings the only tools i have to work with are my own hands and eyes want to shoot the approaching band of armies click the mouse and aim except there is absolutely no aiming assistance both the enemies and my elite units are mounted and i only get one shot before having to spend 3 seconds to reload melee kills while mounted also took some time to master i have to wait until they are precise at the position where if i extend my polearm now at the end of my thrust it reaches precisely on the enemy medieval tactics are a much harder lessons to learn when to shieldwall when to use ranks when to hold and when to charge whether to attack or to defend and when things start to go well where to lay siege next when to start and when to end a military campaign so i can host feasts to improve morale and relations these are all hard questions we have to continue to contemplate in between individual battles and there is no other game in the world that has this great amount of depth the amazing combat gameplay and the rich rpg experience than this if you only have resource to play one rpg game and you like medieval themes then get this also i hope the m b2 is progressing well i can t wait to buy it
