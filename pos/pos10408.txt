2020 this is my honest and open review so please look at other reviews and watch youtube reviews gameplay to come to your own decision about this game after entering into the world of sim racing during the lockdown and purchasing a logitech g29 i dabbled with a few other games of varying disciplines from dirt 2 0 to project cars and i personally found that assetto corsa competizione is by far the best sim on the market for the price here s a brief list as to why pro s high graphical quality on each car and circuit unique handling for each car and the clear physical distinction between gt3 and gt4 cars total immersion and fidelity when racing wheel to wheel attention to detail such as tyre degradation to standing water across the track player ranking system which allows private servers to cap inexperienced players from ruining others races accidentally ability to use external vehicle skins although only visible to client and not server hosted real time weather and time of day effectscon s lack of public server filters lack of interest for the gt4 cars lack of explanation within car setups eg brake pad numbers lack of server tool support eg unable to change circuit without changing server config and restarting server basic ai which will collide with player if you re in anyway slower or in front of themthere is also so much more that i haven t included in this review which you ll find in game yourself and be utterly blown away by the shear attention to detail within the game or from other reviews i urge anyone to not enjoy a great battle for position with equally skilled opponents on iconic circuits like spa or mount panorama i would strongly advise racing in a league or organised events as this is the absolute best way to get the most out of this game just search online for racing events and leagues in your timezone and get stuck in for me the game isn t perfect and it has improved with patches and the inclusion of intercontinental circuits and gt4 class has increased it s replay ability the pro s far outweigh the cons when compared to other sims like iracing and it s hefty price tag
