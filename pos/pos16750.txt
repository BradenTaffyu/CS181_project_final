2021 if you are anything like me you enjoyed building in the sims far more than playing in the sims you enjoyed creative mode in minecraft because the best part of it isn t mining it s crafting designing building and creating house flipper is like that but even better it takes all the beauty and potential of sims building and makes it into a fully fledged game complete with support for community added items tasks to choose to complete or not and a soft relaxing game where you can do whatever you want whenever you want you can challenge yourself to create the most beautiful or the wackiest of houses or you can just sit back and enjoy the endless potential of flipping houses with the risk physical demand or monetary requirements of real life house flipping this game is definitely an all time favorite of mine and it very well could be for you too
