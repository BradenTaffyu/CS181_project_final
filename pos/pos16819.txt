2019 i was going to write a review about house flipper but waited for the garden flipper dlc to come out and just put everything in one review i love house flipper and the garden flipper dlc made me love it even more with a few comments for house flipper there is so much that you can do to a home but some things i wish they would include would be to make additions to a home for example a home you can buy in the new garden flipper dlc is only one bedroom to be able to install a loft add panels to the outside of a home that make it look like a log cabin not just brick or siding place cabinets or shelves inside of the wall to create more room utilize more space in small homes change the roof tiles to a different color and or style metal or shingle etc for garden flipper add in a lawn mower please the one currently will do but i feel that a lawn mower would speed things up be able to put koi fish in the pond or any other pond dwelling fish place climbing roses onto items like a trellis or a pergola be able to place a bird feeder onto a tree install a tree house have the ability to remove a tree after it was planted not just sell the plant and try again include more types of trees white birch pine etc not just fruit trees and some decorative smaller ones put in an in ground pool add in the ability to place a green house or a sun room include more types of flowers cosmos foxglove azalea etc be able to add a deck onto a homethat is all i can think about for know overall i love both games and highly recommend them if i can think of anything else i update the review
