2018 so i have been playing this game for over 100 hours and i felt like writing a review first of all this game is a lot of fun to play with my friends and i really like the fact that i can create and customize my own servers secondly i would like to go over the upsides and downsides upsides fun with friends many people can join can create and customize your own servers fun mods to mess around with lots of things to craft and build fun dlc s downsides maps are too small connection isn t always the best small glitches more commands would be niceoverall opinion i love this game and it belongs to my favourites its easy and relaxing its worth its pricei d rate it a 9 5 10 there s always room for improvements but its damn near perfect
