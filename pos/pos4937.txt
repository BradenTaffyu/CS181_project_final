2015 this is my personal opinion containing to story spoilers i had very high expectations for fallout 4 and hoped for the best with all the hype bethesda made up the the release as with fallout 3 and fallout new vegas the fallout series has shifted from a hardcore rpg into a more shooter based rpg sadly ruining a couple of mechanics in the game i was skeptical with the voice protagonist and while the voice actors certainly did a good job it just doesn t feel like it fits the game the enemies have gotten improved ai they can now flank you as well as trying to go to cover making fights seem overall harder v a t s has been improved and acts more like slowing time than freezing it the environment and the level design is very pleasing and it has a ton of detail packed into it bethesda really did a good job on this part with increasing the areas and locations you can enter weapon customization and crafting has been improved a lot and now seems endless in options while the interface for weapons and armor crafting works well the crafting of housing materials etc is sadly quite clunky you can also modify each piece of power armor you can increase its effectiveness in various ways and also paint your power armor the graphics has never been a priority in the fallout series but the visual style and graphics of fallout 4 makes the game look spectacular and unique in it s own little way with improved graphics such as lighting and water effects the game runs smoothly so far i haven t encountered any bug or glitch and overall it seems very well optimized compared to fallout 3 and skyrim but do take note that it is a good idea to edit the ini files for a better fov and fixing the mouse accel which seems to be an engine problem the sounds in fallout 4 are absolutely amazing from the great classical music on the radio to the various ambient sounds heard in wasteland to a large and stunning soundtrack by inon zur the new dialogue system doesn t really work well and it feels like you re playing a game of russian roulette since you don t get a clue of what your character is about to say so far only charisma has an impact on speech options unlike in fallout 3 where strength and intelligence also had an impact sadly the karma system has been completely removed i thought the alignment system was a great element to the game hopefully someone will make a mod to add this to the game so you once again can be lawful evil or chaotic good to put it simple this is my game of the year
