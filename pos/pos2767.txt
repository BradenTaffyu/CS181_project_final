2020 when i see games with overwhelmingly positive reviews i go in with pretty high expectations i ve been wanting to try this for a while but really didn t think it was for me for those sheltered folks like me who stick to the same old type of games and are really unsure about this one with turn based combat etc go for it i can t believe i waited so long to try it it isn t just a game it s a pure work of art it s the first time i ve truly felt the option to be a bad guy and kill everyone and the story will support that it s just well and truly fantastic the turn based combat isn t what i thought it s brilliant edit 76 hours in now it just gets better so excited to finish the story and replay with a different character i want to add i m playing this co op so if you re looking for a lockdown co op game this is it edit 125 incredible hours later and i m almost in tears what a beautiful beautiful specimen of a game i just cannot explain in words how great this is lohse s song wow i can t wait to play through it again on a different character a new story unbelievable game
