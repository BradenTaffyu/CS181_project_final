2021 i was initially reluctant to pick up this game due to the translation issues that it suffered under when it was first released but i finally nabbed it on sale and i m glad i did it s the most entertaining tactical rpg i ve played in a long time the setting can perhaps best be described as dungeonpunk featuring both modern guns futuristic robots fantasy style monsters people with swords who are somehow still tactically viable and esp abilities that might as well be magic it feels like a blend of the best features from xcom style tactical games with a two move system half or full cover suppressive fire and flanking combined with the kind of melee combat dodge and counter mechanics and spectacular super moves you d expect from something like final fantasy tactics or disgaea the megacity setting and your team being composed of unique characters rather than randomly generated or customized and thus ultimately generic members as you d see in the mainline xcom games invokes the recent xcom chimera squad in particular only far less buggy somehow despite this being produced by a small indie studio rather than a big name publisher go figure the story and gameplay both offer an appealingly slow burn experience where new features and options are drip fed to you as you progress through the story with things like skill research side quests story mission replay crafting class changes customizeable robot companions and tameable monsters all being gradually introduced along with a growing number of playable characters each with unique skills abilities and mysterious pasts it nicely prevents that thing where you feel like the first hour of a complex game is just you sitting through tutorial after tutorial getting dragged through scripted scenarios and forced to click on stuff in order to demonstrate how everything works well there s still some of that but after two short tutorial missions you re granted steadily greater freedom to pick your own missions while occasionally receiving an intermission that introduces a new element which at that point feels like a reward rather than an imposition another unusual feature i d like to draw attention to is the police support basically since the game has you playing as effectively a kind of privatized police unit you will be supported by regular generic police units in most missions it adds a lot of tactical depth and makes your own units with all their fancy esp powers or dramatic talent feel a lot more special since they re often fighting alongside generic troops with regular work a day weapons you also need to weigh the support these troops are able to provide against the fact that you re going to profit a lot more in the long term from having your team do the take downs rather than the troops on top of that some missions offer tactical decisions concerning the distribution of those generic troops as well as your own letting you do stuff like devoting them to securing a checkpoint sending some off in another direction to launch a pincer attack or reaching an isolated group of officers in order to take command and add them to your own forces for the duration in other words it adds a lot of tactical and strategic depth to the missions as well as making you feel on a narrative level as if you are part of something larger just one small band of troubleshooters helping to protect a huge city now while i have much praise for this game it s not without its drawbacks the translation has been much improved since launch mostly with help from the fans but it s still not great especially the early tutorials those can be pretty winceworthy most of the time the occasionally poor wordings or messy grammar is just an annoyance but in some cases the ability descriptions or achievement text can leave you genuinely questioning how they work the game is also still plagues by some technical issues though honestly by today s standards it isn t bad at all and more importantly the dev team is the most dedicated devoted and hard working i ve ever seen the game is still getting patched regularly and anytime a serious issue crops up it s corrected within a day or two any issues bugs or confusions that are raised on the forums also tends to draw a developer response with unbelievable speed with that kind of customer service i m personally willing to forgive a lot of small issues so give it a chance dash into the middle of a gang of psionic cultist with a sword while a heavily armored police swat unit lays down covering fire for you and your buddy snipes their support mage with a well placed lightning bolt it s a blast and if the subtitles are at times imperfect just pretend it s an old hong kong flick with poor dubbing and take it as part of the charm p
