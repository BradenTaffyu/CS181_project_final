early access review i have around 350 hours on the blacksmith platform migrated to steam today dark and darker is the most hardcore and skill rewarding session based action extraction game on the market and if hardcore e g souls like is fun for you then it s an amazing experience a lot of newbies die literally to the first npc monsters they meet not because they are insanely strong but because it takes actual game knowledge and experience to run around and clear them with ease map layout a bunch of meta and non meta builds for each class spacing movement and item usage tricks understanding and properling utilizing all of those allows you to express your skills in pvp heavy environment duos and trios are the best as opposed to solo runs as they provide that additional team synergy and coordination fun devs speed and dedication to bugfixing and adjusting the balance is amazing too they tweak different class abilities all the time improve the matchmaking and introduce new content maps classes at regular intervals and you can have a taste of the main gameplay for free that s the best deal you can get just make sure to bring some friends to share your initial frustration from newbie deaths d and as you improve the fun of successful survival
