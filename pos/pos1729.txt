2017 i urge you to go into this game as blind as possible of course this game is not perfect so i will start out by listing some of the issues the pc port has problems with fullscreen resolution the far mod can help with this dodging when using k m controls is clunky i recommend playing with a controller i experienced a bit of popping in of environmental assets the hacking mini game that becomes very prevalent later on in the game can be frustrating some of the sidequests are rather tedious a certain quest in the desert comes to mind no auto save remember to save oftenhowever these are in my opinion massively outweighed by the positives the combat is crisp and feels very statisfying when you get good at it most boss battles feel very epic shifts seamlessly between different gameplay styles hack slash side scroller bullet hell beautiful and varied scenery asks philosophical questions without coming off as pretentious intriguing setting and fleshed out world that ties into yoko taro s previous works main characters are likeable and have good development the plot is interesting and gets quite emotional multiple endings absolutely phenomenal soundtrack final credits are ingeniousoverall nier automata was an incredible experience and one of the best games i have ever played
