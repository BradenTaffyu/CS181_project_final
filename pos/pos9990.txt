2016 early access review 14 hours2 days2 games2 devastated coloniesyou are not meant to beat this game this game is meant to beat you once you are exicted to see how happy your colony is and thinking hmm this is kind of a breeze the word turns against you in unthinkable ways i highly recommend this game if you are a dwarf fortress player as i am and are accustomed to watching your fortress crumble before your eyes as you helplessly gaze at the screen thinking did this just really happen this game is not for you if you enjoy games like the sims where everything is lovey dovey and little suzie becomes queen of the ball or something ain t happening in rim world it is out to get you
