2022 one of my favorite games i d say i can lose myself just drifting around and often just take my time once in awhile i ll pick it up again and just coast i m in no rush to complete the story even with the new stuff that s come out the music is great and peaceful the story is kinda sad i d think and i believe the loneliness is really felt in this game idk man i just really like it
