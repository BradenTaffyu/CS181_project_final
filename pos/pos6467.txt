2021 tl dr trucks go vrooooom i won t pretend to know anything about trucks retarders air brakes or trailer stability and i ve never been in an actual truck but i felt drawn by this game i bought it on a whim in a bundle with a few dlcs at the beginning of 2021 when my mind was elsewhere in a space between nowhere and anywhere else map expansions were beyond the baltic sea going east and scandinavia along with heavy cargo pack high power cargo pack and cabin accessories an ets 2 storywhat i thought would be a curious and sporadic dive into trucking and highways turned into many hours of taking the longest possible hauls chilling and meditating as the kilometers zoomed by accompanied by my favorite radio or a post rock soundtrack it turned into a window to another reality a life never lived it turned into driving into the unknown charting all the roads and seeing all the sights in this wonderful diorama of europe where you don t need vaccine certificates to travel when i started i was confounded by all the options on offer there s an ocean of things you can adjust from gameplay options where you can turn a casual sim into a hardcore driving simulation to many button or key assignments and game preferences audio setup deserves a special mention with 16 options to fiddle with you can adjust sound levels of individual truck and ambient sounds fine tuning until your ears are satisfied with all the noise reaching them and your brain hums along with the engine i ve played this in the most plebeian way possible mouse keyboard controller occasionally and a single monitor but the control settings allow for using wheels pedals multiple monitors and even tobii eye tracking visual settings also offer numerous options for tinkering hiatus a screenshot of euro truck simulator 2 by quirky custodian the game starts you in a country of your choice with no truck of your own and you must work and drive for others until you can afford one that means only quick jobs from the market with rented equipment or you could get a bank loan i drove toiled and sweated for companies in norway until i got some experience under my belt and saved enough for a shiny new truck there are seven truck manufacturers and plenty of truck variations that can be further customized with many options and parts but i settled for a yellow volvo fh classic sleeper there was no reasoning behind it other than that i liked the way it looked and with the real adventure started it became my chill out zone and my retreat into the diorama for over 200 hours i ve plumbed the depths of the cargo market and external contracts that you can use if you link an optional free world of trucks account to the game broke many laws and violated many red lights and wrong ways while scouring every inch of the map hauling cargo the longest possible route i could find careful with the cargo one way for a safe delivery free spirited the other way just driving around enjoying the roads looking for sights and discovering miniature versions of cities that consist of a few houses or buildings landmarks if the city has any and a lot of company lots garages and resting spots neon hotel lights became my best friends all the past lights a screenshot of euro truck simulator 2 by quirky custodian countryside always fared much better offering among other things balloons monuments strange statues fighter jets on pedestals old castles and forts windmills and verdant fields the game is capable of producing some seriously stunning and breathtaking moments of sightseeing in all my travels one constant companion was the game s mostly pedestrian traffic with moments of profound cosmic loss of self leading to weird occurrences i ve witnessed freak highway accidents cluttered roundabouts like some tangled caterpillars and some questionable driving ethics that led to crashes the only penalty for any violation is an instant fine and a percentage increase in damage for your truck which stays visually in pristine condition the game features no visible damage on vehicles i can t remember when i hired my first company driver and started dabbling in logistics truck and trailer customizations her name is ella and she s now probably a more skilled driver than me with maximized points in multiple of the game s six trucking skills she s definitely the highest earner i stopped hauling cargo and just drive around searching for sights unseen sporadically glancing at a blue news ticker telling me what the rest of my 29 drivers are doing and how much money they made or lost due to a bad trip my company keeps growing 17 garages for now some stand empty until i find the drivers satisfying my standards most are dotted with various truck and trailer combinations hauling cargo all over europe and parts of russia the one in oslo holds my first yellow volvo truck resting peacefully he deserves it i ve bought a new beefier larger volvo truck i liked the sound the engine made with my current audio settings on one of the recent trips i stopped at a resting stop in the middle of germany to get some sleep and had the weirdest dream even a nightmare of breaking free from the diorama and soaring over the map buildings and forests turned into cardboard cutouts gaping black voids opened between cities traffic disappeared into nowhere water floated in mid air and my mind kept thinking how easily shattered the illusion of the world is i awoke with a start right before two identical humanlike dolls on bicycles almost ran me over on the bank of a levitating river if this is all an illusion a scam it is still a splendidly crafted scam i ascribed my chaotic thoughts to lack of sleep not enough food and never looked back all my wanderings and sleepless nights run on an i7 7700 rtx2070 32gb of ram an ssd and in 1080p 60 in spite of occasionally weird traffic i ve encountered no serious issues no falling through the void symptoms no slowdowns and the simulation never crashed the loading times are fast and there aren t many of them i ve noticed some slight visual glitches but nothing really immersion breaking i was running the realistic graphics mods v5 2 by frkn64 but i removed it when scs pushed a lighting overhaul the only mods i use now are fael environment v3 1 for improved foliage and sisl s mega pack for cabin accesories and less lonely nights escapism a screenshot of euro truck simulator 2 by quirky custodian i still haven t seen and heard all the sights and sounds of the current map and scs software keeps adding more and improving and reworking older parts visuals included yes each part is a dlc but a dlc that adds huge chunks of europe and new things to haul transport see and explore and new achievements to earn i don t think they intend to stop any time soon it s incredibly impressive what s on offer in this game or dare i say way of life and it s often on sale with bundles to get your road not taken started eventually we must all find our quietest place in the loudest ones ets2 was and still is mine perhaps it can become yours as well p s i still don t know what a retarder is more off the beaten path games wonders and failures at the cabinet of curiosities follow the average achievement hunter curator for reviews and useful information on steam achievements lots of achievements many of them time consuming nothing troublesome or hard but every content dlc is required for 100 and new content is coming regularly
