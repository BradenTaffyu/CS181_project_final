2017 early access review i see people complaining that there is no point to the game other than trying to design a system and i can t really argue against that i just want to give a personal positive review for those folks that enjoy designing systems just for the sake of it this game is really great for that for me it scratches a bit of the factorio itch but in its own charming way the devs are also adding new dynamics to the game fairly regularly which is encouraging price point seems fair as well recommended to folks that enjoy system management
