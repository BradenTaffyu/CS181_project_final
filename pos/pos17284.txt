2020 rating the game itself is very good it has its bad sides but the biggest problem is the dlc policy review as a kid i dreamed of a heroes of might and magic game with real time battles well this game isn t exactly it but it s fairly close in my opinion technically the game is quite excellent it s a few years old already but it looks very good both in the world map and in combat the terrain is beautiful the structures armies and magic all look good unfortunately you most likely can t enjoy it all but i ll get to that later same can be said about the sounds i find them excellent as well all the sounds of battle shouts roars magic and voice acting sound great the music is also quite excellent and creates immersion of a massive fantasy battle very well but again you most likely can t enjoy it all now there is one bad thing i have to say about the technical side and that is the load times i have a quite fast ssd and the game still has pretty long load times and i can only imagine how painful it would be with a old hdd well the game does have a lot of things to process so it s kinda understandable but it s still annoying what about the gameplay well the campaign map is pretty great actually this part of the game is turn based you move your armies and heroes on the map build your cities and each faction has their unique things it has some improvements over the first game and things generally just work better there is far less hero spam from the ai and the cat and mouse game is not so bad anymore it s nice to think builds for your lords heroes and i like how units get experience like in all total war games so the campaign map works nicely it just gets out of hand later when you have a lot of provinces and characters to micromanage but the combat of the game that is honestly the worst part of the game in my opinion or rather the controls are just bad and it becomes tedious to play when you have more than one army to control the battles are played in real time and each army has 20 pieces to move they can be single units like heroes or big monsters or they can be large groups of units like 100 swordsmen but uh there s like no attack move command and the units are brainless like they just stand there even if their friends next to them get attacked they do nothing now i would understand this behavior if you ordered the units to stand ground and the game does have a guard stance for this but the default stance honestly feels like warcraft 1 or something the armies just stand there and get killed if you don t micromanage everything and the problem is later you will have so many stacks to move that microing it all becomes hellish why can t they have even basic ai like move to help the guys next to you or don t just stand there if you re getting shot you could just put the guard stance on if you wanted them to stay there and do nothing it also doesn t help that the battles are fast once the armies clash it won t take long before one side is either dead or retreating if the battles were slower you would have more time to micromanage individual stacks now it just falls apart like a house of cards another bad thing about the fast battles is that you can t really look at the battle your armies are like ants running around you can t enjoy the graphics you have to just micromanage your stacks as quickly as you can from a birds eye view and the thing is when you zoom in close the game actually opens up a lot you will see the beautiful graphics for what they are there s great animations blood and limbs flying and all and there are sounds that you can t hearwhen you play normally there s lively shouting battle cries monster roars and such these create immersion heavily but the problem is if you play the game as it s intended you will never hear these so the game wastes a lot of potential by poor controls and fast battles well the controls do work in quick battles and when small armies clash but in the campaign army sizes get out of control fast other bad stuff the game also lacks an autocombat system i m not talking about the campaign map autoresolve the thing i m talking about is a system where you could just watch the battle and enjoy the things i mentioned before well warhammer 2 wasn t in the first game allows you to put some of your reinforcements does not work always under ai control but the system is lackluster and does not give you the option to actually like press a button and just watch the battle luckily there is a mod for this the spectator mod this is simply essential for me it lets me enjoy the game a lot more than just trying to fight myself with the horrible controls why isn t such a system included in the base game finishing thoughts the game is most fun early game when the armies are smaller microing units is less painful then and magic is impactful later when the armies are massive that one buff will do nearly nothing problem is that the game swirls out of control too soon and you start just clicking that autoresolve because the battles won t be enjoyable anymore due to massive army sizes well they are enjoyable if you just use the spectator mode and watch them but playing them yourself meh i wish there were smaller maps scenarios available where the game would stay smaller in scale less heroes less armies less towns to micromanage seriously it gets tedious when you have to level up a dozen or more characters every turn now the dlc policy is awful well on the other hand it s good that they still make more content for the game but there s alot of dlc for the game the cost of the game ramps up really fast for new players and the base game is just not enough this is especially true when you consider that to get the full experience you also need to own the first warhammer game and its dlcs so essentially you need to buy two expensive games both of which have a ton of fairly expensive dlc despite all the ranting i still think total war warhammer ii is a very good game it just has its share of problems if you like strategy games you should get it from sale it is a very expensive thing to get though as i mentioned before to get the full experience you also need to buy the first game and all its dlc summary the good very good looking immersive sounds if you zoom in excellent music tons of factions if you buy everything building up your heroes and leveling armies is coolthe bad combat controls ai loading times dlc policy requires modding for autocombat
