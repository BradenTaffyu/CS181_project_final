2020 early access review honestly this game is a blast i ve not had this much fun with a cartoon style game in ages and that says something to be honest it does need a lot of work to become the game i hope it to become but for what it is right now it is super fun the new additions of animals and larger islands really help make it all start to come together the recipes and the intensity of the game play really bring out the fun side of survival weather it be a solo play through or a multiplayer play through it s a very fun game i have watched the storyline for the game come together from the beginning where all we had was a radio tower with nothing really noticeable being in it to a full blown story island filled with honey and bears and large towers with plenty of notes and story to follow i would love to see where they take it from here
