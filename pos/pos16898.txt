2015 early access review now that the multiplayer update is out i figured i would go ahead and make a review of the game now that it s mostly completed the short answer if you like strategy games or are fascinated by the idea of creating your own pathogen to destroy humanity buy this game especially during a sale the details the base game is a genetic strategy game where your goal is to infect the world and destory it before they can do the same to you it offers plenty of options for doing so and the game is simple enough in the lower difficulties for newcomers to get a basic idea of what to do but in harder difficulties it is challenging enough for even veteran players to have a difficult challenge the game has many different plague types and modes to try including user created plagues the multiplayer mode is also fun sporting many strategies that counter other strategies with quite a bit of depth would advise against newcomers to the game from playing that mode first as it is much more intense of an experience compared to the main game against friends or randoms the multiplayer is a great addition to an already great game i ve played this game ever since 2012 whenever the game first started out on mobile devices and there was only 6 plagues and 3 difficulties this game has kept my attention and still manages to be a fun distraction and experience to come back to time and time again so if you seem at all interested pick it up it s a strategy game that s worth the price p s this game will make you hate greenland you will understand why
