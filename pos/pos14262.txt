2021 early access review hey you yes you what are you doing right now is it literally nothing because the world is on fire and everything is trash well now at least one thing isn t trash and that thing is dyson sphere program do you like efficiency and careful planning you spend the first 20 hours making a slapdash jackson pollack inspired factory and then spend the next 20 hours pulling your hair out while you burn the entire thing down and start from scratch why the are my overflow storage units causing a backup in my production line strap the in for an intense 45 minute trouble shoot em up experience before you figure out that the problem was that your iq was barely above room temperature and or you were high while you were building this then after all that realize that it s 4am and that this is the 3rd night in a row that you ve done this dyson sphere program falls short of some of the grittier aspects of its peers specifically satisfactory but what it lacks in grit it more than makes up for in disrespecting your time and being one of the more addictive engineering games i ve played in a long time 9 10 slapsp s the english localization is laughably bad in a lot of places but it s funny literally every single time so i hope they never fix it
