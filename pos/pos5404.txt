2017 early access review realized i haven t written a review for this game yet after nearly 70 hours of playing it saying it s phenomenal is an understatement of the highest caliber but seriously this game has such a great sense of world and space that you feel like you re living in a breathing functioning world it s weird and dangerous and funny and horrifying and i ve yet to find anything else anywhere close to it also checking back in after a few months and hearing music which i had set to max on accident scared the piss out of me
