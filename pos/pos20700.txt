2023 single player complete game nearly bug free no micro transactions engaging story and harry potter it took 40 hours to finish the campaign as i honestly wanted to explore every corner of the map you can play stealth persuasion or just run in spells blazing i didn t want the story campaign to end after completing it there is still some stuff to do but it does get boring pretty quick crafting base building potion making are all just ok but at least present overall a worthwhile purchase especially if on sale
