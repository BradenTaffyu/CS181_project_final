2021 i ve played american truck simulator for 420 8 hours now and i think its safe to say that this is an amazing game bugs aside i think the scenery is absolutely breathtaking and with the great mod community you can almost find every single thing you can ask for from cabin accessories and graphics mods to an entire multiplayer system i personally think this game has one of the greatest mod communities but the greatness doesn t stop there aside from the sub par graphics the publishers scs software are constantly pushing updates and support for the game so you don t have the worry about bugs not getting fixed or crashes not getting resolved also if you play euro truck simulator 2 you can expect similar game play with vast support for controllers and steering wheels as well as tons of truck customization something i don t like is that when you want to drive a truck that s not in your home garage it will spawn the truck in your home garage instead of spawning you at the garage in which its located but that s pretty much it
