2021 early access review i am a gunslinger i brandish a pistol in each hand my mutant origins have blessed me with a preternatural fleetness of foot a power of persuasion over creatures i meet and the ability to think a wall of force into existence i am on approach to the sleepy agrarian relatively safe town of joppa i nod to the watervine farmers as i pass i cross over the threshold of the town and set to work i ve been here fifty times in past lives i know each villager s motives i know where each of them stores their valuables i blow through town leaving their merchant a little bit the richer and the rest of them much the poorer i descend into the first of qud s titular caves the first thing i come across is a cave bear battling a bat i beguile the bear he serves me now and only me a crack from one of my revolvers drops the bat but this transgression summons down the wrath of the rest of them a few peals of thunder later my bear and i are ringed by bat corpses i reload and we push deeper into the caves we encounter a few snapjaws hyena like humanoid creatures one of them seems out of place this doesn t save it from the wrath of my revolvers however on its body i find a two handed fullerite maul a weapon this powerful shouldn t exist within one hundred parasangs of joppa i holster my revolvers and take up the weapon the bear and i press northward to the cave of redrock we ve been tasked by a villager to pursue the source of their recent woes a creature that is feeding on their watervine crops we battle our way down through a few levels of the cave system when suddenly a blast of fire erupts in our midst through the flames i can see a strange pink snapjaw it is a firesnarler i learn a rare snapjaw cursed with the power of pyrokinesis a long line of my past lives unrolls in front of my eyes like past avatars they warn me that i must not panic only by thinking through my every move will i survive i make for the stairs and ascend my bear is with me but its fur is aflame i pull out a waterskin and pour it over the bear water is money in qud and this bear will prove to be costly we set our quest aside for now we head back to joppa dejectedly but on our way we discover a derelict staircase descending into some unknown ruins we take up the challenge and quickly regret it as soon as my foot touches the floor i hear the telltale sound of projectiles whizzing past with a glance i see thirst thistles plants that fire desiccating barbs in a land where fresh water is the greatest rarity one such a plant is a dire threat here we face three of them we bolt up the stairs and limp the rest of the way to joppa each of us half mummified what a site it must have been a gunslinger slumped against the wall of the village elder s hut sharing drams of water with a bear five times his size like two hobos sharing a bottle of wine we leave town again and push east in search of whatever treasures and trinkets we might find we cross paths with a pack of itenerant apes and their worshippers we stop to trade then bid them good fortune somewhere along the way i pick up a wide brimmed hat stylish and i grow an extra pair of arms useful we find another opening into the earth and descend once more into the caves of qud we are in some sort of a room devices of the old ones shed artificial light bookshelves line the walls and fresh water pools on the floor i rush forward to scoop it up with an aluminum flask when i realize my folly the sound of a gunshot rings in my ear and i feel my side pierced the past lives whisper again i must not panic think and survive i look up and see an automated turret i duck behind cover again and catch my breath this time i m prepared i swing around the corner and before the turret fires i summon a wall of force between us and it the turret fires in vain i control the force wall which means i make the rules i fire my revolvers flickering the wall just long enough for my slugs to pass through it i beat the turret at its own game and it now lies in a heap the bear and i climb out of the ruin with a mighty haul of fresh water and lead slugs for our troubles this is qud these are its caves one of them will be the death of me but what a story it will be
