from now on when people ask me what a 40k game should be i will point them at this it nails the feel and environment there s some bugs still at the writing of this review but not as bad as there use to be as far as i ve heard as for things i think could improve the game 1 a better breakdown and guidance of class function and intentions 2 load out saving there s a point in the game where all your items are taken from you which lead to me spending nearly an hour sorting through my inventory to try and find everything everyone used to be equipped with 3 better indicating if gear is an upgrade or not i ve spent too much time comparing one bolter to another to determine which is the better one
