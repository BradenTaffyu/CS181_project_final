2018 don t you hate when you re clipping nails and they always fall into keyboard cracks the time has come all who were waiting for a theme hospital successor finally got it two point studios with some ex theme hospital developers brings you two point hospital it s basically a theme hospital remake at least it feels that way the game plays pretty much the same as theme hospital it s a simple management game just what i wanted you build rooms train your staff manage prices wages and trying to cure as many patients as possible i love the simplicity you choose the room and build it no need to waste time on electricity or sewer systems like in some other games i know it adds realism but not all games needs it i love prison architect but i hate the building system in that game it s too complicated i love how easy and simple building your hospital is and if you want to change something you can easily edit the room no need to destroy anything after building the rooms you need to make your hospital attractive you can place plants posters vending machines and many other things to achieve that staff has different traits like stupid trait or weak bladder trait all the people in your hospital also have needs they need to eat use toilet and stay energized so you need to pay attention to their needs to keep them happy you also need to keep your hospital clean and attractive so that when health inspector comes he would say only good things about your hospital and it s all about management you need to keep an eye on everything trying to please everyone could be challenging patients will die you ll fail the objectives just learn from your mistakes you can also by land to expand your hospital when you run out of space some people those who probably don t know what theme hospital is expected this to be a serious simulator you won t find it here the game is meant to be simple and funny illnesses are fictional like bed face caused by sleeping at bad angle or lightheadedness when patient s head becomes a light bulb and it must be changed with a new head there are few dozens of funny illnesses when patient dies it doesn t end there he can come back as a ghost and haunt your hospital so you need a janitor who can catch the ghost not everyone is capable of doing that so choose your janitors wisely and the whole game is like that it s funny you laugh at people dying like a patient realizes he s gonna die soon he changes his clothes comes out of the room and dies firing staff is so sad it could make you cry it s a hard choice to make but sometimes you need to do this terrible decision new stuff is unlocked with kudosh points you receive them for completing objectives you can even unlock a purple bench it s a bench but it s purple you can also upgrade your equipment do you remember those announcements yep they re back and they will make you laugh they also added a radio station music may not the best it fits the theme nicely but it s really boring commercials on the other hand are great you should listen to them the game has also a nice online integration you can compete against your friends see the leaderboards and compare your stats against theirs and of course try to beat them another feature is online challenges you can challenge your friends to treat as many patients as you can for example graphically the game is really nice in a cute way graphics design is similar to planet coaster but not as good that game really has the best looking humans ever in the genre because there s no facial expressions but despite that humans look really good in this game environment looks pretty well too everything is detailed and is nice to look at it could be better but there s nothing to complain about from the artistic point of view game looks great graphically performance is great game runs smooth on max settings didn t encounter any issues so far judging from the minimum requirements this game should be toaster friendly so even if you have an old pc or the cheapest 300 one it should run fine this game has not many negatives ai could be better staff while resting stands up from the sofa and sits down again immediately and they do that few times in a row or people who are thirsty ignore the fact that there re 3 drink machines around them not a negative but it would be nice if the game had a first person option where you could walk around your hospital and please pretty please give us the option turn off the hud get this game if you love management games and want to laugh while playing the price is just right i don t get why so many people complain about the price it s half the price of aaa game and there were 25 40 pre order discounts everywhere there s a lot of content and ways to build your hospital which will keep you occupied for some time also this game will improve your mood something bad happened today you re sad you just realized you have a monobrow illness play this and your mood will improve but don t expect deep and realistic simulation if you want that i suggest waiting for other hospital game which is coming soon thank you two point studios and sega for bringing this game to us now go and make two point park and two point movies pros cute graphicsfunnysimple fun gameplaycons minor ai issuesboring musicmy curator page
