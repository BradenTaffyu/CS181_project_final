i have a mixed feelings about magic the gathering as anyone who have been playing the games for 20years on and off will have so i will start with the good and follow up with the bad the client is for the most part very smooth and quick maybe even the best card game client out there which to be fair though does not say that much the main good thing about magic arena is that it is realistic to play as a free player and still have fun though as the original fomo p2w game magic the gathering have adopted similar monetization to mobile games though for the most part this is in the mild end compared to competition to play the game for free on the highest levels at an even playing field is possible but not trivial you will have enough resources in game to play a draft approximately twice a week and more if you have a above average win rate as a new magic player expect the competition to be fierce even at the lowest brackets it is possible to play constructed formats with an even playing field if you are able to select one meta deck and play with that in one format however as a free to play player do not expect to be able to make more than one tier 1 deck in a season which brings me to the ugly part of magic arena they ban a lot of cards and while you might get compensated for lost cards all the supporting cards in that deck will have to be written off i tend to take year long breaks from magic before coming back again and my last break was triggered by losing decks i had heavily invested in twice in a row because of bans after spending 100 s of euros in the early life of magic arena i have now decided to play it for free when i feel like it and keep my purchases to paper magic
