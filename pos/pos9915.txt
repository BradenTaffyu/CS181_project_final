2021 bought a cat from a luxury goods trader my colonists enjoyed the time with the cat and it really raised the overall mood the cat eventually wanders around and finds the self brewed booze quickly drinking it before passing out outside while a bear decided it was hungry for some cat meat long story short my colonists rescued the cat killed the bear and made a new bed from its fur for their cat which was now an alcoholic so yeah this game ain t called a story generator for no reason while the base game offers a lot to do mods can expand and enhance your experience by great lengths
