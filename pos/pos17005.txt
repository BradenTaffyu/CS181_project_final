2020 wow finally a game worth buying with dlc that are like the expansion packs of old i gave up on total war games after the mess that was the pre purchase debacle of rome 2 with this game they have redeemed themselves a fantastic immersive game that has kept me busy during the covid 19 lock down on my brothers advice i bought tw wh1 to get more content for this i then bought all the dlc i was so impressed i can not decide what is best the beautiful well scaped campaign map or these detailed monsters units of the tactical battles both are breathtakingly handsome the game runs a massive map with almost 100 empires clans is still fast smooth between turns i think if you enjoyed age of wonders 1 3 you would love this same as if you enjoyed the other tw series this adds so much more with the magic monsters flying beasts it also has a hint of heroes of might magic to it a good mix of all games way better that civ vi the dlc is to be commended for what felt like a little money compared with paradox s dlc i got amazing well scoped races with almost every feature being unique it felt like the old expansion packs you used to get when games where still on disks where you got like a new game but similar the pirates had me travelling around the map digging for treasures with clues that really made you think hard at the same time loved it because i found so much detail on the map i hadn t seen before the norse add on had me travelling around hunting wild monsters that i could capture recruit it was the same game but with a whole different focus really really loving this game i actually want to thank the creators for bringing back to games something that has been missing for a long time a good mix of graphics content story on a no problems platform
