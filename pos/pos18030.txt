2017 i have played medieval ii shogun ii and rome ii for over 100 hours each at least each game is spectacular rome ii is spectacular the team has once again done a wonderful job recreating the era to give a real immersive feel to it each game has slightly different mechanics and those are personal preference rome ii for example has you recruit soldiers through generals instead of settlments but after 2 3 hours of learning any total war game you feel right at home my favourite part of rome ii is how they added so many factions to the map this creates a unique play through every time you start a new game the downside to me though is that not enough of these factions are playable considering how many factions are around at the start of the game it does feel a bit like you are getting ripped off when you see the small amount of factions you can choose to play however this is only my real critcism of the game along with that the only other thing i would change is bringing back the family tree aspect from medieval ii i give this game a 4 4 5the reason for that score is because it s nearly a perfect game but the lack of factions loses it a half point and the tiny wish that the family tree was reintroduced loses it 0 1 of the 3 total war games i have played i put this one behind medieval ii and ahead of shogun ii
