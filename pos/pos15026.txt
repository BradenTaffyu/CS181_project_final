2014 early access review although i ve only played it for about 3 hours here s what i can tell 1 the gamethere is minimal lag and you do not need the hassle of port forwarding and hamachi and all that it s already set up aswell the game is great and well balanced for multiplayer 2 communitythe community is friendly and most of the time people will band together and make settlements 4 hands are better than 2 i find that we all get together at night make food and plan on what we will do tommarow wether it be gathering food building walls and traps or sending a small group of 3 to hunt down a large monster or to go out and gather more bushes grass and saplings 3 consthe game goes a bit too fast sometimes what sould have taken around 100 days turns into something you do in the first month aswell food although still a problem is nearly non existant when you have someone that gathers rabbits and berries in the morning this goes for health aswell as bees seem to be someone s top priority if you are not dumb or take something on too tough for you you will never die unless you are wx because rain is so bs 4 end resultthe game is well balanced and fun there is a dynamic knowledge of what we need to do you can eventually get to a point where you have morning routines like gathering the rabbits from the field and harvesting honey without the worry of needing to spend your entire day doing that like you do in singleplayer the game move much faster and the ability to respawn if you have nice teammates makes it much more enjoyable with the fear of permideath always on your shoulder i would reccomend this game to those that did not enjoy the super stress of the singleplayer but likes the overall gameplay or just because they want to play with friends this however is a short burning flame the game does not last long as server hosts need to leave ending the game for everyone in the end however i give it a good review it is great gameplay with a slight gameplay twist that ends up turning it into what seems as an entirely new game by the devs 8 10 brb going to go play it again
