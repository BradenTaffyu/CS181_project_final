2018 very good but deeply deeply flawed fps with rpg elements them up deeper rpg elements from fallouts 1 2 and new vegas have been removed but the combat has been greatly improved making 4 more like an open world fps that allows you to give bonuses to certain stats such as increased damage with certain types of weapons and the ability to craft more items your character has also been given a definite backstory ex soldier family man for male characters and law student mother wife for female characters making in depth roleplaying pretty much impossible the game also doesn t give you any incentive to care about your spouse or child so you can at least completely ignore that aspect if you want although your character will sometimes bring them up this game s optimization is truly terrible and is a lesson in what not to do when creating a video game i don t really understand it but apparently many of the game s textures are improperly compressed giving massive frame drops to many users and mods have been created specifically to address this even while making textures appear smoother the vivid mods and the optimized vanilla textures mod are very good for fixing this problem in addition the game speed is tied to the framerate so if vsync is forced off the game will enter hyperspeed something that didn t happen with the previous games i thought it was understood that this was bad practice in the 80 s but apparently not this also causes very slow load times which can be fixed with the load accelerator mod thankfully unfortunately the great depth of the quests in new vegas has been shallowed greatly in 4 thanks to bethesda s writers quests are generally much more linear and will usually only have one available solution no more being a double agent or multiple ways to assassinate the president sadly however you can choose whichever faction you want to side with unlike 3 which is nice although it s not as fleshed out as new vegas i think the railroad and minutemen are pushed as the good guys a little too hard and the institute as the bad guys the brotherhood forms a good middle ground though as they re a force capable of bringing peace and stability to the commonwealth but are back to their all your technology are belong to us and kill anything that s even remotely non human even if it is clearly intelligent and friendly idealogy the voice acting is generally top notch a huge improvement over the rather terrible voice acting for common characters in previous games and the general appearance of the game even without mods is generally rather nice save for the horrid performance i think the faces of characters strike a good balance between realistic and the uncanny valley so nothing to complain about there animations are also very smooth and weapons are much less prone to the odd stalling and sight misalignment that plagued 3 and new vegas environments are also more dynamic and interactive with rising and falling water and destroyable objects all in all it s a good game but not a good fallout game bethesda s world and writing don t even come close to holding a candle to black isle s and obsidian s but at the end of the day it s fun to kill things which is all i ask of my shoot em up games but not my read em up games
