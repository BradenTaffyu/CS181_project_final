2016 edit below this edit is the original review i made during early access currently i would have to say 100 of my issues with the game in the early access were addressed even before the release the ai has been improved to the point they make choices a skilled player may make the mass ap issue has been entirely resolved the issue with certain skills not being balanced as in hailstorm single dagger and others have all been rebalanced and made entirely fair to add to this they have outdone themselves by adding full voice acting in the game something that was only in the first one after the enhanced edition the mechanics for the undead are entirely fleshed out the storyline is entirely fluid and fleshed out i can honestly say this game has not only met but exceeded my every expectation is entirely justified in its price for the quality put into it larion studios has released a game that shows what early access should be used for and it s benefits i whole heartedly look forward to their next game early access original review i ll start by saying that i am well aware it s early access so some features are clearly not available as of yet the game is indeed an improvement overall to the first game the combat is more fluid and challenging however i do see an issue in the fact the ai seemingly has collosal amounts of ap and can walk halfway across the field and still attack this was an issue in the first game as well though and not a fault in d os2 even the very first goal of chapter one can be suceeded in so many ways including simple brute force if you happen to be a tactical genius the added highground vs lowground bonus penalty for ranged attacks in a great addition as it adds other dimension to the tactics in combat my greatest complaint is really just a matter of not being able to test out the true customization of the character classes i also admit that the first town in d os seemed to have so much more to do but i do enjoy the more serious and adult approach of d os2 all in all i genuinely believe the game is worth picking up not necessarily saying people should buy it now at full price but it will definitely be a game worth playing with your friends albeit a very unforgiving game
