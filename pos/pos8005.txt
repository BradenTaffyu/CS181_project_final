2019 early access review if you re looking at this game you re probably aware of what it has that makes it so very particularly unique in comparison to most other vehicle games out there this is not quite a racing game whatsoever but it is absolutely astounding at what it does and that is provide a wonderful fairly realistic driving experience combined with just about the greatest damage model of any game to date i remember when i first played burnout 3 and was left in awe by seeing the carnage of the vehicles beamng has recreated and even improved upon that feeling it s just endless amounts of fun seeing the many different ways you can tear apart your cars and the best thing is there s even more to do there s a great workshop community that has created a very large amount of quite good mods and it s absolutely amazing if you also happen to play automation as you can create vehicles entirely of your own accord and creativity and smash them to bits even without automation though there is a great amount of parts you can change in your vehicle from engine and gearbox swaps to adding forced aspiration and nitrous oxide to adjusting the suspension set up or even tuning wastegate pressure and gear ratios there s a wonderful amount of content in this game and they even continue to keep adding more i would pay the price of a triple a title for this game and i simply can t wait to see what the devs have in store for us moving forward
