2021 do i recommend this game absolutely does anyone have time for this game not at alldoes time exist while playing this game what is time i played this game a lot a couple years back and always had that urge to just do one more thing you would get to the point that you remembered hitting play at 7pm then you look at the time and it s 9pm as if only 10 minutes flew by but that s ok because you have a couple more hours you re sending out scientists to explore the galaxy sending construction teams to take over star systems and colonizing worlds before you know it it s 1am and you re just getting into a war that you know won t be short you press on and defeat the enemy take on new systems give out so much luxury and loyalty to stabalilze your empire across the galaxy only to come face to face with your next opponent 4am and you think to yourself it s only been a half hour starting back up on this game a few weeks back because i was able to grab the necroids pack and wanted to see what the new species was like and what offerings they had i quickly learned that this game evolved a lot there were new things to pick from new origins to be a part of i customized my empire and started a new game exploring and learning more about new anomalies and sites to explore and expanding the curiosity of the game was amazing i was then threatened by my neighbor about how poorly my army was and that we should join teams i was still a young system and growing at a good pace a few years go by in just a few minutes and i was invited to a galactic community no idea what this was but then realized this game just got bigger in the past 10 minutes now i m searching for more figuring out what else is out there trading all the resources building the armies of tomorrow i quickly learned about the fallen empire that decided to take over the galaxy took over my neighbor only to be beaten by his neighbor fallen empire decided to accept victory and joined the galactic community very strange things happened within 7 hours of game time there s so much that has changed since it launched and since i started playing a couple years ago i m always on the watch for bundles or deals on the dlc i don t have the megacorp federations or nemesis at the time of writing this reviews on the megacorp weren t pleasing but now i wonder if it s been expanded like the other dlc that i do own i wasn t playing when federations was released but now that i m back in i ll see about picking that up with nemesis this game is fun to play singleplayer to play with friends and to play with a community design your own intergalactic space force customize how you rule your own empire republic democracy or dictatorship play a game start a new game start another game go back on games play new games each time gets a bit more rewarding with so many different scenarios and layouts you never know what you will find as you explore
