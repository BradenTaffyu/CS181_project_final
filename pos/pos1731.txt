2022 i totally recommend this game but just for a simple reason it really annoyed me so much during the whole game the story is so amazing and deep specially that the game show us how machines can have feelings like humans too that shows maybe everything that exist in this world deserve a chance to not be judged blinded the combat and gameplay is so fun that make me lose myself in it and the level up system seemed a little complicated at first but you will manage to do it well if you focus on it the graphics and atmosphere is so stunning and beautiful i kinda enjoyed side missions even more than story missions for little things like giving desert rose picture to operator 6o as a gift or saving the sister machine in desert it was just so beautiful the dialogues the voice acting all felt so real more than all i enjoyed the music so much during the whole game specially the park music was really piece of art the only reason that annoyed me so much was the skirt and that ass yes call me whatever you want but i cant enjoy the game and focus on it when i see an ass every time that i move i felt like this was so annoying and creepy that i see her skirt even on cutscenes
