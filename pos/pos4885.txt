2016 not to sound condescending but as a fallout 1 2 veteran i find it kind of funny how no offense newcomers introduced to the series with f3 or nv both of which are great games on their own by the way are saying that this game isn t a fallout fallout true fallout died when bethesda took over plain and simple i made my peace with fallout being dead a long time ago back in 2008 and maybe that s why i enjoyed fallout 4 a bit more than i enjoyed f3 let s see fighting and shooting is more fun hardcore mode is pretty damn hardcore unlike in f nv where it was just a minor annoyance i don t really see rpg elements as dumbed down from f3 nv as many people say fallout 4 is way way more fps oriented than f3 ever was true but that doesn t mean rpg elements are not important in any way they re the what sets the rules of all the fights and there are plenty of options i prefer voiced protagonist over mute emotionless robot that i played as in f3 nv game got more alive thanks to it dialogue wheel where it isn t possible to see your full answers isn t good but mods fixed that already amount of humour and dialogue quality is around the new gen fallouts level which is miles and miles away from old gen fallouts overall mood and atmosphere feels more fallouty than f3 but less fallouty than new vegas with dlcs settlements are an optional fun and that s good same goes for power armor which is a tad too overpowered but meh modding of your weapons and armor is well done graphics are kinda meh for a 2015 game but fallout was never about flashy graphics it isn t bad i had a very bad input lag on a gtx 960 disregarding of the settings and wasn t able to run the game in fullscreen until i consulted google for quite some time now it s buttery smooth on high ultra combo but c mon i shouldn t have to use google and fiddle around ini files and whatnot in order to have a normal experience not that i m not able to but i shouldn t have to speaking of which fps is capped and vsync cannot be normally disabled again bethesda why u do dis 8 10
