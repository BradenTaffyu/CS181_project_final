2020 tl dr10 10 the best driving game ever to feature the united states in detail it s good enough to convince ol il pallino to sink a ton of money into a high end gaming steering wheel overviewol il pallino meant to rack up more playing time before reviewing american truck simulator so as to satisfy any toxic gas vents who believe that lots of hours are needed to make a review look legit but fact in the matter is that this author should write a review sooner than later which games and their circumstances only take up space and waste the reader s times american truck simulator is the perfect sort of game for people who were highly turned onto european truck simulator 2 but are otherwise just too american to get used to things like tractor trailers with only two axles and the aesthetics lacked by the tractor trailers made by mack peterbilt kenworth and international volvo models are also available in american truck simulator but they re swedish in case the reader never played european truck simulator 2 it s simple the player starts out as a driver for hire and takes jobs until they can get enough experience and enough money to raise their credit limit to buy their own truck and make that important step in becoming an owner operator experience gains results in unlocking hazmat certification to increase the types and profitability of loads hauled later level gains results in longer routes and better performance bonuses as the difficulty curve starts to go downhill the player can expand their trucking headquarters and own a fleet of trucks and trailers and hire out other drivers to help with piling on the profits graphics and soundthe only downer in the graphics there s the same sort of slant in the graphics similar to flying a helicopter in grand theft auto iv which gives the feeling the player is looking at a still picture but otherwise the graphics are what a hardcore simulation player would demand from a simulation game ain t that america a screenshot of american truck simulator by il pallino the sounds are all true to life except that there s nothing like an in game radio station and those no sort of cb radio chatter to be heard players are free to adjust the sounds as they see fit but ol il pallino recommends keeping the engine nose on and playing big ugly wheels by the beat farmers for anyone who s either driving a peterbilt or are driving to or through el centro california positivesthe experience of playing especially after one masters the play controls is absolutely amazing watching playthroughs doesn t do justice and written reviews much less so how the game plays was best summarized from a quote by jay leno it s like trying to describe sexual intercourse to an alien the developers aced it in adding to the adventuresome spirit to truck driving by awarding achievements to players for simply going to new towns awards not only help but the natural landmarks and likenesses of real life buildings all make for nice driving distractions negativesthere needs to be a better way of taking screenshots especially since it s entirely possible the player will want to take their eyes off of the road for longer than what they d do if they were operating a motor vehicle in real life but the speedometer isn t obvious enough and it is often possible to go too fast ol il pallino ain t one of those n00bz who disables speeding fines the biggest problem with american truck simulator is that in jobs that require an escort it s entirely possible for vehicles to spawn in which they block traffic similar to autobahn police simulator 2 but unlike the latter game players can save their game and then reload to totally mitigate the effect of brain damaged ai messing things up for the player conclusionthe hardest part of writing a review about american truck simulator making time to do something other than actually play the game at least nobody should be going out in florida due to the incompetent handling of the coronavirus cause anyone who s played this game for the first time wouldn t want to leave their computer anyway and much less interact with some unknown jackwagon regardless if there s an outbreak or no outbreak at least american truck simulator was the perfect game to review for the fourth of july but this was purely coincidental the honest word of il pallino or else this review provided independently by an administrator for rexcurse rexnetwork no compensation was provided email contact dnbmedia co for requests promotions
