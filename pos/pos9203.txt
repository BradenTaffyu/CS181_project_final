2019 stellaris is a phenomenal strategy game that blends grand strategy with real time strategy it is a combination of sins of a solar empire and endless space however much more in depth it is unfortunate that it is plagued by the same engine limitations as sins of a solar empire late game on anything but the smallest maps you will lag the game will slow down you will stutter and freeze and you will want to quit because of it the ui is not friendly to new players in the slightest and there are a lot of nooks and crannies that you will discover later on that actually mean quite a big deal to the game even with all these flaws the positives shine through and end up with a product that is incredible and unique the dlcs really bring this game together it is clear that having them all is how stellaris is really meant to be played there is always something unique and new happening in your campaigns in my experience over 100 hours of play time i wish you could have a bit more control over the tactics of your fleets during combat like in soase that was my issue with endless space as well sometimes it feels like all it is is a straight up brawl and whoever has more ships wins but i know that isn t always the case there are a lot of different factors like ship composition and weapons that counter the others but from my experience nothing beats battleships with tachyon lance and kinetic batteries with a corvette escort which is kind of disappointing because there are so many other cool weapon types i would like to utilize after 100 hours of gameplay stellaris is still feeling fresh and i see myself playing it quite a bit more in the future the possibilities with modding are also endless and i am sure will spice things up a bit after i start to get tired of the core game i only hope they don t make the endgame even more laggy with any luck we will get a sequel in the coming years that isn t built off of an engine from 2007 that has seen little to no updates
