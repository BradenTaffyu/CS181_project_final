2022 so after 75 hours of gametime relationship goals in game though not in real life very tiring battle generating income and plenty of grinding i ve finally beaten the game and not gonna lie i really liked the game and this time i m gonna review this piece of gem first off story character since this is actually contain spoiler so spoiler alert only click it if you ve beaten the game or if you don t care about the spoiler so for the story i m only gonna give you the sypnosis of the intro i can t give you the rest of the story because i just don t want to so here we go one day your grandpa was sending you a message that he wanna give you farm and tell you that you might feel bored about the modern life in the future which 15 years later whatever you really become bored and really tired because you have to work over and over and when you checked your cabinet there s an envelope in there and it was your grandpa he wants you to change it was the same thing happened to him before and he tell us to just throw what we have now aside and move into the village called stardew valley and with that you decided to do it you took a bus into the village and while you finally there someone welcomes you her name is robin she then takes you into your grandpa s farm which is yea looks filthy nowadays and then she shows you your new house to live in from now on and then there s a male elder and yeah i actually don t wanna call it old man kinda rude for me man which his name is lewis he was the mayor of the pelican town which is the town in stardew valley hmm why i call it village earlier then heh whatever he welcomes you to the town as well and then he tells you how good but also rustic your grandpa s house is which is yours as well though i think it still looks great and since you ve been gone into so much bus trip to the village he asks you to get some rest so you can explore it the next day and he also inform you that if you can sell your stuff into the shipping box and you finally take a rest and your new life is begin and that s it for the story i can give you the game actually has some backstory that is really good and might suprises you and the game s not only have the town s story you also have a story which involves the company that you just left and then the character there s ton of them each of them has some personality and each of them has some schedule and things to do but sometimes they went into somewhere else and also each character have some background and events that s actually great to look at and can make you either love them even more than ever make you think twice for trusting them or even fully hates them which is amazing and now the second thing of the game s aspect graphics not gonna lie i actually don t really pay much attention about the graphics i actually can just put it into the end or i can just throw it into the tr shcan ngl i actually don t know who is danny devito but i like this word but this is review so i should talk about it for the graphics well i like it the dev uses the retro graphic which is looks great to me not that i actually liked the retro graphics to begin with the backgrounds and locations were looks good and in fact it s good on any season the character sprites are really great to look at the monsters are amazing and the portrait on the other hand umm i actually used a mod called anime portrait by ohodavi because i love it so much despite the fact that i never watched anime but to be honest the original portrait looks good for me i actually liked it and now the most important aspect in the game for me which is gameplay now how do i say about this oh yeah have you ever played harvest moon if you do it s almost similar like it if you don t that s okay i ll tell you first off the farming obviously you have regular farm the cave and greenhouse the regular farm looks very messy at the first time and you obviously need to clean it before you can use it and then if you have cleaned it you can use it to plant anything from potato pumpkin to even trees if you need more of it to make your farm looks good and you can make your plants grow faster or better and don t forget to take care of them from any intruder and just like harvest moon some plants can only planted to a certain season which means you can t just rely on single plant to get rich second one the cave you can use it to harvest some fruit bats or mushrooms but you need to make money before you can use it because it s empty for the first time after that don t forget to chech it daily and last one the greenhouse like i said before you need to do some chores to unlock it and after that you can use it to plant anything in there just like you do in the regular farm when i said anything i mean literally anything even if it s not on the right season so if you wanna plant your favourite plant you can plant it there as long as you have the corps that is the second one is mining just like harvest moon you can mine some ore and minerals you can use them to upgrade your tools or just donate them to the museum you need pickaxe to mine obviously and then go into the mines in there not only there s ore and minerals to mine and take there are also enemies to stop you which will talk about it soon and speaking of the mine there s two of them the regular and the harder one in the harder cave not only there are some high quality ores and minerals in there but there are powerful enemies in there as well you need more powerful gear to get in there and then combat oh boy the combat first off there s some enemies in the game in the mines especially some of them are flying some of them aren t you fight them with sword bombs or even slingshot and the more levels in the mine you get the harder the enemies are sometimes they dropped some stuff that can be used to craft something that can help you to fight the enemies easier and also try not to let them get you game ended anyway this is amazing i like it oh wait you think that s the only thing you do in the game haha no there s other thing you can do in this game like talking to other people play some minigames fishing having relationship with people either into different gender or same gender get married go into the event and carnival and many more and then the last aspect of the game is audio soundtrack yeah the audio is really good the ambience is amazing it always make me got relaxed for listening into it and the soundtrack was pretty great especially the winter one i really liked it the songs makes me got relaxed even more i can t explain it more i just really liked it you can just experience it yourself conclusion so in conclusion i really liked the game it s a great game it makes you reminding of the old days playing harvest moon for people who ever played harvest moon you can either buy it on sale or buy it immediately anyway that s it hope this review make you wanna buy the game final score all hail stardew valley 100thumbs up for this game hope this game released in the afterlife as well
