2018 wow i do love this game to be short about it if you ve ever played theme hospital and liked it you re gonna like this game too sure some things need fixing patients dying despite of a wide variety of diagnosis and treatment facilities patients leaving angry from boredom hunger or thirst from a hallway filled with food and drink machines and magazine stands characters getting stuck in place for no reason at all not being able to place certain small items like radiators or fire extinguishers under wall mounted items like x ray screens or even paintings etc some things absolutely need to be added not in the latest place copy paste of roomscause let s be honest about it after figuring out how to get you gp s office up to prestige level 5 you really do not want to design the next 10 or more gp s offices all over again scrolling through the list of items endlessly placing the same sh t over and over again and yes 10 or more of some rooms are needed usually also i would like to see some options added like ability to move patients to another treatment room of the same kind in the queue management screen more often than not one office will have 4 patients near death while the office next to it has all patients in fairly good or perfect health still ability to appoint staff to a certain room or at least building so they don t wander off all the time ability to suspend all staff breaks when handling an emergency or at least have them not leave a treatment room until replacement has arrived there is more of course more pro s and con s but all in all i do enjoy this game immensely i start it up as soon as i have a few hours to spare it s easy to pause if something else needs your attention and if you play it windowed you can easily switch between screens should you need to i have 3 monitors in permanent use so yes i need to
