2015 early access review i quickly discovered something important about project zomboid i m not very good spinning to face a zombie i recalled my son s reaction when i beat a guy one on one in a shootout in wolfet he looked at my dead opponent and said thank you for sucking i bring this up because i can set sandbox mode to ease me into harder and harder levels nobody s gona watch me on youtube if i d been recording my playthroughs i haven t been you re welcome but poor little joey fatone has a pretty good base set up and his much tougher brother fred fatone is working on his own i m learning the system and having a ball most guys will play pz like it s dwarf fortress losing is fun which is great but it s your call there s a deep and satisfying skill system but that s poorly suited to die in a week scenarios so you make an important choice when you start the game entirely apart from which fatone brother to play and what skills he has sandbox can be adjusted to encourage learning a lot survival well not so much unless you re adept i ve seen enough playthroughs to convince me that very very few guys and i don t mean old ones like me will bother much with most skills if they know that living a month is unlikely the game has not yet reached a point however where an effective base will be fun for very long at least not your second or third one if you make yourself safe and reasonably self sustaining you ve won and it s probably time for a new fatone but the game lets you pick what style you want anyone remotely interested in the genre basically anyone interested enough to be reading this should enjoy the game just don t expect to live forever you re joey fatone not justin timberlake
