2018 early access review beautiful and brutal every game of rimworld plays like a unique story in an ongoing epic of people just trying to make a life for themselves you will stand silent over the graves of colonists you just couldn t save you will fool yourself into believing your favorites are immortal you will weather storms and anomalies freak accidents and rabid wildlife you will build grow and lead the colony in its defense because you have to because these little cartoon on the screen inevitably become as real as any friend or family member you ve ever had because rimworld is a damn good game
