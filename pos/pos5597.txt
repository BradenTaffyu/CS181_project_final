2023 this game has 1 incomparable strength and 1 flaw that almost breaks itmount and blade games do 1 thing so well that everything else could fade in importance it is the talent based realistic medieval combat on a battle scale not arcade slashing but actual combat which requires you to move and target in particular ways to be able to defeat an opponent and on horseback with couched lances horse archery once it was out there it made you wonder why no one had done this before it is the game i always imagined and waited for since when i was a little child in the early 1990s and there is still nothing else like it so despite many frustrations you will surely have if you are the kind of guy then mb is your game to go and you probably know it the simple genius of the campaign design is the underrated part of the package you start the game as a lone warrior in 1st person you gather men to form a band and you can gradually grow this band into a royal army of thousands and form a state all in real time and with real numbers with no illusory scale jumps between layers of the game when you think about it this is an impressive way of gaming how medieval political entities actually came to existence as told by social historians like tilly elias bloch in comparison to the mb1 warband the sieges are a major improvement and the graphics are beautiful but i am here to write about 1 major frustration that almost does away with the game s 1 major forte swinging two handed axes on horseback is hilariously unrealistic and vastly overpowered to an extent that almost breaks the game in terms of both balance and immersion it s not a thing that historically existed and it s easy to understand why and it turns the game into arcade there are mods out there that tweak this but this is a fundamental game design flaw that shouldn t have been there one could go through a long list of other frustrations of course it is not clear why the mb2 bannerlord took so many years to launch and came out in still incomplete shape there are many essential features missing and you need to use mods to make up for them the night day mechanic has no consequential effect camping and resting is almost entirely ignored and we still don t have seafaring which the mb viking conquest handled so well i m inclining to vote down for these reasons but then i am turkish and i have to support the taleworld s efforts at least while other games and studios go disproportionately for sugar graphics and boasting about the number of items they go for protein content gameplay and design but god why does it take so long and why the mounted 2 handed axes
