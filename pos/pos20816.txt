2023 i half expected hagrid to show up and say you re a wizard pitvypyr but alas he was a no show after almost 80 hours into the game i ve had a generally good experience it s been fun so far however there are a few things that have left me disappointed i was seriously upset over the broom system i mean all the brooms are the same except for upgrades you should have gotten a nimbus 2000 and flown out of the hogwarts courtyard and then when you got the firebolt you should have been able to hit the afterburner and gone from map edge to map edge within a few seconds but nope that fell flat and another gripe is the merlin tests after you solve each test couldn t they have made a way to disable the merlin animation i m getting flashbacks of skinning animals from my red dead redemption 2 days that seriously gets old and the cave layouts could have been better designed instead you run a few feet turn left or right then another turn and you re at a chest open said chest and back outside then it s over yeah some have a few puzzles but the majority are the same ol same also where is the spell upgrade for revelio i wanted an option to have this spell be extended for at least a min instead you re spamming that spell like there is no tomorrow and i don t think i ve used any of the potions except thunderbrew since i had to brew a focus potion and drink it for one of the class requirements it would have been nice to have these extended too maybe doing more potion classes and learning to squeeze a bezoar with a side of a knife instead of slicing it and then learning to extend the potion s effects for longer than 15 seconds seems like you d be spamming those things too in the middle of a long fight that s one of the reasons i don t use them after you get out into the big wide world the grind becomes real it seems and another gripe why didn t they have a 5th spell set for using it in the vivarium as well i mean putting the bag the feed the brush etc on the vivarium spell set would have been nice instead you re having to move everything around to brush your beasts for that all important hair feather i feel they could have tweaked the game more and another thing i just don t see the draw for skins outfits unless they actually served a purpose i played a sniping game where i got a ghillie suit i thought to myself nice i can be more invisible but it didn t do anything to help you in the game at all the enemy could see you just as well with it on as off so with all the different hats glasses gloves in this game i usually change the appearance back to a generic hat and don t use any of the different styles in the game skins just don t appeal to me but after all this griping don t get me wrong i really enjoy the game but the latter half is just monotonous
