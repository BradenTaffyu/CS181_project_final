2021 early access review outstanding the graphics are very well presented in the time i ve played i ve not had any crashes and not noticed any bugs runs smooth 60fps gameplay is quite deep and i m really looking forward to the future of more developments with the game it plays quite similar to factorio but seems to be more varied and no shooting aliens so far which is good with me
