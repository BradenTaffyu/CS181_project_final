2013 arma 3 was highly anticipated by me when it was first announced and i pounced on the beta as soon as it was released now that its on general release i m totally wrapped by it i ve already played around 250 hours and just can t get enough of it there s 114 pages of custom made missions available for free via steam and the armaholic web site singleplayer coop and multiplayer missions most that i ve played have been excellent the in game editor enables you to create missions fairly easily with little experience the whole package is well worth full price there s more big updates coming soon adding to the campaign mode the only downside i ve found is the lack of an armoury all previous arma games have included an armoury where you are able to try out all weapons and vehicles plus play as any character in game including animals as well as play different scenarios which are never the same due to the massive open world aspect of these arma maps the game has amazing graphics an open world stretching for many kilometers in all directions and smooth gameplay all of which make arma a pleasure to play imo far better than any other shooter around incluing battlefield 4 call of duty op flashpoint though i love the battlefied and operation flashpoint games as well edit april 13th 2015 the game has come a long way since i wrote my original review while the game was in beta though due to a massive back log of unplayed games that i own i ve not had much opportunity to play the game recently that said the developers have added a lot more to the game since i last played it such as the single player campaign plus of course there are many more missions and modifications added since i mentioned it previously in fact far more than i ll probably ever be able to get through edit nov 2016 okay i ve still got a massive backlog of unplayed games even bigger than last april when i intended to update this last that said i have found some time to play quite a lot recently and am very impressed with everything the devs have accomplished with this game the armoury is still missing but i believe someone has created a mod which i ve not had time to check yet that i m hoping will add the armoury mode that we had in the original arma and arma ii i ve played a few hours of the single player missions that have been added to the game and was very impressed you can play them either as a lone wolf or with friends if you wish both of which i enjoy though i ve not managed to persuade many to play for a long time i found them challenging enought to feel a sense of achievement once i d completed or nearly completed the missions i died a lot initially but once i got the lay of the land it was easy to figure out where to stay in cover and hit your targets almost with impunity still most of the time i did find the scenarios challenging and very enjoyable there s loads of different envoronments to work through which makes for interesting play i ve still to play more multiplayer been avoiding it for now as i don t feel up to the standard most of the clans that run this game are at if i could find a group of average players i d be really happy i will hopfully rewrite this review and consolidate what i d said once i ve spent some time playing the multiplayer game and experienced more of the scenarios that the community have posted via the steam workshop there are so many of them now unless you re a total addict i doubt you d ever be able to play them all much like the community made maps for left 4 dead 2 and the mods for games like fallout 3 and the elder scrolls iv and v
