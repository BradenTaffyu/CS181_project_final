2021 after putting 2 000 hours in horizion 3 and 4 200 in 4 i was really looking forward to this game and was surprised at how good this game is graphics are amazing as always the cars drive so much better the way cars react to upgrades is less realistic but better in terms of a video game it works very well its also nice that the roads arent clogged with ai traffic to the point where you can t enjoy your cars which was a massive issue in the past 2 games the campaign sucks but i never really went past the first quarter of it in any horizon game i dont care about the story i just want to drive around plus afk racing is still a thing which is nice
