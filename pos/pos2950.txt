2019 oh god where do begin okay so let s do a classic pros and cons list starting with pros pros huge gi gantic if you have not played this game before you ll find choices matter and you have a lot of them you run the real risk of making decisions that will carry with you throughout the game you could potentially kill someone that could be horribly important later on characters including yours grow with the story your companions will act and react to your choices and will interract with npc s you can form pretty real relationships with your companions character customization is simplistic but unique i mean the game lets you choose the instruments that play in a theme song that s pretty wild the game has a lot of realistic freedom and you have the potential to run into situations you re not prepared for or you don t have all the info for very immersive there s so much to do in the game so the replayability value is phenomenal puzzles are handled well most if not all the info will be provided in the area for the puzzle to be solved and is strictly based on your own ability to problem solve mama maladycons the game can be big to the point of being overwhelming this wouldn t be that big of a problem if there weren t more clear instructions just as i said in the previous comment the game lacks a lot of direction while i can go on about how the freedom is there it also is a little difficult to keep track of all the things you have to want to do it s very easy to get lost in a quest and not know how to pick it back up more waypoints would be useful it can be a bit infuriating when you re trying to progress and you have absolutely no idea what you re doing the game can be ruthless for people who are not used to its mechanic and some bosses will savestate just as you re getting into battle so if you re not prepared for it you ll be stuck in this boss that can kill you in an instant and having to reload a file from an hour ago can be agonizingly slow not really a sprinting or speed up feature so things can trek on and on and on which can give the illusion of difficulty because it takes up time some puzzles can be a bit open ended certain instructions can be a bit unclear
