2013 early access review ksp version 0 23 alpha try the free demo if you re unsure an absolutely brilliant example of an open game still under development ksp lets players explore the kerbol system with a fleet of mostly operational self designed ships probes rovers stations permanent bases and of course manned missions although the unity engine causes even top end pcs to sometimes run at sub par framerates the game is slowly becoming more intricate and beautiful with every update you ll quickly realise that there are no predefined goals and a lot of what you achieve on ksp is fuelled by your imagination so if you re looking for a linear game with missions and a set storyline this isn t for you the game features two different modes career mode and sandbox mode while the basic career mode is currently being updated and improved sandbox definitely contains enough content to give dozens of hours of fun if not more multiplayer is due to be introduced before final release too outside the stock game the community is excellent with a plethora of mods created to complement the game easily installed thanks to developer support and an official mod sharing website once you begin to look for objectives beyond scooting around the rocky surface of moho or exploring jool s many moons you can introduce extraplanetary mining with the kethane mod orbital mapping with the isa mapsat mod or a host of other content packages created by the community just expect to crash often when you first start and don t grow too attached to any of your impressive creations this is an alpha level game after all
