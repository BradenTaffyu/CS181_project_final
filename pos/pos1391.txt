2015 early access review firstly a tl dr review get it and play it your first couple of runs might not feel very fun or make much sense and you may feel this game is lacking content but keep playing and you ll understand what this game is all about if you re one of those people who can t appreciate a good soundtrack an immersive experience and patient gameplay stick to your h1z1 cod 9 10 overall brilliant not overpriced with active developers mod support and there s even local online multiplayer can t go wrong with this it s just sheer good ness anyway onto a real review project zomboid is one of the few games that actually makes me feel on edge whilst i m playing the game expresses how you are going to die no matter what and it s true you will die one scratch from a zombie can get infected killing you irreversibly surely that s too powerful you may be thinking but no this game stresses for you to skillfully outmanouver and sneak past zombies instead of killing them just because you can or for some bullshitty xp weapons are effective and zombies are easy to kill true but one misclick is all it takes for your life to be over and you know why it s not even frustrating when you die because the game told you that you were going to die you knew this moment would come i like to randomly generate a character and live their story if you like trying to guide them through this unforgiving world as long as you can when it comes to crafting it takes effort to get the knowledge to actually craft things as it should be the building systems in other early access games are fun aye but they don t make much sense let s take 7 days to die for example 7dtd is a brilliant game don t get me wrong but project zomboid is more fun in terms of immersion and realism and there s one small feature in the game that i really love in one of the soundtrack songs there s the sound of a clock ticking in the background that clock ticking signifies your time left to live before you die such a simple feature keeps you on edge and keeps you as alert as a meerkat as you stroll around with your trusty butter knife the only gripe i have is that i d like to see some more better animations on the player model the combat system could be a little better too as i often find myself charging attacks but i m not even sure if charging my attacks matters or not most of the time regardless of those this game is brilliance created by innovative clever and active developers it s fun engaging and a wonderful way to pass a few hours by mods are awesome with it too a must buy for zombie game lovers 9 10
