2022 early access review the 215 9 hours that you see on record here are but a part of my actual gameplay time due to the fact that i only play single player and most of the time i play with steam in offline mode i d say my real gameplay time is easily over 500 hours in total first of all i generally recommend this game and you should definitely buy it if it s on a good sale this is my solo experience game doesn t hold your hand it teaches you how to breathe then points you to a trader quest giver merchant npc who rarely doesn t spawn in the forest biome lol tough luck for newbies then it walks out just like your dad did 20 years ago when he said he was going out to get some milk if you don t want to go into multiple character re rolls poe nerd here and ride the masochist train for a few a dozen hours learn how to make good horde bases from other players and i know this is broad but learn which loot is valuable useful and what the top priority crafting recipes are from other players generally you would want to rush to get iron gear armor and melee weapons and or tools upgrade from pipe guns to a higher tier of guns that you specialize in and craft a motorcycle as soon as you can also prepare to spend hours upon hours making an item sorting system and then maintaining it the faster you start it the less painful it will be you are gonna be looking at a lot of menus and there will be times where you will be spending some time grinding for resources mining trading and crafting a lot so get ready for it even though you can customize your world settings the game ultimately suffers from the skyrim end game syndrome and the oblivion difficulty syndrome the skyrim syndrome means that by the end of the game if you have played your cards right you will have become almost god like i am not joking you will have to actively try to get yourself killed or experience brain aneurysms and be constantly putting yourself in very very bad situations you will be able to get every single skill point in the game you can read all of the magazines in the game you will be proficient with every tool weapon and armor imaginable you will be the smartest toughest strongest and most agile entity in the game no decision so far will have mattered it doesn t matter if in the beginning you followed the strength skill tree again sorry poe nerd here and used bats shotguns and heavy armor you will be able to do everything later making you have an existential crisis and wonder if you even ever had choices and a free will to begin with you won t feel special at all all builds end up the same reaching end game has never felt this dull for me in a video game ever the oblivion syndrome means even though you can customize your game settings and craft your own worlds fundamentally the difficulty of the game comes down to how much damage the player does to enemies and blocks and how much damage said player takes from enemies that s it it s just a slider which the bleed effect from knives and machetes ignore btw lol it just feels rough the only solution i can find here is more content and a more developed difficulty system like fallout 4 did for its survival difficulty the first is more realistic than the latter so let s talk about it let s talk about content specifically what s left to be desired 1 still no storyline the world is devoid of life with traders being the only npcs in the game it s the main reason end game is currently so boring there are no end goals no end game areas to explore nothing new to chase you do what you did previously but better and it becomes a meaningless game loop i want more i want my killing sprees to have an impact to the world i want to be praised i want to reduce the zombie spawn rate or even purify an area of zombies i need more 2 functional water 3 an actually balanced and fair zombie ai currently they all have phd in engineering and are smarter than einstein most of the time feral sense broke the stealth mechanic the fun pimps are constantly cracking down on exploits that a very small minority of players use which results in changes for everyone lowering the quality of the game and unintentionally bringing new bugs exploits to the game they need to realize that some people will always find weaknesses exploits in video games and instead of doing this eternal loop should focus their resources and time on actually finishing and polishing the game 4 better resource gathering mechanics in general especially a good farming mechanic right now farming needs to be fixed reworked the current state of farming is just too boring and it s unsustainable without skill point investment it shouldn t be this cruel also where is livestock farming and fishing to name a few 5 more zombie and animal variety 6 seasons 7 some climbing mechanic and or tool s to move around like ropes or grappling hooks i am not asking for the game to become a dying light clone but for me this game feels so stiff if we had such tools and or at least some basic climbing mechanics it would be absolutely fantastic i also understand that this ruins game balance to a high degree so the climbing mechanic should be locked behind levels and skills point investment and tools should be limited and or be end game content you already end up as at least a demi god by the end of the game so there s nothing to lose there 8 even better cities and countrysides even better and more points of interests poi to be paired with them more weapons clothes and armor unique items when 8 1 more item customization i want my best items to feel more personal i want to be able to be more attached to them and feel proud for having them 9 any combat abilities in chat 10 an actual infection system in zombie games i don t want to just worry about the zombies or potentially even other survivors but i want to worry about the zombie virus itself i just don t want honey yes actual honey from bees to be able to solve all of my infection problems forever the game might become more hardcore because of this change but i think more people than not will like it i have almost no knowledge about co op even though in this review i focused more on the negatives there are a lot of positives too and this game is definitely fun to play hope i helped bye
