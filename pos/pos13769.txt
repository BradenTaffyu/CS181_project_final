2019 well this game has deserved the best millitary firefight simulator title yes it has some lack of animation i agree with that opinion but in turkey we would say yi idi ld r hakk n yeme it means give the devil his due it s clearly better millitary simulator than the others you can search for mine you can cure your teammates you can be injured from heavy fire you can use cas planes you can use drones air land and i don t want to mention you can use tanks cars apc s artilleries mortars or s 750 cause of year 2035 15 20 years after s 500 now i want to mention about factions there are 3 factions in the sp game they are blufor opfor independents and civilians the blufor as you now nato the opfor is a coalition force which has established for the counteract against the nato forces the independents aren t from the both sides they are just protecting their aegaen islands against the both usually nato yes you heard it right aegaen islands of the stratis and altis are the main objectives of the game and they are clearly a huge maps not stratis so its obviously an independent and a realistic game that you can create your own missions and own briefings with a 3d eden editior yes in sp you can create your own arma 3 game in mp not recommended to who loves realistic sp firefight you can join an online player created brigades with a teamspeak that will be realistic too but some people don t understand the realistic firefigt simulator so they are just make you crazy in addition you can play in the cooperative missions that s all i would to say about the game i m highly recommend you this the masterpiece game finally i want to tell you make arma not war
