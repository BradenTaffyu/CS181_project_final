started off as a kind hearted wanderer going from town to town doing small errands to help out and earn some allies gained some renown by traveling around and winning a few tournaments eventually joined the desert kingdom and started fighting to defend my king s land king gave me some castles and towns after helping him win a few sieges mismanaged my construction projects in my new fiefs and went into debt for 3 million coins completely broke but still fighting in a massive war with the western kingdom realized it was unwinnable and started executing every western leader after each battle hoping that would make a difference lost my generous and merciful traits gained the deceitful trait now every kingdom and clan despises me for being a heartless murderous monster left my king knowing his kingdom was doomed tried joining another kingdom but everyone hates me for being a war criminal only option now is to retire to a cave in the mountains and live the rest of my life as an honorless hermit while my governor brother and his children try to salvage our clan s name in a dying kingdom started out as a friendly wanderer with a heart of gold ended as a disgraced war criminal forced to retreat to the mountains and live the rest of my days hiding out in a cave reflecting on just how quickly the quest for power degraded my moral compass 10 10
