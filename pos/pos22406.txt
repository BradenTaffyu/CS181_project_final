2016 i am a newcomer to the dark souls franchise from time to time i would stumble upon video or gif of dark souls games but i didn t understand anything only thing that i knew is that games are hard well i bought dark souls 3 and i see why others are hooked so many secrets hidden areas and mistery lore that even the biggest dark souls fans still try to figure it out you will be hungry for more and more which area is next what will it bring to you which boss is there what is the lore of this area monsters boss a loot in the distance how to get to it is it maybe rubbish or some cool armor so many questions do yourself a favor and play dark souls 3 play it blind try not to look at wikis maybe even avoid the co op for your first time through it ll make victory all the sweeter 3i highly recommended 10 10
