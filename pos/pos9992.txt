2018 rimworld rimworld rimworld what am i going to do about you see you have to understand i kind of have a love hate relationship with this game sometimes it s my absolute favorite game of all time and others i will refuse to touch it for months on end but i guess that s just the magic in the game when this game draws you in it keeps you in for hours upon hours it s one of the only games that can genuinely keep me engrossed for entire days at a time all that being said rimworld is a colony sim in which you have to take care of a bunch of whiney little babies and survive against all odds and somehow that is extraordinarily fun this game will make you feel when your colony survives a tough raid you ll feel it when it took a couple of your colonists lives to destroy that crashed mechanoid ship you ll feel it when 67 manhunting elk come around and charge your colony you know you re likely facing the end but that s what makes the game so good not only can the game keep me entertained for hours it can make me genuinely feel for these little colonists there are very few other games in the industry these days that can accomplish both of those and if you ever get bored of the base game the modding community in this game is amazing there are hundreds of mods pumped out every day and some of them i even consider mods that are a must use for my games in the end this game is definitely worth your money but just always be sure to keep an eye on the clock i ve stayed up too many nights to count thank you tynan for what you have created here
