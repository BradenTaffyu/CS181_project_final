2018 i bought this game in an extremely hesitant mindset to say the least i have absolutely loved a lot of the past total war titles and although i have not been playing them as long as a lot of other people have i feel as though i have at least a bit of experience in these games i hadn t bought this game or warhammer 1 for one specific reason that it wasn t historical personally i absolutely love history learning and talking about it is a passion of mine and this is a very large factor as to why i love the total war franchise i had watched videos on the first warhammer when it came out and was to be honest annoyed and very close minded i hated the thought of a total war game set in a completely mythical land and made up characters and races i never watched any other videos warhammer 1 nor 2 and completely ignored it however one day i was itching for a new total war i had played a lot of them and at this point i was getting bored with the same settings and time periods by complete chance i saw warhammer 2 on sale i cannot remember if it was the summer winter or some other regardless i took the chance and bought it and i loved it i encourage anyone that may be hesitant on buying this game to watch videos or read reviews both good and bad don t do what i did and take one look at the game and completely brush it off based off the simple fact that it isn t historical fictional settings and periods have so much to offer and in my personal opinion warhammer 2 was done correctly i believe it offers great characters and interesting storylines not to mention the beautiful graphics i have not gotten the first warhammer yet however i most certainly plan to once it goes on sale all of this being said i most definitely recommend this game
