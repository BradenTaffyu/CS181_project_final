2021 fallout 4 is an amazing game in terms of its exploration combat and building mechanics that being said fallout has always been a choose your own adventure narrative and while elements of this remain as a whole it is very limited the narrative rely too heavily on essential npcs and dialog that inevitably leads to yes yes funny option no but yes and question still while the story leaves a gap to be desired the content of the game still has the spirit and iconic moments of a fallout game i would highly recommend this game even with its flaws however i would highly encourage new players to play fallout new vegas first to get a sense of what a true fallout games narrative mechanics consist of just to give it a rating in my opinion it is around 7 10 with it being a slight let down in regards to the rest of the franchises however that doesn t detour that it is a well crafted game which tries its best to expand and innovate on it s mechanics but in reality the changes they made led to focus from what was great to become misjudged which is why i would give it a 7 10
