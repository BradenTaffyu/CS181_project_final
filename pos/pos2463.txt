2020 played on bethesda launcher before the steam release roughly 50 70 hoursto keep it simple and to safe yourself some reading it feels like an actual fallout 3 title with the wastelanders update you can actually enjoy check out the challenges and you can gain enough atoms to outweigh the actual prices for purchases think of gold from red dead redemption 2 online minor bugs and glitches that are not breaking the game as much as in the beginning fallout 1st is still a very sour taste but not necessary to play so see it as a subscription or premium pass of course it is not a nice thing as you have spend money to gain access to the game already tldr clearly recommend the game in its current state however make sure that you want to spend the 40 and are keeping in mind that a game as a service is an ongoing project so fixes might come and things might break
