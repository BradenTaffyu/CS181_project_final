2016 i have much more hours in this game i bought it before it was even on steam kerbal space program is a space agency simulator where you control the agency itself and the actual kerbonauts astronauts there are three gamemodes career you manage the actual agency with funds popularity approva and research tech science same as before but just research and sandbox with no limitations but there s almost no agency mechanics although because of that sandbox may sound like a lesser mode the agency mechanics are really secondary the main gameplay is being the actual kerbonauts and performing the mission which you yourself can determine or you can take a contract however building the rocket or spaceplane is just as important as actually flying it there s a whole solar system for you to explore complete with asteroids and moons for some of the planets some of the planets even have irrational orbits and some of those have moons with an irrational orbit to the planet the game is realistic enough to be somewhat educational but loose enough to be a very fun game the game is somewhat difficult due to the loose realism but that is a good thing for myself i d rather a game be too hard this game definitely isn t than be too easy everytime i start a new save i learn something new along the way everytime whether it s a more efficient way to get into orbit faster way to dock or even a way to use less parts for a rocket i always learn something new and i love that also ksp is one of the few games ever to exit early access and actually be complete with no major bugs that s dedication
