coming in as a coh1 2 vet i watched how coh3 stumbled and burned on release but i still kept a watchful eye on it to see if it ever will be worth while i finally played it during a free weekend because i too was still on the fence refusing to drop cash on this game out of fear of it being a total dudill tell you this as of now this moment in time coh3 is not the burning train wreck it was on release anymore the game is absurdly good and now worthy of the number 3 in the coh franchise the qol updates from 2 so throughly outstrip everything that would hold back a player to want to ever try or hop over the fence to 3 that score you see in the top right that says mixed reviews that is no longer applicable to the game in its current state it is no longer worthy of being called a mixed review game but now a very positive game so dont be fooled by the reviews and try the game yourself i will admit the game is very pricey but for 30 or less its absolutely worth buying especially if your into the mp scene
