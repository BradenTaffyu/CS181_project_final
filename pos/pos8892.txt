2019 product received for free this is a cautious recommendation good news this game is a must have for anyone interested in space 4x obviously get it on sale but it s definitely worth full price bad news every 4 8 months paradox releases a patch that changes the game in fundamental ways the changes aren t always good either the game isn t necessarily getting better per say it s still trying to find it s identity which is a combination of weird and frustrating some patches have made the game a burden to play at times but paradox seems committed to fixing mistakes just know that this game is in flux and it won t be the same 6 months or even 2 years from now i do think it s trending upwards though
