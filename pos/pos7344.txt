2016 i have to say that i am quite impressed with this game having played almost every truck sim in the 18 wos days as well as ets2 i remember many years ago stumbling acorss americantrucksimulator com to find that the domain was being held for future use i had high hopes for the game when it was finally released and scs didn t disappoint initially my biggest concern was that the environment and feel was going to be too much like what europe thinks of north america rather than what it s really like over here and while it s difficult to explain those elements do exist but fortunately not to the degree i had initially thought screenshots of the game in the past year kind of made me worry about this but the initial release isn t so bad my favourite thing is that they ve solved pretty much every issue i had in terms of driving physics problems that were present in past games and even ets2 with the transmission setting set to advanced the game allows for clutchless shifting with proper timing naturally with controllers like the g27 and the engine doesn t have the torque converter feel where applying throttle doesn t instantly raise the rpm by a couple hundred if you re not sure what i mean play ets2 with a high horsepower truck like an fh with 750hp and while coasting hit the gas and watch the tach one of the things i wasn t fond of in ets2 is the fact that many cities and roads are so hard to differentiate i could never find my way around if not for the gps the scandinavia dlc is an exception to this imo but it seems like every city and highway is mostly the same ats on the other hand has very original and unique areas as well as cities of varying sizes i hope that this plus the fact that they ll be releasing the map in bits at a time will mean that we can sort of learn our way around through experience and certain areas and roads will become more familiar overtime i m really glad to see scs try to make each area of the map unique original and realistic a number of people have complained about the current lack of trucks many saying that they should have done like they did with ets2 and release them unlicensed first i think that there is a lot of legal mumbo jumbo involved it s hard to criticize scs for this when you don t know what their legal obligations are and where they are currently at with truck manufacturers there s still things i d like to see improved like the audio but i can t even imagine how hard it is to make a realistic sounding truck without hearing audio loops and allowing it to fluently change as engine rpm increases and decreases or even as more or less throttle is applied with each truck so far as engine rpm increases it seems to go through waves for lack of a better word where once you hit 12 or 1300 rpm the tone resets down to sound lower again again difficult to explain kudos to scs software they re definitely on the right track my favourite thing about them as a developer is that they listen to their community very actively and are quick to make changes if needed this game was released at a lower than expected price point and i am very very eager to see where ats goes in the future i highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a relaxing but enjoyable simulator not only for the game but for the amazing developer that stands behind it
