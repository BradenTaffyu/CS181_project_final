2017 early access review amazing game build your base anyway you want it improve your gear and survive amidst a zombie apocalypse the only way i could describe is to say it takes the creativity of minecraft to a more mature and dark setting where survival scavenging and defences are also important for a long and fruitful existence last i played was quite some time ago and the weather and temperatures were still a bit messy i can t speak for how it is now but i suppose that has been fixed a downside is that the game has been eternally in early access not to say the developers aren t working on it but when you leave a game that long in early access it does seem fishy and also hinders us the fact that will probably never get either achievements or the trading cards at least that was an issue back then apparently at least cards were fixed by now i don t know about the achievements overall it is great game i recommend it
