2017 i ll admit i insulted the game when i first took a glimpse at it the gameplay looked pretty boring and it made me want to snooze but it was a completly different story not literally once i purchased the game i was convinced to try out the game before i judged it and with my lunatic of a mind i bought the game to try it out the reviews don t do it any wrong i absolutely love the game the concept of the game is that you escape the modern lifestyle of working to live in the countryside where your grandfather once owned a farm pass down to you i can tell you i honestly feel warped into the game myself as if stardew valley is where i go when i want to escape the world around me the game allows you to marry npcs own pets do quests farm sleep mine in caves kill monsters basically everything you could think of in the average life style plus a little sprinkle of monsters here and there i don t think i have ever felt this close to a game since forever 10 10 i would recommend this to anybody everywhere to give it a try it s worth the price
