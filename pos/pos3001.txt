2017 review divinity original sin 2 rating 9 5 10 legendary there is no other word for it overview divinity original sin 2 from now dos2 is the second installment of the original sin saga developed by larian studios first time a couple years ago veteran rpg makers as they are they come a long way since they made the first divine divinity back in the early 2000 s and also the following chapters which all were good games no beyond divinity never existed shhh dos2 is a real time rpg with turn based combat with some new twists in the classic mechanics to keep it modern gameplay analysis general gameplay there is so much to say about the gameplay of dos2 there really is first of all the thing that astonished me the most among all the good ones which are really a lot is the incredible freedom given to the player in all his actions and interactions with npcs and eventual co op players alike the freedom dos2 offers is as close as it can get to pen and paper rpg level of freedom transported in a videogame every npc is killable everything can be stolen companions will react on what you do based on their alignement and may even become your enemies and so can do players you fplay with in multiplayer there are a myriad of different dialogue options suitable for any alignment you might want to role play about unique dialogues for each of the story npcs unique race based ones unique background based ones reputation based ones so i mean there are so many unique combinations and things that can happen that every play through will be very different as far as interactions go it s all about what you do and who you are in this larian did a wonderful job and very few other rpgs ever have been at the same level of depth in interactions other than this gameplay is pretty much straightforward and like any other classic rpg explore a very vast world composed of 3 huge areas plus all the dungeons and secret places of course loot from randomly generated pieces of gear except unique ones those are always the same fight a good variety of enemies each with its own features and mind you enemies are very different from one another in this game so you will have to use new strategies a lot solve quests in various ways depending on your alignment of just on how you feel like doing but remember everything has some consequences if i was to explain in detail all the gameplay this would be a very very long review and would go over the steam word limit so i tell you this there have maybe been 2 3 rpgs in the whole history that match the depth this one offers don t miss it combat system combat in dos2 is turn based and very much classic style every character starts with a fixed ap number each turn excluding buffs and debuffs of course and they are used for both movement and actions there is no mana in divinity os2 just cooldowns for all skills and for some a special type of energy is required the new mechanics larian decided to introduce in os2 are mainly about how armor works in dos2 there are two types of armor magical and physical which act like additional health bars and nullify any debuff or damage from that specific source magical armor counters magical damage and magical debuffs and so on as long as it has 1 point at least once an armor is depleted it can be regenerated with some skills and potions but while down debuffs and negative statuses will always afflict the targeted character there is no such thing as success percentage it just matters if you have still armor or not the elimination of rng this way is a quite clever gameplay change but also comes with some issues we will discuss further on other than that rest assured there are plenty of skills and fighting schools for all tastes from warriors to healers to summoners there are something like 150 skills around to build your very custom characters the way you want content immense there is no way you can do everything in one play through you will have and want to play this game multiple times to get all the interactions quests and so on to make just one play it can very well require above 85 hours to complete the game 100 can require more than 200 balancing there just is one but quite serious issue with balancing based on how the armor mechanic is structured it is logical to think that a party basing all its damage on either physical or magical would defeat enemies much quicker than splitting damage between example 2 magical and 2 physical characters and it is exactly how it is a party based on just 1 type of damage is much more efficient maybe too much in combat and can defeat most enemies with much more ease than a standard party with some magical and some physical damage challenge tactician difficulty the hardest is a serious challenge if taken without the proper respect badly built parties will be wiped with ease and requires planning strategy in combat and experience some fights really impressed and got me on the brink of madness let me tell you and i play rpgs since twenty years luckily the unlimited and free re spec at your base and adjustable difficulty will make the game beatable even for the less experienced technical analysis graphics environments and art of cutscenes are really well done bear in mind this game does not make graphics one of its priorities still the visuals are quite stunning in certain environments particle effects are well done character models are alright armor and weapon models are made with particular care the world on dos2 is vibrant and alive the ccharacterization of the various environments and locations is marked very distinctively it all contributes to the immersion feeling you already get from the roleplaying part sound it is to mention that larian decided to voice act every single dialogue of this game and there are a monstrous quantity the voice acting is also good this alone is a huge plus other than this the music and sound effects are at very good standards for an rpg no really they are good performance performance is alright the game is optimized well enough but can become heavy for low to mid end machines because it renders and makes all the characters in a whole area work together at the same time so it requires some computing power some machines might not have to run everything smooth also when saving the game has some inexplicably huge frame drops stability dos2 is not really unstable it crashes sometimes it is bound to happen but rarely there are no particular stability problems ai enemy ai is one of the best i ve ever seen around they will execute complex maneuvers to get the most efficiency out of just about everything think of this enemies will get shoulder attacked to walls to avoid being back stabbed if they are supports or ranged units and there is a rogue in the enemy team how often you see this never this is the level of ai i m talking about the same ai that curses you with healing is damage to bypass your shield and kill you with your own healing the next turn prepare to be impressed quality of life inventory management and interfaces are generally good but one thing is really bad picked up new items will constantly clutter your hotbar and having to always clean it is a chore there is a mod that solves this blessed modding but as far as the vanilla game goes this is an issue bugs issues sometimes enemies will just get stuck in combat if the pathfinding becomes too complex or if they are teleported thrown whatever in locations they cannot walk down from in act 3 some voice lines and dialogues are broken and do not work properly
