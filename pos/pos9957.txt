2020 so i spammed randomise on a character creation until i ended up creating a 30 y old dude just like me fighter melee ranged with passion for mining which makes him a cool social army miner so i named him after myself without any second thought for representation and giggles after that i rolled two other random characters and got really lucky with one of them being a 17 year old girl who is extra smart and does all the scientific research in our colony and all was great but then my 30y old character became her lover they constantly had got some loving buff and married soon after she is 21 now they have been married for about 4 years when she turned 21 we augmented her brain with a psychic harmonizer so that she would radiate her positive vibes making everyone around her happier sharing her blissful masochistic existence especially to make her husband happier when he is sharing his bed with her so that he would finally stop going on murderous killing spree with his power claw arms that said my colony only survives on organ harvesting from prisoners we sell kidneys lungs and sometimes even hearts then send caravans to the nearest settlement to sell these in exchange for wood and medicine because life in a desert is harsh
