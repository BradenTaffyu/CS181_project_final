2022 fallout 76 is a pretty fun time it s a game that you can simply hop into casually and have a good time on there s so many opportunities to enjoy many different stories in it s world sharing the sandbox with other players online is an honest good time as well as there doesn t really seem to be a way to truly grief another player so here s some explanations of the good and bad of fallout 76 starting with the good the map is impressively large yet dense with locations odds and ends to explore through so you never really feel as if you re wandering an entirely empty field of grass while the main narrative of the game may be a tad lacking the true shine of the game comes from it s smaller side quest characters there s so many witty memorable personalities that you can find while exploring the game you can honestly build your character however you want want to be a team medic there s a v a t s build that heals you and your team want to just go ham with big guns and big booms heavy weapon power armor is perfect for you then it s truly amazing how much the game gives you to characterize your own way to play the game building your c a m p is honestly one of the most enjoyable parts of the game for me taking everything i ve earned making my own house and decorating it with what i ve earned while exploring the world fills me with a sense of accomplishment i and many others can just glance at their base and be proud with what they ve put together probably most important of all is the fact that you can earn premium currency in this game don t want to fork over 12 for a new skin look through your challenges and you may be able to earn enough atoms to earn it through time now for the bad unfortunately this game isn t perfect and a majority of it s suffering comes from the later portions of the game and how it systematically limits you the daily scrip cap is way too low scrips are a currency that you can earn by trading in legendary items that you don t want but the amount of scrips you can get daily are so beyond limited and you earn legendary items so commonly that you are somewhat forced to put those weapons into your stash to trade in for tomorrow which leads me into my next point stash weight is way too low as of right now you can hold 1 200 wt in your stash this includes everything in the game crafting materials apparels junk weapons and armor etc this is awful as again that daily scrip limit is going to lead to your stash being full before you can even blink you re then forced to make the decision of clearing things out of your stash some of those things you may need for crafting later or the choice of dropping a legendary item that you may ve found useful to use or trade in unfortunately there is a solution to cutting down on a lot of the stash problems fallout 1st a monthly subscription service that gives your stash infinite weight capacity when it comes to storing junk if you do enjoy fallout 76 then truthfully fallout 1st is worth it you get premium currency an extra small base to place a free outfit every month and more but if you re someone who enjoys fallout 76 but cannot invest the money into fallout 1st then your endgame experience is going to be endless stress and suffering on your inventory management it s a terrible system yet another cap so later into the game you ll unlock a currency called gold bullion you can earn this currency by completing events little octagons with an exclamation mark in the center that are marked on the map and getting a treasury note each treasury note only gives you ten bullion not only is the earn rate low but you re capped at earning four hundred gold bullion a day this is just sheer grinding that s unnecessary especially when considering the things you buy with gold bullion can be priced upwards to the four thousands it s silly that this is capped at all and just makes optimizing your builds a headache and chore to do one last thing that s a major negative on the game there s no true endgame content to go through there s no multiplayer raids or dungeons at all closest thing this game has to endgame is launching a nuke and spawning one of two bosses due to this the game can get very repetitive very quickly keep in mind though fallout 76 is a live service game and there may be that magical day where dungeons and raids are added but it d be silly of someone to buy a game purely on the chance of something being added so as of now the endgame is unfortunately extremely dry and unfulfilling all in all i do recommend this game because it s an honest fun time but if you re looking for something long term that s unfortunately when i d tell you to look for something else to invest your time and money in due to how much of a headache it is to deal with especially if you don t pay for fallout 1st hopefully this review was of any help thank you for reading
