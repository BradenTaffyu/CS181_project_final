2016 really fun game i ve spent enough time on this game to tell you it s worth the money if you like strategy games and fantasy battles this is the game for you while i am totally against getting the dlc the base game is still really fun it is upsetting that if you don t want dlc you cannot get elves beastmen etc but it is worth it there s nothing like raising a marauding army of greenskins and sending them north to utterly decimate the dwarf kingdoms and the empire and maybe backstab your allies to lay claim to all of the old world pros addictively fun great if you love strategy games if you like the warhammer universe you ll most likely love it unless your favourite races are dlc satisfying to completely decimate entire nations great mod support personal favourite is a mod that allows you to conquer and occupy all settlements if you like total war games you will most likely enjoy it great for people who enjoy a game you sink a lot of time into cons dlc the dlc costs more than the base game this is awful quite a money grab if i m honest frustrating it can be very frustrating if you fully build up a town to have it stolen or razed and all the effort for nothing quest battles cannot be auto resolved quite frustrating for me as i have to auto resolve battles because my potato pc cannot run the actual battles very well chaos in my opinion the chaos event in game happens way to quickly warning spoiler a few top tier armies spawn in the chaos wastes usually doesn t affect you much if you re greenskins or dwarfs but at the time that they spawn you usually cannot hope to best them i had to work on allying every single faction on the map except norsca because my vampiric corruption would not allow me to expand to fight them all in all i love the game it s a game i can sink a lot of time into and can enjoy it i can t say that for a lot of games my only real problem with it is the dlc and i desperately hope that a goty edition is released at some point
