2022 boy are you not ready literally all the reviews are overwhelmingly positive which clearly means that the game is a masterpiece but most of you already knew that so why why are you still reading through the reviews instead of buying it purchase and experience it i mean don t you wanna be a lumberjack exploring an incredible map filled with collectibles and goodies while a strange kid trying to hunt deer is following you because that s what i ve been doing so far and i love it on a more serious note though the game is surprisingly very well optimized and we all know especially those of you who ve played it on playstation that it has an amazing story awesome music accompanied by some very talented voice acting some really cool mechanics neat animations and effects stunning graphics and the list goes on 50 10 seeing this father of the year simulator gem installed on my desktop made me shed a tear i still can t believe it the perfect game has been released for the perfect platform now then give us everything else sony edit i spoke too soon when i said that this game is just a masterpiece oh no no this this videogame is out of this world and i love it
