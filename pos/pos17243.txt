2020 7 10 simply because a lot of the content is just behind a literal paywall its 60 euros to buy each game for mortal empires and i would definetly recommend you buying this on a mega sale because its too freaking expensive there are a lot of features like getting warpstone to build nukes skaven dlc again one of the downsides are sieges simply to put it they suck hard there is literally only 1 wall which you have to defend there is 1 fort which has layers but its simply too little honestly i will only give it a thumbs up simply because of the many features and because i got my dlcs for cheap playing some races especially skaven without the dlcs is extremely hard i finished the campaign but you get smashed by everything since most of the units are literally meatshields lizardmen are meh since you get easily get like 18 stegadons which are not behind a dlc dark elves are also ok but the high elves are nothing without the queen and the crone dlc which unlocks an archer unit with the capability of course a stack 20 20 of demolishing everything you can try and get dragons but they are too expensive also there are 4 dlc races
