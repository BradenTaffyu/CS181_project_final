2021 product received for free it s a good game it s a bit repetitive at times with the planetary story lines but the individual class stories keep it from being too bad there are plenty of armor and weapon combos to choose from but like most free to play games if you want the high end gear you re going to have to either pay for them straight up or grind the hell out of some quest to get the credits needed to buy them from the in game market where other players can sell their stuff either way your going to pay with your time or your money for the stuff you want in the end i d still give it at least an 8 10 it s good but could always be improved
