2018 update the game had a major overhaul so i am adjusting my review a bit i am the curator for 4x dads a group of gaming men of the age of 30 mostly with jobs and families who enjoy 4x strategy games this game has been on my wishlist for a very long time and i finally was able to pick it up at a good price with a decent amount of the expansions attached with it i m here to tell you that it was well worth the wait i love all of paradox s clausewitz engine 4x games so it was no surprise that i fell in love with the space version i have to say that with all the additional dlc added and a good sale price this game feels rather content ladden for what i paid which is a good feeling kudos to the paradox boys that burned the midnight oil crafting this fine piece of art so this game is a 4x space empire strategy game you create a custom empire in the distant future where your civilization just mastered a form of faster than light travel or ftl the game randomly generates your gaming universe and enemy empires based on the slider settings you provide and off you go it s the standard random planets and debris orbiting a star star lanes connecting those stars if you choose hyperlane ftl and the occasional empire or primitive life form inhabiting one of those stars orbiting planets you can build upgrade buildings on the various grids on your planet just like galciv and the grids randomly have resource bonuses there are different world types habitat bonuses based on your race s dna racial traits good and bad even genetic modification as you unlock more research so you can eventually create a subspecies of your alien race that can live on for example an ice world with an atmosphere most games simply forced you to unlock a habitat research this game actually encourages you to genetically engineer a subspecies or conquer another one brilliant you build ships can customize their item slots with new technology and form fleets with leaders like many other games before this the cool thing about this game is that your ships move around in real time like an rts so there is a bit of command and control with deployment strategy involved raiding tactics or all out battleship slug outs are optional edit ftl was modified to be space hyper lanes only you unlock jump drives much later the ftl overhaul has received much criticism i did not like how the devs changed the game rules without asking or making a new game the game was well established for a good period of time and paradox decided to shake things up for no reason though in retrospect the ftl change did not ruin the game it just pissed off a lot of customers there are ample random story quests to make your game play interesting multiple crisis missions like end game interdimensional species or fallen empires each play thru will be different and supply a different set of challenges diplomacy is a key factor in this game and like the other paradox titles in the 4x category diplomacy is feature rich you can create research agreements form alliances federations vassalize an empire incorporate a vassal into your own annex and even form coalitions against dangerous alien mennaces usually that s just you so if you like 4x and have played a paradox title like hearts of iron victoria europa universalis or crusader kings this game is your space version and it s good
