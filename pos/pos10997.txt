this is a potentially very good game core mechanics for city builder simulators are perfect especially after the first global economic update negative reviews come mostly from buhs fixed all since the launch already and paradox economic policies useless dlc prices for bugged product etc differences from any other city builders the game literally simulates every citizen instead of visually represent mathematric calculation thus there is no other city builder like cs2 you face literally same challanges as city designers from real life most of your time you are challanged by traffic issues and this is not like in other games just try it and you ll not decide to refund
