2016 as a lover of rpg games this one is by far the best undertale has a great and very interesting plot that draws people into the world it takes place in depending on the choices you make throughout the game and how much you keep a close eye on things the story is almost always changing somehow weather it s drastically or only small details you could play undertale a million times and you would always see some type of change or secret you didn t see before the characters are well created and you get attached to them as you play i don t know how many times i started to cry or felt bad or sad about the choices i made whenever i reseted the game and started playing from the beginning again every time i finished it it felt like i was seeing old friends again even though they no longer remember me even now after playing and finishing undertale five times i still laugh and smile at the actions of these characters when i see them make the same jokes as they did all the other times another amazing aspect of the game is it s soundtrack the music really sets the mood of the scene weather you re simply at the shop buying supplies or fighting one of the bosses you always feel the emotions that each song creates when it plays it really makes you feel like you re the character in the game not the one controling the character there are even times i listen to some of the songs on the sountrack when i m doing homework and they always fill me with determination to finish it no matter how late at night it is i don t know about anyone else but personally i would love to see toby fox create a sequal to undertale i know if he did i would buy it in an instant
