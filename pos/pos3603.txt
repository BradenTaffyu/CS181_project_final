2022 alright 84 hours and 84 achievements i do believe it s my time to say something omori is my favorite game at this point in my life from start to finish the story mechanics and art were all perfect is the game itself perfect no of course not nothing is perfect i even cherrypicked a bunch of flaws just for this review such as some menus being clunky pluto s spaceline being a slog some battles especially earlygame ones not being balanced as they should and mr jawsum s entire fight my favorite part about omori is that the events are very real and might have happened to someone on this earth at one point in time i don t like calling the characters characters in this game because they are written so realistically it feels like i knew them at one point in time i ve never been that social of a person and even now as i m finishing up college i m starting to feel like sunny unsure of what to do with a not so bright past i m not one to express my emotions much while playing games but this game has brought a few tears to my eyes and a few chills down my spine after the fifth playthrough they re not as prevalent anymore but i still remember the first time i heard it means everything and omori those two tracks and the scenes they re associated with are my reminders of why this game is perfect to me at least omocat if you re reading this which you probably aren t and i don t mind but thank you for making this game i ve always been interested in game development from a young age and i ve dabbled in it for a large portion of my life but omori was finally the thing that got me to get off my ass and start making something in rpg maker mz it s not big it s only a fangame of a certain franchise i like but i m pulling out all the stops for it i got artists musicians programmers everyone i wish i could do it all myself but i d probably be dead before i even get the script started tl dr i love omori i love you you inspired me a lot i m excited to see if you ll make more games and thanks again oyasumi
