2016 virtual chores are funtl dr 7 10 could stand to have more automation and relationships would be better if fleshed out or given more weightso this is my first review that i m totally not doing for community badge reasons of anything since high school so bear with me the story is your farmer grandpa died gave you the deed to his farm and told you to wait until the monotony of life was too much before revealing you have a farm i d rather have all the wasted cubicle years back but whatever method you think is best gramps you arrive to find your farm is all weeds and there s no clean all button not to mention there are a lot of people you don t know and what they want from you is also unclear which brings me to my first complaint consequences are not explainedyou could chalk this up to learn by doing but there are some things that you want to know beforehand i wish i d known that putting coops and barns can be fairly permanent when starting it s a costly lesson when you find out you can t move the barn somewhere more efficient or that your livestock prefer to eat grass which is hard to do when you place it right next to your crop rows you also make permanent decisions early in the game without knowing the full weight of what you re doing the cave your chosen level improvements etc second time around things are going to go well but my first run hit a point where i regretted half the choices i made but there wasn t much to do about it not to mention how many times i wasted valuable goods on people thinking they d appreciate them which brings me to my second complaint relationships are complicated yet too simplified what does that mean though mister conflicting statements let me go get my pen and paper and i ll explain first you need pen and paper or the wiki i m guilty to remember what people like and luck or the wiki i m guilty to figure out what they love sure you get little hints here and there but when you re limited to two dialogue lines per day per person it can be daunting to find useful information for everyone in a timely manner so your alternative is to just give them stuff and hope they like it but it s roulette barring a few late game items everyone s tastes are wildly different i thought people would like things that i poured blood sweat and tears into to get and they call it garbage my gold star pomegranete is amazing not eh that void essence you re holding required me risking my life to get and you could never hope to get any yourself so don t call it disgusting valuable items aren t necessarily valuable to much of anyone except yourself and it d be nice to have each person s likes loves hates documented in game somehow i doubt it d be hard to make something visually pleasing and people would be less likely to spoil the lists online give me a tractor or farmhandsi love waking up and finding all my beautiful crops grown and ready for picking alllllll of them ready for picking water is automated by sprinklers which is a blessing but you can easily spend your entire day seeding or harvesting i know i can decide not to harvest or seed to do other things but when you have a large enough operation it feels like they control your actions more than you do you want to go work on that dungeon but you also want to horde money like a dragon and want that deluxe barn because sheep are awesome i know it defeats the purpose of virtual chores to have a way to shortuct them but it d still be satisfying to have farmhands those joja mart employees would do better with some sun anyway to pick the stuff through the day or even a tractor to do mass seeding it s slow going on your own with that giant plot of land minor complaint but that s why this game is still highly recommended by me that reminds me i should mention why i love this game it s harvest moon meets animal crossingthis is awesome i get to design a house and create a plant based empire i get to find some hot girl and marry her 3 penny but if i was inclined i could choose a guy a very progressive move that s luckily becoming more common in games you can even make a family there s also a nice variety of extracurriculars such as fishing dungeon crawling gambling cooking and some interesting backstory to find out for everyone there s some pretty funny drama hidden in stardew valley progression is cleverly donewith games like stardew valley a common pitfall is losing steam and getting bored with having to make your own goals you build your own pyramid and then you feel the tedium set in stardew valley however cleverly sucks you in with its community center a decrepit buildilng inhabited by magic jelly monsters that help you fix it up by turning in goods you acquire throughout specific means completing bundled minor tasks leads to major rewards such as the beloved greenhouse a building that allows you to grow any crop regardless of season i m one bundle away from finishing the game so i can t tell you what happens when everything is done but the mystery will keep you going gameplay is solid all aroundyou will never feel like anything you do in stardew valley feels sloppy combat is retro there s a block button but you can usually dodge most monsters with a little bit of weaving it could be argued it s too simplistic but i prefer the legend of zelda feel following suit fishing is easy to pick up hard to master farming is pretty straightforward with tools that are upgradable all in all the result is soothing mixed with bits of flare that being said don t die in the dungeons it is awful and terrible and i can not agree with the punishment the developers decided for it see for yourself if you dare a perfectly soothing ambianceif i wasn t such a productive farmer i d get space out and enjoy the music i m not such a good farmer that i was able to ignore the pitter patter of the rain on my humble home s roof the music is subtly charming while also engrossing and addictive i find myself in the town s saloon late at night flipping through the jukebox finding the song serving as my current earwig they truly compliment the 16bit style of the game too the pixel characters are also given detail with their dialogue portaits making for characters that feel more rounded bad pun fully intended if you don t like the character portraits though you can change it because the game is highly moddableit s surprising for a game like this to be moddable but it is i haven t delved deep into this but judging from the available mods here on steam stardew valley is a canvas open to the creative interpretation of anyone with an idea i m seriously contemplating downloading the anime penny of my dreams in conclusionthere s much and more left out of this review but if you take anything away from this please let it be this your grandpa s wish is personified when you play the game after so many overstimulating titles full of action stress and competition it s nice to settle down and get away from it all in stardew valley
