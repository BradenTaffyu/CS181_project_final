2020 as is the game is hard to recommend thanks to technical issues it needs some mods to be good but then the experience can be awesome granted the main quest is kinda poo poo but there are many quest mods out there and the far harbor dlc isn t too bad or so i ve heard i m yet to play it as of writing this review here are a few core mod suggestions that i find impossible to play without mostly for technical reasons full dialog interface reverb and ambiance overhaul high fps physics fix raw mouse input key remapping done proper immersive reflex sights dynamic interior fog removal hud plus plus no more cash register sound if you don t have this you get an annoying ch ching every time you get xp a la place an object kill an enemy etc remove helmet in dialog place everywhere pip boy flashlight adds dynamic shadows to your flashlight weightless junk bullet counter reloadthere are many mods i could recommend but those would be additions or changes to the game whereas the ones i provided above fix core issues with the game that should really come standard especially raw mouse input and high fps physics fix if you re left handed or use anything besides wasd you should also get key remapping done proper as the game doesn t actually rebind most of the keys and doesn t have all of the options in its options menu
