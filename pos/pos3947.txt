2021 a while back i tried darkest dungeon and i was constantly googling items and strategies trying to figure out what does what and i was always stressed that i was going to do the wrong thing slay the spire is the total opposite of that experience everything is intuitive i have hardly googled anything to find out what it does it just immediately makes sense and rather than being scared to try things out i can t wait to see what every card does the game makes you feel like you re actually good at it even if you re not that good at it even though it s rng based i never found it in my ten hours to be really unfair sometimes you get a garbage hand but maybe your next hand will work and i even died multiple times without wishing pain on the creators of the game and that is the best compliment i can give
