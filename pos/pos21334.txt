2021 product received for free this game is amazingly good for its price endless styles of play with the factions sandbox unit creator is wonderful and the secrets that s part of what i like in games i love easter egg type things in early access the game was really good but everybody was just like why is there no multiplayer now that there is and with all the new ideas and secrets i wouldn t hesitate to give this game overwhelmingly positive however the toll for graphics on mid to low end pc s is a bit laggy but i can live with that i 110 reccomend this game to all
