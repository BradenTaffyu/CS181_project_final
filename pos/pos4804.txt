2017 it s very hard to review fallout 4 without comparing it to the previous games new vegas is my all time favorite fallout game and one of the greatest rpgs i have ever played fallout 4 is not new vegas it was not made by obsidian this is 100 a bethesda game with that said i have put 70 hours into the base game and will continue to play through the dlc after writing this i have all of the base game achievements so i think i have a good understanding about all this game has to offer positives world building this is something bethesda has always done well you know you are in a post apocalyptic world the moment you step out of vault 111 and the feeling of helplessness is seen all over the commonwealth as you travel further into boston the atmosphere is fantastic there are plenty of gloomy and foggy nights to make the outside world spooky the ambient music just adds to this exploration is probably the best part of the game this is no surprise and you will find yourself spending dozens of hours wandering around old parking garages and abandoned factories just hoping to find some lore backstory and loot combat is significantly improved over new vegas and fallout 3 it feels a lot less janky and more responsive weapon and armor mods add much needed customization to your gear and not having to constantly repair allows you to focus on making the best piece of gear possible settlement building is a lot more interesting than i initially thought you are really given a lot of tools to build whatever buildings you want plenty of companions to wander the wasteland with they each have their own set of traits and interesting personality they aren t mass effect 2 level characters but it s a nice bonus negatives the rpg portion of this game is about as light as you can get it s like they spent the budget on fixing the combat and adding a minecraft meta game into fallout but completely lost the plot on what originally made the series popular here s a hint it wasn t the feel of the combat it was allowing a character to get out of a tense situation purely through dialog if they wanted or killing everyone in the main city because they felt like it and were role playing a lunatic character building has taken a nose dive into irrelevant i remember being able to talk with scientists while having 100 science and 10 intellect back in new vegas and feeling like my choice to role play a scientist was perfectly acceptable i have 11 int and am maxed out on most science perks in fallout 4 and i can not think of a single situation where it was useful during a quest or when talking to a person remember how cool it was to get some additional information about a quest by using your 40 100 barter skill in new vegas remember when you built a 1 int character in the original fallout that could not complete basic sentences remember when you could use your 100 speech to beat the end quest without firing a single bullet none of these are a thing in fallout 4 all you have is charisma that gets you out of the occasional dialog option but offers very little else settlements are not as interesting after playing past the 10 hour mark initially they are really cool but they don t really make sense mechanically the settlements themselves are filled with no name npcs literally called settler that have no personality and are forgotten almost instantly gameplay wise there s no benefit to building out a settlement to completion stores were a missed opportunity to at least make a cool little economic and business mini game out of the investment but instead they just offer another vendor you can sell your 32 aluminum cans to overall fallout 4 is a competent game that continues to split the series in both a positive and negative path on one hand bethesda continues to make a cinematic world with countless adventures and plenty of nice feeling combat however what they continue to lose is the magic that made the original fallout and fallout 2 game stand out over 20 years ago the feeling of playing the game how you want to and allowing the character to comfortably use their skills to overcome every obstacle 8 10 i am very biased to elder scrolls fallout
