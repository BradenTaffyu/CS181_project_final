early access review i absolutely love this game not only is the art style stunning but the character s dialogues are well thought out and entertaining to read this title takes inspiration from other farming sims in a very impressive way through their implementation of player friendly mechanics it s clear that the developers of this game love all the same games a lot of us in this community do and have made this game with nothing but high hopes for what this genre can be if handled with care it s very touching to see a studio like this grow their community by keeping in touch with them responding to them and actively working towards making the game better than it already is even if you re not a fan of this genre you ll find things to love about this title because it really is a breath of fresh air i really am so excited to see what this game has in store for its future updates and have now become a loyal fan to anyone who read this and hasn t bought it yet please do and support the devs you won t regret it 33
