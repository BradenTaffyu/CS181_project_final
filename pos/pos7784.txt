2021 early access review the best driving simulator period unmatched soft body physics customization sounds graphics everything in beamng is close to perfection and the game is still in early access the only feature it lacks is visual customization liveries stickers bodykits etc but these aren t available in many autosims looking at you assetto corsa lots of quality mods which include cars maps and a freaking jato rocket ensure you ll have hundreds of hours of fun here touge track drift rally time attack offroad rock crawling drag and with zero level loading screens just a few seconds to switch your car zero dlcs intuitive interface and built in gamepad support are also here 10 10 worth your time and money update v0 24 where negative reviews come fromafter the major ui overhaul a lot of negative reviews were posted many of those call the game literally unplayable which is obviously greatly exaggerated unlike the other stated problem lost controller presets that one is actually unpleasant to deal with judging from the reviewers words since i myself didn t experience a single problem with my dualshock4 nor with the game itself but yet it was not a force majeure that could not be avoided as every major update comes after a teaser which should be a sign for everyone with a custom preset to save or write it down just in case the update affects it to sum up beamng drive is still a nearly perfect rated game and a lot of the negative reviews are to put it mildly unjustified update i love the new covet
