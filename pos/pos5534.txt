2023 early access review i bought a new game today i tried mugging a mans house and got mauled to death i explored a bit tried mugging a mans house and got mauled to death picked the turtle character because he looked cool came across some ruins by sheer luck gained luminesence and the ability to shoot lightbeams out of my bare hands proceeded to almost die to 3 fish that hate jews attained extreme riches in water due me being lost in the woods contracted an extreme allergic reaction to people punching me due me sticking my arm too close to a contagious fungus found then killed a tribe of baboons and their queen by roleplaying as a long range artillery cannon made a mask to not only taunt the baboons but also celebrate my victory got jumped on and brutally disassembled by the remaining wildlife population due my allergies acting up rip tutfcukyeah i think its going pretty well so far
