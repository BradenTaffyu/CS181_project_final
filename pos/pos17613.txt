2016 the game along with my disappointment over the current console generation that inspired me to upgrade from my old a6 powered laptop and build my first gaming pc my only regret is that i didn t do it sooner total war is up there as one of my favorite game series warhammer 40k are my favorite fictional universes thankfully ca have done a good job of bringing the two together and continue to improve on the base game with some decent dlc except the blood gore one this really should have been part of the base game beastmen is overpriced while the game has its issues legendary lords are way too op even given the source material ai is missile unit heavy many overworld and diplomacy exploits it runs great can be really challenging i now save scum on every turn before every battle and is just a fun nerdy time sink total war warhammer total war warhammer does exactly what is says on the tin
