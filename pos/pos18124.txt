2014 new army tradition feature is great graphics are very variable and game will work on low or high quality machines ai are much better and try to fight against you with more tactics unlike in shogun 2 total war where if they knew they would win would charge everyone in straight away even on legendary great modding community very large map to conquer multiple ways to win worse than older total war games very glitchy and feels unfinished not well balanced units you can win with an army of pikemen as they are extremely over powered multiplayer campain can be really glitchy and crash the unit cards all look the same not a very large variety of units to choose from
