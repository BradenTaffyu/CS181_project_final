2020 if you re up for hours of finger cramping and sweaty hands keyboard and mouse gameplay this is a really great game to struggle through with friends or even strangers the story levels dream levels are extremely fun to play and i absolutely love how some of the achievements for the game are out of the way and some may be time consuming in addition to the dream levels there are hundreds of workshop maps that will cater to your liking parkour maps puzzle maps i e mazes riddles sudoku puzzles etc hide and seek maps battle arenas i e sword or lightsaber fighting bunnyhopping maps etc although i do have to say that finding a really good map after playing all the most popular ones of all time is a bit like finding a needle in a haystack but it s worth it the levels are meant for you to get from spawn to the exit and there are a couple of tutorial tools in the beginning of the game to help you dream level called mansion and mountain so all those reviews about not knowing what to do in game did not pay attention to the voice overs or the helpful hints if you play a lot of the workshop maps and can handle the language barrier i do recommend downloading the google translate app on your phone to translate the foreign maps mainly chinese cons 1 there is camera bobbing which can get pretty annoying and the initial few hours of playing this game will give you a headache motion sickness so beware of that my friends and i got used to it eventually 2 at certain times of the day if you re playing on a public lobby either hosting or joining a random lobby there will be a lot of people especially children under the age of 15 who will troll you so also be cautious of that 3 sometimes when you re hosting a lobby some of the interactive parts of the workshop maps will show as moving for you but not for the other people in your lobby this is more of a unity thing from the map s creator part they may have forgotten to code some of the nodes or whatever for multiplayer version 4 if you are hosting or joining an online multiplayer lobby get used to the lag that follows whenever a new person joins the lobby or just the lag between you and the host lag happens get used to it lastly i concocted a list of great maps to start off with a friend s on reddit enjoy feel free to add me on steam if you want to play with someone i ll be glad to show you the ropes if you actually want to find someone to play with at any given time or have questions regarding unity workshop building or some technical stuff join the official human fall flat discord server for a quicker response
