2016 early access review my only cook grub got gut worms somehow and now hates everything and constantly goes beserk trying to kill everyone so the solution was to remove his stomach for some reason though he wasn t happy with that and began to attack all my colonists during a raid attack the next day he got a disease which i believe he spread to my hunter we now have no source of food or anyone to cook it then grub went beserk when my doctor was trying to heal him my doctor couldn t heal grub in time since he was injured himself and grub died to his severe illness and my colony soon died of starvation i hate grub but i love this game
