2021 early access review this review was made for alpha 19 some should still hold up till this day but i wouldn t count it also this was my first review so take everything with a tad of rose tinted glasses sooo i ve played this game for some time i haven t played it as much as other people but i have enough loneliness to make a mini review out of it gameplay 8 5 10 the gameplay is really good in my opinion it needs some work here and there but overall really good the guns feel punchy and powerfull according to the tier level it is and you really feel when you upgrade from a pistol level 1 to a level 2 3 4 5 the other parts of gameplay such as exploring looting farming etc are really well made as well looting feels rewarding specially in 90 gamestages and oh boy looting those big boys factorys is rewarding in all the word normally with secret recepies of the respective company expample shotgun messia gives auto shotty craft shamway gives the secret shamway recepie farming is self explanatory is just that can t be better can t be worse but it feels rewarding enough to make you max out the farming perks gettin 3 food outta 1 crop ain t mining is pretty basic but rewarding and make money outta the rare minerals is just another plus the quests are just simple but simple is what we like on a zombie game want to get paid for crushing the skulls of those dumbasses and get paid for it then the vendors and notes around the world will be pleased to take your services exploring is one of the most important ones it s a open world voxel game duh and it s pretty fun to go around finding wacky but cool stuff tho exploring can get repetitive that s why different bioms exist and they make this aspect way and when i say way i mean it less repetitive the towns mines tall ass buildings makes it worth doing you don t know when a tier 6 shotty could be just around the corner the feeling of wanting more makes it fun the feeling of being a zombie ass kicker makes you keep playing why cuz it s fun history uhhh i don t really know about this one the thing i know is that you are a soldier that got saved by one of the clubs in the apocalypse before hand the entire world went to cuz of a nuclear bomb radiation being the reason why you can t leave the map from ww2 i m sorry for not informing myself but let s be honest none of us played this game for it s almost invisible history art style 9 10 oh this game on a19 is beautiful everything looks cartoony but almost realistic somehow the devs are geniuses for making this graphics i love them but there s a problem with this i ll talk about later dev team cool guys the dev team might be taking their time but they are sure making the game feel fresh and new with each new update heck they are even kicking a a20 dev stream series they are not quick but they are efficient and if the game is good i don t care if my grandson has to play the final version of the game i ll wait what it takes optimization 6 5 10 well it s not great i ll just say that it s good enough but the games runs bad for how the game looks and in which settings you have it in it s definitely better than before much much much better than before but the dev team is probably gonna fix it on future version as already said we have time a lot of time conclusion i love this game i truly don t care how many time i have to wait to see it finished do i recommend it yes if you like freedom on merciless idiot slaying then yes and playing it with a buddy is even more fun so if you re up for this game then start killing some zombies already i didn t touch crafting and skill tree cuz it s something that i think is better you understand and find your own playstyle but if you need help there s a hella lot of guides for you there so have a great dayalso you kouha
