2015 early access review this game would be like if left 4 dead and minecraft had a baby bam crafting survival game and it s the best of both worlds when you start out you just loot the world kill your own food and then you desperately find a place to make a shelter or hold up in the abandoned buildings at night hoping no zombies find you then you will die and die and die and then you play with your friends and you both die and die and die until you finally level up enough and start crafting good stuff pros nice looking 3d environment with physics no random fort building in the sky for this game it would fall on your head and kill you plus there are many different biomes to explore from snowy mountains to deserts crafting adds so much more value to the game rather than running around just shooting zombies they throw everything at you when you least expect it hostile animals hordes of zombies zombie dogs to randomly attack your base even during the day it makes for great gameplay because you never know what is going to happen and when leveling up system that improves your crafting and stats plus you get hunger and thirty stats adding to the survival aspect it s fun to see your character evolve into a wasteland bad mofo especially when you start out naked you get sick and can break bones adding to the realistic feel of the game you never think while playing this game yeah right that would never happen in real life well minus the zombie apocalypse that is that might not ever happen in real life cons a little too difficult for single player alone it s really only good with co op hackers if you forget to set your server to private anyone can join and i ve had several hackers who will join my game just to mess things up too challenging to upgrade items weapons etc the game didn t start that way but it keeps getting updated and every time it gets harder and more unbalanced you run around for days with a crappy bow that can barely kill anything making it almost impossible to loot the houses where zombies spawn in hoards when you play single player the modeling for characters is really weak ugly and there are few options for things like hair styles you basically end up looking like your buddy so it would almost be better to scrap it and just give us 5 or so pre made characters to choose from no hints or tutorials you just get thrown in figure it out for yourself genuis a quick how to craft tutorial would be really beneficial to the first time player especially since it s challenging from the moment you are thrown into the world with almost nothing very minimal lag but there is some especially when you get overwhelmed with the undead but the bugs in this game impressively non existent in short there is no causal play for this game it keeps you on edge the entire time and although it s very difficult to play alone it s still well worth it you can easily drop hours on this game and not even know where the time went worth 25 bucks totally it feels like a completed game even in just the late alpha stage and i m excited to see where it goes from here
