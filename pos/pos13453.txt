2018 great game i really love playing it nothing wrong with the gameplay it is a truely awesome game the physics are very fun with various degrees of accuracy there is nothing more satisfying than watching your spaceship finally make it into orbit after countless failures and their resulting explosions the ships are relativly easy to build and flying them is simple yet responsive if you build them right of course you can build anything from planes to missiles to rockets to some combination of all three the little green kerbal s reactions seen in the bottom right corner are hilarious and its always sad to see that static take their place after a horrible crash however the changes in the eula have made it possible for this game to collect and give your private information sometimes without asking i would recommend you go and read the eula for yourself to see how this collection is handled and form your own opinion go check it out at the take 2 games webite people may have a problem with the way so in conclusion great game would recommend but to quote the eula if you do not want your information used or shared in this manner then you should not use the software note comments were disabled for this review because of someone refusing to let people think something other than they do if you really have something important that you think i may have missed in my thorough reading of the privacy policy and eula then you can contact me through discord at frightcrafter 1092
