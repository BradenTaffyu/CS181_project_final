2023 early access review please try this game i know it looks like it s dwarf fortress i d be lying if i said there weren t similarities but this game is very much it s own thing you aren t managing a town you are exploring a universe it s one of the best games ever made you don t believe me and it s because the ui ux would have been considered bad if it was made twenty five years ago forgive it you ll thank yourself the depth of interactions that this game system allow are absolutely unbelievable the world is so intricate storied and unlike any other fictive setting that s out there you can and should turn iron man off turn on save points at least until you learn what you should be afraid of the true joy of this game is getting to explore something unique
