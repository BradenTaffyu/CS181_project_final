2018 i was so excited when i heard about this game i played so many hours of theme hospital that i could probably program a copy of the game for you by memory two point hospital what a name sega brought back so many good memories of this game for me i have played just about non stop since buying it and i absolutely love it if you were a fan of theme hospital or you like management strategy games this is a must have the game is just like theme hospital only better and so much more in depth you are basically the manager of the hospital you make every decision pertaining to everything about the hospital who to hire where they will work what to charge people for services food entertainment you decide the layout of the rooms and what goes in them this game lets you decide basically everything even how long your staff can go on break and so much more some managment games give you control of some things but in my opinion two point hospital is the definition of a management game the graphics are great and i am running the game on a laptop i bought to do my college course work on it s not anything special and it still runs the game great i have seen some of the bad reviews on here and the only thought i had after reading them was that the person playing the game writing the review just didn t know what they were doing or how to effectively manage their hospital the only time i have had any of my patients get stuck was if the layout of the room wasn t right all i needed to do was move a few things around and bam they were off on their path to a cure these so called bugs that are causing patients to get stuck that everyone keeps talking about i just don t think they exist and if they do they are definitely not game breaking the patients that i have had get stuck even let you know they are stuck by displaying an icon above their head that tells you to please help them after the first few tutuorial levels you really need to get into managing the hospital or it will go south on you really quick it s not hard though it s actually quite easy to hit the first star and move on to the next hospital or stay and grow your current one into a 3 star health care utopia all i am saying is don t put all your eggs into one bad review especially from someone who has only played a short time this game is great and the devs are actively trying to address any issues anyone may be having i have had none and am enjoying every minute of it don t miss out on this great game
