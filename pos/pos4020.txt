2020 slay the spire is a game i bought at some point in 2018 it was still in early access then and the only characters available back then were ironclad and silent both were great introductions to the game in my opinion with ironclad being used for your real tutorial and training silent s run was much easier to finish at the time anyway i decided to shelve it pending full release and some new characters which has since happened and so i revisited the game over the last few days storynot really you go in kick ass and try to reach and slay the heart of the spire you will begin as ironclad but once you defeat the spire or get enough experience points you can unlock silent rinse and repeat to unlock the defect and finally the watcher gameplayslay the spire is a roguelike card game where your goal is to build and refine the best decks you can for each of the four available characters each character has a different skill set and mostly different card loadouts and unlocks additionally each character will start with a relic which functionally provide buffs and timed abilities although some might instead bear a curse or an ability that might as well be a curse lol as you play through runs whether you complete them or not you ll basically earn xp for said character which as mentioned above can be used to unlock other available characters but there are only four but can also be used to unlock a new set of three cards to be added to your deck win or lose every run will net at least a few points actual gameplay is strategy with a dose of rng so you ll need to plan proper timing and use of your cards to maximize your offense and defense you have health points as do your opponents when someone reaches zero they are dead you also can erect shields and you have shield points as such which absorb damage until your block number has been exceeded nothing new there the cards are pretty diverse and have interesting pros and cons depending on the card whether it is a combo card a single use card and so on will face three chapter bosses total to finish a run although you can fight plenty of mini bosses along the way and they tend to have the best loot the maps are node style as is popular with card roguelikes in addition to enemy hexes there are rest hexes where you can heal up or upgrade a card there are merchant hexes and mystery hexes mystery hexes might have enemies or might have treasure might have a merchant or they could have a random encounter that might be good bad or somewhere in between merchants sells relics potions and cards and can also be hired to remove curses or other cards that you don t want in your deck any longer after battles loot includes coins for merchant shops relics and potions potions are single use items and you have three total potion slots available they run the gamut from buffs to resurrection graphicsthe graphics in sts are nice if you ve played any of the recent 2 d roguelikes in general such as darkest dungeon for example you ve got a good idea what this game looks like slay the spire is less cel shaded and more anime colorful and full of life in general though overall i thought the artwork and animations were all well done with plenty of diversity and nice color schemes this is a pleasing game to look at map itself though is pretty bare bones and the menu interfaces are likewise nothing of particular note off does anyone else think the merchant is telling you to off every time you walk up and several times between then and when you leave beyond that though audio is fairly limited to the actual sounds of combat and game interface and it is all done well well i say that but there is also that soundtrack and holy hell is it awesome seriously it s one of those osts you might listen to while not playing slay the spire verdictslay the spire is excellent whether you bought it outright as i did or got it through a humble monthly it s a game that really deserves to be played a lot of work has gone into the base game and the daily challenges keep everything fresh plus there are leaderboards and mods slay the spire is the epitome of a game that just keeps on giving i really can t think of any negatives other than the fact that it could benefit from another two characters being added and hopefully the devs will consider doing so before moving on to slay the spire 2 but even if they didn t this would be an easy recommendation at full price and a must own must play game in general if you found this review helpful and would be interested in supporting my curator group it would be appreciated cheers
