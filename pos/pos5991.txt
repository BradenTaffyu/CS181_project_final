2020 the base game is deplorable in the complete lack of content it brings and is virtually unplayable by itself the game can however be really fun with the addition of a few good dlcs on sale and mods here are the ones i recommend vs don t recommend having played with most of the expansions except eco lifestyle highly recommended 1 sims 4 get together the most underrated sims expansion pack allows you to create unique mini communities that your sim would be part of either it be family or coworkers or hobby groups super useful in everyday game play i use it to make family gatherings after work hangouts holiday parties etc the groups also allow you to modify other sim s behaviour based on your expectations which really adds realism to the game play 2 sims 4 cats dogs pets in the sims are a favourite of mine sucks that we don t have horses like the sims 3 but i am overall very happy with the cats dogs expansion and i like the new vet career as well 3 sims 4 seasons self explanatory adds seasons to your game sims behave differently based on different seasons also adds holidays like thanksgiving christmas valentines day etc highly recommend for varied game play 4 sims 4 parenthood adds activities to toddlers children teens in the game allows sims to parent their kids you can give kids chores ground them reward punish them for specific behaviours etc and these actions will have impacts on your child develops more importantly this is a game pack so it is only half of the price of the expansion packs 5 sims 4 dine out same logic as parenthood allows your sim to eat at restaurants also manage your own restaurant one of my personal favourites one of the better game packs you can get a lot of hours out of this pack also super good for rags to riches challenges medium recommended 1 sims 4 city living allows you to live in cities and brings apartments to the game also adds various festivals to the game which are good outing spots really good expansion pack but ranked lower because i don t like how in the sims 4 they split sims 3 late night into three expansion packs city living get famous and vampires 2 sims 4 get famous allows you to become famous actor streamer dj adds new world which is equivalent to la in the real world with gated communities and hot venues really enjoyed the actor and streamer careers and i think the concept of the pack is good highly recommended for anyone who enjoyed playing with fame in previous sims games again ranked lower because i don t like how they split one expansion pack into three expansion packs 3 sims 4 university allows sims to go to university not essential to game play since sim s don t really need degree to get jobs in the sims 4 however it is well made and recommended for people who enjoyed the university expansions in the previous sims entries 4 sims 4 realm of magic vampires essentially ea broke up sims 4 supernaturals and sold them in individual game packs which is good in my opinion because then you can just purchase the occult sims that you were interested in the realm of magic and vampire game packs actually went into each occult sim wizard vampires in more details that the sims 3 in my opinion rank medium because i think occult sims are not essential to game play but they are really fun and i would recommend picking up these two game packs when you get the chance so so recommended 1 sims 4 island living allows you to travel to the island world of sulani adds mermaid to the game in my opinion this should have been a game pack instead of an expansion pack i am disappointed that they took out the resort management system that was in sims 3 island paradise and i do not think this expansion much content compared to the other ones 2 sims 4 get to work adds several playable careers to the game including doctor scientist and detective the careers are actually really fun especially on the first few play throughs the drawback is that the tasks gets repetitive after a while so i wish more variety was added to the mid to high stages of the career 3 sims 4 jungle adventure sims 3 world adventures turned into a game pack adds archeology into the game good pack but ranked lower because limited replayability and also doesn t appeal to everyone 4 sims 4 tiny living stuff laundry day stuff romantic garden stuff the top of the stuff packs tiny living stuff because it adds interesting concepts objects to the game laundry stuff because it was a community voted pack and the build items in that pack are awesome romantic garden stuff because it adds good landscaping objects weakly recommended 1 sims 4 spa day outdoor retreat bowling night will use once or twice not that important to game play 2 all the other stuff packs and whatnot packs by ea only recommended for avid fans of the series who have a lot of to spend not recommended 1 sims 4 luxury party stuff almost 1 per item do not get unless you already got it ugly items that you will never use 2 sims 4 strangerville not a bad idea but zero replay value once you ve been through it once use your money on some other game if you must get it 3 sims 4 eco lifestyle reviews have been horrible there are many bugs reported online community action plans are a hot mess do not get it until ea fixes it
