2019 gosh how had i not reviewed this previously more than a game it s a zen like way of life there s nothing quite like delivering tons of potatoes to bratislava on a rainy evening with slovak pop music radio for company you know what this game is all about by now so if you re yet to play it but it still intrigues you in even some small way i urge you to give it a go it s a lovingly made trip along some beautiful european roads and a gaming experience unlike any other well you know american truck simulator aside of course to rather shamelessly edit this review at steam awards time a thankful shout out to scs for their ongoing work on this game it is indeed a labour of love and very worthy of a nomination for that steam award incidentally areas of the map that date back to the initial release are still being lovingly revisited and given a polish to bring them more into line with the more recently added content wonderful stuff late 2023 addendum this may of course be more a product of the further deterioration of my very old pc but ets2 does seem to ask more of a machine these days as indicated by the recent ish revision of the recommended specs it should look and run very well on anything vaguely modern however and scs continue their terrific work in revisting and retouching some of the more dated areas of the game maps sadly my truck must remain garaged for now unfortunately as my pc just can t keep up i miss my volvo
