2018 forenotei apologize if this review doesn t appear as crisp as others on this page as i don t write them often that said i feel this is one that absolutely warrants doing so i ll attempt to spare you copious amounts of gushing in favor of clearer more concise points as i go though you should be aware that i ve always had a weakness for games like this your mileage as it will in all things may vary positives craftsmanship excellent clear attention to detail and passion funneled into worldbuilding there is a lot to see hear and learn in rivellon and you d be amazed at where and from whom this knowledge comes from character depth glaringly flawed in some areas but otherwise great whether pre built avatars or enlisted as companions in the game itself the game s cast of characters is unique and brimming with their own motives thoughts and ideas likewise those you do take with you aren t just along for the ride and will actively attempt to make an impact on your adventure nuance and build variety excellent anything is possible within some very loose limitations provided you re willing to work to put it together gameplay good turn based strategy type combat similar in nature to xcom with some departures in the form of such things as character specific initiative larian s systems have a few issues though and a fair number of them can be really really frustrating to deal with story great not the most amazing story i ve experienced but definitely worth the time it doesn t pull punches and if nothing else it is profoundly immersive graphics excellent far above and beyond what is often expected of this genre and despite the abundance of particle effects and bodies on screen it runs smoothly to boot soundtrack fair nothing to write home about sadly it can absolutely set up a mood but it never struck me as anything i d carry with me beyond the game itself negatives equality of companion storytelling not every character was written equal and it shows some have little to no impact on the story overall while others quite literally change the perspective of everything going on taking those that land in the former category invariably trades interesting character dialogue interations and bonding for what has the potential to be some of the more interesting tid bits about the lore important figures and what not gameplay inconsistent autosave mechanic makes it easy to lose hours of progress if you re not particular about saving over and over again items acquired during that lost time are not guaranteed to exist upon a reload nor will they have the same stats as the game rerolls everything you do not presently own each time you reload initiative can be annoying and it creates opportunities for more powerful enemies to murder a member or members of your party before you can even act if you aren t careful endgame i feel no shame in admitting divinity s stronger moments are in its first half where you re getting to know the world and the people you re traveling with a lot of crazy fantastical things happen but it all serves to further motivate you to seek out the real and honest truth sadly however a lot of the payoff isn t quite as stellar as i was hoping it d be in an effort to keep from spoiling anything i ll clip this bullet with some of the final decisions can feel a little forced and as resolutions approach it becomes painfully obvious that as above not all companions and characters were written equal overalldivinity in spite of what are ostensibly minor flaws with the exception of some of the story related notes is a game that i wholeheartedly reccomend if you re a fan of the top down dungeon crawler rpg style of game it has a lot of heart and the world is very well put together while there are some inconsistencies some painfully overt nyah nyah moments with the game s villains and a general undertone of slight predictability to its story it pulled me in and got me hooked on all the little details it had to offer my only major gripe from a roleplaying standpoint is how well for lack of a better word weak some of the resolutions are at best it can feel a little forced and at worst some of the endings to several of the arcs in my playthroughs struck me as outright betrayals of everything that had been built up in an effort to avoid spoilers beyond what little i already have this is something best experienced and decided in person as for gameplay divinity offers a rather open ended system that can be tweaked and paired in a vast number of ways it helps keep combat engaging and it offers a great deal of replayability as there are always new ways to try tackling different situations that said it has some very serious flaws that i found somewhat stifling not the least of which being encounters with tougher enemies with a party that wasn t solidly invested in high initiative scores others such as strange inconsistencies with line of sight action points and other integral mechanics were certainly noticeable but hardly game breaking not much of a change from the first game there i m afraid in all i d rate this a 4 5 i would have been comfortable paying more than its asking price for the experience i got
