2016 early access review gorgeous game so well written even though early access it feels really polished initially the lack of voice acting was my only bane and still kind of is but i can understand why with the amount of writers in this game as opposed to the first only 2 writers for divinity original sin there s triple that for this and voicing the game would take years conversations feel a lot more in depth too and i found myself voluntarily reading it as opposed to just skipping which is what i ended up doing on original sin not that it was boring i loved the voice acting just got very tedious in my opinion worth the money tbh i am very proud to know that i am supporting larian studios on this journey if you haven t got dos2 and have been thinking about it for a while it s worth it
