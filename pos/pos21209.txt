2021 i bought this game the day early access came out i ve been playing it for quite some time so i should hopefully know what i m talking about in this review firstly totally accurate battle simulator tabs as the name suggests is a battle simulator it s enjoyable and you can sink hours and hours into this game at first i ll start with what i find great about this game physics they can be extremely wonky and hilarious at times units as of writing this the game includes around 140 pre made units unit creator being able to make your own units is amazing and honestly i sunk at least 50 hours doing this alone user made content players can create their own campaigns units and then share them with the community the developers while this isn t necessarily the game these are some of the best developers i have seen when it comes to how they interact with their fanbase landfall is extremely friendly and they listen to the community as well community also not exactly the game but the community is great they re welcoming and enjoy sharing their views maps some of the maps in this game are great the newer maps that were released such as fantasy evil good look appealing campaign while i don t play the campaign that often it can be enjoyable controlling units being able to control units while wonky is still fun now to move on to a few things that i have some issues with this is completely my opinion also i didn t mention multiplayer anywhere in this review since i haven t tested it as of writing playtime depending on your attention span as well as if you enjoy the game or not you may get somewhat bored after the 20 hour mark of course this game isn t exactly meant to be played for 4 hours straight but more of a i ll play for half an hour kind of game performance this game s performance can vary quite heavily not from graphics but units since this game is heavy with physics you can expect performance to drop although this is partially my fault as i don t have that great of a computer all in all i d say for twenty dollars this game is worth it it depends on a few things you find interest in but overall it s a solid game not only this but the game is still going to get some content post release such as the hero unit as well as possibly some more units i believe this is a good game that you might want to check out
