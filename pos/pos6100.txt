2020 if you have the base game alone this entry in the series may seem bland and watered down having spent time on the xbox version and now the pc version of this game i can safely say that with the dlcs this is one of the best simulation titles available the staggering price of the content packs at this point can be daunting and i suggest for those of you who are not completionists to just look at add on packs that sound like they add something interesting to the game for your playstyle or preference overall the sims 4 is highly addictive and carries the series well at this point i have sunk many hours into the xbox version and playing it the right way on pc will only add many more
