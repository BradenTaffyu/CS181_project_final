2017 after waiting months for this game it s finally here and i m really impressed with it pros incredible combat mechanics amazing soundtrack enjoyable story no crashes at allcons frame rate locked to 60 fps which is not that bad to be honest at least it s not 30 1920x1080 not working very well the workaround to this is to use the game in windowed mode with the software borderless gaming but it would be better if the devs released a fix
