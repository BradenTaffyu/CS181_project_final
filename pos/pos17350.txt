2023 i m writing this partially as a message to my future self because i am rapidly becoming a huge fan of this game however i have seen what huge fans of this game look like and they don t seem happy either with creative assembly as a whole or how they ve handled this specific game so in case that happens and i become someone furious at the lack of a northern expansion or the balance of the indigenous southern factions let me just say that i love this game i ve played 30 hours i ve finished a campaign and it s the most fun i ve had with any total war game for the first time total war is about people more than armies and anchoring this game around the magnetic personalities of the cast of romance of the three kingdoms gives this game an astonishing amount of character and life that colours so much of the experience with unique mechanics that reflect cao cao s scheming or liu bei s bonds of brotherhood placing the human faces of one of the most popular and influential works of fiction in human history on total war mechanics does so much to enliven them especially when they do superhuman feats of taking on entire regiments by themselves or seeing an ocean of armies part to allow two master swordsmen to duel for the fate of all china it has a lot of the same problems and limitations as most total war games but there are a lot of mechanical changes that i do like total warhammer 2 had even more asymmetrical factions but i found in my brief time with it that i was often frustrated at how often fights between individual units would drag on where it seemed like however i positioned my units however deftly i tried to flank or how many gaps i would leave in my lines the statistically better unit would win time after time and it eventually led to play where i would just line up my armies march them forward and let them fight it out in a big line because i felt so little effect from any attempts at ambush or cleverness here it feels like positioning and tactical play matters so much more i ve won battles handily that the ai insisted i had absolutely no chance of winning through careful positioning of missiles spearmen and a lot of running horsemen around to charge into people from the back with my bro my homie my absolute guy xiaohou dun i ve gotten cocky and turned convincing routs into embarrassing skirmishes that would force me to pull back and reinforce at least on normal difficulty this was not a game about composing the perfectly balanced army it was a game about being clever in the moment about the kind of tactical moves and big plays that someone like cao cao would pull off in the novel it s a game about making you feel like a mastermind just like him about feeling like these larger than life figures and also the quiet sadness of these people dying and falling out of history replaced by people you don t recognise of the emptiness that comes when you defeat your most bitter enemy it is the game that for me has come the absolute closest to fulfilling the intoxicating promise of total war i could be wrong about this maybe in like 5 campaigns time i ll see through the lines of code and into the artifice that underpins all of these kinds of games maybe the majesty and the fantasy will be gone by then but that s why this message exists future me that even though you may not be loving the game now the way you did back then the love that exists now burns so so bright and i don t want you to forget it
