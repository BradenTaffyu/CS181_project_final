2020 early access review beamng should be the driving physics for every game it is that good beamng is seriously the best driving game out there the developers have been providing consistent updates since the game was released into early access back in 2015 i remember playing the demo for hours on end before the game came out on steam because this game is seriously so much fun the community and mods that are available for this game are second to none if there was only one game that i could have off steam it would be this one without a doubt the future for this game is promising for being in early access for almost 5 years there is no lack of progress being made they have some big plans for this game and you will all want to be apart of it
