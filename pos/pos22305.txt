2020 dark souls 3 is the supposed end of the series and finds many amazing ways to wrap it up i ll be doing my personal feelings on the game at least rating wise instead of looking at it like a critic the very first thing i want to say is that you can play the games in order of 1 2 3 but in my personal opinion an order of 2 1 3 would be better for most players dark souls 1 and 3 have many similar elements and are more closely tied together than 2 3 now to get onto the ratings for this specific installment of the souls series story 9 10 the story like all of the other soulsborne games are stories that aren t directly told but more found by careful exploration and looking at every tiny detail the game offers for people who want a more direct story telling this can be frustrating at times as you might find yourself thinking why am i doing x or y but for those who want to try to find the story based off of context clues and small details it s perfect subtle details make the world feel more alive and connected and make forming these own connections yourself that much more rewarding if you find yourself wondering what the lore is behind something specific i might recommend looking it up on youtube as there are many wonderful people who cover the subject gameplay 9 10 the gameplay is similar to dark souls 1 instead of dark souls 2 which has its pros and cons pros quicker sharper with a bit of the realism taken away which in a fantasy game is fine cons pvp is a bit overwhelming at times especially if you re new to the game there will be people who have played the game for years now and just do invasions to kill and trick brand new players people say easy peasy lemon squeezy but in cases like this if you re starting the dark souls series with this one i d like to say difficult difficult lemon difficult there can also be times however where you find some of the funniest and friendliest people randomly gesturing helping you through levels or dropping you end game items that you otherwise wouldn t get until the end of the game really anything happen the soulsborne community is nothing if not random besides that if you re the type of person like me who enjoys learning by mistakes blood sweat and tears it s definitely a good style for you and the amount of reward you feel after defeating a boss you ve been struggling with for hours days is amazing customization 8 5 10 a large part of what i enjoy about dark souls 3 in particular is the difference and variety in builds you can do for pve from an assassin using magic to make themselves quieter to knights using faith to slam lightning into their enemies to a bowman ducking and weaving between enemies to pelt them down there s something for everyone s style of play some fit better at different times than others and if you truly don t like your build you can respec once you reach a certain point in the game appearance wise you can also take the time to make your character appear however you want but if you wear a helmet you won t be seeing your characters face much at all music 10 10 maybe perhaps the best part of the entire soulsborne series the music is near flawless and always beautiful from the most melancholy piece to the most epic the music is something that tugs at the heartstrings in your soul and truly makes you feel for this dying world nothing bad to say about the music anywhere other than i could use more and more all around 9 10 this game is nearly perfect in many aspects for me but falls short in a few others as well the story is wrapped up very well depending on which ending you go for the combat is very finely tuned and as you go through the game you feel the world struggling on wards attempting to live its last breath the area where the game falls short is playing through after your first time it feels much much shorter it s very easy to miss certain npc quest line certain ones can t even be completed without playing through the game multiple times so if you re a completionist be prepared to do multiple playthroughs final thoughts i highly recommend this game for anyone wanting to be engrossed in a decaying world one that is difficult and gritty but rewarding at the perfect times beauty abounds and difficulty astounds but with time perseverance and a bit of luck you ll find yourself enjoying one of the best games of the last decade
