2016 so the game plays pretty much like the others you go out explore an open world gather loot and materials kill enemies and level your character up to become better stronger and try to survive but this time its even better the map is almost the same size as the previous games but this time a lot more depth not so empty and that little bit more colourful and at the same time you feel immersed in the world around you and whilst the graphics are not as good as i expected it still feels like your in a superb fallout game and that it is another good thing is your not locked out of any part of the map like the previous games this time you can just go explore pretty much anywhere you desire if you can survive along the way there are some great new features such as building your own settlement which allows you to build your very own home base just how you want with limitations and allow npcs to help you out and keep everything maintained you can also customize and upgrade armor and weapons to have your own unique look and stats this also includes your new power armor its actually more like a mech suit its pretty damn awesome as for combat the vats system has been tweaked and made better there s a huge variety of cool weapons to choose from and modify and a new batch of enemies standing in your way and this time their a little more difficult to defeat so your going to need to be on beast mode with those guns of yours the main storyline i thought was great and really unlocks more options for future fallout games imo its interesting to say the least as for the side quests and faction quests etc well they tell there story pretty well with plenty to do and plenty of them to repeat to gain exp you will also meet some cool characters npcs along the way and the dlc well its cool but a lot of it i thought could have already been included with the base game i would have liked to see 4 extra zones added instead of a few small building packages etc but that s just me but overall i have to say the best fallout so far and there s still a lot more i haven t mentioned which just adds to the positive side and i think because of the building and crafting etc it will keep you playing for a long time not to mention there s no level cap so that s awesome and don t forget community mods another reason to keep playing 8 5 10 superb
