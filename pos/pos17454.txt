2019 i have already played 38 hours of this game it catches the one more turn of civilization while keeping the fast paced battles of total warhammer 2 i highly recommend this game to anyone who loves total war its the best in the series so far if you are new to total war you should start with an earlier version of it this is because of the high end learning curve for the diplomacy ca managed to make the best diplomacy ai and fun factor i have ever seen this is a double edged sword as well it has a learning curve of immense level the family tree court and diplomacy between everyone must all be taken into account you do not want to have your generals splitting off in the middle of a war the adoption and marriage part of the diplomacy is my favorite cao cao had 2 kids when i was done he had 9 i had a huge choice of who i wanted to lead wei the ai is awful in most cases i hope they fix this however if your looking for a game where it will consume your life this is it what ever you do don t start with the bandit queen that was down right near impossible to complete on my first try 27 hours later i did it the infamy system was amazing
