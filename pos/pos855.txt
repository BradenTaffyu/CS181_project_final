2020 now this is the story all about howmy life got flipped turned upside down and i d like to take a minute just sit right there i ll tell you how i became the miser of a cheery town called stardew valley welcome welcome to stardew valley a relaxing haven for those who want a break from the stresses of modern day life i arrive on a rattling bus noticing that i am getting further and further away from civilized society hills upon hills upon hills with the occasional purple bird flitting about the horizon where in the sticks is this place but wait upon arrival i have been given a chance to customize myself twin fuchsia pigtails and more importantly i make a grab for the big clunky vr headset this is a relaxing simulation after all right arriving at my farm i balked at the sight the patch of land that my simulation grandfather had given me was horrendous gigantic boulders littered the weed infested fields wildly growing trees threatened to suffocate my already tiny lodgings a single room wait there is no kitchen no bathroom what kind of a twisted town is this i don t scream about this for too long as there is a knock at the door huffing i swing the door open and am almost face smooshing the cheeriest old age cap wearing vr human imaginable a new farmer welcome to stardew valley i am the mayor i see you have mov what do you want parsnip seeds uh you shouldn t have hey mayor is there any way for say an upgrade in accommodation while i am here liiiiiike perhaps a fully furnished cozy cabin and it is then i am told that no this is my farm it is what i make it chop down trees and make yourself a chair if you like or how about crafting a chest that you can plant outside of this lovely abode where you can store all of the foraged items you are no doubt going to be digging up or from upturning garbage cans here clunk some starting tools no need to thank me a rusty hoe a blunt axe a scythe and a pickaxe that would have been better suited in the garbage and so began my painful spiritual enlightening journey of restoring order to this farm to working my way out of poverty and to finally finishing the vr simulation so i could get the hell out of this backward town ehhh welcome the locals would see the new farmer stomping through town and unbeknown to them glaring underneath her vr headset but she speaks to no one occasionally thrusting a daffodil in the hands of a passing stranger a daffodil she had ripped moments earlier from a neighbors yard in a forced attempt to make friends so she could level up their hearts the pink haired farmer made it her business to peer at pierre s board of help wanted postings every morning ripping off the ones that required little or no effort at all and ignoring the others that did not benefit her at all pam make your own damn pale ale she would turn up at their festivals for the eggs or the winter solstice or whatever muttering under her breath about how her time was better spent tending to her crops crops and fish and mining money money money she needed so much and yet had so little funding every mushroom every fish every monster slime she glooped off her shirt and schlopped into a jar they were all worth something to someone and then there was the run down community center in town a dilapidated building being spooked by tiny walking apples who demanded she went on a treasure hunt for all manner of things throughout the seasons so that they somehow could restore the community hub to its former glory slowly over time her tiny patch of parsnips that she religiously watered every morning with her inefficient watering can became a fertilized field of cranberries complete with a network of sprinklers and her mediocre fishing skills that would reward her with green algae started landing her the legends of fishlore and the mines were being cleared out floor by floor of their spooks and jumping jellybean slime creatures not to assist the local populace or to become an honoury member of the local adventurers guild nono she was in it for the ore the gold the bat wings and void essences all supplies she needed to upgrade her farm so that one day she could finally get the hell out of there in short this game has become my strange new addiction and it could become yours too here eat a stardrop and join us 10 10
