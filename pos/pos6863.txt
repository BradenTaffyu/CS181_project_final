2019 it s fun to play multiplayer but i would suggest finding some friends to drive with can be really frustrating and boring if played alone if an indian dude yelling in your ears happens to smash 287328 mph in the back of your fragile cargo close the game kneel in front of your bed and pray whatever god up there that he s getting at least a life long ban or you could just write recording in your name tag and you ll be avoided like a needle in a park you get what im trying to say
