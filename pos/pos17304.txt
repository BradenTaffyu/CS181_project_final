2022 ahh ori and the box of tissues round 2 i m here to tell you that ori wotw is an absolute masterpiece this isn t a game it s art beat it in a single play through and cried at least 2 times i loved the game so much i even named one of my kittens ori they basically made a sequel that kept everything about what made the first game great but also took all the things that were lacking in the first game and improved upon it the combat is so much more fun so much so that i would have a hard time going back to blind forest with the auto aiming sentry i mean they gave ori a freaking light saber what s not to love i struggled with it in the beginning as i m not great at combat in video games in general yeah i m one of those who begs for an easy mode in dark souls but i got the hang of it eventually and it starts to get easier when you get more skills and abilities despite the improvements in combat i would not describe it as a combat focused game like hollow knight ori still stays true to its roots and it s still more focused on the amazing platforming that made blind forest such a treat to play the escape sequences are still here and although they added boss fights for someone like me who doesn t love combat as a pacifist i am against all conflict and i get anxious when i have to harm even digital creatures it felt like the right amount of bosses where it wasn t too overwhelming the boss fights are also very forgiving if you die you just reset back to the phase you were at instead of doing the whole fight over again a true masterpiece this is by far one of the best platformers ever created period just stunning and grandiose in it s scope i am truly in awe and you will be too once you try it 10 10
