2018 early access review i just bought this game for full price a week after the winter steam sale ended because that s how fun it looked it is super fun i would describe it as a single player dominion with ftl style advancement i m sad i haven t found any lab or market type cards i loved chaining those in dominion there are some cool cards though my impression so far is that the game seems a little short but as it s early access i m willing to let that slide i highly recommend it at full price edit still great in 2019 nominated for the steam awards
