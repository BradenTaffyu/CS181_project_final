2019 it s super fun to take an utterly devastated house and turn it into a home something livable even nice it s fun to tear down a building and build it back up from scratch you clean away the refuse can tear down and rebuild the inner walls set up new plumbing furnish it and choose color schemes for floors walls and objects it s fun for awhile the game s major failing was not providing mod support the sims did this there are a crazy amount of options in the sims franchise games because anyone could create an object color pattern etc and these were all available for downloads to everyone else every building could feel different cause there was a virtually limitless list of options but this game doesn t have mod support and objects and their associated colors are pretty limited it did take over 50 hrs of play but eventually it felt like i was just putting the same set of objects in different buildings with just enough variation to feel like a slightly different room still i d say this is highly recommended to business management simulation game lovers while the variety holds out
