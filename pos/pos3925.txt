2020 a true hidden gem i played a good amount of xcom and xcom2 and i never would have imagined that the combat system could evolve so much and be used like it is in troubleshooters the mastery system and combat alone would have made this game worthwhile but the world building and characters add even more to the experience definitely recommend this game to those who appreciate good world building and in depth combat systems as long as you don t mind a slow buildup the soundtrack is also fire looking forward to any and all follow ups from dandylion
