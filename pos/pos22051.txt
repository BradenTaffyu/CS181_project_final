2017 never played a dark souls game up until this one it was a very punishing experience learning that one needs to git gud to continue playing i must have spent the first couple of days on and off trying to get past the first boss nothing beats that feeling of defeating a boss and moving onto the next area this is an absolute must play you wont regret it
