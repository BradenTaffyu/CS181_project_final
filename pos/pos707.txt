2016 i m sure every review already mentions the similarities this shares with harvest moon and quite obviously does take inspiration from the series so i won t mention that too much here but this game does truly give you that nostalgic feel and reminds me in particular of harvest moon back to nature which just so happens to be my favorite hm stardew valley offers everything you can really want from this type of game you start as normal in these games with nothing but crappy tools and your first seeds you progress the best you can to upgrade tools build and upgraded buildings on your farm and improve relations with fellow villagers what truly sets stardew valley above the rest is the developers and modding community already the game had very much to offer although end game could be a bit slow no fret in no time at all an update was released that gave us more buildings more villager interactions and more end game content that i won t spoil the mods can do anything from allowing to to summon any item wherever you are not really in the spirit of the game though imo to only changing visuals such as colors or character portraits the downside i suppose to these games is that they simply might not be for everyone the game can be a grind and many times you ll find yourself doing the same thing day after day until you reach your goal if visuals are a concern stardew valley uses pixelated graphics which some love others probably don t although they perfectly fit this game the colors are quite vibrant and amazing too the soundtrack can be a bit dull at times but there is actually a mod that adds quite a bit of music to the game it s hard to find things about stardew valley that i don t like future updates will always keep me coming back for the new content unless this isn t the genre for you there is no reason to not pick this game up especially which the extremely low price tag
