2023 early access review have around 3 000 hours into ark survival evolved the reviews for ark have never been something i listen to and i m glad i didn t this time around the horror stories of nitrado in the reviews coupled by the content creators using this topic to generate views due to the controversy surrounding it are also something i ve ignored and i m glad i used to live in the us and recently moved overseas to the philippines this means 99 of the time i can t play with friends back home typically dealing with 180 ping constant rubberbanding especially in ark which is the worst experience however for whatever reason on nitrado hosted servers w mods i have around 90 110 ping which is playable and definitely enjoyable this seems to hold true for many others like me playing on modded unofficial servers they re in europe brazil and all over the world playing on ny servers with me and experiencing zero lag yet nitrado bad lol the modding community and the ease of access with mods has been amazing no longer do i have to download refresh restart download and repeat this process until i have all mods installed to play on an unofficial server i simply click in the browser view the mods they have implemented and click join and it does it all for me with ease the quality of life improvements have made playing this game so much less of a headache and the ui is wonderful as well have to say i never expected them to revisit ark and provide us with a definitive edition but they did and knocked it out of the park i d even go as far to say i d be content if ark 2 didn t happen and this was their focus for the next few years because it s made my favorite game a better game
