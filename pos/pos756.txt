2016 i first discovered stardew valley when it was on the list of nominated steam awards and at first i shrugged it off unsure what to think of it the next day i went back and looked again and i took note of the overwhelmingly positive rating the game had from that it was obvious people were enjoying the game and it made me make the decision to buy the game and see what it was like from the first 5 minutes i played i quickly became hooked the game having much more depth than i had originally thought the amount of heart put into such a calm relaxing game really made it feel like something truly special every villager feels unique there are a few stereotypes but it doesn t exactly mean they are bad characters and more often than not it s the smaller details that took me by surprise which made me enjoy this game so much overall i feel stardew valley is a pleasant and relaxing experience as well as being surprisingly addicting to play and if you re able to spare the money for it it s well worth picking up chances are you won t be disappointed
