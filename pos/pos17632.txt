2016 you know what i do when i have a problem i ask for help 99 of the obnoxious all caps negative reviews have come from people with issues with hardware or the inability to google their problem which would give them an answer don t be put off by the rancor of the people who went straight to rage this game is stunning and captivating i m running it on a laptop and it looks sounds and feels incredibly authentic to both the franchise and the warhammer world if you are a fan of either this is a no brainer and if you encounter problems loading or running the game ask the almighty google
