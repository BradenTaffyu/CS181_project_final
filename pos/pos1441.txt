2013 early access review this game survived pun intended grew and prospered despite contunual setbacks and misfortune that the indie stone faced throughout the last few years and i tip my digital hat to them for not abandoning their title when they could whether it was sheer bad luck or stupidity on their end or a combination of both it doesn t matter because they still manage to get back on their feet every time i ve patiently watched this game s development since its early development stage back when it was available exclusively through desura it s come a loooong way since then and it s an amazing feat the game s currently in alpha stage so be aware that there will be some bugs but nothing so bad as to be gamebreaking there s only one goal in the game to build fight scavenge and thus survive for as long as you possibly can death is inevitable it s just being prolonged the game features dark eerie and spine chilling music by young and talented zach beever www zachbeever com there are quite a few new features pzwiki net planned plus pz has a very healthy and devoted modding community thus it s pretty safe to assume that this just might be the next minecraft hit we shall wait and see if you enjoy harsh roguelike survival games of the likes of don t starve another title i very highly recommend then you ll most likely appreciate what this game has to offer even in its unfinished state
