2023 there is a bit of a learning curve but the feeling of riding by somebody and swinging a blade takes a long time to get old and when it does you learn to get off your horse and grab a polearm or a maul calradia is a pretty big place but most of the people aren t very memorable the only people who seem to have anything at all to talk about are the nobility and even then they aren t very interesting unless they ve drawn their swords must we dance again emir tredian you do recall how this ended the last few times do you not oh is that supposed to change now that you re no longer a count but that s all okay because it s not just in the desert that nobody remembers your name there s thousands of mountaineers sea raiders wild horsemen and forest hillbillies just ripe for feathering and when you tire of that there s peasant levees soldiers and even a few kings as well they re all a bunch of butt wipes just like actual royalty but the game lets you get in on the same action you could very well call this game sim knight if another company out there wasn t likely to get their lawyers ready in response you control a knight and ride around doing knight things looting villages looting bandits putting criminals to the sword rescuing villages trading goods delivering food to failing villages selling brigands to the professional ransom brokers protecting trade caravans from banditos banditing on the trade caravans getting into tense hostage negotiations and screaming matches over the fate of some nameless farm girl with the cutest freckles before ultimately wrecking your glaive over some mounted kidnapper s neck you even get to siege castles and storm the walls with your buddies there s a bunch of different equipment loadouts for you and your troops you can issue commands in real time on the field of battle or you can just have everyone charge because your squad of ninety knights is built to wreck everyone s face in on the field but most importantly there s crossbows 3 crossbows are amazing and they can punch right through a blue blood s platemail and while they don t work as well in the rain that is fine because crossbows are just so good when the weather s nice that there needs to be a time when you should switch to a different weapon there are very few things more satisfying than sinking a crossbow bolt into a bunch of men at arms helmets as they try to scale a staircase or a ladder to get into your house but one of those things is having friends with you doing the same thing sure you could be an archer instead of a crossbowman but the amount of training you d have to sink into power draw and horse archery to make that viable could be put into other things like engineering or surgery or the ability to train twenty peasants into proper marksmen in a matter of days because you re going to need replacements sure the game opens up with a disclaimer about how life is harder if you re a girl or a commoner and that the world is a little bit sexist and maybe there s a little bit of truth to that because not as many people want to fight under the command of some nameless wench when there s plenty of proper lords with banners to stand under but that doesn t matter twas not by your own hand that you were given flesh but what you choose to do with your life is what gives it meaning sure some people ll make fun of you for grabbing the sword off some drunken lout that attacked you in the tavern but it is by that sword that you can trounce these snot nosed princelings in a duel in front of their sisters their wives their parents and their children oh they ll cry about how it s seen by the courts as a hot headed thing to do and they ll bear a grudge over getting slammed into the mud where they belong but you get renown for doing so and that s all that matters by the bi there s mods out the wazoo for this game and even without mods you can still modify the base game because everything s in notepad does the viking conquest campaign make you miss having more skill points than you could possibly know what to do with just export your character open up the notepad file and give yourself whatever you need don t want to be limited to seven troops when you re storming bandit hideouts at a high level just find the number that controls the cap and raise it to i unno fifteen tired of calradia there s people who ve created entire maps with their own castles sick of men professing themselves as your most ardent admirer while your face is covered in the blood of their soldiers there s a mod out there that allows you to elope with the daughter of some crappy nobleman and upset her entire family just like in real life but unlike real life this actually gets the guys to stop trying to bark up the wrong tree now if i could just find the jester that keeps sending letters to that dastard harlaus about the stores of butter that are being slathered upon olaf s chest perhaps he would stop bringing his buddies over or or perhaps i could just go to pravend with my buddies we can waylay count margarine on the way
