2023 i have had and am still having a blast with this game in my eyes it is currently the better twwh experience for multiple reasons the game has fewer bugs a more consistent design a more stable modding ecosystem and it frequently goes on sale you have nothing to lose by slowly building up your wh2 collection and then eventually moving to wh3 in 2 years once all the major concerns have been addressed or it goes on sale the dlcs and content will carry over so you don t have anything to lose the game on its own is great mortal empires provides nearly unlimited amount of funs i m probably a thousand hours in this account plus another and i consistently come back every few months to try another campaign the game design is pretty tight and the powercreep is still relatively under control like with all twwh games definitely recommend picking up on sale you can also raw dog it and just buy everything if you have the budget
