2015 so i had arrived in the commonwealth wasteland and didn t sit around for a second first thing i did was start roaming through houses and pulling everything apart eventually i heard a noise i was not alone in this destroyed american home no sir something else was here with me i dropped to the floor my fingers resting on my trusty 10mm handgun as i steeled myself for the beast to come for me just as it came for apparently every living creature around me well a wastepaper basket then slid around the corner before hissing at me with the voice of a thousand suns then inflicted minor damage and gave me a teeny bit of rad poisoning there was a radroach cliped inside the waste paper basket and they were now moving around as one entity this is exactly what i paid 90 for praise be todd howard priase be fallout 4
