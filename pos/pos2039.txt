2023 this is a great mmorpg with tons of content and is very solo friendly it is recommended that you sub at least once to gain access to all the expansions and increased level cap then sub again when a new expansion comes out your not really missing out when free to play or preferred unless you love the perks of subscribed like operations raids a second combat style or increased credit limit i have hundreds of hours in this game both pre steam release and after it is recommended that you look up some guides like from swtorista to get a better grasp on the game though i again recommend this game for both star wars content story solo content and a fairly great mmorpg in general that s free to play if you do have a account already remember to connect it and mind that the subscription cartel coins and dlc on steam relies upon it being connected to your swtor account and steam account i will keep coming back to it and keep playing it for years to come and beyond it is worth noting that as of the writing of this review a 64 bit upgrade will be in it pts phase and will come out soon bringing swtor to a more modern standard and with more content on the way so it s not a dead game
