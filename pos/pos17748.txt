2023 its a decent total war i ll focus on the negatives here but overall its a good game with some shortcomings that do affect the experience negatively but doesnt stop me from enjoying my time the bad all the clans feel the same except the sea raiders i feel like they lack distinction in shogun 2 i would encounter people with specializations like horses archers etc in pharao one folk is the same as the other i open the diplomacy screen and the only difference is the name i rather have half the clans and more unique features for all of them i cannot agree that the map is small like some are claiming the campaign cinematics feel very weird when not playing as a faction in egypt who cares what happens to the pharao when you are a tribe of warriors similarly units play very similar there are basically 3 categories melee ranged and chariots now what unit you choose in each has little effect on gameplay even clubs and spears dont make much difference in shogun 2 you would care more about what unit the enemy had archers feel lackluster and its very cringe when enemy units walk around like pin cusions with maybe 10 arrows stuck in them in general it feels like it takes forever to down one single unit even if i order my whole army to attack a specific unit it isnt wiped out emmidiately feels rather unrealistic the biggest drawback of this game are sieges climbing walls without cannons or catapults is realistic but very boring the problem is that the ai pins you down on the wall and it quickly turns to a huge blob of soldiers fighting on a narrow ledge while most of them cant do anything and just stand there add to this that archers wont release arrows on enemies on the same wall this needs serious rework in my opinion sea raiders are very powerful and overshadow pretty much every faction in combat in the beginning it doesnt feel very realistic ui could be better and more streamlined trading basic goods requires unnecessary steps and i do miss the controls to order soldiers to take steps in a direction without breaking formation i like that i can scale banners but even on smallest they take up too much space the entire court thing is very meh and unimpactful some good points i like the generals plenty to level up that give generic buffs and abilities without feeling misplaced or fantasised finding gear is fun the campaign is decent so far with raiders and random events that effect my gameplay resource production makes sense i just wish i could make trades last longer than 10 rounds gaining gratitude and things like gear for generals from the populace is a very good mechanic that makes sense ai in battles is a step up from shogun 2 warriors dont feel as clumped together and move more independently the map is large enough for me overall it looks good is well polished and runs well
