2015 early access review this game is just the best car simulation game and yes i did not say car crash simulator because this is game is not just about crashing they have many different and challengning secnarios and there are most likley more to come the game has good graphics realistic physics engine many different scenarios best development team ever many mods for the game smash your ex s car updated often labour of love from the developersi have put over 200 hours into this game i bought it long before the steam release i have read some rewievs latley and i see people blaming the game because they have a low end computer that can t run this game stop blaming someone else when it is actually your computers fault
