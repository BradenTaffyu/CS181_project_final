2020 i m glad i held out for the steam release along with the addition of the wastelanders expansion fallout 76 isn t perfect but neither was fallout 4 which i absolutely loved and adored despite the minor bugs fallout 76 has been everything i have ever wanted from a multiplayer fallout experience quests and leveling has been a blast the community is super friendly and willing to help out the new players group quests random encounters raids and now a main story arc with npcs is just scratching the surface of everything there is to do it feels great to be back in the world of fallout
