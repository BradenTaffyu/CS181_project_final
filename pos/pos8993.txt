2018 writting my positive review to counter some points of many of the negative reviews does 2 0 change things yes are people mad about said changes of course however i think it s silly for some people to say i use to like this game and i hate what they ve done with it when everyone has the ability to change back to a previous version of the game right click game on steam properties betas change version once you ve done that you ll be playing a previous version of the game at no additional cost if you re a prospective buyer reading this along with the other reviews keep that in mind when you make that decision don t think that you re now unable to play the game at a time before the 2 0 changes i still enjoy the game myself but if i find myself in a situation where i want the same diversity that was present before 2 0 i will just revert back to that patch no big deal
