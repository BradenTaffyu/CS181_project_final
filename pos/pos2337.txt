2021 yeah i hated fallout 76 for the first 2 years but games can always improve frfr fallout 76 is a really fun game pre ordered years ago regretted came back after 2 years and it was better definitely had fun now that it goes on sale for 10 15 when there are sales you should consider dropping the money on it
