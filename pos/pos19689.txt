2016 i bought this game in 2014 on pc and i haven t played it recently enough but it has always been in the back of my mind i played it on the ps3 at release aswally and when i bought it on pc i replayed it with some graphics mods and improvements on the game fallout new vegas is the underrated 3d fallout game by all people who seem to be unable to see what makes a great fallout game it s superior to fallout 3 and 4 in every way except the gunplay and the graphics which is technically surpassed by fallout 4 but i feel like fallout 4 seems like plastic but i digress and i ll move from this incoherent rant into the main meat of this review story and dialogue fallout new vegas is written by those who originally worked on fallout 1 and 2 and their work and faith to the old lore is absolutely phenomenal i have been engrossed into the world of new vegas and the whole mojave desert just through the dialogue and how the whole map locations and all the politics behind every event would as todd howard would say it just works the whole conflict between the ncr and the legion is written in a way where you cannot technically define evil as all choices are quite morally gray all choices have a proper pros and cons list and it seems like they re all equal shades of gray but at the same time they seem black from the other perspective characters do speak in a realistic manner but as i say this i m sure that there are characters that don t really speak naturally dialogue wise but i just cannot seem to think of any at the time except ullyses he seems too pretentious to seem like a real person mechanics the mechanics of the game are quite an improvement over fallout 3 the quest system from fallout 3 where the choices and quest start could be different or change the course of the quest but it s quite llinear and less liberal with all the different choices and in new vegas they overhual it and give you more methods to complete a quest depending on how your character is built and how you want to play the shooting has been improved with the addition of iron sights the stats have been improved with slight more impact onto the game and the quests adding alternative routes into quests they ve readded the traits from fallout and fallout 2 which force your character to gain extra skills but also penalizes you in some other way and the perks have been turned into an affair that only comes each 2 xp levels this is to prevent you becoming some sort of past mortal god at level 20 and the repair system has been revamped and improved and works in a much simpler and handier way than in fallout 3 i do recommend hardcore mode for returning fallout 3 fans as it does add a slight minigame that makes food and water quite neccesary and adds a bit more difficulty graphics and map design the map is designed in a way where it is easy to find something interesting within a radius of something else making it like a mountain that you climb in a way you progress you can fast travel back to safety if you re outside then return from the last spot you were at and keep progressing fast travelling does cheapen the game quite a bit and make it less interesting but at the same time it does make running back for supplies or even restocking or upgrading much simpler the mojave desert has roads on it and when i first played the game i had never noticed that the roads in the game would actually work if you drove on it and it made me realise how much thought the developers put into the map and the playable region of the game the developers put less effort into the third and fourth dlcs old world blues and lonesome road when it comes to how the map is planned out and how it would work in real life but who plays an rpg for realism it s all an afterthought soundtrack and original score from classic 40s 50s american music from the likes of dean martin and other artists to be honest i don t know names i just listen to ambient noise to give personality to an otherwise dark quiet pest infested cave the soundtrack does hit it s hits of how to perfectly fit in the silence of the mojave and the slow trekking through the map it s amazing to listen to and the songs have stuck with me throughout my daily life still stuck in the back of my head still jingling and jangling then again music tastes are subjective but in my opinion i do feel like it did fit the game quite well
