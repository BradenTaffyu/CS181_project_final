2016 i think it s time to update the review this game was released 7 years ago and still to this day receives free updates and additional content via dlcs i liked the game when it released it was very good back then now add 7 years of constant updates to that if you buy the base game now without the dlcs you will still get a very good game in better state than it released which can give you many hours of fun i constantly return to stellaris every few months play a game and enjoy the relaxing gameplay it s like taking a vacation the game makes me feel good like not many other games can stellaris is in a way like reading sci fi novel about origin of unknown species and it s story in unknown galaxy far far away where you decide what will be on the next page and quite often you get to a random page with twist the endless combinations of possible stories in this game makes it so much fun and easy to return to paradox made something very special here try it for yourself and get lost in it like i did for so many years original review from 2016 this game is my dream come true this is the distant worlds 2 i was waiting for if you are bored from all the other 4x games with no balls to give us something new and exciting stellaris is the game that delivers imagine civilisation combined with space 4x game throw grand strategy on top of it and its made by paradox this is how distant worlds should have looked from the get go love it engaging diplomacy excelent new game setup the race options are spectacular absolutely beatifull race avatars huge galaxies superb music even blade runner inspired theme no ai 4x and grand strategy in one package slavery real time with pause non intrusive and nicely done ui compared to ck2 game is easy to get into but has a lot of depth randomnes not a single game will be the same but there are also some things that do not work so well game is build on an old engine with no 64bit support battles could me more engaging maybe some dlc will change this dlc policy which may not suit everyone game is stuttering when not paused i suppose it will be solved in update espionage and advanced trade options are missing at the moment it will be surely part of upcoming dlcs
