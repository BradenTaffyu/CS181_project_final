2022 early access review beans mcgee was a normal man he woke up in a house naked with the house alarm ringing which told him that he did not belong there the neighours weren t too happy about the noise so much so that they smashed windows and doors in just to get to beans luckily he knew how to calm them down with a frying pan before taking a can of dog food and running away eventually beans managed to find a fire station the fire station too was filled with very unhappy people beans calmed them all down as well and warmed them up nicely on a campfire he decided that since the firemen were all gone that this would be his base it even had a stripper pole beans was pretty happy he continued to snack on canned peas carrots and beans of course and ate ice cream all night long one day beans decided to go find his happy place the place was called the prison where beans had spent much of his life and he wanted to go visit he took his beat up truck and drove there and was disappointed to see that they did not give him a warm welcome it was then that a helicopter came and started filming him beans was so happy with the attention he decided to do backward donuts for the adoring crowd that gathered and they even let him ramp off their definitely resting bodies then the truck flipped and they all applauded him by giving him a group hug rip beans mcgee
