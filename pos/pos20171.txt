this is the most enjoyable manage a party through a story game i ve played in many years immersion i ve followed the warhammer 40k universe since the 1990s this game faithfully portrays that setting from the viewpoint of humans on the wild frontier if you like the setting you ll love this if you re unfamiliar with the setting i d say this is a spectacular introduction to the tone of the setting and a pretty good survey of the diversity the setting holds the artwork the writing the music and the feelings that the choices evoke all of these do a great job of immersing me in the setting respectful of choices the game does a great job of making me feel like the choices i make have an influence over the story the written story clearly shows me when the choices i made mattered i could confidently roleplay my rogue trader the way i wanted without feeling like the story would end because i made the wrong choice the menu almost always offers a just kill everybody option and while i almost never chose that path on my initial playthrough i appreciate that the game offers that level of freedom the story is not at the mercy of a random number generator either you don t lose party members by combat going poorly you lose party members because you choose to lose them this almost eliminates save skimming for me can play casually i wouldn t recommend rushing through this even if you have the time it s a heavy story it should be savored the game facilitates casual play by giving you an easily accessible home base to return to between missions going there wipes away all the bad combat effects and gives some much needed downtime the game doesn t force you to remember lots of complex ability inventory combinations for combat while you do have to make decisions about equipment to carry and abilities to learn i don t find those decisions to be punishing i was able to walk away from the game for weeks at a time and not be totally lost on how to play or what i was doing when i came back that s a rare thing in this genre
