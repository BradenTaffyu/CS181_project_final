2016 product received for free early access review rimworld is one of those few games that does what it does unbelievably well rimworld is a base building colony management style game but these genres it takes to a whole new level in complexity the game itself is considered an early access title but don t be fooled by this there is a breath and depth of content here that goes far beyond a 30 price tag you can easily get hundreds of hours of play time in rimworld as there is so much depth that even after almost 150 hours of play time myself i feel like i m barely scratching the surface there are always so many new things new mechanics new items new ways colonists interact with things that i m learning about that things can stay fresh for a long time rimworld is one of those games that takes a short amount of time to understand but a lifetime to master part of the replayability is the sheer variety in any given game you can choose a difficulty a biome a storyteller the style of ai when it comes to how challenges and boons come to your colony and you can even generate your colonists everything right down to those very colonists have such depth it s difficult to explain in a review one colonist might have an excellent skill with firearms and cooking but might be incapable of dumb labor and like to eat human flesh another colonist might have a bad back and cataracts but might be an excellent researcher and particularly strong willed another part of the replayability is the extensive and highly active modding community which have created amazing mods to keep the gameplay fresh and fun everything from mods that reduce micromanagement to mods that allow you to play in h p lovecraft s call of cthulhu setting mods that allow you to engineer organs or mods that add additional weapons and enemies there s truly a mod for just about everything the graphics and sound effects are simple but the true value in rimworld is the story that gets told as you progress through your game when raiders come will you defend yourself and then set the raiders you capture free will you try to convert them to your side will you tear their organs out to sell on the black market and use their skin to make arm chairs with yes this is totally possible will you tame wild animals and breed them for food and materials as a farmer will you simply slaughter them as a hunter will you grow and concoct drugs to enhance your colonists abilities and keep them happy or create these drugs to sell and make a tidy profit do you prefer a simple defendable base or a beautiful symetrical base there s really something for everyone in rimworld i could say so much about rimworld and i really feel like it wouldn t be enough i know videos aren t always the best way to communicate the experience of a game but in this case i think it s approrpiate if you ever want to see the depth a rimworld campaign can get here are two modded ones i m running along with all of the insanity that happens in each the start of a playthrough of 5 psychopaths that slaughter remove organs and sell off all that cross them youtube video rimworld alpha 15 pure evil custom scenario five escaped prison psychopaths part 1 gameplay views 49 608 hey folks rimworld alpha 15 update just dropped and it broke my old alpha 14 save file for our previous game but no big deal we essentially had everything taken care of and i wanted to do an all the start of a playthrough featuring h p lovecraft as the storyteller fighting against creatures from the call of cthulhu youtube video rimworld alpha 15 the call of cthulhu new start with storyteller h p lovecraft ep 1 gameplay views 33 771 we re starting up a brand new rimworld alpha 15 custom scenario featuring several call of cthulhu mods as well as having an ai storyteller of h p lovecraft
