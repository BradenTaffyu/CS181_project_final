2021 early access review it s really an amazing game that s a must have for people that like open world car games but want more realism and more control over what they re doing mods really have helped push this game to what it is but you also have to appreciate the developers who have been constantly developing the game since it s release so long ago i have been playing off and on since before the steam release and it s really amazing to see how much the game has grown that said after getting a vr headset for sim racing i have all but stopped playing as the game in it s current form does not support vr i think as far as car games go these days there s enough people owning vr headsets to justify developing for vr the immersion vr adds to these games is the reason i can t get back into beam hoping to see a future update to support vr
