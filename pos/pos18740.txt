2019 bought the game due to 2 very insisting friends who play it religiously these guys have over 1000 hours dedicated to the game so far i have 60 hours here s how i stumbled into the rabbit hole and into the matrix known as eu4 first time booting it up the game opened up then shut down and opened up again cool apparently sh t like that is normal they say i was introduced to the the world of what 1444 beautiful map absolutely gorgeous i quickly chose to play as the ottomans because they re my ancestors not because that s what every beginner should choose to play as now let me say this this game is difficult to learn because there is just so much in this game never seen so many mechanics to make the whole game work first of all the core game doesn t do this game justice so if you bought it while it was on sale and think it s crap you re right it is the core game lacks the legendary quality of strategy gaming it has today due to its many dlc s before you get into the game make sure you have another friend that knows the game and plays it religiously the cool thing about the eu4 servers is if you have a friend that has all the dlc s and hosts a game those dlc s are temporarily given to you during that game this is how i played it was rather confusing with all the extra stuff but my god is with good once you realise what it s all for lemme just say this real quickly because this is what really got me into the game world domination once you understand how to play the game you get addicted into conquering land like class a drugs level addiction becoming a strong and powerful country conquering land and later on making vassals countries under your command and later on client states countries you free that were previously consumed or a whole new country that absolutely owe you their literal existence so they re more loyal to you that vassals vassal countries depending on how strong you make them will later on want liberty pro tip don t let them become a massive country i learned what happens the hard way if you let them be as big as you client states will die for you make em as big as you want the real hard part of the game is the urge to constantly keep conquering make sure your overextension percentage is low when conquering new lands if there s a coalition against you and you hear the horns of war restart the game especially if the mamluks are after you those guys just keep coming no one knows how and why they re so big they just are those guys are hellspawn it s like they r ped whatever moved back in the day and made a soldier out of it anyways where was i right first few hours i didn t like the game was hard to get into even after lots of long youtube videos to help me learn best way to learn in this game is to just try random sh t and fail and learn from your mistakes this game is the reddit of games you think you re playing for an hour but no son before you know it you ve skipped dinner and bedtime and you need to quickly take a shower to get to work the 60 hours i have amassed til now is all the sleep i m missing to this day i am so f cking tired i really need to sleep i miss it the cool dreams i d have they re all gone now it s just bloodshed and tears get this game but only if you re single if you get it whilst you re in a relationship you re gonna end up single or nah don t play this with your partner might end up worse what s worse than being single dead mate being dead sucks more than being single being single is so much better because then you get to play this game now get the game vamos
