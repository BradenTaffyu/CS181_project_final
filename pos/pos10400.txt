2021 assetto corsa competizione is the best sim racing title out there the sim has the perfect combination of physics and graphics unlike many sim racing titles acc has great weather dynamics all the dlcs so far have been high quality and ai behavior is mostly on point the only downside i could really point out is the vr integration since it is quite taxing but still playable for the mid range gpus for the controller racers it is extremely challenging to race with a controller so even though you maybe can pull it off i would still suggest playing only on a steering wheel overall if you are into gt racing or want to get into gt racing acc is a must have
