2020 this is the most beautiful game i have ever played and i played so very many i can t stop playing i am completely absorbed and captivated in the beautiful atmosphere of this game it s so relaxing and i can just play for hours exploring and enjoying the scenery and holy crap the scenery everywhere you look there is beauty these devs really really really really reallly really nailed the graphics it runs really really well for how amaizingly beautiful it looks too the multiplayer is a bit buggy i ve noticed if you re too far from the host the animals become scarce and some will freeze in place buuuuut even if you don t have the dlc for the reserves you can still join dlcs servers if someone else in the server has the dlc only thing i dislike about the game is that it has a lot of dlc i don t mind at all paying for new maps because the maps are hugeeeee and beautiful and unique however you have to pay to unlock hunter equipment such as crossbows duck decoys tree stands atv s etc so that takes a bit away from it but other than that the game is a masterpiece and worth every penny nope not gunna do a buck joke ha ha i know you thought i was going there huh 10 10
