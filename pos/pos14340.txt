2021 early access review most likely game of the year 2021 or whatever year it goes to 1 0this is as early access as subnautica was for a year a complete game with voice acting and tutorial visually stunning in a universe that is free to explore fly to every planet star or dyson sphere you are constructing even the textures of the dyson sphere are high resolution awaiting for you to fly by fantastic factory game with input methods called sorters that can grab from not only the conveyor next to the building but up to 3 tiles away making base building easier and less of a nightmare than other games mindustry satisfactory big pharma so many user friendly considerations and in game tutorials the day and night cycle is important planets are small meaning that you will end up building a circle around equator of initially small bases but in the end one big connected network of power generation from the sun dyson sphere in the first hour the planet seems huge and resources hard to find far apart but with upgrades a jetpack and ability to zoom out those scattered outposts slowly become integrated suburbs to the main base a wonderful game worth the price tag it even runs on a tablet without any issues surface tablet from 2017 while satisfactory is completely unplayable on the same hardware con it is very hard to see in the dark a game with the focus on block the sun by building a complete sphere around it should be more aware of having light available both during the night time of the planet but also when the inevitable happens and the sun if forever gone well done fantastic game do visit the screenshot section if you are considering buying this game
