2023 my take is mostly from the alpha and beta which i played around 100 hours and i got 23 hours in the full game if you enjoy owlcat games know what to expect ie afew bugs here and there lots of combat a huge amount to learn read huge build depth great characters worlds and general rpg goodness then this game nails all those things yet again if you also enjoy 40k setting like myself its a must buy tbh and owlcat captures the setting very well music is top tier writing ext all fantastic and will get you hooked fast if your coming from bg3 and expect a game thats fully voiced dont want to read alot and thought bg3 was complex in build and mechanic depth then maybe this game isn t for you unless ur willing to put the time in overall fantastic game best 40k for a very long time if not the best 40k game i loved every min i have played of this game its not perfect but its very enjoyable and there a lot of content here to enjoy
