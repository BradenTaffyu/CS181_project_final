2016 so far yet so great this is the best fallout game for me even this game came out 6 years ago why did i say this let s have a look to the cons and prons that i ve made based from my reviews pros a strong long story that ll make you surprised even from the beginning until the end faction system a lot of major and minor improvements that made the game not to run like a rotten potato that will ruin another fallout game great difficulty that lives up to its name and that is the hardcore mode massive varied open wasted world just for you to explore and to encounter interesting characters and quests new combat system faction system and more features to the settings keeps the atmosphere and structure that made it s immediate predecessor weapon mods that let you have fun and experiment with your guns great dlcs that isn t made for a cash grab tactics powerful enemies in different parts of the world cons no more metro tunnels like you can see from the past game fallout 3 no significant innovations or improvements in graphics design or play mechanics lots of bugs and glitches that you can encounter while playing this game dirty rigged ai lets you go up to level 30 you only can pick few perks like 15 perks only not including the 2 perks at the beginning if you asked me if you should get this game i would say it why not this is the best fallout game made by bethesda and obsidian too sad for fallout 4 which obsidian wasn t part of the development which is why fallout 4 was the suckiest fallout game
