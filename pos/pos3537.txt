2017 i can say really a lot about this game don t even know what to start with yeah almost everyone who played this game has fallen in love with it yes this game have really a lot of fans theories some interesting stories etcetera but i m here to tell you what i like in this game the most musici don t know how much time it took to create all those soundtracks but i think for amators it would take like a years to do such a thing because this music is the whole game every soundtrack is unique and cool maybe this game the only one where all soundtracks are really cool every single one some tracks really inspire you in the battles some of them are just relaxing and some even have made my friend cry o o even now i m listening to the soundtrack which fills me up with determination to write this review you can find music here tobyfox bandcamp com and herestorywhat can be better than an interesting story with 3 routes pacifist genocide neutral 1 pacifist is a whole game of emotional positivity the best jokes from skeletons i love their jokes interesting and unbelievable shows from mettaton and alphys the coolest time spending with undyne and others after undertale you will still keep in your mind all character because each of them is unique you will love all of them because how to not love so funny kind interesting friends to who you will prove that not every human brings the chaos in the underground maybe from the start you will think how to get to home because all game is about how you are trying your best to reach the point like with every save you are filling yourself more and more with the determination like you meeting so many enemies on your way but you trying to prove them people are not bad you gain more and more friends fans and just people who want to stay with you and that s it you reached the point you filled on full with determination you see that you almost reached the end and after you doing that you understand that you don t want to leave all those friends you gain you don t want to lost all those love you earned from them and you understand that you heart is here and it s belonging to them but things going even more better in the true pacifist ending you are not just reaching the point but you not even leaving your friends family and all happy together 2 genocide but you see that there is not only one way to use your determination you think you should become stronger to raise your lv and hp but with every lv up you see that you are losing your self and something other controlling it now but this is already too late to stop you killed everyone there is no way back everyone told you you gonna have a bad time but you didn t listen the whole game trying to say you that to be bad it s not that easy and there is no profit from it but you are filled with determination again and you are going further because you know you can do it and you are doing it and what happened next it doesn t matter for you any more you just want to do it and that s all 3 neutral sometimes you kill sometimes not but still you will be forced to choose bad or good ending at the end i will say that this game can really go deep in your heart be careful thro to not hurt yourself by choosing routes this game will also go deep in your memory with all good moments you passed in of course i recommend this game and wish to everyone have fun in it i will see you in the next review and stay determined my real hours somwhere close to 55 because i was afk a lot in game pass all routes done
