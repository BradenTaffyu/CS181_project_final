2018 the game is great and unique for 10 you get many game modes which are also fun you can not expect much from the graphics there is however the possibility to improve them with modding it s a lot of fun and you have many options sometimes the game is easily overwhelmed even on good pc s some game modes like zombie survival can cause a lot of fps lag because it s so poorly optimized anyway this game is a lot of fun and you can customize it so much so that theres something for everyone you can play a lot of game modes and it s also pretty easy to play with friends thanks to steam the multiplayer itself has a voice chat but it can be a bit buggy too dull voice background noise no mic detected but yeah overall it s a nice game so on the whole it s a masterpiece
