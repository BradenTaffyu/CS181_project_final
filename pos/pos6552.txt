2018 absolutely love this game the level of detail is amazing and i love going to cities that i ve been to in real life and spotting all the similarities the countryside and motorway driving is super relaxing especially with the radio and cruise control on the added expansions are great giving a lot more map to discover and find work although currently i only own and have played the scandinavia and going east ones can t wait to get the italia expansion and explore beautiful italy some more there s lots of ways to customise your vehicle and really make it unique to you plus some great features like the sleep mechanic i e having to calculate how much driving time you ll have left if you take a quick nap because your eyes are closing repeatedly or making sure you have enough fuel to complete the job or just get to the next fuel station it s all good i usually end up taking out the biggest loan i can buying my own truck and plunging my company into debt but i still have fun i racked up a lot of hours on this game outside of steam back when i still used to buy physical copies of games and it s one of my favourite games that i keep going back to when i want to chill and just enjoy some stress free gaming plus it reminds me of going trucking with my dad when i was a child
