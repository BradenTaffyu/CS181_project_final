2015 this is probably the first rpg in years where i feel compassion towards seemingly random enemies most developers portray them as nothing more than fodder but undertale goes a step further by if you play it right having said enemies later show up in different areas you d passed through earlier they talk to you say what s on their mind maybe even flirt with you a little bit there is literally a tiny volcano who thinks her lava can heal people and tries so hard to be helpful the enemies have facial expressions and react to the things you say or do the in battle animations and their attacks all feel so personal as someone i know said it s like a combination of cave story earthbound and the stanley parable with a heavy sprinkling of touhou for good measure that said the game isn t perfect no game is of course the genocide route is understandly in stark contrast to the pacifist or neutral ways of playing instead of struggling to survive the enemies fall like dominos however when they do fight back it s not fun at all there are two fights i wound up having to get outside help with because i literally could not physically react in time it was during those moments where i wondered just how much testing said fights were put through or whether the developer had based it on their own skill always a bad idea for one so intimately familiar with the game otherwise the game is a blast and i ve already completed it on genocide pre pacifist and true pacifist the writing is absolutely magnificent and you do feel awful when you play to kill the music is easy to lose yourself in as well there is so much to see and do because of the minutia between the two ways of playing and the multiple ways of ending a neutral game this is one of those rare cases where you can truly say the devs think of everything
