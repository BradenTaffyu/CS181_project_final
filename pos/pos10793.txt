2016 so far so good the two biggest changes this time around are the battle plan system and a more simplified ui and gameplay i d definately say both of these changes were positive ones the battle plans are an amazing way to reduce micro management and i really wish they were in eu4 also it s more or less optional at any point you can grab some troops and order them around manually and when they are done they ll get back to whatever battle plan you had going so the gameplay this time around is simpler than previous games which some people miss but persionally i like being able to play the game without having everything automated seriously though if a hoi3 fan every complains about dumbing down ask them if they played with their trade deals automated honestly like a lot of paradox games i think they all have the same overall level of complexity it just moves to other places so for example you are no longer stockpiling resources it s all flows now but you are still stockpiling equipment vehicles can have different variations and every once in a while you ll research some new infantry equipment or a tank or a plane then you ve got your entire army using the old gear while you build and resupply your units with the new equipment ignore the haters who are comparing fully patched hoi3 with 7 years of dlc to launch day ho4
