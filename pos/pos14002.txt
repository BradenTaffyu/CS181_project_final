2017 early access review tldr below i got this game after being a long time rimworld player with a few hundred hours of playtime it is definitely appreciably different as opposed to rimworld where raids and random events are what ails you the environment in oxygen not included is your greatest threat while the two games have a similar core aspect to them colony building and management they go about it in entirely different ways the reason i bring up its core similarity to rimworld first and foremost is that it s my humble opinion that if you like or love rimworld you will probably enjoy oxygen not included in oxygen not included your colonists are basically stranded inside of an asteroid planetoid or what have you they are completely underground in a totally closed loop system this game is all about toeing the line and balancing a few core aspects having food for your colonists oxygen for them to breathe eliminating waste products think latrines and carbon dioxide and producing the energy to facilitate the previous careful resource management is the name of the game here if you let any of the previous aspects get way too far out of balance your colony is likely to start losing members and or the colony will break down into a death spiral don t produce enough oxygen and people start suffocating and become unable to reach far out sections of the base don t produce enough food and colonists will pretty quickly break down into high stress states and eventually starve manage the colony s waste products poorly and before you know it you re unable to produce more oxygen running out of water to use for other processes and having stress breakdowns don t produce enough energy and food oxygen and waste management aren t happening at all one of the game s biggest challenges and likely one of its greatest selling points is in the way it simulates thermodynamics and fluid mechanics heat is a big factor in oxygen not included trying to grow temperature sensitive plants directly above a hot power production storage area is almost guaranteed to fail without gratuitous insulation different substances can be heated or cooled to solid liquid and gaseous states heavy gases like carbon dioxide will pool in sumps at the lowest points in your colony potentially rendering them inaccessible lighter gases like hydrogen will float to the top of an area and displace oxygen clean water and waste water will need to be pumped around the base for different purposes and allowing them to mix can lead to damaged equipment or contaminated water sources managing all of these physical aspects can be challenging frustrating and rewarding all at the same time this game looks very good and runs very well the game is set in a 2d side view perspective it has an entertaining art style reminiscent of don t starve but more cute than creepy the environments are very pretty to look at different gases give a subtle background to the open areas in the colony liquids move and swirl around ore deposits in the rock shimmer as you move the camera around the game seems to perform perfectly on my rig with a reasonably large base and over a dozen colonists i cannot say however where the threshold is where performance will start to degrade i have experienced zero game breaking bugs or ctds the game s first major shortcoming at the time of writing this review is its lack of end game content and goals the main idea of oxygen not included as of right now is to basically have as many colonists survive for as long as you can manage once you realize that it s in your best interest not to always take a colonist every three days when you re offered one and once you can create a sustainable system when you are recycling waste and making your own power in house you can get to a sort of stagnation where an established colony isn t as fun to play as a struggling one the game s second major shortcoming is its colonist ai ensuring colonists are getting things done in a timely manner and avoiding every colony sim player s worst nightmare idle colonists can be a huge matter of micromanagement this is because getting more important things done is a matter of manually setting the tasks themselves to a higher priority between 1 lowest and 9 highest colonists can also have certain tasks such as digging or delivering enabled or disabled when things are going right and you re not in a hurry to get something done the ai and work priority system works well enough the problem comes when you queue multiple things up and colonists attempt to get them done they do not organize their work time very well when faced with a great number of tasks rated at the same priority i ve become a little frustrated more than once when a colonist runs far out from the established base to mine something mines one piece of material then turns around and runs all the way back into base to do some arbitrary task back there this game would greatly benefit from a work type priority system at the colonist level in the same fashion as how rimworld manages work priorities it s sad seeing how inefficient these colonists can be especially when their survival is riding on how quickly they can get some resource back to base or how fast they can break into a new area to pump waste into to prevent the colony s first cistern from overflowing into the ground floor the only way to avert these issues is through the excessive micromanagement of individual task priorities i am not trying to bash the game or the developers with the above negatives as it is an early access despite these two major flaws the game is still quite entertaining and promising klei has been pushing updates for this game on a regular schedule full of content and improvements this company is pretty well known for seeing their early access titles through and i don t think i see it getting abandoned stagnating for some large amount of time like games such as cube world or starbound did i think for the price they re asking to get into the early access this game is most definitely worth it if you like colony building games and management sims this will definitely do the trick for you it looks like it should get refined and expanded upon more into the future if you want something that is much more fleshed out and fully realized it might be worth waiting on this one but as of right now it s quite a bit of fun and definitely entertaining tldr a very good looking interesting and entertaining game if you re into colony building and survival a bit rough around the edges with end game goal content and colonist ai makes very interesting use of some light physics to make the environment and resources the primary thing that kills you worth it for its current price point as of right now but might be worth a wait if you want something more fleshed out
