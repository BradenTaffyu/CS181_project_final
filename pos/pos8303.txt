2018 i can say that after 140hrs of gameplay this is probably one of the best and well thought out citybuilder games out there i absolutely love this game and i find it relaxing after a long day at work i hope the creators release an expansion that allows us to actually try to see how long we can survive or maybe even build on the story and link other cities together rather than just establishing outposts
