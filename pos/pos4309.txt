2017 less reviewing more playing but seriously though this game is great in my opinion the combat is really engaging and actually requires skill the single player is a fun open world experience where you can do whatever you want and the modding community only makes this game better one of my only gripes is that the mulitplayer community isn t all that big there are maybe 1 or 2 slightly full servers but the rest are completely dead another thing to note is that the graphics are a bit dated but that really isn t an issue for me personally10 10 would drink from skulls again
