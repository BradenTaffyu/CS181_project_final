2016 early access review 4 29 2020 update four years after i wrote this review the game is still in alpha alpha 19 is supposedly on the horizon the console ports have also been abandoned this game has been in development so long that its console ports are dead and it s still supposedly in the alpha stage the world alpha apparently having lost all meaning in this case even the games i compared it to h1z1 and day z are either dead or on life support consider that when reading my review below pro it s pretty much the greatest open world zombie game ever made honestly if you like those minecraft terraria games but wish they were set in a george romero movie then this is your game in my opinion it s also way more fun than the current generation of zombie mmos as well i m looking at you h1z1 and day z so this is like the best of those two groups of games mashed together con the development team moves at an absolutely glacial pace this game was kickstarted like 4 or 5 years ago and it s still in alpha even though it s been released for ps4 and xbox one the updates are few and far between and glitches from almost half a decade ago are still present in its current 14 6 14 7 i dunno build the devs made a really fun game but they don t update it nearly enough five years of an alpha build is pretty laughable and an example of why some people don t like early access maybe it will enter beta before i enter a retirement home if you can accept the game as it is and deal with the fact that every now and then an update is gonna come out that makes you start over then i honestly can t reccomend it enough
