2017 i was becoming bored the hunt became a grind popping between campsites downing whatever was foolish enough to exist within 400 meters of me i thought a 7mm would bring me joy but it didn t i tried bow hunting which was a blast for a day i had forgotten the hunt not the shooting and harvesting the hunt so i travelled on foot day night shooting and arching along the way i had fun again so much of the map had i left uncovered i was getting that old familiar feeling i could almost smell the rain on the grass there was so much i was missing in my chase of an easy thrill my travels brought me to north lake and in my search of a landmark i came upon a most chilling call it shook my core i was frozen in fear or anticipation awestruck is how the old man tells it to me his words became my truth when i levelled that 7mm towards the most gracefull creature ever stood before me a roosevelt elk the biggest i d ever seen about 100m away and another beside him not as big but just as majestic i knew i could only have one but neither gave me a clear shot i called he spun around and called back i felt a click as the trigger pulled and suddenly i was looking skyward because the magnum has her own part in every discourse he was down the feeling i had the first five minutes in the preserve was back the wonder and grandeur of this magical place came flooding back into my veins i realized i hadn t taken a breath in at least a minute as my rifle came down to survey my quarry and there it was the stag i earned the stag i hunted
