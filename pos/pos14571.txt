2018 if you have beaten civ v 100 times and at higher difficulty levels and just needed a fix and something different ya this works it s a generally good game have to say though civ v is still better in almost every possible way civ v is even just as appealing graphically but honestly this game cannot muster the foreboding you can feel in civ v the ai in civ v just feels alive and as though it is genuinely plotting to beat you i just don t get that feeling in civ vi also civ v has way better quotes for the artworks and achievements and the narrator is much better in civ v than in this game and i love sean bean so i don t say that easily fun game though worth a play through pretty to look at but civ v is the last name in civilization imo
