2022 one of the best sandbox experiences out there the game is 6 years old as of this review but it has been soft reset several times from major updates the developers continue to breath life and new features into this game taking player feedback to add new systems and alter existing ones if you re already a fan of grand strategy this plays like a bigger but less narrative ck3 the amount of variety in a single playthrough and the stories you can tell with the myriad of empire options is truly staggering the only negative is that the game is a little light on story content with the individual beats of an empire mostly residing in your own head cannon
