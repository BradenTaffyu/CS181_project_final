2021 the original blind forest was and is one of my favorite games of all time this follow up is a more than worthy sequel ramping up the sense of scale from the first game with a larger map to explore more attacks more platforming skills more characters to interact with and more of the same gorgeous art style that made the first game such a wonder to behold the sequel takes much of what was awesome about the first game and turns it up several more notches some of the same emotional beats that were present in the first game are also reused here but ori s journey of discovery in this tale is no less powerful and gut punching gareth coker s beautiful music sweeps us along as we explore the new land of niwen with jaw dropping scenes of beauty everywhere you look this is a stunning game a labor of love from moon studios and a wondrous success a fabulous jewel of a game which will captivate you time and time again
