2017 early access review i have played a lot of different games through my life gamming probably since 2000 from finishing quake 1 demo lots of time to spend countless hours trying to conquer medieval europe total war so after 17 years or more of gaming you know when you come across something special and damn it this is something very special probably among the best games i ever played the amount of content stuff going on and stuff that you can do is absurd even more with mods this game in early acess its already more complete than a lot of games out there btw if you are looking to loose wheight this is a great game i actually forgot to have dinner last night lol
