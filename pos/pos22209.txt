2020 absolutely enjoyed wanna tell about the whole game but imma lazy guy as the last game of the series it ended up perfectly loved everything only disappointment is there is no free cam cant take cool screenshots like wide angled ones that s the only thing i dont like although it would be a big apple cheese if the free cam was here isnt it xd anyway totally worth for the price so just grab it if u havent already
