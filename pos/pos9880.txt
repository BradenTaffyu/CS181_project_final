2016 early access review i like to base my purchases on how complex challenging and re playable a game is typically when i am looking to spend money especially games upwards of 30 i want to know i ll get my money s worth i like to read other people s reviews to see not just that they rated it up but that those who do rate it up have more than a handful of hours in the game looking around at the reviews here you can clearly see people are getting their money s worth out of this gem of a game having played 30 hours i ve been having an amazing time rimworld is a unique blend of base building resource management tower defense and likely a few other genres that manages to engage you where you actually care about your colony and colonists coupled with a rng event system there is always excitement around the corner maybe a blight will destroy 75 of your crops or you ll be attacked by a group of rampaging bunnies or elephants or a toxic fallout will sweep across the land forcing you to adapt to survive even if rng may scare you away the difficulty ramps over time so you ll never be unfairly challenged although you will be alerted to your weaknesses time and time again the customization this game allows is also what makes it potentially fun for just about anyone and the gradual increase in difficulty keeps things interesting with a plethora of mods available and a scenario editor so you can play exactly the game you want you can create a colony with superstars and top tier gear in a lush environment a small group of desolate tribals trying to adapt to below freezing temperatures a group of psychopathic cannibals etc your imagination is the limit in my latest game i had to abandon my best colony yet because of poor planning instead of the typical raid of pirates charging into my fortified defenses consisting of traps and gun turrets they decided to blow open a back way into my base and decimated my infrastructure overpowering my brave colonists it didn t help that one of my smokeleaf addicted colonists decided to go smoke himself silly as they were tearing down the wall as annoying as some of these defeats are you always learn more for next time i ve just now started as a group of five tribals with no technology and it completely changes the way you play the game don t let the early access tag fool you this is a complete game with a massive amount of depth and great communication from a competent developer i can t wait to see what else is in store if this does sound interest watch a few let s plays to give you an idea of how rimworld plays out one other note the soundtrack is absolutely stellar and really sets the theme highly recommended
