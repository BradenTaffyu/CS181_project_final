2021 never write reviews but after playing 200 hours it has asked me to write a review so i guess i will because this game deserves more attention this game is really good i have only been playing it properly for just over a month now and i cant stop 200 hours in one month think you can do the math its just such a nice game that once you know what you are doing it is a really relaxing experience till their is a raid then the game makes you think on your toes especially if you are playing on commitment mode just a few things about the game and things that i wish i knew before playing 1 play your first 50 hours on reload anytime just till you learn the game after that play on commitment mode as i feel that is the way this game is meant to be played as its more meaningful when one of your favourite colonists dies from a squirrel 2 play on strive to survive even from your first game as that s also the difficulty the game is meant to be played 3 don t pick random randy because you think your hard 4 stop playing the sims and play this instead this game is a lot like the sims but more like a survival with raids and quests nothing against the sims but this just blows it out the window 5 mods are really good especially the vanilla expanded series which adds tons to the game such as loads of different weapons animals furniture story tellers factions and more basically adds free dlc just like the sims but free because this game isn t made by ea 6 mods are really easy to get as they are on the steam workshop 7 apart from your cook put 1 on plant cut mining and hunt as they are jobs that need doing when you need it doing thank me later 8 i actually only found this out recently and i wish this was the first thing i found out about this game click on the book at the bottom right of the screen that will show your wealth i thought the raids get harder and harder as the game goes on but i was wrong the raids are based on how much wealth you have so basically if you have 1000 silver only a few raiders will show up if you have 1000 silver guns good mats ect then the raids will be tougher this is actually one of the favourite things about this game as even if someone dies your wealth level goes down so it evens the game out so dont worry if someone dies tip if you want the raids to be easier burn all the stuff you dont need 7 did i say this game is better than the sims pros 1 once you know how to play its really nice to just sit back and watch everyone work by themselves because you sorted out their work schedule so you can now just sit back sip on your tea and wait for drama to happen 2 the whole world has different factions that will raid you but you can also form a caravan and raid them if someone raids you and kills your master chef mary and you want revenge then you can form a caravan go to their base capture mary s killer take all their supplies guns walls doors ect take mary s killer back to your base as prisoner and feed him all the dead corpses you have stored up from past raids till they die from throwing up to much because your not one to be messed around with are you 3 i like the way this game doesn t force you to do anything you can literally play how you want to play if you want to only do quests then do quests if you don t want to do quests then don t if you want to take over the globe then do it if you want to be a drug dealer and make a drug factory then you can many games don t do this with such a variety and i think its great 4 back to a point i made earlier the wealth system is one of my favourite things about this game so clever how they have come up with a way to balance out the game so their is no need to rage quit and delete your massive colony you spent so much time on because mary died rip mary 4 better than the simscons 1 if you have a full time job a wife and kids then this game probably isn t for you hoped this helped if you have any questions then i m happy to help
