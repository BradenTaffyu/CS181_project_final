2015 early access review pros great sandbox survival gameplay it is not just another survival game its unique and very hardcore experience despite being isometric this game have some unique style craft system is comfortable enough character creation system you can even choose passive skills you can build your own fort with garden generators traps and etc sound design of the game it creating depressing and sometimes horror mood perfectly fits the game regular updatescons lack of npcs and venicles you can hardly call it cons cause they definitely gonna be in full version so far i cant find any serious issues in this game one of the best early access games this game is must have for any horror survival fan
