2017 early access review incredible i ve been playing roguelikes since maybe 2002ish spending most of my time in nethack and dungeon crawl stone soup probably 3000 total hours this blows them out of the water the blend of sci fi with fantasy is so well done you forget there s even a mashup happening the story is amusing but serious every time i get further i become ecstatic to learn a new piece of what s going on the graphics are incredible the tiles are almost ascii like in their appearance and the colors are perfect the music is phenomenal sets the scene wonderfully get this game
