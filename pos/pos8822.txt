2017 i m 313 hours into stellaris i haven t completed it but i believe i can give a pretty good impression of the game this review includes all the dlcs up to and including utopia stellaris is one of those unique games where random happens so often that one game can feel like several new playthroughs over 300 hours into the game i still often find brand new things happening in single player and multiplayer modes you start with a single planet and a few people from there you go off to take over the universe you will encounter everything from space dragons horrors of the void and pirates that will try to kill you for that matter half of the universe will also attempt to kill or devour you the rest wanna make friends or simply breed you out of history going into stellaris it is important to know that this is not a game you will finish in a day or a week it s a game where you should take your time and really learn and understand what is going on it s a game where every choice you make for your population affects the outcome of the game reasearch building military and social aspects of your population are by your command there are a million tools to reach your goal so you get to pick whatever you want you wanna be a insane warmonger sure go ahead you wanna be a spiritual leader who believes in peace sure go ahead you wanna be the most tech savvy scientist and have every population below you sure go ahead you wish to enslave the entire world and feel like a king with slaves sure go ahead you wanna be a complete asshat and purge people who disagree with you sure go ahead stellaris lets you truly customize according to your whims and rule the universe as you like which is great design your own race from appearance to values design your own ships with weapons shields and ftl drives design your own planets with terraforming and much more gameplay and graphics are amazing complemented by a soundtrack that promotes relaxation on your journey into space stellaris is strongly recommended for people who love complex long running grts games
