2020 k well this is a bit of a mixed review because total warhammer ii exists and has so many gameplay improvements over this one that it seems like an obvious recommendation for that instead of this but and this is a big but if you want all the content for total warhammer ii and eventually total warhammer iii including the gigantic mortal empires campaign that combines the maps together then you will need to buy this one and the associated dlc for factions you want to play as well while this is cool for fans of the series that would ve already had this first game it is kind of a kick in the pants to people just getting into it my advice is wait for a sale as the base game and dlcs for this go on sale for fairly cheap quite frequently and you don t really need all the dlc my advice is just get the factions that are well made and interesting to play like norsca and maybe wood elves for tw wh1 alternatively you could get the queen the crone for tw wh 2 as it s a high elf faction with access to wood elf units and cheaper chaos are sort of fun but horde factions are kinda meh avoid beastmen completely for now for tw ii you want tomb kings vampire pirates ideally also the prophet the warlock lord pack cause it makes skaven way more fun and any other lord packs for factions you find interesting to play as some can change the game up quite a bitlastly i will say this game is not as demanding as the 2nd one so if you re computer is not up to spec with at least a geforce 10 series or equivalent and probably a 4th gen or higher i5 or equivalent then i d say hold off on getting tw wh 2 for now and just get this as it won t make your pc cry the recommended system requirements for both this and tw wh 2 are basically the bare minimum required to make the game not look terrible as they re benchmarked for 1080p and not a full 60 fps for some reason seriously their recommended system requirements are for a target of 1080p 45 55 fps what the hell i wouldn t even want to attempt to play on something close to the minimum system requirements as i imagine it would be like playing a slideshow
