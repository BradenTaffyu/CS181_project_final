2019 so stardew valley how can i possibly sum my experience with this game in a coherant matter however this game has really changed my life and ive never loved a game so deeply before i own this game on multiple platforms originally getting the game in 2016 when i first found out about this beautiful experience of a game stardew valley provides a calming and almost theraputic experience for anyone who plays it or listens to the ost like i said before this game has truly changed my life for the better helping me get through tough times and i couldnt be happier the characters are all human and relatable with beautiful character arcs and stories their own unique personalities and routes likes dislikes stuggles and hobbies it also provides a platform for lgbt community members to comfortably play a game and marry a love interest without being forced to be who they dont want to be and its wonderful stardew valley helped me develope a genuine interest in agriculture and helped me find a appriciation of nature i lost some other wonderful points about this game the subtle and interesting tid bits of lore hidden in the game ive loved looking into it in my free time you can play the game however you want and while i reccomend the community center route the joja route still provides some challenge the beautiful and memorable ost ive personally purchased this ost and listen to it almost every day the calming but joyful tumes present in the game can truly make mundane tasks seem like such fun multiplayer you can as of recently play with your friends and its amazing ive always loved to share this game with my friends buying them all a copy whenever i had the money and each time i have loved sharing a farm with them its replayable theres no limit to how many farms and saves you can have from what i can tell and its so much fun starting a new farm is always a pleasure and reminds me of my beginner days in this gamein short i d highly reccomend this game to anyone who needs an idyllic escape
