2020 fallout new vegas is an amazing game but certainly not a masterpiece in my opinion the game has really great qualitys but it also has its areas where it gets bogged down pros amazing story the story of this game is really compelling the revenge narrative is really fun and you ll be surprised with the routes the story takes fantastic role play and replayability if you see my hours of fallout new vegas you can assume i have played this game alot i ve played this game with many characters who have their own completely different characters you can essentially play however you want there are also factions in the game which continues providing you with multiple choices all the time the faction system is great probably one of the best aspects of the game world and characters the world of new vegas is top notch i love exploring every nook and cranny of the mojave since its so developed and so interesting the characters are really solid as well a bunch of memorable faces with their own fun personalitys and compelling back storys you ll be sure to be remembering these characters for years on after your playthrough guns there are alot of fun guns in this game completely whacky like a laser gun that shoots death rays from the sun a grenade machinegun and the iconic ranger sequoia the weapon the guy in the box art is using a pistol with the power of a sniper rifle very cool but there are problems with the gun play which i will address in the cons music turn on the radio and hear some classic hits alot of these songs will be ingrained in my skull for ages such as big iron in the shadow of the valley or johnny guitar even the songs made for this game are really great and really develops the ambience of the mojave one of my favourite tracks is the piece that accompanies you at the final battle of the game really highlights the colossal scale of this battle consbugs this game unfortunately is one the most buggy games i ve ever played it can be really off putting at times sometimes you have the funny glitches where a characters limbs start going flying everywhere but most of the time its just the annoying bugs that crash your game or make it temporarily unplayable it is a must that you download a mod new vegas anti crash to make this game truly solid guns although as stated above some guns can be quite alot of fun gun play can be a bit iffy at times enemies can act at meat shields taking excessive bullets to take down aim can be not too great sometimes fairly unprecise sometimes you might just want to use vats essentially the auto aim to kill opponents as killing enemies the standard way can sometimes be unfun graphics i m not too much of a graphics person i really do love playing my retro games with their blocky appearances but new vegas can be a bit ugly sometimes the mojave deserts always looked pretty off putting to me and some characters may look a little uncanny i d say this is one of the less major cons as the game overall looks pretty fine but it gets bogged down by certain aspects of its appearance overall a really solid game with somewhat underwhelming gunplay and graphics and a huge bugs issue these issues could be due to their brief development time from bethesda but i don t care to get into that but aspects like the story and world building are genuinely fantastic and makes this stand out as one of the better fallout games
