after the first couple of patches i m finding it much easier to play and more enjoyable there are still several significant balance issues relating to ages education children issues with rent and unemployment and household sizes i m actually running a couple of rebalancing mods that have made it more realistic and playable i d recommend you start out with three specific mods population rebalance economy rebalance and historical start unlocks rail shipping and farming mining logging these have provided better gameplay and smoother growth patterns for me so far
