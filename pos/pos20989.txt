just the kind of game you wanna play if you want a break from tense action packed games relaxing good story and even better characters clearly and neatly inspired from anime and a diverse set of loot and upgrade options oh and the relaxing bit doesn t mean it never gets stressful for example the boss fights are really intense and it does have rogue like features definitely worth the money
