2018 i ll try to keep my review short and spoiler free this game is good and you should get it 10 10concernedape has hit a homerun with this one the charming farming backdrop is only the beginning as you take over your grandfather s dilapidated farm if you go into the experience fully you ll enjoy meeting and befriending a complex little community by the sea you can be as altruistic or evil as you choose and even though the player rarely offers dialogue the writing is often good enough to provoke at least the thought of a roleplaying response or you can just farm wheat all summer and fall and make millions off of your own craft brew and never even talk to a townie besides your source of seeds all backed by surprisingly diverse yet coherent soundtrack also made by concernedape absolutely check this out if you are looking for charm character and a place to absolutely sink a lot more time than you intended i have lots of additional time on console
