2016 being really fast in my review its simply the best total war game ever made each faction plays completely different from the others and the game is way more straightforward than every other total war game to date it have a bit of a shogun feel to it and the ai can give you a run for your money even in normal difficulty i super recomend it for every fan of total war tittles or anyone that likes a good whaaaaaaag
