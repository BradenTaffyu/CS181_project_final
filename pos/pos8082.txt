2016 early access review this game is awesome you can even use a steering wheel to play it when i got this game in early access it was pretty good but it got boring so i didn t play it anymore now that i tried it out it s awesome you got buses new cars better physics and more maps you can play this game even on a laptop with bad graphics and it runs okay one of the best driving simulators i would say
