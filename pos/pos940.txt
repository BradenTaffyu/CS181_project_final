2016 if you re familiar with management sims like the harvest moon series stardew valley makes some interesting additions that make it really unique the best way i can describe it is it s like putting together the farming in harvest moon the relationship system in animal crossing and the simplified combat in recettear or secret of mana for the snes the game is really simple you start off wondering whether you made the correct choice in life stuck in a soulless office cubicle but grandpa offers a way out eventually you find yourself in the countryside with a piece of land and it s up to you to do what you will with it this village has its uniqueness in that you have different festivals with different requirements every season you are gently eased into planting certain crops diving into the mines for ores beware monsters or getting to know the locals better or fixing the old community center whether you want to do any of this or how you do this is entirely up to you of course different seasons come with different limitations there are plenty of secrets to find and the wiki the actual one not the wikia one has a lot of information on most aspects of the game like crop prices recommendations for new players each season is 28 days and plants die outside of their season try to plant as much of the highest yielding crop you can your cash crop but be sure to have at least some of every other crop available in the season as you need them for other purposes dive into the mines early and often and keep all the quartz you can get as you need them to make the good sprinklers later on sprinklers save you from having to water the plants yourself so you can use that time to do other things as a heads up this game is the fruit of the sustained effort of a single person programmer pixel artist music writing and all the only other games i know which are made this way are dust an elysian tail and the evochron games the amount of effort these developers have to put in is unimaginable even microsoft s xna framework which stardew valley and dust happen to be built upon has been discontinued since april 2014 this gives you a sense of how long these projects take with that much investment and pride on the line you can be sure that if these games are fortunate enough to be released they would release only in the best possible state if you have problems starting the game try heading to your installation folder steamapps common stardew valley and install the xna framework 4 0 under commonredist that solved my problem expect multiplayer to be added in the future the developer simply released the singleplayer part first which is not missing anything other than the ability to play together with other players i think there was a q a involved with the closed beta group behind this decision but don t hold me to this fully recommended both the great game and the developer eric barone
