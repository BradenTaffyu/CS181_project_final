2015 early access review the main hangup with people seems to be the pricetag seriously people nobody seems to have an issue with paying 40 on console games 15 to me is nothing for a game with great replayability and customizability if you have played the mobile version then you know what the game is like if you haven t godownload it for free on google play store you may be wondering i ve played the mobile version why get the pc version the pc version has quite a bit more in it namely the ability to make your own scenarios not interested in making any scenarios no problem there are thousands of custom scenarios available for you to choose from almost 5 000 as of 4 14 2015 this is a game that will require a varying strategy amidst fairly static gameplay someone posted that it s like the first level of mario and it only varies in how you get to the end not really true they didn t mention that almost everything you do or don t do has a direct impact in game can you infect the entire world without anyone finding out can you destroy humanity in less than a year bad to bone nothing is more awesome than watching your diseased seed spread across the globe
