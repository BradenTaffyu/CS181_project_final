2023 amazing game there may be a few flaws but the good outweighs the bad i cried and became depressed for a week or two after i finished for the first time i still cry at the good ending to this day the battle mechanics are amazing and sometimes easy to exploit especially when you know what s coming the story is also very good and it offers a range of choices you can do for each endings
