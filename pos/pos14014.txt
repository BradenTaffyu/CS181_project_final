2021 tl dr if you re purchasing this because of the colony sim tag you might end up disappointed i elaborate later in the review oxygen not included is a fun and quirky game you re put in charge of creatures called dupes that are trying to survive in the core of an asteroid making due with whatever resources there are available to them while maintaining a habitable environment the game takes a faux but mostly accurate i suppose science approach almost every solid has a liquid and gas state as well something being too hot and cold are big issues temperature control is actually the biggest difficulty hump the game has to offer but once you get a handle on it there s still plenty of challenge in getting things running smoothly the colony sim part of the game is bare bones i want to stress that this is fine as there s plenty of other elements of gameplay here to make up for that but if you were expecting dwarf fortress rimworld or even just sims level of interaction between dupes look else where there are no dramatic events no real socializing the dupes do not aspire and they do not have traditional increasing needs but rather the needs expand as you upgrade them there s a morale system but its little more than avoid doing stupid things too long or you get punished more than anything else there s no trading so there is no need for industry outside of expanding the colony and even if there was most jobs can be done by almost any dupe so there s no meaningful specializing in any industry field there s no quality of goods difference so a first time dupe will process iron nearly the same as a dupe thats been processing iron for cycles i would compare this game more to factorio than anything else your goal isn t to build a colony but a factory with some minor colony aspects on the side that being said for what it does do its great and i wholly recommend it as a time killer but just know it is not a colony simulator do not purchase this for the colony aspect you re making a factory here 10 10
