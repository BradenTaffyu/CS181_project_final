2016 tl dr 8 10 buy it going strictly by the base game since no dlc expansions exists as of now stellaris is a terrific grand strategy game from paradox difficulty and learning curve are easier than europa universalis though this may change when more dlc comes out the game is very easy to get into especially if you re familiar with paradox games it s in more of a fantasy sci fi environment than their other stuff so if you re not into that then i d avoid this however if you want to fight aliens this game is for you pros very immersive writing strategy is necessary not just ship spam different playstyles supported and encouraged both pros and cons to playing tall and wide interesting mechanics that make managing a large empire less micro y but still challenging insanely well developed early game colonizing planets is super fun late game crises make steamrolling impossiblecons mid game can get very dull after a certain size scientific research becomes practically pointless strategic resources don t feel very important just kind of nice to have sectors lack the depth they demand diplomacy is pretty bland for a paradox gameoverall i d give this game a solid 8 10 i d definitely recommend buying it if you re a paradox fan or just a gs fan in general
