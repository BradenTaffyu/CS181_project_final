2021 early access review so about 200 hours in two weeks after starting the game the first time this is about as bad a drug as factorio and impressive bit of engineering given the speed of operation especially with save files of this size overall a massive logistics puzzle with somewhat sparse visibility to what happens around the star cluster but i would not be surprised if tools for that get added in future patches anyway back to transporting photons with a ftl logistic vessel actual light travelling faster than light works perfectly on linux just turn of the precompiled shader cache updates if it suddenly stops running no need to re install the whole game just delete the shader cache folder under steam ohh the drama when the game stopped working after 80 hours and i had to figure that out
