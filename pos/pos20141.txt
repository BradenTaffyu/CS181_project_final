2016 personal rating not a bad game i expected moreclassic rating new vegas doesn t add too much to what we saw in fallout 3 in my opinion there are companions enhanced crafting which is pretty useless anyway maybe more weapons and mods but it s the same old game i can t tell one true change in game play or ui main story falls short in comparison to fo3 nv it s mostly made of side quests some of which very interesting i have to admit but all the courier s story starts and ends in a flutter not going to spoil i loved fo3 dark setting i liked new vegas i loved fo3 story i liked new vegas i had some crashes in fo3 i had many more in new vegas i don t remember any particular bug in fo3 i found a lot in new vegas from mid game to end i had to open the wiki almost every time i played i had to fast travel very often in nv because of silly quest while i spent more time actually playing in fo3 factions implementation is not good in new vegas in my opinion if you don t pay attention to what armor you wear your playthrough can get f d up as you can see there s a lot of things i didn t like but i cannot say new vegas is a bad game i can just tell to whoever is still doubtful about choosing fallout 3 or new vegas go with the former you won t be disappointed
