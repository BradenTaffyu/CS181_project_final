2019 if you follower of my curator and you mainly looking for more detailed information about how to get all achievements without too much replay in nearly only in a single playthrough then please scroll to the hey i am an achievement hunter part or just keep reading the whole review which will be a short review with direct information so good old fallout i waited a long time to play this game it is now easy to get the goty for a quite cheap price nearly every month there is a 50 discount for it and it is definitely worth its price after all it offers a good 120 hours if you planning to explore everything or actually more as i not finished every sidequest this game is far from being perfect don t misunderstand me the previous sentence mainly because of the high expectations this means the i disliked part might be much longer than the part i liked but the game is still very recommended it can make you busy for 1 2 months i liked fallout games were always lore heavy there are a lot of stories to read about the pre war world personal logs etc the atmosphere of the game is well done just like always few new pieces of music and some of the good old ones so still fun to listen to the in game radio huge world to explore s p e c i a l mini videos are great minigames what you can play by acquiring the game holo tapes far harbor dlci disliked city simulator i not liked to manage villages repetitive quests here and there but that might felt to me only as it is hard to show something new to veteran gamers i really not like that i can t dismantle junk to ingredients not even at my own village i stored soo many junks so when i wanted to get back some ingredients from the main storage where i kept most of my items then it was difficult to find sometimes ai followers always blocked my path i stopped to use them as soon as i was enough effective for solo combat sometimes i felt so that the repop of monsters is a bit way too fast no summary ending once dlc or game finished about what effect your decisions had the main storyline was weak at least for me the game missed some craziness and weird characters balance of the game felt bad because of leveling you will encounter stronger enemies some of them need so many bullets and that all with the maxed stats talents you can get for the related guns diamond city radio speaker well bad very bad dlcs were disappointing except the far harbor one nuka cola is the only other real dlc but it felt just like a territory clear grind the game was developed by bethesda and not by obsidian fallout new vegas is much better i doubt you will be sad about purchasing the game if you like rpgs so go ahead the goty isn t much on 50 if you compare it to the hours you will spend with this game hey i am an achievement hunter first of all if you want to get all the achievements then you need to own the dlcs so buy the goty perfection time is min 120 hours and there are some annoying and grind heavy achievements hey nuka cola dlc ticket farm i talking to you you should be easily getting all achievements no real skill required you can play the game on any difficulty and one playthrough enough with minimal loading you should reload only for the endings and you need to avoid to make main factions hostile as long as possible other than these end quests of main factions the achievements not exclusive you can t miss them permanently guides achievement walkthroughs do not always explain where is the point of no returns until when you can progress on the main storyline etc ideally you want to get on as long as they let you progress without making other main factions hostile unlike in fallout new vegas the quests not explaining what is this point no quest about deciding for one faction so if you not save your game then you might need to replay a lot i explain in the following video what are these quests how far you can progress how to solve some previous quests to avoid longer endgame which leads to long replay if you want to go for other endings or other faction related achievements youtube video fallout 4 point of no returns or where to stop and save before quests make factions hostile views 20 781 in fallout 4 only the base game has exclusive achievements badges want to get all of it with minimum replays and so in nearly only one playthrough then check this video this review was created for average achievement hunter curator follow my curator if you like to see achievement related information completion time difficulty to get all achievements on the store page of the games the curator group doesn t mark any game as recommended so it shows useful information about achievements on the store page of the games without influencing the main store page of steam with recommendations all games sorted to lists based on expected completion times no point not to follow
