2016 plague inc evolved is a strategy game about creating and evolving a disease that will infect and ultimately destroy the whole world upon discovering your disease scientists of the world will attempt to cure it breakdown great things this is the biggest pro in my opinion there is something for everyone here it is a great casual experience for people who aren t big strategy gamers my friend who claims to dislike map games loves this game hardcore strategy gamers and fans of the genre will also find fun here i for example play tons of 4x and grand strategy games and i love this one as well the harder difficulties and scenarios custom and official can provide great challenges and interesting strategical situations fantastic difficulty curve the game is very easy to learn and provides a fun challenge to master it at the hardest difficulties the jump from brutal to mega brutal is pretty big but that gap can be filled by harder plagues or scenarios the game never has to feel too easy or too difficult good things good variety with the main plagues official scenarios and custom scenarios i will say that the normal plagues bacteria fungus parasite and prion all feel very similar to each other but even with that in mind there is still a good amount of variety in the main game some of the official scenarios are very interesting and can provide a large or small shake up to your normal strategy however i will say a large portion of the scenarios don t feel all that different from the main game or each other which is why i put this under good things instead of great things but there are so many scenarios you will definitely find something interesting custom scenarios are great the game allows community members to create their own scenarios and customize the world events and the plague itself to create a unique experience when you start to get a bit bored of the normal stuff there are basically endless custom scenarios to play true not all custom scenarios are good but custom scenarios are produced so often that is is viable to only have to play really good ones and the editor is very intuitive and explains everything very well so it easy and quite to fun to create your own custom scenario i rank this as good instead of great because the editor doesn t provide that much variety and last time i checked truly unique plagues like the necroa virus and the neurax worm cannot be created in the editor granted they would be difficult to create but many communities have dedicated creators who put time and effort into creating cool content for the game and i have no reason to believe this one is any different anyway you may feel that none or few of the custom scenarios feel meaningfully different from anything else clean and intuitive ui you will never be befuddled by this game s ui it is not over complicated while still providing all the information you might ever want as well it looks very nice and has some nice aesthetic but not distracting touches such as a cool picture of your pathogen and what an infected body might look like concept it is a very cool and interesting concept to manufacture a plague to infect and kill the whole world the only other game i know of that has a similar concept is pandemic but plague inc has much more depth i would say sound effects are pretty cool and fit the theme of the game rather well there are enough to feel satisfying but not so many that you get annoyed okay things main graphics on the map are pretty good if simple you can zoom in quite far and see some detail however you would never want to do this as there is never a reason to not look at the whole map as you might miss something so you might get a little tired of looking at the same thing all the time besides the ui screens although admittedly it is satifying to see everything slowly turn red music is a bit lacking but not bad the main music creates the feel the game is going for and is mostly ambient noises i m not sure if actual music would fit this game well but nevertheless i cannot rate the sound here as good it is a short loop and there is not much to it but since it is just ambient it won t annoy you i wouldn t recommend muting it multiplayer is pretty meh there are two multiplayer modes co op and competitive which i really like they are pretty different so i will start with co op co op mode involves two players controlling separate plagues on the same map and they can work on separate regions or the same and they can buff each other however multiplayer seems to function very differently than singleplayer with changed mechanics and yet the game doesn t seem to tell you this so we floundered a lot in this mode despite both being very good at the singleplayer modes even when we won most of the time one of the plagues got eliminated early on and the other one did all the work also pop ups don t seem to appear as much in multiplayer so i had my plague 50 cured without even noticing that the cure started competitive is fine but it feels like a race like we might as well just play singleplayer and see who wins first interactions are limited to several evolutions that can sabotage the other player some of these are very major and can change the whole game but usually the other player will just do the same to you as they are pretty much forced to so it still feels like a race just under different conditions also the victory conditions are changed a bit you don t have to kill everyone just infect everyone which is a big negative for me as it feels like half the game is just missing you can also win if the other plague is eliminated as mentioned you can sabotage the other player but this victory condition almost always feels like you won because the other player messed up and not because you did well so can be a bit unsatisfying i have mostly mentioned negative things but that s not to say that multiplayer isn t fun it is still plague inc and all the previously mentioned positives still apply it just isn t quite as fun as the singleplayer mode for me however big disclaimer i don t have many friends who play this game so i haven t actually played that many multiplayer games so my opinion on them might improve as i come to understand them a bit better bad things this game s only real con is that it can get a bit repetitive but that can be a big con the game lacks any real variety in its events and doesn t have that many to start with so there is very little variety created by in game events and even the ones that do happen seem to barely affect anything in the game for many of the plagues the exact same strategy can be used and it can feel very repetitive however this isn t a huge con as many of the more unique plagues and scenarios can change it up quite a bit but it will still feel prevalent as you try out different things this is sort of a subset of the repetitiveness but it is the biggest issue for me most of the symptoms feel the same there are many symptoms in the game but for most plagues they consist of increases infection rate increase death rate or slow down cure research different tiers of symptoms will do this at different levels but still feel the same it can be fun to think about how people are affected by the actual symptoms you are adding but from an actual gameplay perspective many feel exactly the same overall rating 8 10 worth buying at full price the pros heavily outweigh the cons and you will definitely get some fun from this game this review went way longer than i intended but hopefully it was helpful to you
