2016 early access review i played the first divinity original sin and now i have played divinity origin sin 2 to completion or to at least completion when it comes in terms of what is available in the alpha and yet i am considering picking it up for a second run the combat of this game is excellent and i believe is its shining feature and if you think you are particularly good at it there is now even a pvp arena in dos 2 with that said if you did not like dos 1 you will probably not like dos 2 the game is the same formula practically the same combat system with a few improvements and a few setbacks and really the same story quality of the first game you might find the story a little disappointing if you bought into all the hype that larian threw down about hiring so many writers when really what you are looking at is pages and pages of written dialogue no voice acting that you will probably begin to skip through six hours into the game and i say that as someone who loves books andrej sapkowski s blood of elves is sitting right next to my keyboard but look on the brightside it s still early access right they could improve it well at least we can hope while i certainly have enjoyed dos 2 for its combat graphics and character design the story is not going to win any awards if it stays in its current form if that is going to be a deal breaker for you then i suggest you wait until the game is finished and see how it is then but if a badass combat system is enough to draw you in then i ll see you in the arena oh by the way i should mention that the lizards in this game look really really badass and sexy 3
