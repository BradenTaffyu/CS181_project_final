2014 the very first fallout game i ve played i ve been sitting here for maybe 15 minutes thinking of something to write but thanks to writer s block i m going to make this short and sweet it ll run well on pretty much any computer that s not 10 years old it s fun and funny if you like shooters or rpgs i d recommend this if you like skyrim i d suggest thisif you do buy it i just suggest one thing use the manual save and only the manual save if you re comfortable using the quicksave go ahead don t try and load off a quicksave though only use it when in game don t use the autosave function it s pretty unreliable but it doesn t matter everything comes down to this i shot someone in the hand with a hunting rifle he blew up 10 10
