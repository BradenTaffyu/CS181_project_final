2015 early access review a review is nothing if it isn t helpful so let s get down to brass tacks at the moment you should know beamng is not a game it s at best a sandbox title with most of the necessary content missing its far better to say at the moment that its a game engine looking for a game but what a game engine the content as it stands offers you the chance to drive round a handful of locations thanks to johnny3600 who points out that this game uses torque3d as an engine not the cryengine as i first thought though the backgrounds are very far cry think tropical vegetation poorish roads but critically are quite large and varied so you can expect well made tarmacked roads to ring islands with grotty little dirt tracks in the centre often leading to ledges mountains etc the vehicles are mostly regular cars i believe generic models including pickups and a rig don t expect forumula 1 cars this is a far more everyday selection of vehicles so far it all sounds uninspiring what makes it so good well the physics engine effectively makes it a crash simulator every piece of each car is detailed to give it form bendableness weight and mass etc when assembled they work as a real car would but when you come into contact with something they all crush get displaced and generally smash up most convincingly on its own its not enough to make a car game but when its combined with a very satisfying feeling of driving you have a potential monster hit in a word what we have here is the beauty of mathematics cutting edge in all its glory put to use to smash things up it s fantastic rewarding enormous fun to drive and best of all utterly convincing i ve crashed enough in this game to know that you don t want to fishtail and clip the rear of your car if you re going to crash in real life because the loss of control is horrendous as in how a certain english ex princess met her fate you stand a far better chance of survival just going head on with an object despite the g forces with a seatbelt of course trust me the first time you crash a car in this game the sense of emotional trauma in the silence that follows is palpable so there it is a few cars some nice locations and nothing to do all dressed up and nowhere to go i m not even sure that anyone knows exactly how it will all end up when it finally becomes a game there are experiments with car chases and there s always the prospect of multiplayer but frankly it doesn t lend itself to the usual genres of car games you just have to buy it on faith at the moment but its still immensely enjoyable crazikyle points out that there are lots of mods available right now and for many people this is a deal breaker i m no expert on mods so by all means anyone who has some to recommend should add them to the bottom of the review in the comments section i want to make this review as helpful as possible and if you folks can help do that by contributing suggestions then please go right ahead and do so one more thought to leave you with i ve played some excellent racing games including iracer project cars assetto corsa etc none of them feel like you are driving an organic real world machine quite the way that beamng does the cars in beamng are made of assembled pieces and the pieces shake and rattle and bounce under the torque and forces just like a real car other developers pretend their cars are real by suggesting movement and bounce but only beamng has the sense that you have a real honest to god vehicle glued to your throttle pedal if that isn t enough to pique your interest may i suggest a nice game of scrabble
