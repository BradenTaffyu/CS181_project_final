2022 not a video game reviewer but wanted to drop a recommendation so that the developers get more recognition solid art style music story and gameplay i love the style of using a company commander and adding up to 8 units in your company with the different upgrade paths of units you can get really creative and create some overpowered units in the late game in a fun way great game would recommend
