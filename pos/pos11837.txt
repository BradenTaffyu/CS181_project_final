2013 early access review i bought this game off the back of seeing rhino crunch playing it then managed to get it when it arrived on the fun pimps website many months ago i was addicited from the get go even with all the bugs it still was very enjoyable as an experience and enjoyed the fact i was part of this epic game being built comparrisons to minecraft i think any form of comparrison made to mc is definitely valid though what mc is missing 7 days provides beautiful graphics even better with new update four different biomes to explore destroy and rebuild if anything if your an avid mc player then this will only satisfy your building needs even more with zombies as your common enemy current stage of development so there are a lot of features that are coming in the future what we have at the moment is a very enjoyable survival crafting building game with zombies it plays better in this current stage than all the previous alpha s apart from mp but i have heard a fix is coming soon the areas are interesting the updates are coming much more regularly they are trying to balance between what is suggested and their own game plan this is going to be a very much fun pimps community game so you have a lot to look forward too so my final word is if you want to help test the game in the current phase and you are a massive fan of this game buy it now and start having fun report those bugs if you like the look of it but don t feel like buying the game in it s current state of development then i would wait until its finished and then buy it i bought it for more than it currently is on steam and i am definitely not complaining it s immense fun and in short if you loved minecraft and your a massive fan of zombies then i think you should 100 give this game a go
