2020 after a long day of playing don t starve together with my family in real life we often enjoy unwinding with an evening of not starving together as well i have roughly 390 hours in this game as i write this and my kids and i frequently enjoy playing it if you like games that are open world with goals defined by you and you enjoy a bit of dark humor then this will be an enjoyable experience for you it has it all not starving night and day weather different biomes to explore combat base building collecting crafting magic and sanity but wait there s more the game really includes so many don t together activities such as not freezing together not overheating together not getting caught in the dark together not being killed by a pack of hounds together and so so many other things to avoid together the game play and controls are easy to learn though combat can take a bit to get right at first keep at the combat and soon enough you too will know the secret of using ham to defend yourself music feels fitting graphics are a superb fit for the game and world generation allows for a variety of play styles klei has been fantastic with support frequently offering events and new content in short it would be a difficult time to find more fun than this while avoiding starvation with family and friends i highly recommend
