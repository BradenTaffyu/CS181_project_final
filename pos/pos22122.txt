2017 so after putting a lot of hours into all of the dark souls games i decided to write a review about this awesome game dark souls 3 is the third and the last dark souls game in the franchise and frankly it is a worth end to the series now let s talk about some aspects of the game the story ever since gwyn has linked the first flame there were countless other heroes that relinked the first flame so that the age of fire can continue the current four lords of cinder rise from their grave because the fire is threatened these lads are supposed to re link the flame so the age can continue but instead of doing that they would rather watch the flame die out so the flame wakes up the unkindled you are one of these unkindled ash your job is to bring the lords of cinders back to their thrones either alive or as ashes my overall opinion of the story is that its pretty awesome but can be really confusing sometimes and it needs a lot of reading the gameplay dark souls 3 s gameplay is basically dark souls 1 s gameplay but with a lot of fixes and balances and some you still have the same main stats but some of them either got removed or they were made into one stat endurance no longer gives you more equip load instead equip load can be raised by spending points in vitality and also the resistance stat from dark souls 1 is completely gone you can t invest points directly into resistance also because of a lore aspect you no longer have the option to stack up humanity actually humanity is quite gone from this game instead you use embers to restore your link to the other worlds and also give you an hp boost which lasts as long as you re alive to simplify it once you use an ember you can be invaded but you can also summon other people to help you at certain areas summons also invaders also have the option to use estus although the overall estus you can use while being summoned is reduced now you can also equip up to four rings oh and one other thing poise is completely broken covenants also return and quite frankly some of them are really fun and give you good rewards while some of them are totally dead for example the blade of the darkmoon my favourite covenant from ds1 is utter in this game since you can t level up because the covenant itself relies on another covenant way of blue which is a completely dead covenant on levels above 25 overall the gameplay is pretty cool you have a lot of variety in magic stuff pryomancy offensive or healing miracles sorceries dark sorceries miracles pryomancies and you also have a ton of melee weapons to use this makes ds3 s replayability insane because you can literally make almost any kind of build you want the controls i highly recommend using a controller nuff said i think the controlls are good but if this is your first souls experience you gotta get used to it first the graphics areas and armour this game is super gorgerous it looks amazing in almost every area i especially love how irithyl looks like with all that snow and stuff superb i really like how some weapons got some extra details boss weapons look amazing the enemies are also very nicely detailed almost all of the areas look very cool but honestly there were some areas that could ve been bigger and better detailed for example the profaned capital is a joke it s basically a 5 minute run to the boss and that s it the armour in dark souls 3 is really good there are a lot of armour from ds1 for example you can get lautrec s armour or artorias s armour you can do a lot of cosplay by combining other armour pieces together overall they have a lot of variety some things that are worth mentioning dark souls 3 continues ds1 s and ds2 s trend with having some ridicolously easy bosses wolnir deacons of the deep crystal sage and the anchient wyern are basically a joke dark souls 3 also continues the other trend from the other games which is that the main guys you are supposed to defeat are probably one of the easiest bosses the abyss watchers themselves aren t so hard yhrom the giant is a complete joke aldrich isn t so particularly hard either although thank god the twin princes actually manage to put up some kind of challange i would ve enjoyed if most of these bosses put up some kind of challangealso there are the invaders i myself don t have a really big problem with invading but some people really don t like how this entire system works alright that about covers most of what i wanted to say let s gather the cons and pros pros fitting end to the series lore is quite interesting awesome gameplay mechanics good variety of magic or pure melee weapons insane ammount of builds you can almost make any kind of build you want graphics are awesome lot of throwbacks to dark souls 1 forgot to mention this game has an amazing soundtrack most of the bosses are really well done can be played as coop game almost entirely pvp lot of npc questlinescons the main lord of cinders were pretty easy to defeat yhorm the giant was pretty dissapointing some areas in the game got very little ammount of detail the proned capital had some potention but it was completely wasted poise sucks arse it s broken it does not work covenant farming the insane ammount of lag in pvp people can literally hit you with a broken straight sword 3 meters in front of you i don t know if pvp is designed that way or not but they definitely should do something about it sometimes you land a huge hit and the enemy easily rolls through it despite the fact that seemingly you hit the dude in the nuts my final verdict 9 10 if you already have completed dark souls 1 and loved it i definitely recommend you to purchase dark souls 3 if you have not yet played any kind of souls game its still worth to pick up but you ll need some time to get used to it this is an awesome end to this awesome series thanks for reading this review edit grammar and formatting
