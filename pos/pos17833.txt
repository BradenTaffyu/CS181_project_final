coming from company of heroes 2 i only cared about the multiplayer version of this game let s be honest this game was horrendous when it came out a slap in the face of long time fans and what happened everyone moved on or went back to company of heroes 2 a f ing gem graphics don t trump game play personally i went back to coh 2 i was content and honestly not interested in this game anymore i think a year or so had gone by and a friend who was new to the series said let s give it go reluctantly i agreed i was pleasantly surprised while it is not perfect yet i can see the light a lot has changed getting closer and closer to what coh2 has but with a better base to build off the main things i would like to see 1 more variation more variation more variation they have recently been adding more battlegroups but they got to pump those numbers variety is the spice of life 2 price is still steep literally have friends that won t even try this because of it reviews 3 add new teams russian japan oberkommondo west etc don t limit the game by sticking to the mediterranean theatre crap we are all here just to blow sh t up
