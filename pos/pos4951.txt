2022 the first 10 20 hours of a play through are usually pretty fun because the gameplay loop is engaging but by the endgame the gameplay loop loses steam and the only things left the game offers are the boring shallow quests and the mediocre gunplay the quest can be still seem interesting on a first play through so i think the game is worth the recommend but know that every subsequent play through will be rely heavily on the core gameloop to still be interesting
