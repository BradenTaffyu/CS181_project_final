2017 this is an amazing game with a intrisic fun people shouldnt vote down this game beacuse of some perceived slight its a wonderful way to learn about orbital mechanics and the general idea of how space flight is accomplished i cannot tell you how much fun i ve had just going in blind and totally blowing up rockets on the launch pad trying to reach orbit but when you do its very much worth the effort i ve owned this game for a number of years now and i d easily buy it again and i have for my children over and over just to help everyone learn a little more science
