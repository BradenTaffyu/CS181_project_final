2018 genre farm rpggraphics i like the pixel graphics age i would say from 10 years old story the game doesn t have a story directly you will always learn new things about the farm in the game difficulty very easy at the beginning it was just a little tricky to find your way around the city and to know where to do what on the map game time i would say endlessly it s a lot of fun and it s worth starting all over again bugs not known multi singleplayer you can play alone or with up to three other people together it s all the more fun by the way the money is then shared price full price is worth it negative positive no negative aspects the game is a lot of fun especially with a few friends the game is also a good candidate for relaxing you can t get upset with the relaxed music in the game so if you had a hard day you can simply blow away your stress on the farm recommended only follow me on for your support
