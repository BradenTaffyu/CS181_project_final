2020 absolutely incredible game i love it to bits and it was a blast going for 100 achievements except for the mini game one screw that overall it s a 9 10 for me dirt cheap for the amount of content it has i especially enjoyed the social aspects of the game gameplay 8 10 combat drags it down a bit music 11 10 you won t get them out of your head visuals 8 10price 10 10 too cheap honestly
