2019 a racing game that blends a narrow single series focus with excellent visuals surprisingly good sound and solid racing in a dynamic environment with day night cycle and changing weather for offline racers mid event saving works quickly and well allowing full endurance events to be run over several realtime days and doubling up as a poor man s flashback tool if you need that and the ai provides a solid challenge with the nature of endurance racing less immediate need for passing and cars frequently being in different parts of their tyre fuel life covering somewhat for all racing ai s difficulty with overtaking the ui isn t perfect partly because the complicated nature of engine maps brake balance traction control abs et al requires a lot of buttons but also because things like pit stop settings are not intuitively placed they re in the car setup menu and then once you get into the race the later pit stop presets may forget the tyre and fuel settings you chose the focus on just one racing series is either a weakness or a strength depending on your tolerance for gt3 cars but overall acc is a game much improved by its 1 1 patch offering customisable challenge in classic locations made to look beautiful by excellent graphics and dynamic environments
