2019 this game didn t really appeal to me but i saw the raving reviews from it on here and so i felt like giving it a try since it was on sale during the holidays i can now confidently say that this game has sincerely impressed me so far the top down view isn t something i really like in any games beside the pokemon series but divinity 2 benefits from this in a practical sense and immersive sense weirdly enough i m currently 14 hours in and still on the first main area but i really am enjoying this so far the game rewards you for being clever but it never punishes you if you want an easier experience i feel like i m only scratching the surface and i can t wait to play more
