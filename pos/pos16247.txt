2016 i have several board games that i used to play in real life with folks stuff like arkham horror munchkin and battlestar galatica since i have several friends on skype we heard about tts and all got happy about it it can be tricky sometimes to find the games from the workshop to play and sometimes every workshop game does not work as expected but overall i m happy with tts
