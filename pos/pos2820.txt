2021 divinity 2 original sin is by far the most detailed and self aware turn based rpg i have ever played it s level of detail on combat or interactions with the environment or diologues or the story arcs and even the relations between those character arcs is just divine i just finished the game and i am writing this review as credits rolling and gotta say i am a wreck right now and the game s god tier soundtrack definitely doesn t helping i am almost about the cry and i did nt even got a sad ending or anything i just feel like i am ending a friendship that means a lot to me i am amazed how this game s each character grow in me an absolute must buy for all the rpg lovers and a reason to play rpg for new comers
