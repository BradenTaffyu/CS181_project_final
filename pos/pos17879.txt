2023 so after reading and going off other peoples perspective on coh3 with their opinions containing negative feedback such as sound or graphical disappointment i decided to purchase the game myself to validate whether or not this game is in fact un enjoyable or simply not meeting the expectation of a new coh overall i would recommend this to a friend as coh3 brings an amazing replayable singleplayer potential and upping the difficulty can provide some rewarding battles with the ai for your new experienced rts players the online multiplayer will require some practice strategy and fine tuning plays to combat the enemy some pointers i have for anyone who d like a casual average rts players opinion who has played all 3 coh games i really enjoyed the take on the single player board incorporating a meaningful and potentially positive or negative impact on your decisions during the campaign they allowed us the play ability and choices for those of us who enjoyed the coh2 ardennes dlc into the base game the multiplayer is at first a different feeling and the ui is a new feel that brings out concepts from coh 1 and i really enjoyed playing that out the multiplayer is fast everchanging dynamic and extremely enjoyable when you have unified efforts from your team the sound and graphics are perfectly fine in my opinion i m using a mid tier pc build and haven t had any issues with how the game appears with every setting maxed out always do your own research as i did because these negative reviews did deter me at first but i fell in love again with coh3 with valuable teamplay friends to play with and the fun enjoyable singleplayer coh3 has to offer
