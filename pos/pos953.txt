2016 i am absolutely flabbergasted and disgusted that inside won best indie game of 2016 against stardew valley stardew valley in my opinion is easily the game of the year not since i was a child have i wanted to replay a game as much as i did with this game the game is comfy and builds a nostalgia building game without having to rely on existing games or tropes to build it for you in my opinion it is the perfection of a genere and i can t possibly imagine any way that it could be made better outside of more content not that it doesn t have enough
