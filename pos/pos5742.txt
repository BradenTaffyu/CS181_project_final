2022 bannerlord is a great continuation of the mount blade series it has more refined economical battle and levelling systems compared to its predecessor introducing new features such as character perks which are unlocked every 25 levels in each skill tree another interesting feature that the game has introduced are the clans and the ability to have a family meaning now player have the option to marry existing npc have children with them and even witnessing them die of an old age or in battle if the options of birth and death are enabled before starting the new game when you start a new game you start off with clan level 1 which can be levelled up by gaining renown that can be acquired from tournaments or winning battles against the enemy each clan level that you gain allows the player to have more workshops companions and clan parties that can be sent out and fight alongside you if they happen to be nearby just like in previous games you can be a mercenary for a kingdom of your choosing become its vassal or start your own kingdom this time however it is possible for a ruler to die if birth and death options are enabled before starting a new game in which case a new ruler has to be selected by the council so it is possible now for the player to become a ruler of the already existing faction it is also possible for the player to abdicate leadership of a faction if leading your kingdom becomes too much or too boring more in depth kingdom options and decisions have also made their debut in bannerlord now policies can be enacted within the kingdom where each policy gives different drawbacks and benefits policies are enacted by the support or opposition of the council if the council opposes the policy the ruler can still override this decision but this will require to spend influence points influence points are gained daily if you re a vassal or leader of your faction these can also be gained by winning battles donating prisoners to other allied clans or donating troops or equipment to other lords influence points are also spent to create armies and then spend further after certain amount of time to increase cohesion of the army if cohesion is too low there is a possibility that lords may leave your army weakening your forces if you are a mercenary you can still earn influence points these are then exchanged for gold automatically since you are not a vassal it makes sense for a mercenary to not spend influence points on kingdom decisions the main quest is slow and mundane it eventually leads you to creating your own faction while giving you a time limit to conquer certain amount of settlements while also trying to prevent conspiracy raising against you this comes in form of additional quests such as destroying caravans full of equipment or destroying bands of bandits near your settlements these are a pain to deal with if you are at war with other faction as these quests can be located on the other side of the map leaving you vulnerable to enemy sieges if you fail to complete these conspiracy quests it will eventually lead to at least 3 factions declaring war on you all at once and the only way to make peace with them is to beat them to submission as offering peace is not an option unfortunately honestly it will be better to ignore the main quest and play normally since not completing it doesn t affect your save in any way as you can still create your own faction once you reach clan level 4 when it comes to the rest of the game combat and commanding your troops feels great it s fluid and intuitive and the game gives you different ways to approach sieges such as building battering rams siege towers or simply using ladders to infiltrate a town or a castle when you defend you have options to use ballistas or catapults to fend off the enemy just like in previous games you recruit troops and companions upgrade them to make your party stronger and defeat your enemies take over settlements and grow your empire or help other existing faction to become undeniably the strongest nation in calradia this game definitely will make you pour many hours into it as it is very engaging and fun and i would consider this game a must have for medieval enthusiasts or any sandbox lovers however there are also some downsides to this game despite all the positives the game can get quite repetitive and after spending many hours it may eventually get boring for some people ai of the enemy and allied lords can be annoying and making peace with other rulers can become quite expensive which can put strain on player s finances leading to smaller castle town garrisons making it an easy target for the ai in future wars if you start your own faction there is a high chance that you will get war declared on you by other factions constantly as you will seem significantly weaker than their faction this can give you a lot of headache and not many chances to rebuild your army to properly defend yourself recently steam achievements were added to the game with the official release and it has been discovered that some of them are glitched and they cannot be achieved even if the conditions are met which is irritating tl dr it is a great game with new fantastic systems and mechanics such as kingdom decisions policies clans and families as the game goes on you can feel the progression of your character and satisfaction that comes with it combat feels fluid and intuitive while gameplay itself is as good as ever however the game can get very repetitive the ai of the lords can be infuriating at times especially rulers that declare war on you constantly when you start your new kingdom some achievements are glitched and cannot be achieved thus preventing player to achieve 100 of the game but i m sure this will be fixed soon caravans seems to be useless in this game and it is a waste of gold that can be spent on anything else other than caravans overall this is a fantastic game that provides a rich experience and i think that everyone should try it out
