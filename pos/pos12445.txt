2020 probably the best game that i ve ever played in my childhood this game is a g old and never it dies the memories i give everything to repeat flash in front of me as i try to say this game is the best of all and of course it improves some of your abilities as a person talking and trying to communicate with another person unlike any other games you dont have to kill every ppl you see so therefore you get a chance to communicate with them and thats when your skill in talking as a person starts to improve basic stuff about modding and error fixing sometimes some mods and the game itself dont intend to work like the missing textures and crashes which makes the player try to test and search for something to fix it most important one creativity gmod is a sandbox game a genre which player is left to try and create or invent something which other players would appreciate like sfm videos dups maps mods etcif you havent played it i suggest that you do before you lose the only chance to create memories me and my friends were only enjoying the game and didnt know we were making memories gl hf my good reader
