2022 early access review this is potentially the greatest game i have ever played no matter what other games i play i always find myself back playing dyson sphere program the buildings build paths technology fuel types research the list is endless of well designed and thought through components but that will pale in comparison to the graphics your jaw will drop the first time you see your dyson sphere being built from a distance trust me you are going to love this game please be careful though you may think you will only play 1 2 hours but then all of a sudden its 3am and you work in 4 hours
