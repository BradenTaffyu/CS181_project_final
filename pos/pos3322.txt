2019 divinity original sin 2 generally has the larian mark of quality the characters and the world are more interesting than most the writing is excellent everything is gorgeous to look at and combat really requires you to think sadly they ve also chosen to add one system that really spoils the whole and kept a couple of other features that were never any good in the first place the one that spoils it is the armor system it s a couple of numbers that block magic or physical damage and status effects heals generally can t sustain you and healing undead is a special pain because they only heal from poison and poison is flammable so good luck with that if anyone on the map is using fire the focus is really always on the armor instead of being a game about the glory and chaos of magic original sin 2 is a game about the importance of proper armor management and that really weighs it down i don t want to be obsessing about equipment when i m supposed to be on a grand adventure another bad decision is the choice to keep the lousy inventory system from the first game it was easily the worst thing about that game and it s also one of the worst things about original sin 2 i d say that over the course of two hours of gameplay i d picked up around 200 items meaning keys crafting materials and written pieces of exposition that i had absolutely no chance of discerning the value of without using google it s like having to organize an extremely cluttered desktop without knowing what any of the icons do it s stupid and it s boring people designed rpgs like this in 1998 please evolve already between all the garbage you re picking up and the armor budget that you have to manage that s an awful lot of paperwork keeping you from enjoying the game itself are you an adventurer or a tax accountant turns out you re both what a life i m also disappointed that they ve chosen to dial back the humor the first game was a comedy murder mystery that turned into a depressing holocaust drama in case it wasn t completely self evident the good part wasn t the depressing holocaust drama that part was complete trash as much as i appreciate my demented squirrel knight and the jokes that they do squeeze in there it s sad that a company that is so good at being funny would instead choose to depress the hell out of you in the sequel the game starts out in a concentration camp where your character is waiting to be used for medical experiments and you also get the delightful task of breaking the news to a baby bambi bear whose mother has been brutally murdered by sociopaths what the larian none of that is ultimately enough to keep original sin 2 from being a good game but it does stop it from being a great one it s a game that could ve been so much more if only larian had been smarter about where they put their focus
