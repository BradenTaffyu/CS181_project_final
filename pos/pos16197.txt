2020 this game is worth every penny and then some there is an abundance of amazing workshop content this game allows my friends and i to have board game nights even though we re scattered all across the u s the vr support is good controls with the vive are a little clunky and take some getting used to the community is always offering to teach new games there is never a shortage of games to join in on this quickly rose to the top of my most played games on steam i highly recommend it
