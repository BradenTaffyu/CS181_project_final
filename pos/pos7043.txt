2017 i first saw ats a long time ago when i watched my son playing it but wasn t keen to be a driver here while i was driving for real would ve been too much although i was really interested and helped him with turning and reversing and stuff i love driving always have it s a passion about a year after i retired i got the urge to keep the passion alive so i started a steam account and my son gifted ats to me as an early christmas present and i ve been driving here since oct 2016 got into it big time and became addicted real quick there s nothing i d rather do than get in the truck take a load somewhere and experience the sunrise sunset and the great scenery i ve done a lot of real life night driving into daylight and when it happens in the game it s so real i yawn and feel that special tiredness you only feel when daylight breaks and you re still behind the wheel even though it might only be two in the arv at my place i m always thinkin about when i m goin to be drivin next and what i m gunna do it s late at night and i hear are you comin to bed yet i say i ll just drop this load off and i ll be there then a couple of hours later i hear when are you comin to bed and i say the same thing again and hear you said that two hours ago that s how it is and that s what it does the best form of addiction i could ever recommend my personal opinion ats it s a lot better than going to bed
