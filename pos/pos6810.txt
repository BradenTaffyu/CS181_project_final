2014 i have bought ets2 through another site so my playtime is not accurate this will be a review from my own perspective my opinion is not a subject to approval in this review i will use 10 different categories each having 10 points at the end of the review i will sum these points up gameplayin euro truck simulator 2 you control a truck driver who slowly climbs up the career path and eventually runs a huge company or goes bankrupt in the process you can customize your truck give your driver a name and so on anything you would want to customize in a truck simulator is there the game is very fun and playable in general it s a great game if you want to relax after or before work school you can also level up in various fields gameplay score 10 10soundthe game features very realistic truck sounds and i have no complaints about those you can hear the rain thunderstorm etc but the biggest flaw i noticed is that i don t hear the ai cars trucks passing by it might be a problem with either my sound card or settings but if i am wrong i will update my review when i figure out how it really is sound score 9 10graphicsas a game developer myself i do understand that if the point of the game is functionality then of course graphics must be put to second or latter place therefore the graphics and animations for ets2 are as good as they should be for a truck simulator i d really give 11 points here if it only was not against my rules graphics score 10 10difficultymy first hours were of course quite difficult to understand the controls but what helped the the most are the manual and the online ets2 guide thanks to those i learned the controls and how to play this game really quickly the developers put their thought into this and for that i salute them i don t remember if there was a tutorial i think there was i ll check when i get back home difficulty score 10 10varietythere is a huge variety of landscape trucks a i cars trucks buildings and everything i would expect this game to have there are lots of upgrades to choose from the developers did a great job on that part the only bad thing which stands out to me the most is probably the people walking on the streets of the cities yeah there are none but hey it s a driving game and maybe the developers decided not to include pedestrians in order to either optimize the game or invest more time on more important things like trucks landscape variety score 9 5 10originalityi haven t really played any other truck simulators in the past so i ll just put a full 10 here originality score 10 10economythe economic business management part of this game however could be improved much more there s really not much you can micromanage you can t negotiate with your employees about salary you can t promote them only level them up you can t enter how much you really want to take from the bank there are no competitors even if you see the actual a i trucks driving on the road however the economic part of the game is still playable i m not saying it s not it s just that tycoon maniacs like me might find this as a huge flaw economy score 5 10a i the ai in this game is really well developed it however still behaves strangely sometimes the cars sometimes don t follow the road rules sometimes they glitch out but overall the ai just about right a i score 8 10controlslike i stated before the controls are well accessible and are easly to learn and customize you can even use a wheel with pedals pretty much what all driving games offer right perfect controls controls score 10 10price vs qualitythe game is 20 euros it is too low should be 40 or 50 buy it before it raises you will not regret it price vs quality score 10 10overalloverall score 91 5 100
