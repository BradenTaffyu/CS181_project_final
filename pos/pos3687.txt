2021 the ending absolutely gripped me roller coaster of sad happy hopeful and depressed emotions a few notes rpg elements are really well done 1 1 earthbound feeling the art is so fantastic one of the games biggest strengths great soundtrack lots of bops the story is the real winner to me i can tell this is going to be one of those titles you wish you could erase your memory of so you can experience it again the game tackles aspects of depression and grief the mixture of light hearted moments uneasy darker undertones and cast of well developed characters makes for a story that sticks with you can easily recommend to anyone who enjoyed earthbound mother or undertale can also recommend to anyone who is interested in the story and wants to embark on the emotional journey
