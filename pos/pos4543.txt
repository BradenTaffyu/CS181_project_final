2014 quite possibly the best power fantasy rpg ever made you start off as the leader of a small band of warriors consisting of both companions with their own backstory stats as well as more disposable troops of various types at the beginning you are mostly limited to skirmishing with small packs of bandits for minor loot and gear to better equip your nascent warband but as your renown and reputation grows you are able to recruit larger numbers of warriors and pledge yourself as a vassal to a noble lord with this newfound status comes responsibilities and you will from time to time be asked to contribute a war party to a campaign against one of the other factions in the game proving yourself to be a loyal subject and a capable warrior leader will bring you to the attention of the leader of your chosen faction and with it opportunities to become a lord yourself with lands granted to you that will provide you with a source of income to maintain your army with the overall design of the game lends itself to a very games of thrones esian feel and at some point you may feel powerful enough to contest for the throne of your faction have you own vassals or even try to unite all of calradia under your banner as far as game mechanics go this game is solidly an rpg unlike medieval total war which this game has some similarities to with both an inventory and stats system for your main character and companions combat oriented stats for each weapon type are raised both by leveling up as well as through usage in combat main knocks against the game are somewhat janky animations and poorly executed autoterrain generation system
