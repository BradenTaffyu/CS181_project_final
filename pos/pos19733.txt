2017 fallout new vegas is probably a great example of what a fallout game should be like i love the location in las vegas area and the mojave desert and the storyline is ok pretty good if just coming from fallout 3 you may find the game slightly different from the previous game make sure to check out the great dlc s made for this game recommended if you like the newer fallout game series the storyline is really my favorite
