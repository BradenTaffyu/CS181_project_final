2018 now that 2017 is but a memory i can say with confidence that divinity original sin 2 was my game of the year although i backed the game on kickstarter just like the first and had an early access copy i didn t play it until full launch so that i could fully immerse myself and immerse myself i did into this high fantasy adventure that manages to make the magical and fantastical feel realistic and gritty it has taken everything that was good about divinity original sin and improved upon it whilst also making it so you don t need to have played the first in any way as it takes place a thousand years before whether i m following a quest that portrays me as the savior of the universe hero complex much or trying to solve the angst of a tiny rat i really believe in my characters and their responses there is a balance between the epic and the banal the frivolous and the fateful that creates a woven world that is wonderful to experience in my first playthrough co op with a friend i m a summoner focusing on gathering my minions i m a bit heavy handed though i ll send my minions into battle at a moments notice from afar but stand aside watching the ebb and flow supporting and commanding the field i speak harsh truths and it frequently gets me into trouble even though i feel righteous in my solo playthrough i m a morally ambiguous pickpocketing hitman with a deep dark past that i ve blocked from memory i fight with my words and flirt with absolutely everyone often getting what i desire in alternative ways even though the majority of the quests are the same on multiple playthroughs bar the character story quests which too are dark and deep it feels different different dialogue and varying methods result in genuinely diverse results and that s testament to the freedom flexibility and depth of the game divinity original sin 2 rewards exploration and creativity as many side quests can only be discovered or completed by turning over every rock talking to every npc or trying things that are a little out of the box this may frustrate some but delighted me at every stage there are no glowing quest signs and immersion breaking yellow exclamation marks here if you don t like reading that s fine as everything is beautifully and uniquely voiceovered but if you don t like paying attention to detail you re going to miss out on a lot of the fun this game is for people who like to genuinely invest their time and attention into the world they re playing and the characters in it perhaps that above all else is what reminds me of the d d campaigns from my youth that i sorely miss tactically the combat is as complicated as you make it with different difficulty settings that cater to your preference for challenge you can brute force things if you re so inclined but you re rewarded for playing smart at any level and the game gives you the tools to feel like a tactical genius with a deep satisfaction when you pull off a clever combo divinity original sin 2 has the old school charm of baldur s gate and planescape torment but with modern mechanics and beautiful aesthetics i finally feel like an rpg has surpassed them it only took a few decades for us to get here i wonder if this is the pinnacle of the genre and how long it ll be before i can say that about a game again if you find the reviews of an old welsh lady interesting please follow my curator page thanks
