2017 guys you don t need to buy dlc dlc is honestly not worthit and the workshop has achieved so much more paradox s dlc isn t worthit but isn t manditory either no need to buy the dlc to enhance the game just get a mod from the workshop road to 56 kaiserreich great war mod the game is great with a some derpy ai but once you have gained some expertise multiplayer can prove to be alot of fun just to clarify once again dlc is not by a long shot needed and will enhance the game marginally in my opinion best ww2 sim and i would definitely reccomend to anyone fanatical or even interested in ww2
