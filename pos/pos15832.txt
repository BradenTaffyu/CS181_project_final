2023 i have played way too many hours of this game i replay the free play levels regularly to relax especially before bed i once had a guy come over for a date he for whatever reason decided to immediately sit at my desk where i had just been gaming opens up steam and starts browsing my games then says why do you have over 250 hours in power wash simulator lol he did not last long before getting kicked out unlike power wash simulator my love which i have since put 50 more hours in and counting super excited with the new and free additions like the tomb raider levels and potential future dlc given that i bought it for like 20 and have had this much fun with it its well worth the money if they keep adding things for me to clean maybe its because i m hispanic but i really love this game i pretty much just exclusively do levels with the highest level power washer to relax although it is pretty fun to work your way up from the crappy starter power washer to the fancy one with all the bells and whistles highly recommend putting on some lo fi hip hop and just zoning out to this game my coworkers are still trying to figure out how to weaponize my obsession with powerwashing by hooking up a real power washer to a controller so i can clean their driveways if only update i m now at 420 hours niceee
