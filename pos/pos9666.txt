2017 highly recommend this is the best physics engine in any racing game hands down might not be the absolute best for just racing or serious trackwork for dedicated sim raccers although it it still amazing for racing assetto corsa comes into its own for drifitng and being able to hold a slide just if you want to learn how to control a car on the edge of its grip assetto corsa is the only game i ve ever played where the handeling model will let you dance on the edge of a cars grip with full confidence that it wont bite back everything s controlable and smooth and if you stick with this game for even a little while you will learn so much as a driver the modding support community is also a massive bonus for heaps of extra free conent but the dlc the kunos provides is amaing as well they re one of the best devs ive ever come accross theyre really close to the community and support the game with regularuodates and dlc in my opinion dont even wait for a sale just buy this thing its worth every penny if you like cars and youll never regret it
