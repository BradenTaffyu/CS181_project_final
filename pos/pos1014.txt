2015 early access review one or two years ago i m not sure why i bought this game probably thinking that s a team of devs whose project i want to get behind a month later i dropped the game thinking it was unplayable and would most likely never be finished i was wrong as poultry with dentures in depth doesn t even start to describe it the gameplay might scare you away but it s efficient once you grasp the goals at hand just act with your best judgmentfirst game in a year me and a friend meet up near muldraugh when i get there he tells me he s got attacked he s wounded fleeing the undead he got lost and bumped into an abbandoned lumber mill with solid metal doors he gives me directions i see where he is while i struggle to get drugs bandages and disinfectant he discovers the joys of stitching oneself we join and while he recovers from his wounds i board the place up and gather all the wood and tools i can we sleep in the break room they re 5 feets away clawing at the boards they never break in after a few days we start scavenging the suburbs just what we need we have projects a few weeks later we re settled the crops we planted on the roof after transporting some dirt there is flourishing days passed by peacefully the place is clear and we start to feel in control he picks up cooking one night i hear moans and cracks the building s on fire whole groups of them came to see it my friend passed out while cooking and canning food for the winter he almost dies in the fire to save the seeds and tools we couldn t survive without once set up in a smaller building we heal and consume all our reserves the meds are gone and the water shuts off we peek outside the z s have massed we can t reclaim enough terrain for a field or rain collectors after making an inventory of what s left we decide to loot the gun store one town away we ll have to get out anyway and at least if we go there we could clean our home afterwards the way there is easy we re well rested fed and hydrated we run there only stopping for the night in a gas station half way just before we arrive we re starving we ate all our food drank all our water we see a supermarket we drink soda and eat meat for the first time in a month we re safe in the offices the stairs are broken we can rest peacefully and the shop is within a stone throw the next morning we silently climb down the roof with a rope made of bloody clothes the score is easy i distract them shooting our few last bullets and run into the woods while he brings down the metal roll up door of the gunshop as fast as he can with a sledgehammer we ve got em we re armed to the teeth and we paint our way out of town red i already aim better by the time we reach the gas station it s a tough fight to reclaim it and i get scrached a cold gives me fever and i freak out at the idea i might be infected i drink and smoke all night to forget the worries by the morning i m all better besides the hangover but who cares i live but my friend is nauseous he didn t rest and looks sickly he tells me he thought we were above use by dates after surviving what we did he couldn t just die from bad cabbage could he a few miles later he can t run anymore i run my lungs out straight to the city he ll die if i can t get him supplies before he stops answering he says this i can t run anymore i m exhausted sick wounded they ll catch me soon i have to go back i put the gun bags down raid the first house i find for basic pharmacy goods and just run his way i battled to find his bright orange shirt in what s left of his last stand and found him brought him peace losing some flesh on the way i was now the one wounded exhausted sick and lost alone on a country road with a dead friend his murderers and three sports bags full of guns and bullets we had played 13 hrs straight at that point no rage or regrets just ideas for next time seriously buy it now
