2021 playing the sims is great it s a childhood classic brings me back to when i first entered the world of pc games it gets depressing around 4am when i realise i ve been playing for hours on end sat by myself playing the life of someone who is more successful funnier more attractive wealthier and generally better off than me living in my dream house i don t want a big house nothing fancy i don t like the idea of having to do a lot of extra cleaning but having a spare room and maybe a small pond would be nice my sims always have so much space for an allotment in this economy how are you meant to have an allotment it s ridiculous plus my sims usually have at least 8 friends i can only aspire to that
