2022 you re either into this sort of thing or not and since i am into this sort of thing it worked out well for me one of the best games on playstation and personalcomputer ever but that sort of hyperbole can get one into trouble old fans should give this a shot if they already haven t 4 years later and new fans should take a look at the old games for something quite different this is the story of a father and son coming to grips with their past who they are and getting ready for what lies ahead thankfully this journey will come to a close with ragnar k to avoid a seemingly mandatory fat filled trilogy plaguing many a franchise stay true to the path and your journey will be well worth it i forgot to add that even if you meet the recommended gpu and memory requirements it s probably wise to take a second look at your cpu as well people are saying what a great port it is but an i7 from 2016 might not be the best option for this
