2016 welcome to the game of the year seriously this game is honestly the best game i have played in years like i can t express how much this game is so heartwarming loving feels amazing fun replayable and the list of adjectives that i could use range on and on and on and on this game is literally the best game i ve played in ages and if you don t do yourself the pleasure of playing it at least watch videos on it because this game deserves the most attention and most amount of love towards it starting off with the story you are an office worker who works for the joja corporation sitting in front of your pc and rotting away along with the life around you the amount of people you see in the starting intro who are wasting their lives away is honestly quite depressing and doesn t even match the tone for the game at all this game uses the form of a tonal shift which basically starts the game off with such a dark tone but enlightens it when you get to your bright vibrant and amazingly joyus farm the story of the game is that your grandfather gives you an envelope to only open when you need a break from your rural life thus the game begins you are introduced to your farm by the lovely robin she tells you that the farm looks kinda trashy and laughs at you she may seem like an evil girl now but she turns out to be such a lovely girl now whilst i m talking about the people i think it is a good idea to talk about the townsfolk i honestly feel such a bond and an actual care between all the villagers and all the people that you encounter they all seem unique and some of them seem to have such a troubled past and many have dark secrets which may be discovered as you progress through the game this is yet another amazing example of how the game makes you feel like you fit in and bond you talk to the villagers and have the option to gift them 2 gifts per week the villager may love it or they may despise it and will make it quite apparent if they hate it as you go up the heart scale you will unlock cutscenes between the villagers and they may send you meal recipes in the mail me myself i have never fit in well with people i would be the person in school and i still am the person who would get left behind or be forced to walk behind the person in front jist of the story i was never popular you re probably wondering where i m going with this and well this game has made me feel like i fit in and that i am actually part of a community of people that care about me it s a heartwarming feeling and makes me feel so happy and just makes me feel a feeling that i ve never felt in a video game enough of the sappy stuff let s talk about the basicness of this game yes the basics i know the basics of some games may be quite boring but this game just does it this game starts you off with tools and just lets you live off the land and allows you to remove the trees rocks and other forageable items which may be lying around your farm this game is literally your big fat sandbox and it allows you to do whatever the hell you want to do with it the game makes me feel like i am free and that the game isn t restraining me to doing anything and isn t stopping me from doing anything stardew valley does an amazing job of letting you feel like this is your house so you can do what you want this game is all about you and making you feel like it s your farm and you can do it i may be sounding repetitive but i need to enforce that this game is your oyster so you ve probably heard that this game is like a cross between harvest moon and animal crossing and it really is this may sound like it s a bad thing but if you ve played either of those games you ll realise that those games are extremely good and make you feel like you re free and have the ability to do anything planting your crops will get into this soon is extremely relaxing and is just such a great time waster everything in this game just feels so amazing and is just i m at a loss for words without repeating myself onto what it s like to actually plant the crops planting crops is a great way of making money in stardew valley be if for your own personal use or be it for money you use your hoe on the ground to till the land you then place some sort of seed into the tilled land and then water it proceed to water it every morning and soon you will have an amazing bountiful farm filled with delightful looking crops and more colours than the eyes can make out you don t have to farm in the game unless you want to actually follow the basic premise of the game duh but there are other alternatives which i cannot for the life of me remember right now so there s fishing in this game are you surprised does the word fishing strike fear into your veins due to other games having such dastardly and terrible fishing minigames well release your fear the fishing minigame in this game is actually bloody brilliant the fishing minigame is where you control a green bar and keep it on the fish if you keep it on the fish for a certain amount of time congrats you ve caught you re first fish and probably not your last if you manage to not keep the green bar off the fish the bar will decrease and will soon stop the fishing that is about it oh also you have a chance to catch a treasure chest which can contain something really good or something well something you can also build crab pots which can capture unique types of fish and trash there s so much in this game that i need to talk about so i hope you re sitting comfortably and are ready for this to go on and on and on onto energy and how that works energy is vital in this game and can sometimes be such a crippling factor in this game you require energy for literally everything you do i m not saying this is a bad thing but i m saying that you need to make sure that you can manage your energy and ensure that you don t overdo it overdoing it will exhaust you and you ll have to go to sleep if you don t sleep you will fall asleep and someone will leave you into your house you ll wake up the next day with a letter in the mail telling you that they found you out cold and left you back home the game allows you to experience it at your own pace if you want to play slow and take each day as it comes do it you re allowed you want to play the game fast and wild do it you re allowed you want to just play the game and not worry about how or what will happen do it you re allowed at the end of the day as i ve said before you can do whatever the hell you want and you are free to do what you want you are literally the owner of this game and you can do whatever the hell you want this game is about expressing yourself and letting you be the controller of the game stardew valley has a museum system which allows you to donate your found artifacts and other little gems that you find throughout the game finding these things will allow you to get rewards which can decorate your house or unlock a whole new place to visit oooooooo foreshadowing this game rewards you for playing it it rewards you for being you it also rewards you in so many ways and just lets you be you you can also find geodes in the land which the blacksmith may open up for you for the small price of 25 gold within these you can find things to donate to the museum or if you want to take the monitary approach to it you can sell the things you get from the geodes final words i ran over the word limit i adore this game i adore concernedape i adore this game and this community this game is actually turning out to be the best game that i ve ever played and i can t wait to sink many many many more hours into this truely magnificent piece of art perfect 10 10 game
