2022 slay the spire is unique enjoyable and very addicting deck building roguelike which as usual is easy to learn hard to master i don t even know where to start i ve put over a hundred of hours into this title at the time of writing the review and i still don t have enough coming back to it every once in a while for my dose of challenge the game includes 4 different characters and each one of them plays differently with at least a few viable strategies for each while the core of the game stays the same no run is like the other and you can never know if the next elite encounter on your way to slay the spire won t be your last the game is marvelous literally everything clicks into a beautiful experience with one more run attitude where hours pass like minutes and you realize it s 7 00 am once it gets bright outside it s good really damn good probably the best deck building game i ve played to date surpassing even hand of fate 1 2 which i also hold in very high regard i don t know what else to write try it once and don t blame me for ruining your social life i don t regret a single hour spent with this title and i m yet to consider it fully finished for myself as higher ascension runs are really difficult even if you perfectly know all the game mechanics archi s seal of approval in regards to being one of the best games of all time if you liked my review you can find more of them on my profile and on my curator page
