2022 does it beat out parkasaurus not really here is why does it need bigger maps yes is it buggy hell yes does it try to justify micromanagement through research yes are storms stupid yes as a floridian i am offended that the building codes of jurassic park cant withstand a hurricane while i have never had a house blown away by 4 direct hits in my life hell the trailer parks here have better survival rates than the multi million dollar facilities built on an island meant to house designer turkey lizards animals that supposedly get along eat each other 100 of the time but my biggest gripe from the makers of planet coaster they couldn t figure out how to add rides to a dinosaur theme park beyond the gyrosphere and the jurassic tour madness if busch gardens can have coasters and giraffes i expect a video game to have coasters and brontosauruses this has so much potential and it is wasted on screen authenticity about a story where every park has failed if there is to be authenticity where tf is dennis nedry in the voice acting nothing beats out a disgruntled slob for a narrator or at least when playing on 1993 mode everytime there is a park sabotage have the didn t say the magic word play still recommending the game cause dinos
