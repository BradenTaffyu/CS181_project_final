this is coming from a 14 year old just to point out i m no professional this game brings something to the table that other games i feel don t do i love the aspect to be the soldier in the fight and being able to be a commander on the front lines from the siege battle to the market system this game has a bright future and has shown to be very entertaining if your considering buying a strategy game i would recommend this 100
