2013 all in all rome 2 is ok there are breatkthroughs and some stuff is broken i wont go deep into details but overall thats what i see good stuff 1 provinces allows to manage the map effectively its a good thing really and i like it a lot 2 overland map rocks its really beautiful 3 squalor system needs osme balancing but in general its fine 4 battles are gorgeous really 5 can still play on my crappy notebook bad stuff 1 no walls for small cities makes me wanna cry 2 no friendly fire icon when your missile units wtfpoon your own infantry 3 magical battle map abilities i believe there is too much micro in using those 4 naval battles ramming sucks maybe its my fault but i just cant get it straight all in all this game still needs tons of polishing mods are there and some of them are good and it will be a gem
