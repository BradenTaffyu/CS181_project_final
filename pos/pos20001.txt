2013 you were fooled tricked betrayed by the man but you wake up from the grave with a mighty lust for revenge and nothing is going to stop you thats how i felt when i first started playing new vegas i think it has one of the most amazing beginnings of any game because you just feel that you have the get back at the man who shoots you in the opening cutscene a lot of people have spoken in a negative way about how the game isn t open from the start and while i partly agree with that i don t think it matters that much becuse starting your journey towards the strip is just so engaging like any other game from the fallout franshice the experience is what you make of it if you just use the first gun you find only follow the main storyline and don t talk to people and explore you re probably not going to get that much out of the game althoug it is certenly playabe that way to get the most out of this game you have to immerse yourself in your character that you can basically make your own in most ways from what faction you are going to side with handling delicate situuations peacfully with you charm or going in guns blazing killing everything is sight how you are going to look and act during dialouges the game is however full of bugs and not just the giant insects trying to kill you some of it can be excused due to it being such a large world with so much to do but it can be annoying at times when the game freezes some character interactions being buggy and objects glitching out but most bugs can be fixed throug unofficial patches since fallout probably has one of the largest modding comunities this also means you can add endless amounts of content to game already filled to the brim with it fallout new vegas is a great addition to the already fantastic fallout series fixing alot of the problems people had with fallout 3 like like the iron sight it aslo contains probably my favourite storyline in the series so far with gambling gangs and a big battle 8 10feel free to check out my other reviews
