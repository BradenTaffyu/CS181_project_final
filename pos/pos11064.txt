2022 the successor of jwe i can confidently say it is better i even pre ordered the game trust me i m definitely not biased lol now let s talk about all the wonderful things this game does the biggest selling point of this game that differentiated it from it s predecessor was the addition of marine and properly flying reptiles you get all the dinosaurs from the last game in addition to the dlc and dinosaur pack dinosaurs from the 1st game already included with even more dinosaurs from the new dinosaur packs it s building customisation is way better and overall the graphics have improved we have more biomes than the classic tropical one in the 1st game our wonderful pc master race has buildings and decorations from all eras there are dlcs some only add a couple of new dinosaurs and some add amazing campaigns and tons of new stuff buying them is always fully optional now the last and biggest bestest thing about this game the developers frontier actually listen to the community i know that s very rare nowadays every dlcs comes with a free update most of the time the free updates bring so much quality of life improvements and just general additions that the players whined about on social media makes them even better than the dlcs they release with well since i made the game look so good it s time to talk about the flaws of this game the game had a few flaws at the start like bugs and other glitches but that s understandable and besides the game breaking ones are patched although there are a few bugs left we have to remember that nothing s perfect and nowadays it s hard to have a big game without any issues the campaign is largely just a tutorial which can t be compared to the amazing campaign of the 1st game but i guess we got the chaos theory mode which is just as good the only hybrids in this game are the i rex and indoraptor which is unfortunate since the hybrids from the doctor wu dlc are way better there isn t that many attractions in the game the community atleast most of it from what i ve seen wants more attractions instead of more species i have to agree though we do get a new building in some free updates they re mostly glorified viewing galleries although since i mostly build nature reserves and more nature focused parks i don t really mind it this game is more sandbox focused than it s predecessor since the campaign is just a glorified tutorial there are other gamemodes besides campaign and sandbox but they are mostly play once and never again atleast for me so if you aren t creative or have a good imagination then i guess buy the game at a discount i don t really care i love sandbox lmao overall it s a great game is it worth the full price absolutely now there are also mods which you can download at your own risk which can enhance the experience even more or hinder it and up your game completely if you don t know how to mod games there are of course mods that also make the species ingame more scientifically accurate i mean it s the jurassic universe the closest to scientific accuracy are the dinosaurs made originally by frontier and not the universal designs but who needs that when we have prehistoric kingdom which if it get s proper support and development could be as good as this game
