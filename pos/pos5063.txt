2018 personal rating 5 of 10one of the hardest game to review this is actually my 6th review i ve written while the previous 5 was deemed not good enough its going to be long so i ll do my best to keep it precise i ve completed the game with 100 achievement plus dlcs excluding hi res on vanilla so this review will solely be based on that graphic is great with very detailed texture additional effects that comes with rain or high radiated areas changes the bright and radiant mood immediately which adds to immersion the detail on weapons armors and items makes you appreciate them more overall one of the best improvement there are a few addtion of enemy types and they their behaviour are even more distinguished each enemy type has also more variety which further determine their actions vats no longer pauses the game but slows action down significantly enemy a i has improved too where they will take cover and attack more strategically with the level cap removed enemy level may scale together with their toughness you may still feel challenged on higher level skill system has been removed and replaced with perks perks also allow you to maxed out your special points each level allows you to spend a point to your perk with skill points gone many features are also taken off or simplified such as lockpicking and speech checks without sufficient points in lock picking perk you simply cannot pick the lock this is similar with speech where you simply cannot select the option to succeed without the perk level speech option now comes in a radial of 4 options a particular location always determines the behaviour or action type example the bottom option is always a hostile reply hostile sarcastic or polite reply most often changes nothing speech checks are most commonly used to request for more quest reward and higher speech check level only means slightly better reward this means the speech system has been simplified to the point where it is utterly shallow and under utilized karma system has been removed and your actions immediately determine your fate if caught picking pocket people will turn hostile this also means factions or followers no longer depends on karma faction points has also been removed this means you can no longer juggle your alliance with multiple factions in the previous fallout so long as the faction points remain high enough you can still accept quest of access their base one of the biggest draw back of this system in fallout 4 is faction may immediately turn hostile when you perform certain action example accepting a quest for another faction even you have not seen the quest through as mentioned above all your action in game immediately changes the course of the game weapons can now be customized extensively each weapon is determine by its base type example standard pistol can be customized into rifle or even sniper rifle apart from unique weapon legendary enemies a new enemy type like a mini boss drops weapons or armor parts with additional ability or perk this could be great if not unique weapons may share the same ability or limited customized ability this makes normal weapons with a good perk succeeds a unique weapon in many ways armors are split into 6 pieces with each also customizable one of the greatest addition to fallout 4 is the settlement building you can salvage or scavenge raw material from the open world and use them to enhance your weapons and armor or build bases you need to court settlers and balance up the settlement with food water power and defence each settlement location are prefixed and the sizes varies bigger the settlement building area the more items you can build the fallout 4 world may seem huge but it seems rather shallow new areas you discover simply means a new possible quest location where you need to traverse till the other end and collect or kill something the quests are rather shallow and meaningless as most quests radiant or fixed seems to be similar most locations are populated with an enemy type and clearing it will only cause them to repopulate after a few in game days so basically the game is neverending grind to level or scavance material for settlement also exploring these location the first time are usually awarded with a collectible at the end to find the settlement keeps giving a repetitive radiant quest that cannot be prevented ignoring it will cause happiness to dwindle and people leaving eventually the quests are among of rescuing defending clearing or killing someone and then return for a menial reward followed by another radiant quest follower points still exists for some reason but unfortunately only a handful of follower offers quests even so their story isn t that interesting and their quests end up going to certain location and performing something similar to the settlement radiant quest you can rack up follower points by taking them along and performing certain action example being polite rude when replying or accepting certain quests maximizing the points will award you with the follower perk while follower with quests require you to complete them to get the perk another issue that plague the settlement is bugs your settlement may suffer from dwindling happiness for no reason or your buildings are suddenly unpowered you may also notice your defense or food or water is insufficient and sometimes they can be fixed by travelling to the settlement and go into build mode building can be frustrating as settlers may get stuck or snapping issues all the dlcs adds new items to be constructed some bizzare while others can proof to be fun such as robot construction and customization however fun it may be and useful the bots are also buggy they may go missing when used as mule between settlements or just disappear from settlements playable content wise there are only 2 dlc with chunky content as appose to its previous games far habour seem pretty atmospheric but otherwise dull and shallow the story is interesting enough to complete and the murky water gives combat a fresh take nuka world on the other hand is far more interesting not only the main quests conflicts with the events in fallout 4 but the locations and side quests also proof to be far more engaging and compelling while some may be weird and others full of surprises as i played i also utilized the console more and more this is due to in game bugs mostly which occure more than it should such as quests not progressing with npc missing npc and settlements getting bugged out overall fallout 4 is like a washed out and simplified version of fallout 3 and new vegas but it still can proof to be good and interesting with the likes of nuka world it may give you a mixed emotion playing it like a love hate relationship love it because it is still a fallout game and at times may proof good whether you are questing farming exploring or simply hanging out plus the minor enhancement made to the game feature and hating it because of the simplification and tedium
