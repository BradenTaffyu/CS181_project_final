2020 i have played this game for 340 hours as of writing this in all that time i am nowhere near a professional at this game at all let it be said that i love this game and i think that if you re looking for a challenging environment that comes with laughs from friends you ll love it too there isn t really any explanation in this game no tutorial when you spawn that points you in the right direction you ll probably die your first time playing and i think that s part of the reason this game is so fun 340 hours i ve played and not once have i made it to winter and that is entirely my fault not the game s forage for resources build and farm find things out by trial and error your experience is your compendium and your wit and creativity your preparedness is how you will survive
