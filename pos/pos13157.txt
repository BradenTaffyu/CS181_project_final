2019 i ve delayed writing the review for this game for so long now fearing i would not really be able to put the greatness of ksp into words i currently have 400 hours recorded in steam but actually most of my game time hasn t been counted because i mostly started the game from the mod managing program ckan i could be pretty much anywhere between 1 000 and 2 000 hours i guess maybe even more i got it in the alpha phase and it sucked me in from my first moments in the game it remains to this day the best example of a great honest early access game along with minecraft and subnautica i even rank it among the very best games i ve played in my life since i started in the late 80 s maybe i should state that i do not have a scientific mind at all and consider myself as more of a literary person and yet i felt wonder at every step of the way flying high reaching space achieving orbit rendez vous ing with asteroids docking with other spacecrafts reaching the moons landing on them and looking at my home planet reaching interplanetary space discovering new planets and so on and so forth and yet i felt pride when i managed to build rockets that could land on another celestial body when i rescued a stranded kerbonaut when i designed a space crane that allowed me to build a planetary base piece by piece when i finally achieved what previously seemed impossible through careful planning as well as trial and error i sometimes found myself thinking about how to build my lunar base at night while in my bed waiting to sleep or drawing up the plans on a piece of paper during a pause at work not only that but this game has taught me a lot about space astrophysics and orbital mechanics of course i know reality is more complex than this game which needs to simplify things to keep them fun and manageable but still now i can t help but roll my eyes when i see blatant mistakes in films and series the way they have starships changing directions or pointing directly at a planet to plunge into its atmosphere very few games have given me such great feelings as ksp did which is why i keep coming back to this game again and again starting all over again each time to re discover the joys of spacefaring of developing my space program it is even one of those games where failure is part of the process and part of the fun when something goes horribly wrong it becomes an opportunity to start a new mission to set it right rescue the stranded kerbonaut salvage the precious science from the lost probe launch a newer sleeker space station the possibilities are almost endless i also keep coming back because there s still so much more i want to do sure i ve explored the moons through and through i ve landed on duna mars i ve sent a probe into the sun kerbol i ve studied moho mercury i ve sent another one flying by jool jupiter but i still want to build a base on duna mars i still want to visit eelo the furthest planet i still want to land a kerbonaut on eve venus and bring him back home safely and i will do those things to quote a famous speech not because they re easy but because they re hard because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of my energies and skills thank you squad for this wonderful game
