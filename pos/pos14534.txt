2018 i ve been playing civ compulsively for over 25 years i can be a harsh critic i ve sunk hundreds or thousands of hours into every version of the game civ6 is a fantastic game it takes all the beauty and interesting mechanics of civ5 and adds actual strategic decision the districts add huge variability and make every game feel very different no more mid late game slog to just build everything you cannot build everything and you really need to think about urban planning i love the tech and policy boots they really help drive gameplay and narrative based on the map and or your current situation the r f expansion keeps you from sitting back and just coasting to victory i know a lot of people love civ5 and bash civ6 endlessly aside from mods i really do not get it civ5 had no strategic element it was all 1 this 2 that there were no policies that you could change no governments nothing just accumulating 1s and moving your troops around the map for me that barely qualifies as a game civ6 is a true strategic game with governments and policies it s complex but avoids too much micromanaging as for the ai that s always the weak point in modern 4x games civ5 and endless legend which i also love are no better and often worse i don t know if the ai has been improved with r f but i m in the middle of a war with nubia at the moment and the ai is not stupid the peace war logic employed by the ai has been solid and the tactical troop movements have been good far better than the dazed and confused troop movements of civ5 i still wish there was a slider to allow the ai more cpu time for deeper analysis the game and expansions are pricey to be sure but its a great game and worth it when you figure the countless hours you ll be up what it s 2am already if not wait for it to go on sale but don t listen to all the trolls this is fantastic game
