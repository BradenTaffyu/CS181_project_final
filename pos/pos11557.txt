2014 early access review in the midst of all these crafting zombie games the fun pimps have pulled off an impressively honest development 7dtd may not be the flashiest or prettiest game of the bunch but the game mechanics are reliable and the crafting is deep but enjoyable you can already find servers with one click hosting ofthe game even in alpha they still have work to do there are some glitches in the voxel building system as of 9 3 there are areas and certain heights the physics glitch and blocks for no rhyme or reason fall apart when they should not their one static map navegane have buildings and bridges that where built before one of their patches but now fall apart when you traverse them since the current physics mechanics no longer hold them up despite all that i can and have easily setup an instance of the game that my friends can jump on any time and enjoy a couple of hours crafting and battling hordes of zombies i hope these guys keep going with their development road map and more casual players give this title a try
