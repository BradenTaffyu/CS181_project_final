2022 early access review super good light sim zombie sandbox i just wish it was a little more mechanically skill driven than luck based too many things are solved by literally walking away from threats and just not engaging with the game because if you start running or doing anything interesting there s like a 1 0956 chance you will trip and die of ligma instantly punishing you for trying to do wacky things there s things that are just plainly on the face stupid flying against the game s purported realism purely for the sake of making things artificially difficult such as zombies being able to punch through metal or bite through kevlar or magically gaining the ability to launch a psychic mind blast at vehicle engines when enough of them gather near one i think these things are sort of motivated by the fact that there s no real endgame so making you die randomly is a nice stand in while content is being developed to keep you pinned to the area that is most fleshed out the early game in which you slowly walk away from zombies in order to watch tv for 9 days in a row before 577200 tiles worth of zombies aggro onto you you will slowly walk away from that too the systems are fun the combat reminds me of a weird isometric resident evil when it works properly and zombies aren t matador trickbiting you due to pathfinding hiccups but too many things are too grindy and too punishing to engage with without heavy use of modding or sandbox customization i was on the fence about this game for like 5 years and its proven to be a really amazing experience to finally play and if you don t like the base game settings you re free to customize it until you like it which is 100 worth doing
