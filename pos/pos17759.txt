2023 i have no idea why so many people are rating this game so low i m really enjoying it and the new features outpost court battle options etc give it a different feel from troy the skins are amazing and graphics are beautiful yes it feels more like a saga in some aspects but with the variety of options factions unplayable factions soldier variations building options territories etc you get a full experience should have been 10 less but why miss out on this experience the amount of play hrs you will put in will make up for it and then some get the game and get ready to be pharaoh
