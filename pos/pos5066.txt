2018 mysterd s verdict highly recommended to those who can accept fallout 4 s base game change in direction i e fo4 is more shooter arpg hybrid but less of the moral decision making that the fo series is known for than ever before reason for the verdict fo4 base game improves drastically on the feel of the combat weapon systems upgrading equipment stuff by a mile but it doesn t offer up choices galore of good evil neutral special choices per quest like previous fo games do side note on the above verdict far harbor dlc 15 20 hours dlc could be the saving grace for many fo fans here w fo4 as that dlc offers up the classic fo style of moral decision making in most quests both main side quests that dlc is excellent will get a review of its own if it hasn t already intro let s get this right out of the way fallout 4 base game is not as deep of the previous two modern day fallout games when compared to even fallout 3 base game especially fallout new vegas in terms of actual choices the rpg elements the base game has been cut back a bit on that stuff if you were expecting good neutral evil special choices per quest in a fo game like many previous games even including bethesda s fallout 3 its dlc s did this well you will often not find that here in fallout 4 base game though the far harbor dlc expands on the fo4 foundation of excellent combat offers that rpg decision making stuff up often consistently what you will find often are different shades of good in most of fo4 s base game quests you can be a sarcastic jerk still do nice things i e think mass effect like options or you can be straight up nice and do morally good things and or you can often extort persuade to earn more caps money per quest most of the time that s it though once a while you might also get actual others choices evil neutral or special choices for a quest new direction combat arpg stuff fo4 base game now has a heavy focus on drastically improved gunplay action similar to that of an id software shooter but combat s still not as great as an id game b c there s still less rpg arpg systems in id s games with perks special basically now merged into the perks system some skills things were tossed out the window or moved over to perks there s also less points to upgrade per each perk or skill it won t go to 100 now most of them often go up to numbers of say 2 5 or up to 10 points since guns stat doesn t get upgraded to 100 bonuses are part of the perks system you don t have some of the clunkiness of combat that fo3 fo nv had going on vats mode for combat now is not a complete stand still but happens in a heavy slow motion keeping the combat flowing action going even if it s still going slowly some might be looking for that old school inspired vats mode where you can pin point body parts in a turn based style to queue up shots attacks similar to fallout 3 nv where it actually doesn t move time at all might not like this change though some might like the new change to keep things still going even if it s ultra slow in vats for fo4 personally i m fine with this change as the game s combat is still slow enough in vats the drastic improvement in combat makes a lot of stuff for time to pass slowly in vats there s also a heavy focus on arpg loot grabbing weapons materials etc tinkering with equipment upgrading which drastically improves anything related to dealing w combat besides the game s hand crafted quests there s also the radiant ai system here in which this could go on for a very long time as there are constant quests being given to the player that are generated randomly by the game if you want that fo4 combat but you also really want all of that classic fallout style moral decision making you really should try far harbor dlc for classic fallout fans fallout 1 2 fallout 3 fans and especially fallout new vegas fans that really want the decision making stuff fh dlc is the dlc that fallout fans look should take on if it isn t up already a separate review for far harbor on that its dlc page will be up or incoming as i recently finished that dlc open world exploring as usual per bethesda games this is usually one of the main reasons to play a bethesda softworks game boston is an absolutely fantastic choice for the game to be set based around with a location with so much history surrounding it bethesda s version of a fallout style boston is excellent many historical locations landmarks are here with of course the fallout destroyed twist thrown on top of it such as diamond city is their take on fenway park cit is their take on mit faneuil hall is here bunker hill old north church boston common goodneighbor is where the old scollay square old state house resides here the old north church etc etc with so many interesting different locations here in fo4 when compared to fo3 fo4 certainly has going a lot more usage of color whatnot than fo3 s base game which used lots of brown gray some green as you would expect given how excellent a lot of areas levels were built in previous bethesda developed games you can expect excellent design throughout with the awesome open world how linear certain buildings missions and also how open some of the level design is for buildings locations you explore inside as usual everything here is great it has a nice mix of everything pretty much performance graphics running mostly at 50 60fps at 1440p with most stuff set on medium and godrays set to off on my desktop pc w7 64 i7 950 16 gb ram gtx 970 yes fallout 4 ran quite well on my desktop pc it also has ran quite well on other laptops that i ve thrown this at such as my w10 based sc15 laptop 60fps no problem at 1080p even my w10 acer nitro laptop at 900p with medium settings 30fps w out drops so if anything shouldn t be much of a problem to get fallout 4 running well on most modern systems which is great mind you fo4 does have tons of textures objects things little details everywhere which is great btw this really doesn t always look like a game from this generation of systems it also doesn t look like a game from the last generation of pc s console systems either as it s beyond that also the graphics quality look somewhere b t a game from the xbox 360 ps3 xbox 1 ps4 generation given with so many systems things fallout 4 has going on and with its huge open world this makes a lot of sense animations might be better than usual for a bethesda game which isn t saying much as their animations have never been that good by any means but still aren t on the level of many other higher aaa games i also don t think most people here meet the gtx 1080 recommendations either for the highest end of textures either which likely could improve quality on the textures graphics but seriously most people probably will not be here for the graphics animations but will be playing fallout 4 for the exploration open world gameplay arpg elements gunplay which certainly delivers an awesome experience here with just that stuff alone outro after 142 hours w the fo4 base game this game is an outstanding open world shooter arpg experience if you re looking for a game with tons to do a huge open world of boston to explore immensely improved combat you re going to love fallout 4 for the most part it s a very addictive time consuming shooter arpg with a huge open world of the awesome location of boston in a fallout destroyed manner and absolutely tons to do while i was disappointed quite a bit with the questing namely especially on many side quests i still enjoyed the game immensely w its exploration setting its awesome main quest even despite its few flaws
