its games like this that make me wish steam had a neutral button don t get me wrong fallout new vegas is a masterpiece which i realize i tend to use that word a lot in my reviews but this title truly deserves it it oozes atmosphere out of every pore the story is amazing the characters are interesting yadda yadda yadda but it is so unstable even by bethesda standards the game crashed on me all the time and so many bugs impeded my experience i probably lost a total of 10 hours of progress to save corruptions and this is after all these years of patches and bug fixes i had to install a lot of mods just to get this game to a stable condition but what if some people aren t that technically inclined what if they can t figure out how to install all the script extenders unofficial patches etc then they re just screwed in its vanilla state this game is unacceptably broken and if we re being honest with ourselves the core gameplay loop didn t exactly age well pretty much every objective is go here talk to this person go there rinse and repeat if it wasn t for the outstanding dialogue and writing this game would be outright tedious it is important to keep in mind though fnv had a seriously tumultuous development bethesda was not kind in the slightest to obsidian while making this and personally i am dumbfounded they managed to make something this magical with the hand they were dealt in fact one of the only dynamically designed quests in the game also happens to be one of the buggiest so i don t hold this flaw against the game at all making the entire gameplay loop as open ended and choice based as beyond the meat was literally impossible with the engine they were working with and the time they had as for the bugs though consumers have the right to a reasonably polished product more than 10 years after its release i would expect this game to be way more stable than it is all that being said i can t in good conscience not recommend this game its a work of art full of clever writing and endearing characters even if the mission design is outdated its still fun to run around and start random fire fights with random a holes f ck you legion
