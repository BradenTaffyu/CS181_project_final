2021 i had no idea when getting this game how engrossing it would be the base game alone offers quite a bit of content and a solid gameplay experience that lasted me a good number of hours but once you get into the mod workshop and community the game really opens up it s such a good framework for crafting various stories and experiences especially with mods that no two playthroughs will ever feel quite the same i highly recommend this game to those who like longer strategic and planning type games it s not for everyone gameplay can be slow and you can play for hours without anything particularly exciting happening but that slow and steady progress towards longer term goals is very satisfying if that s your thing
