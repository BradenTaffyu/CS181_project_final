2021 tl dr i played wh1 so that you don t have to the single reason why i m giving it a thumbs up is due to the clever way in which ca thought the series out meaning that ownership of wh1 and its dlc carries over into the later games unlocks content for the player and continues to provide value that being said it s really hard to justify playing wh1 when looking just at what it provides along with the dlc a lot of the time spent here it s pretty difficult to find fun or entertainment mainly due to the fact that regardless of the faction you want to play the game appears to be designed around the idea of hindering the player and not giving them tools to work with rather than providing meaningful options sure you get plenty of cool looking units but for the most part they are terribly inefficient and cost ineffective it s frankly pretty depressing to see how poorly melee infantry cav perform almost across all factions in a game that has bloody warhammer written in the title on the flip side if you simply spam stacks of the cheapest infantry you have available and just auto resolve all of your battles or if you stack whatever monsters your faction has available the game completely breaks down and is entirely trivialized either the auto resolve engine gets overloaded and gives you a decisive victory with next to no casualties even against an army that would completely destroy you in the manual battle or the monsters are so overpowered than when they re stacked together they just roflstomp any and all opposition for the most part there is no real middle ground where fielding a balanced army can give you strategic and tactical advantages or at least offer options to be considered if you want to play effectively a lot of the above is due to how poorly siege battles are designed here regardless of who you are playing most of the game involves besieging cities it doesn t help that all look and play the same no matter what cultures are involved in terms of substance the textures are different of course the main problem is that they are completely stripped of options or mechanics and everyone from the exalted champions of chaos to the sneaky night goblins simply have to bumrush a wall losing half the army in the process due to how overpowered the towers are following with the hope that you can outlast the defenders and win to attrition in a frontal slog with whatever you have left so you can suffer through that training costly armies that perform very poorly and wasting many turns setting up sieges and recovering your loses or you can be smart and either cheese the towers and shoot the passive ai to with your cheapest artillery and archers or simply blob a stack of monsters smash your way through the gate and roflstomp your way to victory or even better just bring 3 4 stacks of the cheapest infantry you have available and auto resolve which is the most efficient and headache free way of playing wh1 if you are looking for a fun and immersive experience that is more meaningful from the perspective of a grand strategy game you probably want to have a look over wh2 consider purchasing wh1 and its dlc only if you really like that game and would want to unlock additional stuff like the grand campaign map i ll mention that the above impressions have been formed on normal difficulty playing the game across all of its campaigns and with all factions the only 2 iterations of the campaigns that i haven t completed are the beastmen grand campaign specifically with morghur as the starting lord he is essentially denied the use of the single cost efficient units in the entire roster minotaurs and encouraged to use chaos spawn which are worthless and wintertooth because i would have done an exact carbon copy playthrough of the campaign with norsca as going for non mammoth armies and pledging to anyone but the serpent god means just hamstringing yourself for no benefit
