2018 pros good graphics awesome various scenarios in depth choice consequence system order or faith disciplines cons short scenarios would like them to be longer leaves you unfulfilled the scenarios doesn t let you continue after when done with tasks tutorial program isn t very helpful the scenarios are fast doesn t let you build a far bigger base overall although the fast scenarios the limited time to build and do anything incredible the game stands out as probably one of the best survival rps game genre the graphics are good and the storylines for the scenarios are awesome yet short i hope to see scenarios that lasts longer and allows the player to do as he see fit with his city without any kind time restrictions verdict 8 10 points i recommend this game
