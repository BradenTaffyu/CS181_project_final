2020 bloons tower defense games is nostalgic tower defense games for me to that is reflected in my review so bloons tower defense 6 is your typical tower defense game but in this game you get to upgrade your troops which i find a huge up from the earlier bloons games you also get to have a hero you get to buy they all do something diffrent let s get to the game itself you start having a few towers to place to fight back the balloons that are coming to get to your base you pick on of hundreds of maps and have to defend it for rounds which get increasingly harder and the amount of rounds depend on what difficulty you pick you also start with less money the harder difficulty if you played bloons as a kid you will like this with a few hours you are gonna be set with everything you need then there s only left to fight the balloons i would rate this as a great entry in the franchise 7 10
