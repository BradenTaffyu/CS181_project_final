2019 the amount of negative reviews for this game is astonishing so let s address the common issues microtransactions yes they exist they ruin the fun of the game if you buy them as well by fast tracking your progress why even play completely optional no need to buy any phone port btd5 was a flash port less content yes this has less content if you compare it to btd5 but btd5 saw frequent updates for years give btd6 some time with 30 maps 3 difficulty settings on each map and plenty of bonus challenges like military only impoppable and deflation to name a few this game already has a lot of replayability a lot new was added in btd6 let s look at what was added heroes a fun new tower type very powerful levels up instead of upgrading and you can only have 1 per game 3rd path that s right each tower has a 3rd path you can still only go down two at a time but the 3rd tier offers brand new upgrades and added strategy old towers feel new with 5 new upgrades a pop 5 that s right a 5th tier has been added this tier is the ultimate upgrade just like 4 was in btd5 new towers two brand new towers both very unique and fun visuals not only are the 3d graphics fun but now towers show off their upgrades better in 5 they only showed off visuals from one path in 6 they show from both paths a 3 2 0 ninja is going to look different from a 3 0 2 ninja what about the bad ui the ui is okay but you can tell it was made for mobile lost towers sadly engineer bloon chipper and gatling are not in 6 as of posting this buy this it s great don t listen to the complainers
