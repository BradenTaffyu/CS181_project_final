2017 this will be detailed review by person who was hunting in real life and played almost all hunting sims for pc to date preword i hunted with my dad years ago just thank you devs it is perfect software not only game just bring more stuff and continue to develop it s like on real hunting with my dad years years ago nothing can be compared to this game the hunter cabela deer hunter hunting unlimited they died today best hunting experience in history of computer gaming it s completely relaxing just to hear pines waving on the wind somwhere over rotwald area listening to rain storm forest just close eyes and have that short break on digital nature during day for real it s best audio video application for pc and when it comes to give true nature feeling call of the wild is beyond any competition for years it s great to turn this game on for a few minutes during workday and relax not to mention you can easily spend hours and have enormous fun during hunting here night hunts or ability to seamless walk trek hunt in 24 hour cycle is great and going after wounded animal through dark forest is da bong especially when you chase wounded 400 kg wild boar in dense forest around midnight feelings presentation and realism are above perfect if you have ever been on real hunt just buy it game have some ui bugs in menu but it will be fixed with 1 or 2 patches no other problems shooting and tracking are real it works exactly the same in real life some hunts are very easy some are long and no outcome but for real hunter most important is respect for nature and harmony with it this game as only one in pc gaming history gives that well thehunter call of the wild a screenshot of thehunter call of the wild by fallen demon night hunts are just thrilling imagine rural field after harvests at midnight full moon and you on the hunting tower watching pack of wild boars roaming the field after mouses and seeds yes you have head lamp and if you miss vitals or hit like in real life big boar it can run good hundreds of meters after searching for animal at night are just amazing check my uploaded screenshots to understand yes you can turn off all helpers and act like in rl to say more i just forget after few minutes that im playing a game 35 years old here and feel like in archive movie from one of my hunts in real life all works the same animals reacts different depends when bullet hits etc together with video audio work of art presentation it makes amazing job no one ever bring so much real poetry in digital gaming presentation of nature than expansive worlds did here thehunter call of the wild a screenshot of thehunter call of the wild by fallen demon this game have so many features that it will be very hard to describe them all and all of them are well tested and realized in the game if you ask yourself is that feature is here answer yes it is if you are looking for ethic game about hunting to interest your kids or friends with hunting it s best title ever released there is no better pc program that can awake love to the nature than this game and please all eco terrorists who don t even know what real hunting is about just shut up and keep chains around trees still as simplest hunter did more to ecosystem and nature than band of ecologist through whole their life details are just breathtaking shoots are dependable by range wind position after unlocking some skills and perks someone really knows how to present real hunting and if you only have occasion just listen to pines waving on strong wind at rotwald mountians at first reserve did i mention that leaves flying from trees depend on which driection wind is flowing good forget about the hunter just sink into this title and beg devs to develop it further its just great joy to simply walk in this game personally i will pay for all dlc for it and im sure we get some free dlcs too you are like on real hunt here in call of the wilds im playing on i5 haswell 16gb ram and 1060 geforce all on ultra and high and trust me stable fps around 50 60 and dat feeling along with excellent sounds you will hear very high range of nature sounds different for each bush plants grass day and night or even part of day or night there is no difference in visual or sound presentation with normal real life hunt im completely shocked light in this game works like in real life too you will almost feel wet cold mornings warm sunsets scary storms just like in real life simple walking through woods hello no one generic fragment of land each is handplaced and designed like real life no boring terrain all over the map about bugs i havent noticed any in game about what is essential hunting tracking playing there are small and very minor buggies with ui but it will be easily solved by small patches so really screw negative reviews if you are hunting in real life if you love nature if you hunted long ago if you are interested in hunting if you are looking for best looking game on pc if you are looking for intelligent and enormous hunting application if you are looking for enjoyable multiplayer hunts not so embarassing like in the hunter online all is really better here just go buy and thank devs for realizing every hunter dream and i i took the one less traveled a screenshot of thehunter call of the wild by rominvictus about bugs shortly leave bugs to vegans and keep hunting and eating meat instead longer and please stop listening people about shooting it works exactly like in rl life not only shooting wind guess after perk eralier by observing nature magnitude setup after perk but a way of the bullet mechanics after the hit if someone never shoot on real hunt he just simple can t understand that hit which lands on soft part of the animal only wounds it and make a lot of pain and hunter is obliged to track it even 2 days with dogs if you want to score animal learn to shoot and read some hunting books devs here are one of most dedicated and involved in gaming industry and their fame for long supporting of titles is well known just look at older brother thehunter classic and i bet this wonderfull game call of the wild will become it s successor there are many headshooters from stupid fps games around here who never hold and fire from real gun trust me this game is as close to real shooting and hunting as it can be not only visually dat scopes god almost smell rubber near eye but what is most important from shooting mechanic there is bullet drop wind calibre and power incorporated and very smart and real hit system so all of you cod cs sons go screw yourself kidos see you in the wilds developers please keep this game supported and developed in next years as it s best and most realistic hunting experience ever created i will gladly pay for future dlcs and remember about some freelc too just give us more of eveything in next years and we have a deal years have passed since my review and im still loving this game and playing it not to mention new angler game from the same developers i love you devs thank you for supporting this title for so long
