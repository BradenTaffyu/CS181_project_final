2017 as a hunter in real life i respect this game the graphics and how much fun it is it s not too easy or too hard to take down animals so everyone can enjoy it i don t really have any complaints about the game besides a glitch here and there but that s not a big deal to me the only thing i would really like to see change is to have a trophy room added to the game it didn t really bother me much that there wasn t one until yesterday when i harvested the legendary red deer in hirschfelden i was a little dissapointed that i couldn t go back and look at how big it is so my idea is to have a trophy room and either have it display the top 10 scoring animals a person has killed or have the hunter be able to select if they want a trophy in there with a maximum of 20 trophies allowed i don t make the game so this is just my idea of a small thing that would make the game more enjoyable for me thanks for the fun this game has brought me
