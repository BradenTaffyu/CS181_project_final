2020 this is a very fun relaxing game when i play a game i always hope to take something away from it sometimes its just a good time or a fond memory other times its a life lesson this game is the last one sometimes when i play games i have the habit of rushing through them and completing them in one or two sittings this is a game where you simply can t do that you must be patient you must plan ahead you must control your impulses and delay gratification sure you can sell your crops immediately but if you chose to wait several days you will profit much more oh you want pomegranates well you need to wait a month for them to grow and even several years for them to mature this game is full of planning ahead like that but in doing so it encourages you to make the most out of your day and enjoy the journey along the way that is what i took away from stardew valley
