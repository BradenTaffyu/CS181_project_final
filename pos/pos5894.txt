2022 early access review honestly i really miss warband i wish it would be a new version of warband with new updated graphic one thing that bannerlord is better is clan mechanic and trade bannerlord removes most of warband s features that i am really disappointed i recommend this game only because i still have hope that developers will make it better it is in early access though
