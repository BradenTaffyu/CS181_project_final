2019 nothing s perfect but slay the spire is close enough to spit slay the spire is a deckbuilding roguelike you start the game with a very simple 12 card deck gather cards as you climb up and fight battles go through events rest at campfires shop at shops and then hopefully the deck grows into something cohesive enough to challenge the bosses of the spire mechanically it s quite simple deal enough damage to reduce the enemy s health to zero use defend cards to protect against incoming attacks and your deck reshuffles when you go through the whole thing however the game uses this mechanical simplicity as a rock solid foundation to build complexity and depth cards like draw a card discard a card can become the absolute foundation of a deck while a card like deal 32 damage can be an absolute dead draw depending on your other card picks relics passive bonuses to your character add another layer to consider you have a relic that lets you keep drawing cards when you empty your hand should you focus on 0 cost cards and eliminate your higher cost ones when removing cards from your deck is a rare and expensive service the game s art style is unique and while it may not appeal to everyone it s at least refreshing and fun it s a funny game without leaning too hard into humor it s a cute game without leaning into weeb cuteness overall everything is at the least well made if you enjoy card games if you enjoy roguelikes absolutely pick this up
