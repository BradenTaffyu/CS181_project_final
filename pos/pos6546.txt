2018 for every type of person there s the one game out there that really fits for him this game however appeals to various sorts of players i d reckon if you like trucks for instance you ll probably really like this game unless maybe you re one of those nitpicky types that gets very angry over small details that differ slightly from reality but leave you unable to enjoy a game like this i on the other hand belong to the group of people that like to zone out listening to your favourite music from the early 2000s doing something repetitive and very irrelevant and this game really is perfect for that admittedly it comes without the music but you can somehow bring it in the game via a fancy radio feature or just leave your music player open in the background soon you ll find yourself on the road letting your mind wander i can absolutely recommend this game on a slightly different note writing a game review for a virtual internet badge should really make one reconsiders one s life priorities
