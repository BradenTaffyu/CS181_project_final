2022 i m sure you ve read heard saw how 76 was an absolute fail i avoided this game like the plague until about 2 weeks ago as to not ruin my love of the series i was talked into getting it on sale expectations low i m absolutely addicted to this game i love the creativity of other players their camp s and builds are really cool most of the time even trap camps are funny the graphics are quite incredible for the amount of stuff in these worlds the player base is for the most part very supportive and friendly there are lots of quests and npcs like the older games microtransactions are slimey in any game and they include a fomo aspect to this games microtransactions super annoying
