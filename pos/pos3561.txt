2018 product received for free i lv undertale for the hp it gives me the main reason i enjoyed undertale was a clever battle system and a subversive plot these traits go hand in hand you can learn a lot about a monster by how they respond to fighting and acting and the way they attack reflects their character subversive humour both meta and within the fourth wall had me smiling often chuckling or rolling my eyes and even laughing aloud a few times after a few runs i got curious and tried killing different combinations of bosses enjoying the little changes in dialouge during and after the game trying weird stuff in the pacifist route to try and save or kill asriel to prevent him from returning and finally moridly curious and frustrated genocide toby fox knows how most people will play his game he gets his hooks in early and digs them deep while you experiment with different interactions then rips you to shreds with them should you become invested enough to attempt genocide it s not something that will occur naturally even if you kill every monster you see while you progress unless you play it like a jrpg undertale knows or at least assumes you re attatched to its world by the time you try to subvert its message of kindness patience courage justice integrity and persevereance with raw determination undertale knows and subverts your subversion by following your lead the game becomes determined to stop you from killing it less monsters show up the more you kill making it harder to wipe an area new monsters appear looking for their friends some bosses evolve to exceed your new power level while most become weaker than normal enemies from a gameplay perspective helpless undertale knows they can t beat you so they don t even fight not physically the trivialized bosses attack your soul pulling on those worked in hooks that lead you to genocide and flaying your attatchments alive if you re empathic you will give up genocide at some point if you re human you will struggle at least once to carry on after a boss fight boss fight or appeal to your humanity for me it happened twice once at the obvious sans difficulty spike the punster brickwalled me for weeks and again in an entirely unexpected place the mad dummy one of the few characters i didn t like i found his commitment to rage trite no matter what you do this guy is furious but genocide is their happy ending i was stunned at how hard it was to take that away from them i stopped playing for a week realizing just how monsterous or human in undertale terms i had become playing as toby intends genocide hurts it s a lacklustre grind that breaks the fourth wall often calling attention to the pc s dead stare as if possessed by you the player driving them to destroy what they have come to love i felt like garbage playing genocide and only my determination had me continue to push the game to the brink it pushed back hard with every trick it knew turning its goofball humour into black comedy and grim tragedy i got dunked on and was happy i deserved it i m not even finished the game yet i just gave chara my soul and am about to start my corrupted run after being afriad afraid to do so two years i stopped playing enjoying my ars and spoofs and ask xxxxx on youtube i even did some light roleplay that s how into the story i was a couple years ago undertale is a good game mechanically and a masterpiece of a story if you play it thoroughly the story is weaker if you only play once or twice but if you really get into it and explore the little details and big secrets like it convinced me to do i don t say this lightly the humour morals and self subversion of undertale will tilt how you look at the world even if you re only here to play a game and laugh a bit though it s still well worth the price that was why i love the xp undertale gave and is still giving me playing it talking about it reading the ars and singing the songs gives me hope
