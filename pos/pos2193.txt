2022 i ve played this game with as much legitimacy as most fo76 could and i ve played many hours on console the daily ops addition was awesome the battlepass although kinda filler is usually pretty great i recently cracked out on this game over my spring break and ended up with a lvl 110 character and an extra 130ish hours on the game and it was really a fun time even alone i really urge people who have lots of free time to check this game out and to be honest the bugs are much worse on console so pc didnt feel any worse it was an incredible step up from console of which i am lvl 160 fallout 76 is my favorite fallout and i know ill get hate for it but i love the game thanks for reading this if u see this
