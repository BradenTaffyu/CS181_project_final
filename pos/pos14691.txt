2019 i picked this game up on sale with the two current expansion packs as of october 2019 with a certain level of scepticism having played 400 hours on civ 5 i had become accustomed to its style and depth as well as the art style civ 6 has proven to replace its predecessor for me in under 20 hours there s a great deal more routes to take in every stage of the game making it feel less linear than 5 without going into much detail the main concerns of ai stupidity haven t made themselves apparent to me and i quite like the more cartoonish style religion is much more dynamic now with theological combat being separate from diplomacy and allowing you to essentially play two games at once city planning is ever more important with the district system but it s now much easier to build a sizeable empire with the amenity and loyalty systems that replace the empire wide happiness system in 5 this now feels more like an empire based game encouraging you to sprawl outwards instead of sticking to a few cities as your luxuries become more stretched at least from my previous game tactics the ai are far from perfect not using units to their potentials particularly in terms of religion but the grievance system makes a certain amount of sense and is more transparent than the warmonger system of 5 overall i would definitely recommend the platinum edition when it s on sale 40 but it would be very overpriced otherwise
