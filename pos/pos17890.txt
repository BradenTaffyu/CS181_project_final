2023 i ve had tons of fun with the game so far i feel it is a worthy successor to coh 1 and coh 2 the reviews are doing it a disservice it has bugs and some flaws but it is not the buggy broken mess it is being made out to be the core game is solid mechanics work and new mechanics are interesting and nice balance is a little out of wack but that s kind of expected singleplayer ai can be a little passive but overall it s alright and fun if you like company of heroes any entry you would enjoy this one
