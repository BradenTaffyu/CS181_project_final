2020 i ve just finished the game sent a spaceship to the stars for the first time where do i start this game is great and i m not saying that lightly each chunk of gameplay each music the simple yet nice graphics everything is amazing you get attached to your pawns game s term for your colonists sometimes even your livestock i shall tell you the story of one eye the brave one eye was a bison bought off some traders at the very beginning of my save what made him so special to me you may ask each time the colony was fighting a difficult battle he and his wife ferala she died on the battlefield god bless her soul would put themselves between the colonists and harm tanking so the pawns could keep shooting one of these instances is how one eye earned his name we were hunting thrumbos they got close to us the courageous bisons won us that fight but at a price he had become one eyed much later an infestation occured in the stockpile four bisons including one eye got involved victory was achieved at a bitter cost one eye and another bison bled out he was gone but shall never be forgotten his legacy the colony and his offsprings lived on a jade sarcophagus was built to honour him he was the hero we needed but didn t deserve may he rest in peace
