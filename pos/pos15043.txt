2020 very fun with friends do not play this version if you are playing alone play don t starve instead since bosses have twice the health in don t starve together which places the emphasis on the togetherness if you are looking for a game that constantly keeps you on your toes and drags you through hell before you find the sweet spot of just barely getting by this is the game for you there is a creepy air accompanied with old fashioned early 1900 s stereo music which feels very classy the ensemble of characters allow the player to view the don t starve world the constant in a new perspective as each character has drastic strengths and weaknesses aside for maybe 2 characters the game when bought comes with two access keys one being for yourself and the other for a friend the normal price is 15 bucks but on sale it goes as low as 5 it s quirky like its lore and game highly recommend
