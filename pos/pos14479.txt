2021 ok i ve had every civ game in the history of civilization and i m finally ready to give civ vi my review lots of old civ players like me remember the days of the doomstacks and alot of hate came when they were removed from the game heck even i had trouble feeling the love for the new one tile one unit system but it really does make the game more strategic and the districts well it gives you more things to consider when building your cities and makes cities more specialised now why did i wait until i ve played 280 hours to make this review truth is it has nothing to do with the amout of hours i ve played it has everything to do with the amount of hours my wife has played i bought her this game just a week ago and she has already put in 70 hours and if that is how caught up a person all new to the franchise can get then there is no doubt in my mind this game deserves a thumbs up i ve already heard her say just one more turn several times before comming to bed civanon
