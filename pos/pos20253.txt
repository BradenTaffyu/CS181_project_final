2023 ngl baldurs gate 3 spoiled the rpg genr for me the fact that not every single interaction is voiced has a ton of secrets around me makes me just think of bg3 but this is sci fi that i personally prefer over fantasy and not only sci fi but also 40k its a tradeoff sacrifice for bg3 s polish i guess overall its a neat game but bg3 really made all other rpg s look bad in comparisson
