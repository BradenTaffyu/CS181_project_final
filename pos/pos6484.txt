2020 time to hop into your fancy truck and make various type of deliveries all over europe a game that s still going strong after it s initial release 8 years ago this is my take on euro truck simulator 2 the goodstrong community and continuous updates added since release euro truck simulator 2 is still going strong considering that the game was released back in october 2012 the developers have expanded the game as separate dlcs while making multiple updates to improve the experience in fact they re now giving some of the cities they had on the original release a major face lift like updating the roads changing the landscape and making the cities look bigger it should also go without saying that the community for this game is quite strong i only started playing this game late last year but i have noticed a lot of positive feedback to the game especially when it s through the steam awards at the end of the year and this game makes it to one of the featured categories the badno options to manage rest time something that eventually started to bother me was that you don t have a proper option to manage how long you want to rest yourself the driver whenever you want to make a pit stop hotel garage gas station etc and rest you sleep for 8 or 9 hours and you don t have any ways of adjusting the time i understand that resting especially for a profession such as truck drivers can require a lot of needed breaks and rests but if there was a way to give yourself a chance to rest for maybe 4 hours instead especially in the middle of a job it can prove to be helpful the only unintended alternative that could be used to get some short rest would be to take a ferry but besides that no other options are currently available the uglyso many police vehicles feels easy to get fined whether you re on a job or not something bothersome that i noticed late was the abundance of police vehicles not in terms of roadblock or accidents rather in terms of standard patrol as a result i find myself getting hit with speeding tickets quite a bit even at times when i m above the limit by 3 km h at times i can t recall if there was an option to lower the frequency of police patrol or not but if there is considering that this was on the default setting this gets annoying after a while especially when the fine for speeding is an easy loss of 1 000 while the negatives are profound it doesn t take away the simplicity and easily addicting nature of this game as noted before in the intro the fact that the game is 8 years old and still going strong in the community and development side there s absolutely no reason to not give this game a go whether you play it for a few hours or it becomes your next year long time waster pick this game up and go for a drive developers headquarters scs software prague czech rep
