2016 early access review if i had the intelligence and programing ability and the numerous other aspects that go into game design this is the game i would make as i am a sociologist boo hiss watching how my colony devolves evolves is a fascinating experience yes of course the emotional experience of crash landing on planet can never truly translated to a game but this this is truly a world i can believe in the ethnographer in me wants to see the world through their eyes but the human in me of course does not let this happen i want to intervene in the community and direct their world this translates to a beautiful and awe inspiring in all aspects this is truly unique game all comparisons are truly of the table yes it s a bit like dwarf fortress yes it s a bit like etc but none and i mean none truly do this justice looking at screen shot will never encompass the emotional attachment you have with your colony the sheer genius of the game is this emotional hook within the game things actual matter life and death have consequences this blocky almost primitive graphic take on a far greater significate when you are actually involved in the minutia of the game i hesitate to use that word truly remarkable and i hope the author s are richly rewarded for such a unique experience recommended without a doubt
