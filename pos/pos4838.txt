2022 i m new to fallout series i decided to start with fallout 4 because it s the most recent one i pretend fallout 76 does not exist fallout new vegas is next on my list say whatever you want about this game but i really enjoyed playing it many choices don t matter in this game idk if they matter in other fallouts but these few choices that count are being perfectly executive from my point of view bethesda has succesfully made a skyrim with guns same engine same style but the game is still somehow awesome the exploring in this game is remarkable while trying to reach my quest s location i always stop by somewhere else and might encounter someone else who s got a problem that needs to be solved it always keeps you busy the base building not a big fan of those but a guy like me who does not really care the appearance of his base the game made me care i found myself building humble houses with beds inside so my humble settlers won t get wet while sleeping few major choices matter in this game but these few ones are really hard to decide every character from factions have their beliefs and their goals in my humble opinion there is no good ending building your character feels just right i played the game on very hard difficulty at the beginning i couldn t do a lot of things myself i was running out of ammo a lot i had to rely on my follower many times after some point when i leveled enough my character i was handling a group of enemies just fine the game didn t scale the damage and the hp of the enemies to punish me for being overpowered instead it let me enjoy my overwhelming damage for newcomers to the series fallout 4 is a very good game to start with p s search how to change your fov settings as soon as you start the game
