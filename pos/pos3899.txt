2021 it s anime xcom random person who mentioned this game to me except this game offers so much more than that description could ever say outside of solid x com tier mechanics the game has so many intricate systems and ways to customize your units that i find it hard to believe that anyone who likes this genre would get bored the mastery system in this game is brilliant and reminds me a little bit of final fantasy 9 and it s passives you basically have a point pool and an ever increasing amount of passives to equip per character but there s also dozens and dozens of set bonuses you can activate to really make every character your own want a character that blocks literally every single hit they ever receive and counter attack every single time you absolutely can want to create a completely glass cannon magic character who melts targets but dies in one hit you can and i love it not only that but this game has a nice universe and storyline that you experience at a very steady and pleasant pace dandylion is a small indie dev who really seems to treat this game as a passion project and it really shows this game has been steadily improving since it s release and it s my absolute game of the year 2021 i ve played this game for around 150 hours now and i have barely finished the main story but it appears to continue in the free dlc i do want to be fair and mention the negatives too but the only negative i can come up with is the balance at times for example there s a mission where 2 of your new recruits have to fight the rest of your team 6 or 7 members at this point and it s quite a frustrating fight if you ve treated everyone equally there s passives that revive you after the first death and give you an immediate turn after reviving for example and the more of this sort of stuff you ve stacked on your team well the more impossible this mission becomes without cheesing it by unequipping everyone you can t control this fight i genuinely believe this game is amazing and just one viral youtube video away from becoming insanely popular all it takes is one big influencer to cover this game and it ll finally get the recognition that it totally deserves i absolutely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys x com final fantasy tactics or any turn based game in general
