2014 early access review 7dtd was my first foray into early access and has become for me the gold standard against which i measure other titles although still technically in alpha it is one of the most polished games i ve played gameplay is addictive and although it can be frustrating on first spawn ie no gear alone and up against lethal mobs from minute one getting to the survivable stage with crafted weapons and food is very quick to achieve with some careful thought the centrepiece is of course the crafting which could be held up as an example of how to do it getting the recipies for advanced gear is deceptively easy in the main but actually being able to assemble all the neccessary bits is a challenge getting yourself ready for your first horde gives a sense of urgency to the proceedings a superbly well made and well thought out title and rapidly becoming my number one just another 5 minutes game of choice 10 10 and only getting better with each patch
