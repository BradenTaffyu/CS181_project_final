2022 early access review do you know how damn epic it is riding into battle full speed with spear in hand right into another cavalry unit charging back at you having to time the attack so perfectly and sticking it through the enemies chest knocking the enemy 10 yards through the air off their horse like some jousting battle it s pretty epic in my opinion until you turn to ride back to your army and are pelted with arrows in the back damn archers
