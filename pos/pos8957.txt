alright some people seem to have gotten the wrong idea seeing a generic ai art warning in the steam page so the latest dlc the biggest most content filled of all has a character with ai voice a robot character and it s not using ai voice it s using text to speech it s not copying anybodys voice or anything like that they were making a machine themes dlc and thought it d be cool to make the oponent use a synthetic voice yet suddenly some people now find the game unplayable okay feel free to not buy the expansion or play the game vote with your money and time but know you re overreacting and making a mountain out of a molehill i recommend informing onself well before taking a position they talk about it at the end of this dev diary the quote being expanding upon some of the interactions originally created in galactic paragon all of your conversations with the synthetic queen will have full generated audio voice overs our audio director ernesto l pez has a bit to say about how we went about it designing the voice for the synth queen was an entertaining adventure while we had access before to use advanced text to speech to do prototypes and characters this time we tried to use the tool like a music synthesizer we created multiple takes arranged them and compiled them creating a good result we were excited to create an ai character with an ai voice since this would allow some creative leeway if the result felt odd or non human that could fit the character perfectly but also when the results had specific emotion that helped us to create what we believe is a fantastic character and an enjoyable and exciting narrative arc for players that have been waiting for a new and exotic crisis we re extremely happy with how this all came out it takes encounters with her to another level
