2022 early access review wow okay this review as for now will be a review from somebody who is only barely actually getting into the game upon originally purchasing this game i hopped into the game died three or four times without realizing what i was doing or why i died and took about a month or two break however coming back to the game after my extended break and watching a couple of videos i have had two playthroughs now where i ve survived at least one week like i said still learning and definitely not the best at the game this game is extremely fun not to mention how very immersive it is as well there s lots of parts of the game that come together to create in my opinion the best zombie survival game currently available i will if i remember update this review at another point when i have more experience in the game and am not extremely tired out of game with more information on why this game is amazing
