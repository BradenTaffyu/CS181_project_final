2021 with only 19 hours at time of this review i can say i am hooked at first i didn t expect i would like fallout new vegas much being an older game at 10 years i got into pc gaming in the mid and late 90 s with dukenukem quest ii doom half life counter strike day of defeat team fortress and more after playing a few hours of fallout new vegas and having my first shoot out in goodsprings and leaving for primm it got exciting and i became addicted i made the choice to side with the more professional civilized ncr and friendly to anyone that treats me the same i kill powder gangers jackal gang convicts and legionaries on sight and sometimes they kill me i haven t met the other bad guys or gangs yet this is a real rpg you can play this game so many different ways the character i play is like clint eastwood in the old spaghetti westerns i am the good guy who is bad when needed game play is stable for me and graphics while dated are still good enough there are texture mods and game stability game play mods you can install if you have the need or want for that at this time i gave fallout new vegas a 9 10
