2023 early access review if you like automation games this one is just as all around solid as the greats while encompassing a scale beyond any other game i ve seen easily one of the most satisfying games i ve played and would highly recommend the beginning starts out quite similar to factorio drawing many parallels but don t let that fool you the part of this game that shines the most is after you complete the main objective and you start setting up interstellar production lines it really feel like it s own creation in the interstellar phase
