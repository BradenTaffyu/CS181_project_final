2020 here is a guide to achieve a 10 10 game review for dark souls iii 1 don t look up guides lets be honest the story is weird do i even understand what happened nope did i make my own incorrect conclusions about who my character was and why i see ghost characters you better believe it in addition to this the different areas you explore are so unique that you ll never want to stop pushing forward don t bother to stop and read about them just walk about and do your own business you may need to backtrack to find an item but it is rewarding to see how far you ve progressed from enemies you used to struggle on side note maybe look up the stat descriptions because that is confusing 2 embrace the constant sense of dread if you can afford it always explore the world embered when you are embered you are more powerful but open the possibility to be invaded by other players there is a match making system that only allows people around your soul level to invade so you have a clear shot to win these fights are always unexpected and bring high intensity adrenaline randomly into your life if you win you will feel like the greatest badass in to ever walk the world of lothric this is seriously like the best part of the game 3 cry you will cry not because it is a challenging game but because when you beat it you can t ever play it for the first time again if you do these 3 things the game will be a 10 10 for you
