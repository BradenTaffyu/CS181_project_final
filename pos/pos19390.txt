2022 dear customer i d like to inform you that this game is released unfinished as i write this review there are still lots of things to improve about it including the basic requirements an online rts should have here is a list of some of the issues the game has at the moment there is no reconnect option if you got disconnected by any issue there are no animations for more than combat and building structures there is a big lack of detail and there are rushed maps of whose textures have visible edges mostly around forests no way to pick colors they are assigned randomly automatically recycled civilizations that look and feel the same but are named differently and have just a few differences interface has bugs in certain areas that give an rtx3000 gpu 15 fps in the menus commands are not properly put in place units don t follow certain orders if they have a specific condition such as healing and no offense to add to this units like to focus fire based off of who s closer so they don t shoot independently in different targets unless the distances vary they didn t struggle to create cinematics the campaign cutscenes are filmed places of touristic attractions such as fortresses important cities that lasted till today and history channel type of storytelling following with yellow silhouettes put on top to simulate the historical event profiles are a work in progress but their statistics tab works you get a notification for getting an invite accepting the invite and entering the group or that you sent the invite the player has accepted the invite and it has joined the group can t send messages to friends while in game only the game chat is enabled and there s no command to whisper or anything like that communication is done only in the menus you don t know who sent you a message as it only shows the notification number at the friend list and you ll have to individually search each friend to see who sent a message the ui makes it so that you have to open the chat by clicking on their name and there is no way to send messages to offline friends a mid range pc has problems running the game on full graphics because of some other bug that causes performance to drop in time low graphics which are most optimal look like a 2003 game and high graphics require better optimization as they are blurry when anti aliasing is on and kind of sharpened when it is off giving it a very cartoonish vibe there is no proper balance there are 2 known civilizations out of 8 that rule the game with no effort at all and because of that most of your games there will be just cavalry and some siege unless you get rushed or blocked in your own base by enemy towers there is only quickplay on multiplayer aka no ranked yet which means you ll face skilled enemies latest patch had a secret nerf that was not announced or planned but enough of the cons the positives are that the campaign is actually interesting if you re into documentaries it s very well made despite the critique just that most missions feel empty masteries are a way to grind xp up to level 80 and don t even require a player to be present for most cases some of them are annoying to complete levels however don t give you anything masteries however give you cosmetics like a banner statues for town center and profile icons that are fitting the age feeling they don t look epic nor funny or anything just simple icons with images the training is done once when you first enter the game and then at art of war and norman campaign they do a great job at teaching you how to play hints and detailed explanations included the game overall has a soft feeling to it and it feels like a nice rts sandbox where you repeat something until you perfect it and then push its limits it s been a fun experience playing with bugs as a casual and i can say matches can be intense with the skilled players from my personal perspective it was a good investment as i have other interests and i would recommend it to those who want to relax and not take a game too seriously or want to learn rts games if you do take it seriously then you ll be as disappointed as the majority of the community and aoe fans as i ve seen they weren t too happy but there are still some who have hope and work to make issues as known as possible it s up to you if you decide to gamble your investment with this game s future as i can tell you now it is very uncertain so an advice if you d take my word into consideration is to wait some 2 years and then probably it would be worth it
