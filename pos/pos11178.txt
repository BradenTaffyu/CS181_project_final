2018 i enjoyed theme hospital a lot back in the day but had technical problems ever getting very far with it for me this is the promise of a potentially great game from then made great if you do not like tycoon style games this is not the game for you if you disliked theme hospital this game won t change your mind as many others have said it s basically a re wrap of that game but what a fun experience it is i find the game appropriately challenging the interface is easy to understand in the version i m now playing which may be a beta patch you can copy rooms which was a much needed quality of life improvement i d like to see a collection of room blueprints added so i didn t have to keep redoing the same room in different hospitals but what is here works well at times the pathfinding ai and micromanagement get a little tedious i find that i have to keep my janitors busy manually fixing machines patients seem to never find the restroom vending machine or water fountain right next to them when my hospital is not performing well sometimes it s hard to figure out why and it d be nice if the game gave more feedback about that however those are flaws in the genre as a whole i think in general there are less fiddly bits than there are in many other tycoon style games despite the flaws i keep coming back to the game and it s one i anticipate coming back to again and again there is a certain amount of sameness to levels i think so it s not a game i will spend 8 hour stretches with it is a game that i am having a blast playing in 1 2 hour to 2 hour increments it s the most pure fun i ve had on steam in quite a while i am incredibly happy that i bought this game again i liked theme hospital i think both of the released expansions are worthwhile for fans of the game also i like the winter one more than the summer one but that s because i like winter more anyway i do wish that games like this had a little less micromanaging in terms of things like placing air conditioners or heaters though that part gets old quickly
