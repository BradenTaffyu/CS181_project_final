long time ago when i was still a young kid in the middle of rts boom i had a hope that one day i ll see a video game that isn t focused so much on battle war aspect but rather take base building to the extreme where we ll build our own castles fortresses defenses and our only goal will be to survive ever increasing waves of enemies years later long after rts boom has ended i ve never found my dream game from early childhood sure there were games which were more or less about the same concept like settlers or civilization but it wasn t what i dreamed of just something that can be considered close enough there was a dwarf fortress as well but it seemed too awkward even for me my dream was still unfulfilled until two games came out in 2017 and 2018 they are billions and rimworld respectively this review is about the second one rimworld rimworld is survival oriented base building management game while they are billions matched my initial dream expectations more i consider rimworld one of the best games i ve ever played due to the complexity of the simulation polished and enjoyable gameplay and the fact that there is no run that looks the same there is always something to improve or to do and the game doesn t stop to amaze me i m deeply shocked how much work and thought was put into rimworld as a whole it s clear as day that the devs put a lot of effort and love into this game personally i d love to see only one single thing added the actual campaign scenarios that would put us into predefined positions and expect from us to meet certain goal whether it d be survival establishing peaceful relations with some faction or anything else however everything in the base game is polished to perfection and i m very happy that i ve found rimworld a game which fulfilled my children dreams of a complex base building game i can wholeheartedly recommend this masterpiece to every person that is interested in checking out how a perfect definition of base building management looks like i ve barely finished a single playthrough during my 80 hours with this game and i know that it isn t even everything that the game has to offer let alone consider it finished this is my current definition of how a good base bulding game should look like and i had a lot of fun from every single hour spent with this title and a lot more to come
