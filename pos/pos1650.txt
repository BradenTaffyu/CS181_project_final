2017 my playthrough youtube playlist the review this is one of the most fun action game that i have ever played nier automata was a huge surprise to me as i expected it to be an average action game but platinumgames and yoko taro really out did themselves this game is nearly masterpiece the action is fast pace and best of all it has no quick time events which had to be hard for platinumgames to keep out the game is aesthetically pleasing from 2b s sexy design to the art style but by far my favorite thing is the music one of the best soundtracks that i have ever heard in a video game the only con of the game is that it is not a good pc port download far fixes for the game here github com as it will fix most of the issues i fully recommend this game to anyone and everyone
