2017 how do you even do a review on this game there s too much to cover anyways let s get into it shall we i must be honest i wasn t aware of the hoi series until the fourth game i was watching it on youtube and twitch feedbackgaming check him out and got really into it only problem was the price but i get it these type of games aren t for everyone and there s a big effort behind them so i respect the price once it was in sale i bought it at first the game seems really complicated and you have to learn it as you go i love the political system altough it could use more options battles are really complex lot of buffs debuffs but i got the basics and i know how to make my divions at least a little bit good even though i don t understand evreything i would really apriciate some aditions to peace treaties like demilitarized zones reparations etc to make the game more realistic i definetly didn t cover al that i should but if you don t want to dive in for few thousand hours this review is enough i m giving it 8 10
