2015 i bought this for two reasons 1 project cars is running like a dog on my amd 290x graphics card 2 it was 50 off on steam and had good reviewsi am just getting in simracing and have bought quite a few pieces of software to go along with my shiny new g27 wheel iracing dirt rally stock car extreme project cars wrc4 to name a few assetto corsa is the best of the bunch by a considerable margin the graphics are not the very best nor the sound and i have seen better presentation but this is about simulation not gloss ac is more natural to me than any other sim i have played the grip the traction the weight transfer the complete package is just amazing after playing this for a little while nothing else feels quite right there are some mighty contenders iracing stock car extreme and dirt rally being very high quality sims but they all pale in comparison to the mighty assetto corsa graphics 8 10 would have been a 9 if it wasn t for pcars sound 7 10 varies quite a bit between different vehicles some are amazing others averagepresentation 8 10 ok menu system and configuration options could be a little bettercontent 10 10 comes with a decent amount of tracks cars and game modes loads of free quality mods tracks cars you name it paid dlc too feel 10 10 this is where ac shines it feels amazing nothing and i mean nothing can touch itgrin factor 10 10 absolute quality no other racing game comes close to making me smile like this overall 9 10 forget the rest this really is the best
