2022 damn dude this game goes deep for me i first found this game through operatordrewski and for the first 20 hours of its playing time i had no one to play it with i think i got this awhile back in like 2018 but it wasn t until mid 2020 that i found a milsim group to play with god dude the times i had with those guys most of em live in europe some live in the us but i honestly think of some of them as my closest buddies there was one guy i had known through playing arma different group we had gotten especially close even after the group split up but uh i found out that after years of fighting depression he died by suicide in fall of 2021 but man this game it took me places it peaked my interests in movies music writing and my future honestly taught me teamwork more than most games i would really recommend this game the regular game with no mods is kind of like ghost recon wildlands but more realistic which is why i think other people would enjoy it as its not overly complicated but almost more fun because of it if you really enjoy airsoft or milsim stuff then i would recommend looking for a group and getting some mods for it its way more fun when you customize it
