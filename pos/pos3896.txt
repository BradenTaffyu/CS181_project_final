troubleshooters abandoned children is a great game and just as importantly from a great game studio side note i visited the studio when i was in seoul for a conference story at the end i love turn based rpgs but i m not a great min maxer surprisingly this game caters to people of all types for rpgs if you want there s crunchy number analysis for the die hard optimization folks or you can change difficulties and make it to where you can play casually imho the more options a game provides with how you decide to play it the better it is troubleshooters is a super fun anime like action game with great art and replayability baked into it fighting animations are pretty sweet making hits and shots feel like they have weight behind them character art is also my biggest fav for this game both with the drawn media and the representation they did in building the computer generated models separately i love bg3 and several parts of this games feels like larian s early original sin 1 level of potential the games play differently so keep that in mind yeah there are rough edges in the game here or there but the story feels fresh even the early parts based on the romance of the three kingdoms the characters also have enough motivation and style in their behaviors to where i want to keep going with story to find out what happens with them if you want a more detailed analysis of the pros and cons to the game i suggest you look at the other reviews i just wanted to gush about this game a bit story ok as my side note stated i got to meet a few of the people who made this game and i was shocked with how humble and kind they were i was in seoul for a conference and one of the things i wanted to do was to visit some of the gaming studios riot and blizzard are super disappointing first of all they both are located in the same building in the coex mall riot has like 3 floors of a tower with bliz taking up a different floor below them guess what they have on the ground floor to showcase their work nothing i got a pic at the sign with the names of the studios and besides some great stares from the building security that was it look i know it s a workspace so they shouldn t cater to me but some art out front would be cool i m just sayin okokok back to the story i also wanted to visit dandylion because i saw that they were in seoul and i was like i have enjoyed their game i wonder if they would be ok with me taking a pic outside their office so i sent them an email and continued to go about my conference a few days later i was shocked to see that they not only were ok with me stopping my they actually wanted to meet me i was floored like that is super nice of them and it was an amazing visit i got to meet the head artist i was a complete fanboy on her work one of the people leading the networking systems and the man behind passion053 i m avoiding saying names for their privacy everyone was kind humble and passionate with their work i thoroughly cannot state enough how much of a high point for my trip it was to meet them so yeah xd i am extremely glad that i got to visit them and they are a group that deserves more support if you are wavering i would yell at you do not hesitate to buy this game i look forward to the next game and wish them the best of luck cheers drbrem
