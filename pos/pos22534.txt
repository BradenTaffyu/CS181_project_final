great fun bit addictive have to delete it from my computer during uni semester shipwrecked dlc is my favourite even though it s a survival game it s quite calming and peaceful feels like escaping the rat race to go live on a beautiful tropical island hamlet is great too but the amount of hours you need to put in to make your house nice and make everything work is too much for me i am bad at video games so i like to play on easy mode in this game you can customise how easy the easy mode is and in what ways is it easier i mostly just give myself loads of extra berry bushes and extra bees extra bees sounds bad but there are several benefits you will find out if you play this game i love interacting with the monkeys and building my little camp in the sand and protecting myself from the world outside
