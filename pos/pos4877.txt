2019 its more streamlined compared to previous fallout titles the main story is pretty weak its more focused on gameplay than story this time the faction quest themselves are a joke their are progression in them but a few will promote you too quickly such as the minutemen and brotherhood of steel they happen to trust a complete stranger from a vault there aren t too much sidequests to keep you busy building settlements was weird didn t invest too much time into it i came to protect my settlement when i can felt like it was shoehorned into the game crafting and modding weapons is still pretty fun crits work slightly different in this game its only useable when you have a full crit meter and you press spacebar in vats critical hits does not occur outside of vats sneak attacks are different from criticals this game is shallow compared to fallout new vegas or fallout 3 go shoot and kill things and don t think too much about the story still a fun ride also if you have a 144hz monitor the game caps it down to half of that so 72 73 fps i think its tied to the engine and if you force it to 144 it breaks certain animations or crashes
