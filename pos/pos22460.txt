2016 so after playing dark souls on old gen dark souls 2 which was also on old gen and dark souls 2 scholar of the first sin i finally was able to play dark souls 3 and this was my impression i had a lot of fun with the old battle mechanics from dark souls mixed with the engine of bloodborne which i couldn t play sadly i enjoyed the new character story lines the weapons the bosses and the pvp system the possibility to delay attacks was a good move on the developers side it really added some spice into it i also played through every ending and they were great too and had their own satisfaction even though they weren t longer than 5 minutes each but if you played the other dark souls games you are used to that i also enjoyed almost all enemy types and their unique attack patterns which made each enemy a challenge especially in a group but now for the bad parts since games like that depend on a good framerate to dodge attacks properly i was severly disappointed in the frame drops that happened while i was playing it they did fix it now but it still annoyed me pretty much the game s co op which has a big impact on the online experience like the old parts was enjoyable but only to some extend for example many coveneants which let you spawn automatically in friends or foes world were broken and didn t work or at least on very few occasions on top of that the game s community is still one of the saltiest of all games people healing in a summoned 1v1 gankers hunting for invaders that want to farm their coveneant and even hackers yes i know the community doesn t anything to do with the gameplay but it influenced my opinion on the package alltogether the character creation there is a lot to customize from forehead to nose but there where little things that annoyed me like the incapability to make a special hair colour you couldn t make bright hair colours like green or something like that it mostly looked bad at least on my screen what also annoys me is the low variety on hair and beardstyles but with all that apart i had a lot of fun playing this game alone and with friends and i am looking forward to the dlcs and more deadly surprises i would give this game a 9 10 with the addition that new comers to the series also can play it without thinking what s going on here because this is what dark souls is about you have to figure it out by yourself while the prequels didn t have a huge impact on ds 3 except references and backstory wise well i hope this review helped you on deciding whether to buy this game or not i d recommend it and leave you prepare to die
