2019 this is possibly one of the best survival games i have ever played the artwork and stories for each character are wonderful although some of the back stories tend to be more dark and sad but they are relatable the naming of the creatures of this game and the voicelines for the characters are amazing as well this game is not very beginner friendly and that s why a lot of these reviews tend to be more negative it s a game about thinking on your feet and being able to learn quickly if you aren t sure what you re doing the dst community is pretty strong and you can find the answers and guides you are looking for rather quickly it can be a frustrating game for new players but once you are able to get the hang of things it quickly becomes a top favorite game i would recommend this game to anyone who likes a challenge
