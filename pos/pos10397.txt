2022 acc is a must have if you have the slightest inkling for sim racing what originally started with a lamborghini and one track has greatly evolved into one of the best racing experiences you can have the sound and feel of the cars the close duels with other drivers the sensation of speed yeah they re not the fastest cars but acc captures the sense of speed very well loud engines creaking and crackling frames that sound like they re about to break and the feeling of accomplishment when shifting perfectly into the next gear btw immediately set gearing to manual the automatic sucks imo a very strong recommendation from me
