2022 patrolling the mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter nv for a long time was my favourite rpg in a sense in roleplay aspect its my favourite game sadly the crashes with or without mods makes a tiresome gameplay nowadays regardless i had tons of funs with the game itself when as kiddo growing up i noticed the subtle critics the game has for political issues in our society so in my opinion you can enjoy this masterpiece from the gameplay alone or the story also i love the dark humor and the radio songs which we find along the way you need to play with wild wasteland enabled the games becomes much better also more fun or with good references p s i think its shameful how obsidian made a more complete fallout in one year than fallout 4 will ever be like each gun with unique reloading animation for start from basic stuff to good storytelling fnv its better than 4 overall p s2 i can agree with the visions of most factions but i truly despise ncr house caesar even yes man its better lmao house would have the best ending in my opinion as he s a true genius manager and visionary in a more edgy run caesar it s more fitting to lead mojave than ncr will ever be but as my favourite char joshua graham got trashed because of caesar i avoid this end we can t expect god to do all the work p s3 i don t know why but i had a weird bug with steam launcher not recording all my playing time with nv my guess it was mostly because i played offline pros cons story crashes tons of builds to do didnt aged well gunplay a lil buggy 8 7 10
