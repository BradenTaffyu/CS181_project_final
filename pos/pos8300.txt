2020 this game is incredible i remember looking at it for a while and thinking it didn t seem like anything special you re in a frozen wasteland and you build a circular city around a generator that s basically the gist of it however what starts as a resource balancing act becomes complicated by difficult choices with no clear cut answers and storylines that don t always play out how you would expect the game doesn t highlight the good or evil option and in fact the morally bad option is sometimes your best chance at survival i started my first playthrough as a good guy honestly my religious community was doing great and i was doing my best to bring in survivors from the wasteland i wanted to be the good guy and help everyone before i knew it my city was extremely overpopulated and headed toward starvation people were threatening to riot hope was low and discontent was high the people were demanding warm housing but i knew a massive storm was just days away hundreds would freeze and die so i lied through my teeth and told them i would totally house every last person raising their hope and quelling their anger when the storm hit lots of those angry people ended up dead one less mouth to feed this completely tanked my hope and i was nearly exiled into the white oblivion but i simply declared sovereign law and used brute force to beat everyone into submission my zealots set up an executioner s block and roasted infidels alive it was horrifying at least we didn t have to start cannibalizing all the slave children who died from hypothermia in the mines the storm passed and the city survived i had won but at what cost
