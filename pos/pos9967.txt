2017 early access review 149 days after the settlement of quora was founded during a mining expedition through the mountains an ancient danger is discovered rynn breaks down the wall to find two mechanoid centipedes and a scyther in hibernation upon seeing this new threat rynn retreats back to base a wall is built to block the mechanoids from reaching quora and serve as a warning to its citizens of the threat suddenly in the middle of the night the janitor dunn wakes up and decides to go on a psychite binge with the only psychite on the map being right in the middle of the mechanoid lair unable to control his urge dunn makes a run for it straight into the lair he goes snatching the sweet sweet psychite and getting high as a kite two seconds later he s gunned down by the centipedes after hearing news of his friends death snow the founder of quora mounts a counter attack on the mechanoid threat accompanied by every abled body in the settlement snow leads the charge against the mechanoids bullets whiz grenades detonate and the battle rages with one centipede down the tides are turning in favor of the quoran peoples when without warning a new threat emerges two insect hives emerge in the crossfire spawning three megaspiders who all rush the quoran brigade with an overwhelming force using the last of his luck snow calls for a retreat but it s too late the entire quoran force is destroyed with snow being the only survivor as he limps back to the settlement he can hear the insects mining through the mountains it s only a matter of time until they breach the mountain walls of quora with a sigh snow limps into the medbay smokeleaf joint in hand contemplating his existence he slowly fades off to sleep
