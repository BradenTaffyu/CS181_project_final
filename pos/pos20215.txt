2023 this is my first warhammer game and i am so hooked on the universe i can t wait to discover more i absolutely adored wrath of the righteous so getting this was a no brainer granted i am only in chapter ii right now but i love this game so much i can t wait to see where the story goes i did encounter some bugs here and there but the incredible writing lore soundtrack and immersion honestly make up for it by far glory to the emperor
