2017 incredible game and probably the only true successor to warhammer fantasy we re ever going to get the constant griping about dlc prices is unwarranted unlike previous total war games adding new factions is more complicated than reskinning a bunch of swordsmen if the dlc wasn t priced as high as it is we simply wouldn t have the dlc compound that with the amount of flc we ve gotten and the fact that even if you don t buy the dlc factions they appear in your campaign i feel the prices are fair i only have two real complaints first of all sieges are incredibly shallow and the ai is very rarely willing to engage in them secondly the chaos campaign is in need of an overhaul currently its very tedious and just not fun after your first campaign however with the third game rumored to center entirely on chaos i m confident this will be fixed eventually other than that i definitely recommend the game
