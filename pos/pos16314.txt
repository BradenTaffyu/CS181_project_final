2017 early access review this is my first review i may be a bit biased because this is my thing i built a project car several years ago put a ford v8 into a mazda rx 7 i spent months running to the store for parts looking for the right wrench for that odd bolt eating burgers and fries with grease covered hands i remember the day i first started the car and the feeling i had when it finally roared to life i remember how my heart was pounding the first time i drove it around the block i remember being terrified that it would leave me stranded far from home because i forgot some simple detail in constructing it this game is the closest you will ever get to that magical journey i had with that car this game will make stories stories that will make your wife laugh the kind of experiences you hated when you were in the middle of but tell to everyone you can when you re older youy re greeted with a shell of a car and a garage full of parts when you start the game you build that car drinking a beer here and there stopping to eat and have a sauna once in a while you genuinely have a feeling of pride when you finally get it started and some excitement the first time you go for a drive in it the game is very well done the dev is active as hell and checks the forums almost every day if you have ever wanted to build a project car this game is the perfect way to get that feeling you have to work for it and it s not easy but it is maybe the most rewarding game i have ever played there aren t a whole lot of bugs for early access the controls take some getting used to but it s oh so worth it if you re one of those guys that loves to put stuff together this is the game for you for 15 bucks you can t get that feeling anywhere else you will make stupid mistakes you will fail you will get drunk you will die and you will love every minute of it buy this game
