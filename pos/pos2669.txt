2023 if you re someone who enjoyed bg3 and is considering playing dos2 much like myself 117 playtime hours ago here s how these games compare presentation dos2 has a really nice artstyle not too different from bg3 maybe slightly more cartoony but really enjoyable artstyle is a matter of preference but to me it really works dos2 doesn t have a cinematic presentation like bg3 so cutscenes are rare not seeing your character up close acting the scene out is the only dissapointing aspect of the game when i compare to bg3 amazing voice acting the game runs smoooooooth specially compared to bg3 which will probably improve with later patches but currently dos2 is a much more optimized game than bg3 story the story is as good as bg3 with many story beats reminding me of it choices matter various different endings and ways to approach situations the companions are great in dos2 but the interactions with them is not a prevalent aspect of the game as it is in bg3 if you re looking to roleplay interactions with your companions bg3 is way better for this the game is of comparable length to bg3 with just about the same amount of side content both games took me around 120 hours to complete on my first playthrough this is likely going to change with time as more stuff gets added to bg3 but if you want a lengthy game dos2 might be it combat gameplay bg3 is a great implementation of dnd combat so many things are dictate by luck if shadowheart misses one more time i am going to scream dos2 uses its own system and luck is a much less of a consideration that gives you a lot more control in combat combat encounters in this game are considerably harder than in bg3 this is potentially a great thing harder encounters with less luck involved makes for a great challenge that rewards preparation there is a lot of build variety and many things can work but my limited understanding is that there are clear better builds better party compositions that can trivialize portions of the game bg3 has the same problem and in my opinion it is worse in bg3 interactions with the environment are way more prevalent in dos2 think burning oil electrifying water blessing surfaces etc and they are a very important part of combat if you liked this aspect of bg3 this is even better here non combat checks such as persuasion also appear to be a lot less random if you have enough skill points in persuasion in addition to another primary attribute the game always tells you which one is relevant you simply pass the check i love this in practical terms that means there is a lot less save scumming in dos2 in bg3 you could simply ignore charisma and charisma related buffs if you just decide to save scum this won t work in dos2 and you will have to actively spend points in persuasion pickpocketing is overpowered in bg3 you can completely ignore gold if you have a good thief in the group in dos2 you re limited to pickpocketing a npc only once this results in pickpocketing being still really good but you have to think a lot more about collecting items for selling gold management etc this is either good or bad i personally prefer to not worry about gold so bg3 is better in this aspect in my opinion how gear works is very different from bg3 in bg3 you have a very limited number of gear options for instance there s an excellent cleric armor halfway act1 that you re likely going to use till the end of the game if you miss it there won t be another chance to find anything similar where gear is located is also fixed in every playthrough of bg3 key gear is in the same place in dos2 finding gear is a constant dopamine hit every container vase lootable body can contain randomized gear that scale with the area difficulty level think diablo loot system in crpg form in practical terms you re always managing your gear and constantly finding new gear so remember to have a character with the lucky charm trait that will help a lot basically if you love checking every container you re going to love dos2 and if you hate that this is something that will annoy you a lot in summary dos2 is a masterpiece it is 6 years older than bg3 and it certainly shows as things like the lack of cutscenes are specially jarring after playing bg3 but other than presentation where bg3 is the clear winner those are both excellent games and depending on what you re looking for you may prefer dos2
