2016 early access review this game is incredible i can t tell you though which game of the series is better seeing that they are both amazing i just wanted to give some feedback on the things i personally think are too overpowered so i played as a elf warrior and your race ability as elf is that you get 1 ap and 25 dmg for some constitution then as a warrior you have enrage which gives you 100 crit and you can choose a talent called war lord which enables you to get 2 ap back when you execute an enemy with warrior having 3 charges blitz attack battering ram and phoenix dive which only cost 1 ap and crippling blow and whirlwind as aoe you can easily solo pretty much everything those things in combination with the golden double handed axe you can buy from an npc not that far into fort joy s story line you are just way too powerful compared to everything else i mean pretty much all i did with lohse and sebille was relocating enemies using teleportation and then just utterly demolishing everyone with my warrior red prince was basically only there for the extra cc allthough i found out that stacking physical armour on him and giving him bracus helm and letting him learn overpower is incredibly powerful aswell seeing that he can shatter enemies physical armour in an instance making them an easy target for chain ccing them so that was the part about warrior being too powerful now i wanted to move to the part where i really like the idea of two different types of armour physical and magical and them protecting you from negative status effects but on the other hand it s just way too easy to abuse this mechanic into chain ccing everything making the fights not really challenging at all so in the end i wanted to say don t get me wrong i really really like the game and i was soooo frustrated when i cleared the first act that i had to wait until the actual release of the game but i personally found those things that i listed too powerfull
