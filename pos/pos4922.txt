2016 i think it s time i wrote my review 500 hours later 30 settlements unlocked and managed pretty much all locations found over level 100 13 companions found and maxed affection and ultimately in love with a robot of all things 4 factions progressed through 4 endings seen all achievements earned the hard way i might add my thoughts despite various reviews from people this was an awesome rollercoaster ridewith beautiful scenery interesting npcs overall engrossing storylines that pulled me in well enough i m lucky the game ran smoothly and relatively bug free for me knock on wood and ran as smoothly as it did with me running about 30 40 mods to improve gameplay and settlement building without the geck having even been released you can see my mod guide here what s in your fallout a guide for fallout 4 by thesawolf what s in your fallout said akin to the capital one what s in your wallet line of commercials is just a simple guide review of various mods i ve installed into my fallout 4 to enhance gameplay fix yes there are technical issues with the game texture pop ins loading various bugs most of these will probably be resolved in future patches or by the community when the geck gets released in terms of it being an rpg yes it s still an rpg you play a role no it s not a fully controllable rpg in the perspective that you can be completely how you want to be that s unfortunately how bethesda wrote it you still have alot of freedoms in how you handle situations via stealth via guns blazing via diplomacy in some situations etc despite not being able to go an all out evil route and people respond completely your companions will they will leave your a it still meets the mold of an rpg not as story engrossing as say the mass effect series but you still steer the direction of the overal story arcs in terms of it s place in the fallout franchise it was a good game not the best in the fallout series imho i still prefer the breaking the mold of fallout 3 and the overall tone and gameplay of fallout new vegas the new breed of fallout is nothing like the early isometric fallouts so no comparison there my scoring graphics 8 despite some of the technical issues the graphics were pretty amazing if not too post apocalyptic future bugfixes high res packs mods etc will improve this considerably sound music 8 the sound was fine ambient noises radios etc mods made the sound so much better better birds better storms quieter settlements etc more variety of radio music would ve been nice but it was decent overall magnolia was a nice touch i enjoyed most of her lounge singer ish songs gameplay 8 9 lots of interesting stuff to do made this a fun playthrough i m a decorating junkie when it comes to mmo s that have the feature having some after ending quests was a nice touch despite the latter ones being radiant the release of the geck and future dlc s will improve upon this dramatically as it has with most of the previous bethesda titlesstory 8 i enjoyed some of the storylines some of them were very engrossing and pulled me in others i found well i feel the factions could be a bit too extremist for my tastes doesn t mean that s bad tho no it s not mass effect level storytelling not even skyrim level but it was a decent overall story arc with some nice twists and turns to keep it interesting overall score 8 9 after bugfixes and the geck release allows for better mods
