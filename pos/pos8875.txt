2016 stellaris is paradox s first foray into sci fi grand strategy and despite being rough around the edges they ve created a great grand strategy 4x game you begin the game by choosing or creating your own spacefaring race and then you gradually explore and expand around your starting system you ll quickly find interesting things to research strange alien life forms and even other advanced races depending on your race s traits ethics and government type these races will quickly judge you and this early judgement often sets the kind of relationship you ll have with them for the rest of the game stellaris early game phase it s unquestionably when the game is at its best discovering what s around you meeting new races and planning your race s expansion is quite exciting you use science ships lead by one of your race s scientists to survey systems which reveals what resources can be harvested there occasionally you ll find an anomaly that can be researched too anomalies if successfully researched will grant you helpful resources such as more energy credits or resource points but if the research fails it can sometimes have quite serious consequences there are a few different resources for you to manage and you ll need to secure a fair amount of them early on to aid your expansion energy credits and minerals are the two main resources energy credits are mainly used for maintaining your units while minerals are mainly used to construct new ships armies and buildings next we have influence influence is spent on colonizing new worlds activating edicts on your planets to increase certain things and can also be used during elections leader selection processes to choose the leader that will benefit you the most with energy credits and minerals you ll quickly reach a point where you re getting dozens per month but influence comes at a much slower rate you usually want it around 3 or 2 per month there are several ways to get more influence but there are several things which take influence every month such as alliances and frontier outposts and they re why you ll have such a low income you also have physics society and engineering research points while not as important as your other resources it s still important to improve your input of these three to decrease the time it takes for you to research new tech resources can be obtained using orbital mining research stations or by constructing specific buildings on your planets surfaces stellaris tech tree isn t a tech tree at all but it works rather well the technologies available for you to research in each of the three categories are randomly selected though you ll still need to research biolab ii before you can research biolab iii for example some of the techs are given weight by the game which means they will always show up while some techs will never appear after 45 hours of playing a new tech came up for me that i hadn t seen before for example the technology that allows you to colonize new worlds will always be one of the first three options for society research once you ve expanded out got a fair few new technologies under your belt and met a few races you ll enter stellaris mid game it sucks the problem is stellaris diplomacy is still pretty rough and during the mid game unless you re at war you ll go long periods of time without having to touch the game at all due to how long research takes to complete the diplomacy options are very limited right now and they don t really have much of an impact on the overall game generally speaking every race will either kind of like you or absolutely hate you and while you can have vassals protectorates and tributaries they also don t have much of an impact on the game and this is all after an update which focused on improving democracy unless you re a war loving race stellaris mid game is far from being as good as it should be war can be a lot of fun in stellaris particularly when you re playing co operatively with friends when you decide to go to war with another race you choose your war goals these range from making the enemy into a tributary 25 of their resource output goes to you to ceding a planet so you can take control of it to something as simple as humiliating the other race the different goals have an associated warscore value and the total warscore needed has to be 60 or lower for you to go to war the warscore value depends on what the goal is in the case of liberating or ceding a planet it depends on the size of the colony and in the case of making the race into a tributary it depends on the overall size of the race once the war has begun you increase your war score by destroying enemy fleets blockading planets with fleets and by landing armies to occupy a planet you can negotiate peace at any time during the war but what peace offerings will be accepted by either side of the war depend on how much positive or negative if you re losing warscore you have before i talk about the game s end game phase i ll briefly return to traits ethics and government types for your race there are quite a lot of traits to choose from for your race but you can only choose up to four traits and you only have two trait points to work with if you want more than just one or two traits you ll need to include negative traits to balance out your positive traits for ethics you can choose three ethics but you ll have to have at least two as you have to use all three of your ethic points each ethic has a normal version as well as a fanatic version the fanatic version costs two ethic points and it doubles the positive and negative effects of the ethic based on what ethics you ve chosen you ll then have to choose what type of government you have each type of government there are twelve to choose from has its own election leader selection as well as buffs for your race your choice of traits does have some impact on how the game plays out but it s your choice of ethics and government that really mixes things up my first few races were fairly similar to each other so the gameplay felt very samey but when i switched up my ethics and government type to something vastly different it completely changed how the game plays which is great lastly stellaris currently broken unbalanced late game the late game portion of the game consists of a galaxy wide crisis that involves a mysterious faction there are two possibilities invading the galaxy and quickly taking control of territory before the 1 2 asimov update by the late game there would be a couple of federations and a few alliances in the galaxy you could team up with to take on the invaders and the invaders would usually have four or five 20k fleet power ships within a couple of years now though the late game crisis events are practically impossible since the 1 2 asimov update i haven t seen a single ai alliance and i haven t seen any federations before the invaders arrive and when they do arrive they re far too powerful to take on in my most recent co op game where i reached the late game portion myself and my friend were both fairly advanced and we had a combined fleet power of around 50k after asimov the invaders now start with a few 60k fleets where we would have been able to at least defend our territory if not push into the invader s territory we now get instantly crushed if we try and take them on verdict the mid game lacks depth the late game is unbalanced despite these things stellaris manages to be an incredibly enjoyable grand strategy 4x game there s a lot of work that still needs to be done by paradox but stellaris is already a hell of a lot of fun lone ranger reviews el k
