2020 stardew valley is an indie attempt at a harvest moon title and a very good one the game gives you a big assortment of animals crops and fruit trees which you ll need to tend to and sell or use them to create artisan goods eventually you ll have access to tools that automate your daily watering feeding shearing milking and egg collecting which enables more time to focus on the social aspects of the game or fishing or exploring the mines each character can be given up to two gifts per week which increases your friendship level granted they like the item you hand to them as your friendship grows you may be treated to a cutscene when you run into that character next friends will also give you useful gifts and recipes in the mail so try to remember what everyone likes and keep them on hand the mine is a great resource for stone geodes for the museum and valuable minerals it s full of monsters and you can easily get in over your head if you aren t careful or come unprepared if you pass out in the mines the valuables you just found are liable to be stolen or you may be subject to a rescue fee my advice is to not focus too heavily on farming or making money diversify your days and work towards completing the achievements in the menu also don t neglect the community center gather or plant everything you need for the current season there s nothing worse than having to wait a whole year to complete the community center because you forgot to plant it before the season changed and don t feel disheartened if grandpa gives you a bad review keep playing past the two year deadline and stop when you feel accomplished this game is supposed to be for relaxation right
