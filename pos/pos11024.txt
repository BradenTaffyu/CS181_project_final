so i understand that there s a lot of criticism surrounding this game about certain features not implemented major performance and game issues and developers not listening to the community although i can t review the reason as to why the developers may or may not be listening to the community i can review my own personal experience of csii which was absolutely freaking amazing first of all i was introduced to cs when it first came out in 2015 i wasn t able to play it because my computer at the time was quite sub par and it couldn t handle a game of this magnitude around three years later i got an apple laptop from a friend of mine although the game performance had improved it wasn t the best when my cities became larger but this was my first real foray into the cs world another two years later i decided to buy an actual gaming laptop and once again cs performance improved massively but once again when my cities reached a certain population higher than the mac game performance lagged why am i telling you this it s because i ve experienced the actual frustration of waiting for my games to load for cs to crash on my crappy laptops you wouldn t believe how excited i was when i finally bought my own mid ranged gaming pc an actual pc and csii almost ran like an absolute dream i say almost because not all games are perfect and csii definitely has its share of certain performance issues but one i can handle we all knew what the gaming requirements would be even though the devs didn t initially release that information to begin with so to sum up the performance issues performance was not a main game breaking issue for me with my new mid range gaming computer second of all key features are missing what exactly is a key feature i m trying to wrap my head around that is it the seasons and snow feature with its ploughs or the pedestrian boulevard accesses how about the mailing system and the postal vans oh no wait it s the industries the ore oil and farming industry that we didn t seem to get in the original cs until it s seventh expansion pack yep that must be it but apparently the missing feature is bikes i actually had to look up all of the dlcs that came out with the first game to make sure that i wasn t missing any major features and i haven t been able to see anything my theory is that the major key feature that s missing is the mods and the issue of it now being behind this new system called paradox mods probably also an issue for everyone when the game came out with no modding capabilities now if that s the case then this is a different thing altogether because i do love certain mods and they really do help improve gameplay tm pe anyone but the idea that you need a mod to actually enjoy the game is beyond ridiculous it will enhance the game play for sure but i think that without mods it makes you think a little bit more for yourself and i only mean this for the actual game play mods for all the decorative stuff it does make my city look prettier lastly my personal review look as you may or may not have read above i ve really enjoyed this game i ve sunk over 200 hours into it because i absolutely love redesigning and starting a city from the ground up the game has an amazing street tool system and the new zoning capabilities are great the absolute look of the game has improved immensely from where it was in cs and i can finally understand and appreciate the name of the game cities skylines because there s nothing more amazing than watching your citizen drive through that complex intersection you concocted and into it s little suburban district whilst the major business and tourism districts skyscrapers bloom up in the distance creating an amazing urban skyline and for me that s what csii is all about the ability to dream up something beautiful and amazing in this next generation of games call me deluded or crazy but no amount of bugs or graphical issues could take me away from this
