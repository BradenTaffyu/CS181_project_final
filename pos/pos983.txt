2016 why i recommend this game harvest moon like game but with more detail and features kept me interested hooked enough to play from start to finish of the main quest in a short period of time relaxing but also challenging allows for different playstyles and ways to play the country life fishing mining farming and animal caring has good humorous moments mysteries and new stuffs to unlock craft learn what i disliked about finding main quest specific rare items i could go 2 seasons without being able to because of them being unavailable some characters don t seem to have events at all even when you max their affection wizard i am looking at you bugs especially with marriage wife danced with another guy in one event what a in my opinion this game should be worked for a couple of more months to have more features events added including multiplayer which is something the dev said is being worked on time will tell but overall this is an enjoyable game at the time i wrote this review i played for about 80 hours after it was released on steam and there was still stuff and quests i haven t completed that shows how much more you can do ign points 9 10
