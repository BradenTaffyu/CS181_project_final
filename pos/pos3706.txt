2021 product received for free this game is amazing my honest rating is a 8 10 it s a nice rpg game where you venture with your friends to amazing adventures i love the artstyle and music although when the time comes it s true colors are revealed and it may not be as happy as you think the game have had me waiting for something to happen at any time if you love rpg games or if you like lisa then give omori a try it s worth understanding the story if you want to go through the feels someday you might even get distracted at the cute and adorable npcs to the point you forget that you are playing a psychological horror game the only issue i had is the slow pacing of the story i get it s trying to reveal the plot bit by bit but at some point some things just get irrelevant great game nonetheless hit me in the feels impressive for such an rpg maker game
