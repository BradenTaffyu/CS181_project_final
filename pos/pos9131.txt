2021 stellaris is a game of opportunity space is a standard feature of strategy games alongside world war ii as the vacuum entices us to fill the universe with the flags of our own people in the early stages of stellaris the player expands from one planet to another in a familiar way develops new technology manages the inhabitants and institutions of his planets and gets bogged down with neighbors it s something one who has played civilizaton can realize even though there are many more subtleties to internalize when a galaxy that can be adjusted to be ridiculously large is full something new happens when there are limits everywhere you can no longer race we have to look at who would be the guy and who the enemy and why it all starts with creating your own space alien the stunningly oddly drawn objects look like really aliens even if you can take on humans it is especially important to choose ethical ideas and physical characteristics it is a different matter to play a breed of strong and strangers who hate strangers than jellyfish interested in sublime philosophy of course all possible objects have already been made their own enthusiast modes with pictures because stellaris is really moderator friendly in the style of paradox stellaris is distinguished from other space strategies by the authors deeper knowledge of the genre in its incidental events and technology stellaris refers to a wide variety of scientific literature the game has a lot to offer equivalents to classics like larry niven s ring world and black holes can pop up killer clouds inspired by jack mcdevitt s engines of god for example as research ships scan planets they may find self made probes ancient structures and spaceship nests it especially keeps the early stages of the game exciting when you don t know if you will meet vorlon s counterparts for example however stellaris shows that as a complex and ambitious game it is a very recent case the strategy of the game is simply beautiful and clear in many ways but the interface has its oddities and it can be difficult to unearth even important information that s why it s good that paradox has created a successful tutorial for the first time the first gaming experience can still vary drastically as artificial intelligence has its weaknesses and strangeness if you re surrounded by a like minded and friendly alien club the game can seem like endless hours of planetary management without a challenge on the other hand luck can bring neighbors blessed with a fanatical purgers philosophy next door who will soon come to the village to clean up the creatures you created with great effort from the galaxy without you having anything to say the one sided nature of diplomacy and the weaknesses of artificial intelligence will of course disappear in multiplayer games where every civilization is controlled by man but organizing such ones takes a lot of time and effort the middle and final stages are often the biggest problems in these games as at a certain stage the player can predict either winning or losing the nature of stellaris as a great strategy in this regard is an advantage or a disadvantage depending on what kind of player you are there are no very realistic winning situations in the game but history rolls forward with its own weight sometimes it s nice sometimes it s ugly pros solid strategic foundations great opportunities to create your own alien races the first and last act of the game cons dragged middle phase of the game random nature of systems stellaris is clearly exactly what its creators want and the vision is strong and the possibilities are amazing and even with its shortcomings it s already more interesting than almost any other space wars i ve played 8 8 10
