2018 product received for free this game is one of the best survival action games i have ever played the goal of the game is to don t starve and don t starve with your friends which is harder but after you get pro in not dying you can actually hunt for bosses and explore the caves the gameplay is really simple and it doesn t take long to learn you get resources make your tools and then get more resources to make other things like science machines and magic machines one of the harderst things for begginers is the winter which isn t that hard because of how the cold traps them in doing nothing but fueling the fire leading to their slow and painful death but it isn t that hard you just need to get some practice and get the right tools this game has lots of character having each one of them their unique skills but for newbies i recommend weber for not having problems in eating monster food wilson for being the ok character having no good sides neither bad sides and willow for having a fire since the start so you don t just get killed by the darkness in the first night i would recommend winona for newbies that actually got a bit into the game as she can dodge the first darkness hit not spoilers about it the game has many enemies but the first ones you will find are spiders and frogs they are easy to kill don t damage you too much but if you don t take care they will not have mercy later on the game we will have some more enemies like doggies and even allucinations that are comming for your meat the doggies are still pretty easy but only after some gameplay you can actuallt fight the allucinations the game s multiplayer works very well it s not hard to find a cool server to play with some friends but if you re a lonely wolf like me you can just join a public one and you may find some nice people or griefers just kick them the game s graphics aren t realistic they are artistic i really like these cartoon graphics they make the game feel different in the end this is a very wonderful game to play with some friends or random people because it doesn t really matter not having someone to play with you you can always find a cool temporary group in a public server and by buying the game you get a free copy for a friend in case you have one
