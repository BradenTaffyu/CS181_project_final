2022 product received for free early access review my last review was a dumb review template so here s an actual review now project zomboid is a wonderful game while i play solo i do get bored easily and it s not the game s fault i d just prefer a story driven game when i m alone and i know that project zomboid is not that kind of game but in the multiplayer that is a whole different story get a group of friends start up a server and build up the greatest memories of fighting hordes looting big buildings and surviving it all modding the game is a breeze while project zomboid is a fun game to play vanilla mods just make it even better but before you get into playing this game will not hold your hand you can play a tutorial and get a survival guide when you begin but things like technique map knowledge and overall survival skills can also help out even with all this death is still a bite away don t get mad at your death it will just happen unless it s completely bs then get angry overall project zomboid is a 10 10 and the indie stone have created one of the best games i have ever played
