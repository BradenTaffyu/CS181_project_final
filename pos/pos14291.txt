early access review dyson sphere program is another automation factory building game in the same vein as factorio and satisfactory however dsp approaches the genre differently instead of one large relatively flat plane to construct your factory you have dozens and dozens of much smaller spherical surfaces to build on the magic of this game comes from its sheer scale cruising to another planet or launching your first solar sails are truly memorable experiences that i haven t seen matched by any other automation game furthermore this is one of the most polished and competent early access titles i have ever played it s astonishing to beat what feels like a fully fleshed out game and then read dev blogs stating all the features that have yet to be added massive praise to youthcat a five person team for creating one of the most special gaming experiences i ve ever had i am incredibly excited to see where the game goes from here
