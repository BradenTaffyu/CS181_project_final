2023 a pretty fun adventure themed open world racing game it does a few things quite well in order to crack through to me someone dealing w adhd in my experience most open ended open world games occupy one of two extremes completely directionless play minecraft creative mode and the ubisoft tower of completing one simple objective and having hundreds of chores immediately unlocked on your map this game sits somewhere in between those though its exact position oscillates as you play and can be influenced by what you re doing you start the game doing something cool immediately and get to sample a few different kinds of cars and styles of racing right out of the gate the game doesn t shy away from showing you how large its map is but it intelligently hides most of the content that s on offer unlocking more is based on choices you make as you pursue the threadbare albeit competent story the game has it has an almost mmo oriented pacing in regard to how you pursue content and unlock more to do different styles of races and environments have their own quest givers and quests to complete which will unlock races that offer progression towards the next narrative beat and a handful of side races that you can do for fun or rewards if you ever feel stuck on what to do the game contains an ai companion of sorts that you can call upon any time to guide you to an objective loosely based on the kind of progression you ve asked it to guide you to i ve played 60 something hours dabbling in all of the race varieties i ve come across including setting foot into each major dlc nowhere near a done state with the game i do think it becomes a bit less adhd accessible when you approach the end game as the game gradually cares less about hiding what s available the content distribution and volume is likely to have something you ll really enjoy and you can really focus down on 1 2 styles of play and still have a ton to do the only drawback with that play style is the reward mechanisms the game has when combined with how many cars and other kinds of rewards there are you might find yourself satisfied with circuit and street based racing but if you want to unlock certain cars certain emotes and complete the story you re going to have to engage with cross country and off road races too not a bad game to play solo or with friends competitive types will likely end up disappointed there isn t a ranked mode and the horizon open consisting of random races with random players takes away some of the satisfaction time trials exist for every course whether they re official in game courses or community made though a significant portion of the top spots on the leaderboard are occupied by cheaters those that trail behind them have completely mastered the art of breaking the tuning system outside of its semi realistic responses to your adjustments extracting more performance from cars than they otherwise could and they drive those cars exceptionally well if you choose to compete here you ll probably need to feel satisfied with placing in the top 5 or top 1 of times or only comparing yourself to your friends at the end of the day this game has a ton to do but the quality of any one thing it does is diminished not as much as you think since this is the 5th horizon game built upon the legacy of the motorsports series that came before it but other titles that specialize in one or two areas are going to be more satisfying to players seeking specific kinds of experiences arcade fun oriented physics simulation based physics competitive racing in multiple formats more concise track lists for the community to compete on and benchmark their performance with etc worth mentioning that there s an absurd amount of accessibility options to accommodate most disabilities and a dial your own difficulty system that will allow for just about everyone to play regardless of ability
