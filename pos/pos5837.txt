2020 early access review epic large scale combat realistic medieval feel fantastic mod support and great graphics are only a few of the things that make bannerlord a great game as the game is presently in active development you ll find areas here and there that need improvement but not many if you don t like something about the game you can simply skip it or find a mod to remove or fix it the game feels like a medieval sandbox that lets you play how you d like whether that be as a trader warrior etc as a non military entity you can watch the world map evolve as factions duke it out for control without ever stepping foot into the decision making the game doesn t tell you who is good or bad there are simply factions and you get to decide who you want to support or war against if you want you can even start your own kingdom and vie for rule of the world alongside the existing powerhouse factions in short for a game that hasn t officially been released yet the gameplay is excellent the music and atmosphere is top shelf and well varied the combat is fun and well balanced and the replayability is near infinite if you re looking for a fairly realistic smart medieval game bannerlord is definitely worth looking into
