2014 early access review 1 0 updated review i bought this when it still looked like a blocky minecraft clone it has changed a lot over the years one of the better early access games i ve bought now that it has reached it s 1 0 goal i feel it is time to update my take i still very much recommend this game for single or multiplayer there are world settings to customize difficulty to your tastes mods to remove or tweak mechanics you don t like the world looks nice there are some mechanics that encourage exploration each location on the map is like a mini open ended dungeon to explore and loot rather than just a building with some enemies and loot cons thoughts sometimes i can t tell if my character s accuracy is just terrible or if the zombie hitboxes are off when using ranged weapons getting infected is not fun easy to get and hard to cure i recommend getting a mod that makes curing it easier inventory management is designed to be closer to realism challenging to manage i recommend getting a mod to increase stack size for quality of life initial roadmap included npcs they technically exist if vendors count theoretically we will see raiders added in a year or so probably won t get anything like npc companions survivors though
