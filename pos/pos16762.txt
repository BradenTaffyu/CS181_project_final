2020 this game is superb but in so many ways could be better and improved considering the devs work on it often i still hold out hope that they will implement the one thing that would in my opinion catapult this game into the stratosphere namely being able to build your own house from scratch set out the plot build the outer walls and windows and staircase design it totally from the ground up i am longing to find a game that i can recreate the houses i lived in in the past and then walk around in vr unfortunately the vr version is sold separately come on so many other games give both within the game but having said all that the therapeutic aspect of this game is second to none to take a ruined house and internally rebuild it clean it decorate it furnish it is very satisfying there really is no other game like it out there money well spent and i m glad i finally bought it if only they added the ability to build your own house from the ground up it would make this game utterly huge in my opinion they have the base of the game to do it why don t they if they don t then some other switched on developers will eventually do it instead great game at the moment maybe 100 hours worth to the limit unless they add a build your own house element how many times have i said that now just add it for f s sake game at present 7 5 10 due to limited lifespan if added option to build own houses then 100 10 and no longer a game but also a ruddy basic layman s design tool please add it or don t and game eventually plays out to a conclusion
