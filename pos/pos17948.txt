2017 if you decide to buy this game i have to warn you that it is very addictive and has a steep learning curve on the other hand it is very beautiful briliant and extremely challenging so it is very difficult to turn it off and you should be ready to stay awake till very late at night fighting for the glory of rome by the way i am an amd user and the game runs fine cpu fx8320gpu r9 280x 3gbram 8gbgame runs fine on ultra graphics 1920x1080
