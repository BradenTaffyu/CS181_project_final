2017 this wow this is so very well done i actually recommended this to my mother who isnt all that into gaming or fps just for the sheer aspect of the enviroment brings back memories of my childhood in the woods around strawberry arizona the sound the wind in the trees the birds you can almost smell the exhaust off the atv is it another shooter in terms of gameplay yes is it a simulator probably not but man the places and the absolute beauty is insane campared to the enviroment of skyrim this is breathtaking and skyrim was beautiful dont buy if all you want to do is kill stuff buy arma 3 instead but if you want an absolutely beautiful experience get this now
