2022 nier automata is an incredible game that tells a fantastic story note this review does not contain any story spoilers for many years it was marred by a poor pc port however on july 15th 2021 the game s fundamental technical issues were addressed and it is finally a game i can wholly recommend the gamepad controls are tighter and more response tools like far fix automata resolution are no longer required for play modding is still supported so these tools have use but were previously required for a technical vanilla experience and in my entire 100 playthrough i ran into zero crashes nier automata is both a narrative masterpiece and a competent pc port as of its final update gameplaythe game has you assume the role of 2b 9s a2 three yorha units whose skillsets are fairly unique the gameplay both in terms of how you play and how you progress the narrative is structured around its five core endings labeled a c each playthrough is unique and you won t simply be repeating the game to reach a choice screen that allows you a different option rather each time you complete a primary ending you start anew from a fresh perspective having both the narrative take on a new angle as well as the gameplay through the character you play combat in nier automata is hack n slash style slicing and dicing through enemies around you you have two weapons slots either of which can be equipped to use a variety of light heavy weapon types the first slot is for light attacks the second for heavy combos in the game consist of various numbers of light heavy attacks in rhythmic succession each weapon in the game details its light heavy combos in simple numeric fashion augmenting the combat in the game is the plug in chips system offensive defensive support utility chips which can be plugged into any of the characters to aid in your gameplay you re allotted a limited number of points for equipping chips and the better a chip is the more points it will take for example a chip which increases your damage by 20 will require more points than a chip which increases your max hp by 5 chips can also be combined to level them up creating better chips which consequently cost more points to equip this is called fusing finally we have pods they re small robots that follow you around and can be equipped with tools to aid you in combat from gatling guns to lasers to sonars which detect nearby hidden items the pods serve both an offensive utilitarian purpose in the game they have both a primary secondary fire functionality where the secondary fire is based off of the currently equipped skill these are much more powerful albeit at the cost of a modest cooldown pods are also closely intertwined with the narrative outside of the hack n slash combat you ll also face sequences of bullet hell style gameplay as well as brief hacking minigames these are typically brief though hacking plays a much more prominent role later on the gameplay is structured around several zones all of which will be fast travel accessible by midgame each zone will have its denizens offering side quests that you can optionally complete as you progress the main story the main story will also take you through all of the zones so you won t miss any areas of the game as you follow its narrative each of the three characters in the game play in different styles though 9s is very different where 2b and a2 are somewhat similar each of the three primary endings a c will offer you a unique spin on the game storynote i m intentionally keeping this section of the review bare and focusing on the technical aspects of the endings system because i wish to avoid spoilers the narrative in this game is worth going through blind arguably the narrative of nier automata is its strongest suit the gameplay is solid and satisfying but the story is something else altogether told through its three primary endings the actual final ending can be found through ending e which is unlockable very quickly after completing ending c as only endings a c require full playthroughs of the game ending a sees the game through the eyes of 2b where ending b is 9s and ending c is a2 endings d is the closest to a choice screen style ending but once a d have been completed e becomes available and will tie up the game in a fantastic fashion making for a breathtaking closing while this sounds overwhelming the formula is as follows finishing ending afinish ending bfinish ending c dfinish ending c d what wasn t chosen above finish ending eafter completing the game for the third time and unlocking ending c d depending on choice you will gain access to chapter select allowing you to jump to the final sequence of the game and make the other choice by doing this you will unlock ending e and see the final narrative of the game which is absolutely incredible the game in total has 26 endings though only a e close with proper credits the rest can be unlocked at various parts in the game both in humorous and creative fashions after a non primary ending is unlocked you simply reload at your most recent save and continue performancenier automata targets a locked 60 fps and is hard capped at this framerate due to physics being tied to the framerate while disappointing at first i was able to quickly adjust to this and the game is rock stable on decent hardware at no point did i encounter any bugs glitches i never dipped below 60 fps and through my entire playthrough the game didn t crash a single time the settings menu is modest with decent confugration and it still looks rather pretty by today s standards this can be helped with higher resolution texture mods as well conclusioni 100 completed this game in around 65 hours if you re only in it for the narrative it can be completed in 25 35 hours depending on your style of play this was a fantastic experience from start to finish and is now among my favorite games of all time if you re a fan of third person hack n slash games or of jrpgs this is a must buy
