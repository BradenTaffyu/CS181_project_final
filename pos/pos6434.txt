2016 what is euro truck simulator 2 well basically you drive a truck and deliver trailers to your destinations across europe this game is from the people of scs who made other truck simulator games as referring to 18 wheels of steel series and euro truck simulatorseems boring to play if you do the same thing over and over it sure seems like it does i honestly thought when i first saw this game it seemed boring when i saw this i gave the first euro truck simulator a try and loved it this game soul purpose is meant for people who want to kill the time that s worth it and love driving is it really all about driving actually yes it is it may seem like an easy task to do but it s actually a challenge you start off small as you drive for other companies and build your way up you start with the very small tasks that you can get done within the first 20 minutes of your gameplay with the short trips eventually you gain skills and level up as you go you can use those skills to help you for traveling the longer distance and get higher payment as you complete the tasks eventually when you get that steady income you can own your own truck and make even more money you start off with a small garage and you ll be able to upgrade it and hire drivers as you go even yet take the shortcut way taking out a loan you pick on what to do is it realistic yes and no it s really how you look at it the physics on this game isn t top notch but it get s the job done for example you hit a vehicle you ll just hit each other and no physical damage would be done between the collision if anything you ll just get a fine speaking of fines there are laws you have to follow such as speeding red lights and green lights and so on the weather system is alright to my standards as you can change the settings of how often you want it to make it rain as you re on the road gas and time is a big factor too it s important to keep track when you need to complete your delivery and keep your fuel up at times sleep is also needed note some of these features can be disabled in the future in game but will get rid of that simulation feel is there multiplayer the game alone is more focused on the single player aspects although there is a mod where you can download and be able to drive with your friends and other people is there mod support heck yes you can find a lot of mods such as custom trucks map mods graphic mods and more although alot of these mods aren t off the steam workshop you would have to try to find these mods somewhere off a ets2 mod pageis there steering wheel and vr support oh yes definitely i have the g29 steering wheel pedal h shifter included it s so much better and very more immersive i also have the oculus rift combining it with the wheel is awesome i would very recommend pairing it up if you have vr or want to invest into it if your pc meets the requirements is the dlc even worth it yes and nothere s a lot of dlc s shown off this game off the page but half of them to me aren t worth getting most of them are for paintjobs for your trucks even though the steam workshop supplies free paintjobs without even paying the important dlc s are the map expansions these are the map expansions you would likely want in the future going east scandanavia vive la france italia beyond the baltic sea road to the black sea iberia russia soon to be released all of these expansions alone will give you hours of fun for every single dlc i have over 500 hours on this game and only explored 67 32 of the map that s because i took my time and didn t rushthe issues i had in the past there hasn t been that many issues in the past for me i had rare crashes that happen here and there and stuttering problems but that s likely my cpu bottlenecking my performance the ai traffic can be brutal at times making sudden stops ahead of you or cutting you off simply but this is a rare occurrence although take care as you put mods into your game some mods will crash your game at times but that s often rare in that case update as of 2019 i upgraded my fx 8320 8 core to a ryzen 7 1700x performance has been flawless ever since performance has also increased with the new dx11 system the game did chug overall with higher end pc s due to dx9 limitations my final verdict if you love driving this is a must have i never had interest in trucks until i played this the scenery all around you while driving is just breathtaking enough where you just want to stop and admire the scenery around you there s a wonderful day night transition weather effects going 90kmh in the uk is just great promods is very recommended also if you have all the map expansions for a trucking simulator i highly recommend this game even if you have no desires about trucks dlc reviews wip going east expansion dlc
