2022 product received for free with 84 hours under my belt all main dlc included for my first playthrough fallout new vegas turned from a yeah sure let s try it out to a must play simply for the story alone my journey across the mojave wasteland will certainly be not the last new vegas s biggest strength lies in its writing and thousand of unique different narrative combinations the game offers you if you wanted to you could be dead set on roleplaying a badass meleeing barbarian feasting upon the flesh like the cannibal you are be mostly a peaceful courier who finds his battlefield across the dictionary or woe every man and woman into bed for sexual intercourse only to steal their possessions right after the amount of complexity on the narrative level alone is so dense it wouldn t make justice to the game to only play through it once not even considering the specialized builds you can run with the factions you come along with that shape your opinion at the final battle of hoover dam the companions you re able to recruit with their own side quests to better their lives the content and amount of freedom you re given at any point is what makes new vegas so fun and addicting to play it also certainly helps that the game has a lovingly bright and ever so expanding modding community to even further customize your journey through the wasteland more radio stations sure a few visual enhancements and crucial bug fix to make the game more stable of course entire fan made expansions that could count as their own dlc for even more content consider it done seriously you could shop yourself dead with how much love this game gets outside official hands within this playthrough i also have completed all 4 dlcs with old world blues being my favourite out of all i won t go into detail to them here but they re all worth going through at least once the only real negative point i can bring up is that the engine this game runs on probably wanted to leave work early it was not uncommon to experience about 2 3 crashes sometimes even up to 6 to desktop each session there is no doubt the game is highly unstable even with bug fix mods the community recommended i found myself seeing loading screens more often than i see my friends snf with that said get your butt off and go wild in the mojave wasteland courier you will not regret it
