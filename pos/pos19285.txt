2023 ive played starcraft warcraft and the old halo rts but this is by far the best of them all the civs feel very different from one another and the eco part is just really fun and strategic its well balance no monitization in any way other then purchasing the game honestly with almost 400 hrs in ill probably be going for 400 more 10 10
