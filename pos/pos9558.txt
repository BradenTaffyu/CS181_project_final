2022 i m not certain how relevant this review is now given the age of the title that said i ve been sim racing since the mid 90s and grew up with grand prix legends papyrus s nascar titles sports car gt rfactor iracing and all the grand turismo titles on the playstation i feel i m qualified to say what makes a good driving simulation so imo there is very little which compares to assetto corsa simply put the physics are as good as it gets every car feels unique and like the real thing sounds too especially when played through good speakers headphones are amazing nothing like gran turismo the graphics are probably getting a bit long in the tooth at this point though they were state of the art when this sim was released they still look great providing excellent detail to both the cars and environments just don t expect them to compare to newer titles controls are good but this is very dependent on which controller you re using like all racing sims a force feedback wheel and pedals are best i use a thrustmaster t300rs with fanatec load cell pedals but it also worked quite well with an old logitech g25 however racing wheels are expensive and take up a lot of space even with a foldaway rig it s still a process to get everything set up it s not the most ideal option but thankfully you can play assetto corsa with a game pad what you want is something with high quality analog sticks and triggers that let you apply progressive pressure to the throttle and brake i use a ps3 controller which is pretty good and i ve heard the ps4 and xbox controllers work well too however i also have an afterglow controller and although it s a quality product its triggers are too light to give you a sense of how much brake and throttle you re applying keep this in mind one more note on using game pads do some research and find a guide on fine tuning the in game settings i won t point to a specific guide since getting the right feel is user specific try several and settle on whichever feels right for you trust me this makes a world of difference if you re just getting into sim racing this title is a great place to start it s now quite affordable even with the dlc which i recommend getting but still offers all the realism of newer titles plus because of its age it runs at high fps on older hardware i use an nvidia gtx 970 pared with an intel i 7 7700k even with all the glitter turned on it s never dropped below 60 fps if you re a veteran but passed on this before it s still worth checking out for its amazing cars and tracks highly recommended
