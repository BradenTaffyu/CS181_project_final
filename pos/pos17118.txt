2018 if you like this style of game then you will like it not sure about the gameplay watch some videos better than me trying to describe it if you played and liked the first game then you will probably like this one if you haven t played the first one then i d probably start there no story plot reasons it s just cheaper during sales right now you don t even need all of the dlc to have fun all dlc content is usable by the ais and anybody who bought it didn t buy tomb kings you still get to fight their ais in campaign or human players who own them online the lord packs are nice but not really game changing in campaign so it s not pay to win by any means i m mostly writing this review to offset some of the more misleading negative reviews people complain about the blood dlc but it s pretty darn cheap and i m pretty sure that was a loophole used by ca to keep the game s rating down oh and if you already own the wh1 blood dlc it works in wh2 and will in wh3 no need to buy it multiple times mortal empires though mortal empires is a flc that combines the content from warhammer 1 2 into a single mega campaign because it is basically 2 games in one you must own both base games in order to play it so if you buy wh2 in the hopes of playing mortal empires you must also buy wh1 because they won t just give you an entire game s worth of content for free listing it as flc is somewhat misleading but i think that is more of a fault with the steam store mortal empires isn t so much free as it is provided at no extra cost for those who meet the requirements now let s talk red shell i won t go into details google it if necessary or tell you how you should feel about it but i think it s important to point out that red shell has already been removed from all total war games any reviews talking about it still being in the game are either outdated misinformed or outright lying
