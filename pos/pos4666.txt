2018 i have a love hate relationship with this game so i took over a year before i posted this cons to know beforehand a the main quest is quirky and imposes very few choices insane sociopathic decisions i would never have done but you can ignore it at worst i know a friend who plays but just does not do the main quest p or just make the final choice at some point kinda sad that the rpg element is so screwed up near the end and was never fixed or improved rpg dialogues use an illusion of choice system which is a shame b the settlement system is hard to ignore you will see and i really like the concept and played it bigtime but it is half baked the system is not explained gotta google it a lot the settlement system is fun yet not player friendly a lot of mods help make it not so bad and some in depth mods really make it less of a hassle again some players just ignore the settlements i was a bit pissed that years later the main quest and settlement system had not received profond improvements as bethesda mostly worked on dlcs which were not great i disagree with their business strategy here pros c open world pretty big nice graphics can even be improved with mods fun gunplay not really hard except when you have no gear at first if you are use to shooter games or combat games you can change the difficulty level anytime which is neat and even use mods if needed to add challenge or tweak the surival mode d quite immersive e great modding community see nexus site and mostly avoid the official creation club you can generally support a modder without it via nexus i played it over 400 hours so really love hate
