2020 do i recommend this game yes the game is really fun the map is gorgeous except for the color of each nation i don t know how to turn off or lower the intensity because i like to watch the geography i must say that this is a rpg strategy game you play and choose the destiny of a nation with the objective to win the war the focus tree of each nation is what makes this game interesting i ve the feeling that this game without dlc must feel very shallow the game needs more objectives before the war or country management obviously the tutorial is awful the tooltips most of the time don t explain anything as always if you are going to play a paradox game is better to start watching youtubers streamers reading guides etc because the game does an awful job when it comes to explain how to play great game edit 11 21 20i started playing with turkey bosporus dlc it s a really fun nation because their focus tree is more complex than the earlier focus tree the game makes the political dispute more interesting and why choosing one faction or the other make it more engaging loving the game
