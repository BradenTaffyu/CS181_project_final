2014 one of the leaders of grand strategy games genre you must guide your nation of choice to world dominance through conquest diplomacy and colonization controls are pleasantly abstracted for example when you dicover a new kind of military unit you can upgrade all your armies with 1 click there s little to none micro managment you can devise your sophisticated plot and relax in your chair as you can setup a full scale invasion with just a few clicks game is visually appealing though in my opinion eu would look better with 2d graphics instead of full 3d there s only one thing that i really dislike about this game the combat resolution it has very sophisticated algorithm with dozens of parameters it s very vague and as a player you have absolutely no idea what the hell is happening unless you invest an hour of researching on the internets all in all eu4 is one of the top games in its genre it s equally good for people who love grand strategies and as an entry point for people who are curious about the genre and want to try it 9 10 would buy to rule the world
