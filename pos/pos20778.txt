2023 there is no doubt that a staggering amount of work has gone into the game i never imagined i would be wandering around a fully realized amazingly detailed hogwarts with magic around every corner this was clearly made by fans for fans now there s about 40 45 hours of solid story content in the game but there s also a good 30 hours of your favorite open world find tons of collectibles nonsense this can be a bit overwhelming or downright boring depending on your attitude also it s very light on the rpg side as there are no real consequences for example you can t really play as a real bastard slytherin because you still end up helping everyone haha despite these shortcomings it is absolutely recommended if you have any interest in the world of harry potter or you just want to play a massive aaa action adventure full of magic and fantasy
