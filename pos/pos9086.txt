2016 product received for free a few of us the other day found ourselves trying to come up with words to explain to others what stellaris felt like and we settled on civ 5 meets eu4 but in space and a lot cooler yeah that works nods like europa universalis 4 stellaris is a grand strategy 4x game explore expand exploit exterminate unlike eu4 if you ve never played this type of game before you probably won t need a bottle of wine 2 spa days and vacation to relax after trying to learn it okay i exaggerate and confess i only needed a couple of glasses of wine and one long weekend to recover from my first delighted dazed and confused hours in eu4 grand strategy indeed you will be exploring space managing resources and influence keeping your people happy colonizing and building deciding ethical matters terraforming pushing the boundaries of science making or breaking alliances building ships and armies waging wars or trying not to and spreading your own special brand of all the things across the glittering universe however you ve probably already heard stellaris is accessible yes it is the tutorial behaves like a proper host and shows you around the place with kindness and interesting explanations and a welcoming attitude the game starts slow and easy you ll have lots of time to click on buttons read well written explanations and poke around the place the learning curve meanders gently into the game and gives you lots of time to breathe and don t worry be happy and little flashy bits up top warn you of the things you really need to pay attention to anyway what could possibly go wrong then of course being a paradox interactive grand strategy game you will land on your backside repeatedly i expect with a resounding thump be surprised by things you didn t seen coming delighted with new lore that hadn t come up before and stunned by the variety of ways in which you can get it wrong get it right win all the things today or go out in high drama and ranging storms tomorrow as you expand and there are endless details to take care of you create sectors and tuck some things aside to manage themselves under your orders and supply you with lootz while you make friends and influence people and wage war in the neighborhood but if you just love micromanaging all the things you can do that too and then there is modding this game is as customizable as you want to deal with off to the workshop with you if you like space games this is my favorite of the last 20 years i was addicted to sierra s outpost back in the olden days bugs and all if you like character creation this alone could be worth buying the game seriously it s awesome fun dif you love eu4 or are terrified of it but secretly always wanted to try you re going to love stellaris if you ve never considered playing grand strategy 4x games stellaris may be the open door with the welcoming host that changes your gaming life forever now gotta run i have a new colony to get sorted have fun makespaceprettyagainedited ps shoulda said i ll let you know if i find something about it i don t like that just hasn t happened yet
