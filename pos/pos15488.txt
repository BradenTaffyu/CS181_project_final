few considerations 1 if you re looking to increase your car mechanics knowledge this game is for you play a good amount of hours then inspect a car in real life and you re going to easily recognize its components 2 this game is great to waste hours and relax there are different ways you can play this game personally i like to grab cars from junkyard and make them new and shiny 3 if you grab the drag racing dlc you re going to have fun tuning your cars so that they can perform against other cars in drag race 4 the only thing that s missing from this game in my opinion is a city environment where you can drive your car and enjoy it as if it was really yours this makes it almost pointless to own cars in the game would be amazing to get in your car get on the road and drive until the city or whatever there is some material on the workshop though that would make great multiplayer content aswell nontheless you can use your cars to do laps in the race track go in the speed track test track or drag racing dlc which can be fun overall if you like to mount and unmount stuff repair things or create to make them shiny new or in good condition and you want to expand your cars knowledge i highly recommend this game to you
