2018 early access review one of the best but slowest dev teams around this game has been getting gradually better and better for the better part of a decade with a number of major additions still planned i have played countless hours over the past years and expect once it s done to play many more there is more than enough content for the low price tag and anyone who wants an open world isometric horror survival game will get the 10 or so back in enjoyment many times over there s a decent multiplayer community and mod community to go along with it though i wouldn t consider the game complete until they finish their npc system and expand the map to include a major city both of which are at least planned and well underway i have not had many bug issues but i also tend to follow standard ea advice and not update immediately after a big patch but rather wait a couple weeks until all the fixes and hotfixes are released no stability issues either so whatever bugs there are they don t tend to be game crashing ones and you can usually work around them though i m scratching my head to think of any significant ones i ve encountered
