2016 i decided to take down my negative review and try to stabilize the game and write a positive review something that this game deserves pros replayability value multiple ways to solve quests ammo crafting and ammo types rpg elements interesting factions lore roleplay ability awesome radio songs achievements aren t disabled if you use mods fun mini games that are very rewarding cheap no settlements and preston garvey mods for everything and i mean everything combat power armor faction armor throwing weapons you can have everything that fallout 4 did good in fallout new vegas great dlcscons locked at 2gb ram you can increase it up to 4 with a mod that s the only con i can think of as a new player in the fallout universe and fallout 4 being my first i can assure you that this game is propably the best in the series i haven t played the classics so i exclude them hell i even unlocked all achievements the mod community is one of the best i ve seen so far alongside the skyrim mod community 10 10 best fallout excluding the classics
