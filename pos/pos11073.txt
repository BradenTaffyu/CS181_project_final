2023 jurassic park evolution 2 delivers improvements across the board it takes the best parts of the original game adds new ways to play and changes up mechanics to make them feel more realistic and interesting making everything more engaging and immersive building straight paths and fences is easier keeping dinosaurs fed is a breeze and even speeding up time is now possible yet managing those raptors is still a welcome challenge while i may not actually be the best dinosaur supervisor yet i can t see myself putting this game down for a long time
