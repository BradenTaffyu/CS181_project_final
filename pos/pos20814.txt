2023 hogwarts legacy is a truly magical one of a kind game you could say that while playing i felt a sense of nostalgia mixed with joy as if i finally had the chance to truly experience the magic i had read about the story is great and the gameplay casting spells crafting potions attending classes solving quests dueling making friends and allies caring for magical animals and discovering the secrets of the wizarding world is a lot of fun i must say they did an outstanding job on hogwarts castle especially the four houses they truly captured the uniqueness of each house the nobility courage and loyalty of gryffindor the intelligence and creativity of ravenclaw the compassion hospitality and love of nature of hufflepuff and finally the burning ambition cunning and hunger for power of slytherin each house s decor location and students are different just like in the books really an excellent job on these details moving on i just loved the magical beasts the expanded lore the quests the collectibles and of course the ominous dark forest great work on those too i also think the combat spell upgrades and the chance to learn the unforgivable curses are some really cool things worth mentioning thank you very much for this new adventure in the fantastic fascinating world of harry potter that we all know and love
