this is a gacha game gacha games are generally notorious for their poor storytelling and live service and gambling nature but limbus company hereinafter lc is kinda different the developer of lc previously made 2 critically acclaimed single player rogue like games lobotomy corporation and library of ruina both of which have good gameplay and great storytelling all 3 games are set in the same universe so you can expect the story of lc to be quite decent in general another very positive aspect of lc is its generosity in game currency used for pulling gacha is easy to obtain allowing even f2p players to participate in seasonal gacha pool to a decent degree all the story content can be completed by free character identities with proper planning and patience high rarity character identities are not required to enjoy the game furthermore unlike most gacha games nowadays there are only 12 playable characters in lc you can pull different identities of a character from gacha pools and choose one to use during battle each identity has different skills and features but they re all derived from the same character therefore each character s personality and backstory become much more intriguing and well established in general because the developer can focus their effort and resources on only a limited number of characters however there are some negative aspects of lc worth your attention too the tutorial is awful you will need to read very carefully or search for online tutorial videos to understand the battle mechanisms remember you can always ask questions on the lc subreddit or steam forum skill and effect descriptions can sometimes be complex and convoluted you ll need to read a lot if you don t have the patience to carefully read through enemy description you will definitely suffer repeated defeats at some point during the main story like any gacha game new identities and egos equipable skills are often stronger than the old ones which may encourage you to keep pulling from new pools to keep up with the ongoing trend or meta live service is intrinsically predatory imho so be sure that you know when to spend and when to stop overall i would give lc a score of 8 10 which is much higher than other popular gacha games nowadays most of which are maybe 5 10 if you can endure the first 2 3 hours of lc during which you ll be painfully confused by all the jargon and gimmicks you ll probably like this game and start to grow fond of the characters
