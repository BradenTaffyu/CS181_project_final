2023 ever wanted to conquer the galaxy as a race of farming robots ever wanted to devour every race you come across as an all encompassing hive mind ever wanted to become a galactic emperor ever wanted to simply destroy all life in the universe so many ways to play so many interesting and fascinating playthroughs i ve gone through that it s hard not to recommend this game biggest negatives is the game chugs along in late game slowing down even the fastest computers and the game is best played with all the content that keeps improving it every step of the way which will cost a pretty penny at this point
