2022 really does a decent job at scratching that ogre battle itch that being said ogre battle was simply far superior but good luck getting yourself a copy if you don t already have one soul nomad might be the only other thing slightly better as well it is a very dry well for this genre of games unsure why that is as the reviews of such games are always overwhelmingly positive pros satisfies the itch class systems and team fights grid based with well drawn sprites simplified class building system that is easy to understandcons just a god awful pointlessly long story with weak skip system weak drawn character pictures subjective i know but still bad enough that i actually cared and normally i don t give a rip clunky interface makes the out of battle creating armies and moving things around 75 of the game easily way less then half of your gameplay will be actually playing vs building your armies which i am cool with so long as the interface is smooth which this wasn t bottom line this genre has a loyal audience that would eat up a real attempt at making a top notch modern version of ogre battle but these ogre lites seem to be all we get worts and all the only one i can think of that even attempted was soul nomad if you enjoyed this game i would recommend checking out that game as well does anyone else know any others seems to be a dry dry well
