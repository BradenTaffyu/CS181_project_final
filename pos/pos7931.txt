2017 early access review the main reason of people buying this game might be the crashing which is of course fine because it really is awesome especially in slow motion but this game has so much more under his hood you start it because you re bored you stay because you re having fun with regular updates a big modding community easy to install mods that not only includes cars maps and missions but also sounds new scripts and last but not least planes trains and boats this game gets bigger and better every day every part of the vehicles are customziable making nfs getting wet when seeing the customizability of those cars not only the parts but also very in depth customization like gear ratio for every gear tire pressure and suspension stiffness to name a few makes beamng drive a simulator that can show itself graphics wise the game doesnt look bad but its not the eye catcher of the year either tho the graphics get better with every update theres still a lot the graphics could become with the newest update the sound has been spiced up making the engine sound a lot better wheel support is the best i have ever actually seen with 900 actually working the best because the interior wheel will then match the rotation of your wheel force feedback really works sometimes too well when the car is getting smashed and my wheel just freaks out the gears can even get damaged if you dont use the clutch or use it wrong which i havent seen in any other racing simulator so far for everyone who likes either racing modifying crashing or challenges this will fill out the empty void of boredom you might get when you dont know what to play i cant wait to see it getting out of the beta especially since the ground concept for a big campaign is already playable
