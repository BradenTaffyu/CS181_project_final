2017 i ve never written a review for any game i ve bought because i feel like the community usually does a good job of laying out the pros and cons but i had to for this game because the negative reviews are ridiculous this game is a hunting simulator there s an entire genre for this and this is the best ever made hands down it s not call of duty and it won t appeal to people looking for a run and gun game so if you buy and complain that you can t 360 no scope a moose you re an idiot i ve hunted quite a bit in my life and i never thought a game would be able to do such a good job of replicating the feel of being deep in the woods creeping through the brush slowly towards a big trophy so you can rub it in your friends faces that you re better than them seriously this game is incredible but it takes patience just like real hunting the world is gorgeous and you can get lost for hours if you want to see what hunting is like or you hunt and it s currently not in season this game will scratch the itch don t let any negative reviews change your mind those people don t understand what this game is
