2018 the amount of reviews claiming this game is bad made by people with less then 50 hours in this game is honestly mind boggling from someone who has played civilization 5 civilization beyond earth and civilization 6 i really enjoy this installment whilst there are many things that civ 5 does better which from the looks of things will be fixed in civ 6 with the upcoming gathering storm expansion this installment does alot of things great aswell golden ages districts religion cultural advancements and much more are all done superbly well whilst it does falter in some areas such as the ai which to be fair was also not the best in civ 5 and diplomacy which looks to be getting an overhaul with gathering storm it is certainly not as bad as people make it out to be tldr civilization 6 is actually really good get it now
