2022 i freaking love this game i have been grinding out several hours worth of time just trying to master mechanics and understanding how things interact it took me nearly 60 hours to even beat the game don t judge and there is still so much to do after you have finished with it the aesthetics are delightful and the humor is always in places i don t quite expect and is subtle enough to not take away from the experience all in all 10 10 would recommend
