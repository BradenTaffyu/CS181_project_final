2017 great rpg probably one of the best games of 2017 it s strengths lie in an amusing colorful world with and intresting serious yet lighthearted fantasy setting the game is actually very rough around the edges the longer you play it s polish runs out in the last 2 chapters as they feel rushed and maybe even unfinished the difficulty curve of the game feels off since near the start it s very challenging but towards the end you will become an unstoppable killing machine though there were many improvements over the first game i still felt the first game had a better focused story better armor system combat system ap management and pacing pros lengthy rpg large variety of skills and character customization options dialogue is fun an intresting a lot of world building in game combat is fun though flawed world skills like teleporting pyramids pickpocketing are intresting combat is very strategic almost to a fault very fair price for content 100 hour playthrough doing every single quest i could cons pro and con i think teleport becomes a less useful skill in this game because of the availability of so many movement abilities to everyone a lot of broken achievements examples pray at every altar on nameless isle the quests associated with sebille fane most companions i assume new armor system is bad encourages stacking either physical or magical damage late game it becomes irrelvant everything is a one shot fest or everyone has an ability to completely strip your armor magic resist ap system is too limited compared to first game too many status effects and they are inconsistent for example rupture tendons can be used against armor but bleeding will be blocked literally every battle will end covered in necrofire fire it makes bless a useless skill since it will always be overwritten source skills useless for first 2 areas since you will never have enough source to use them and wonder if they are worth saving for a truly difficult part that never comes and overpowered for the rest of the game makes for a boring mechanic considering how central to the plot it is bless source vampirism and spirit vision aren t really compelling godwoken abilities honestly the story kind of forgets itself in the 2nd area the game feels like a means to explore and do fun rpgeque quests but the plot takes a backseat to it the final act feels unfinished i felt like i ran into solutions to quests accidently more often than the correct way final battle and final choices don t feel like they were explained or fleshed out early spoiler the compnaion interaction with the game feels to forced everyone you meet is one of the most important people in the world the companions who you don t pick early on continuously show up even though you have no attachement to them at all crafting like in the first game is exceptionally bad you can never preview what the recipe is going to make the receipe ui is super cluttered exiperimentaion is cumbersome it s mostly luck based guessing with a few skill books good luck sorting through the ui with no search function or filters to get anything useful ignore the crafting system completely despite there being decent receipes like boots nails or status immunity potions overall a great game probably the goty but i would reccomend people give the first game a chance beacuse i truly believe it is the better title between the two a few of the characters and plot points carry over so it s worth taking into consideration before playing this game regardless i feel like after a few patches maybe an expansion this game can be fixed up to be almost perfect but for dos is still the best example of kickstarter success and a modern crpg with a classic taste to it
