2019 early access review this game started out as a silly sandbox army game that had some fun elements for someone looking for a fun little game but now it has evolved into something that can interest players of many interests there are dozens of diverse silly and crazy units that are entertaining to watch alone some levels can be seriously difficult and require strategy providing the player with little resources or restricting available units the ability to control units adds a whole array of possible level designs and lets the player witness the chaos amongst their army creating and sharing your own levels and campaigns is easy and adds a constant supply of new unique levels all in all i am very impressed with how well this game has grown and look forward to future updates
