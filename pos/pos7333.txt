2021 this game has been really relaxing for me during the pandemic recently when i cannot get out and travel like i would prefer getting to drive around make deliveries and just see the sites is cathartic and is even better since the team at scs has done such a great job at recreating each state and bringing new content and locations to the game on a pretty regular basis i am anxiously awaiting the new states this year and would recommend this game to anyone that is looking for a relaxing game where you are running your own trucking company
