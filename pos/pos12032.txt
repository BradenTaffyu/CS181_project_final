2022 i find it funny that people are complaining about the game s difficulty on higher boss cells obviously higher boss cells are harder because that is the point if you find it too hard on higher boss cells then play it on lower boss cells what is it with casuals and their sense of entitlement that things not meant for them should be adjusted for them you don t see me playing puzzle games i m not good at then complaining that the puzzles are too hard social media has created the wimpiest generation ever
