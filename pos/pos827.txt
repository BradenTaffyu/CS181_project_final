2016 stardew valley is a lot like the game harvest moon i game i have yet to play but stardew allowd for endless hours of entertainment with many different options to choose from what to do on a day to day basis one day you can stick to organizing and cleaning up your farm the next day you can go fight in mines and collect a ton of different ores and useful materials then you can go fishing to become a better fisherman you get to also raise your own barn animals once you construct more buildings which require every day attention sounds repetitive but it s fun the game goes by seasons starting in spring with each season having 28 days and each season having different crops you can harvest winter has practically 0 crops every season can take hours to complete and you may not even realize that you spent hours playing besides from fishing mining farming and more you can also befriend the people of pelican town town in which stardew takes place and if you become good enough friends with some of the other citizens you can eventually marry them i d say its important to befriend everyone in town because they may send you gifts in the mail if you have good chemistry with them overall i d give stardew a solid 100 based on the endless hours of entertainment and the amount of activities you can do in the game would highly recommend that if you have 15 dollars to spare give this game a shot or wait for a steam sale
