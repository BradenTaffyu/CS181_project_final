2015 i could not stop playing until just today i spent alot of time in the new settlement features which are pretty extensive can take some time to figure out but very cool i really don t understand all the people saying its not a fallout game feels like fallout to me with some new aspects love the options for perks and character building one flaw that i will point out is the poor dialogue but talking is not what we came here to do i pretty much just paid a dollar an hour to be very entertained did not study for midterms no regrets
