2023 early access review being an otr trucker and a gamer has its challenges the biggest being signal quality to play games because steam needs active connection to play with others most of the time and that can limit game choices my wife rides with me and its frustrating trying to play together and crappy signal keeps kicking us we rely on games that can we can lan when hotspot is shotty at best 7 days to die was our go to because we could kinda lan that with our ethernet cable start the game get inside and then simultaneously cut out hotspots again shotty but it worked introducing project zomboid everything we loved about 7 days to die mix in some sims feeling add in alot more real world issues like injuries have to be continually checked and maintained and in some cases stitched and hidden features your gun can jam in the middle of firing press x to rack it and clear the jam and top it off with a huge pile of mods to keep things fresh and interesting and what about the cherry on top you can play offline lan coop with an ethernet cable yes a new age game that understands gamers some of us don t always have the ability to have internet on demand are the graphics aaa no but i think it adds to the appeal but i m a firm believer that graphics aren t a selling point its the core gameplay that should decide a games value and the fact that in project zomboid you can break a window jump through it and get cuts because you didn t right click and clear the broken glass first is an awesome selling point its not a game for the mindless playing definitely not a run and gun its a game where you really have to think about survival and make real decisions before you make your next move oh and if you here a helicopter hide
