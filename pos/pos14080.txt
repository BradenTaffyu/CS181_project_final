this game is a royal pain in the ass but that s why it s so good the moment you find yourself uninterested or bored a new problem arises for you to solve on your own you can build a world how you see fit or go meta it s your call the learning arc can be steep but it s understandable considering the amount of different stages in technogoly advancement in terms of plumbing electrical ventilation food resource supply to even bloody happiness and ect there is no in game purchases to tempt you to spend more money and you unlock skins as you play the game besides the extra dlc s but they aren t expensive and you can get them on sale probably runs amazing on a smart fridge with mcdicks wifi at times you can turn your brain off but then shortly after i usually find 1 or 2 of my lil dudes suddenly dead so be advised
