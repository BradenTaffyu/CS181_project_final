2018 early access review i really don t understand why so many people are bashing the new update personally i think it improved the game quite a lot and most of the criticisms i ve seen are either a unelaborative they changed it now it sucks or sprinkled with actual lies or contradictions or just attacking the devs in general instead of reviewing the actual game so i m going to go through the major complaints i ve seen so far and say why i personally don t think it s as bad as many people are making it out to be they added vehicles but cut the map size in half so they aren t as useful they actually over doubled the map size in the new update from 16km to 36 km so vehicles are still useful not to mention that the stamina system people keep criticizing should actually make them a god send they prevented people from just building what they want outright and made it so you have to grind for levels now and their new leveling system is boring and tedious while the new level system is a bit of a mixed bag i still like it however i just wish the still had base skills to go along with the new more specialized perks the game always had a barrier to letting you craft higher grade stuff since the beginning they just replaced a potentially slightly faster rng system with the schematics to more reliable leveling they essentially swapped out rng for xp and while it s still annoying in many ways especially with some of the level requirements being in the 70 s for certain perks rng could also be tedious instead of checking 5 working stiffs to get either too many or no schematics to make a minibike you now have to clear out 5 working stiffs to get enough xp to get there not to mention that while rare the rng system could actually lock off content in a certain playthrough if favor didn t go your way i once checked every library in my game world in a16 and never acquired a single minibike or scrap armor schematic my entire playthrough at the very least it s now a sure thing at some point even if it takes a while and feels more rewarding when you reach that goal instead of just lucking out while searching a garbage bag the new stamina and health system is obnoxious and prevents you from playing the game practically i will concede that stamina drains much faster than it should and they should probably change the numbers around a bit but everything else seems pretty ok to me better recipes and more animals in the world to hunt also offset this penalty a bit i have master chef and we cleared out the boar farm early on for meat and now i can keep my entire party of 5 going singlehandedly for another 2 weeks at least and this will only get better as i level up and we start dipping into farming it makes hunters and farmers much more valuable now since in a16 a single piece of grilled meat and a jar of water was enough to sustain a person for around 3 days and since food has no spoil timer you d quickly rack up a stockpile and then never have to worry about that aspect of the game ever again now it actually matters throughout the entire playthrough since you have to eat constantly to keep your stamina up and food depletes much faster overall more tedious yes but it makes previously lackluster classes much more important in keeping everyone alive guns are super common now and because loot is no longer as rare as it was the only reason to go into buildings now is for xp farming zombies i actually do not understand this one i am playing a game right now with 5 other people all of which have looted around 5 entire buildings worth along with the entire boar corn farm poi as well as 2 supply drops and we have maybe 4 level 1 pistols 2 level 2 hunting rifles and 1 level 1 smg with a shotgun here or there definitely more common for sure but by no means actually common and this was with 3 points into the looter perk maybe we got with the rng or they got really lucky but this isn t even to mention that unless these people were finding 200 rounds of ammo with each gun and were finding level 4 guns in these stashes early on which i know for a fact they weren t looting is still a big necessity to actually find mods better guns or ammo to keep those guns functional and while this system makes guns feel slightly less of an accomplishment was the old rng system of finding 4 parts to a single gun and the book that much better you know what it felt like to have 50 receivers grips and parts for a pistol but no barrel so they just sat in a safe doing nothing that was also obnoxious and if you think this new system is still worse than that go right ahead but don t act like the old way was lightyears better zombies got massive damage buffs to buildings making builders much worse than they were my group was able to survive the first two 7 day waves with 64 enemies and on nomad difficulty plus countless smaller ones by going into an information center in the middle of the woods upgrading the door to iron and putting a simple wall of 3 wooden spike traps around the perimeter and the zombies were never able to breach the walls or doors yet so i don t know what mega hoards and or crappy bases you guys are putting up but decent defenses are still a must for higher waves but even if they chew through bases slightly faster than before i like that it still encourages a more active defense approach than just letting you sit underground in a slightly reinforced bunker every time a wave came overall this update can still use some work which the devs promised they would do after the holidays but the only major complaints i have so far are these max stamina drops pretty damn fast and until you get higher level food recipes it can be a chore to get it back the new skills system is pretty fun and immersive but only if you have a party of at least 3 people playing together i can see how solo players will struggle to get their feet off the ground with the lack of sharing xp and all some of the level requirements for perks seem a bit too high like the level 40 requirement to finally start making iron tools let alone actually using them efficiently i wish they still had base skills to go along with perks and attributes instead of going down the fallout 4 path of just boiling it down into perks but even still i think the addition of attributes was a great idea and the system works for the most part other than these 4 complaints i personally feel that the update as a whole was an improvement and people who personally don t like it have some good points and give some criticisms but those that claim that alpha 17 gutted and ruined the entire game to the point of no return are committing egregious hyperbole give it some time i m sure it will be improved further just like every other major update this game ever had
