2022 i find myself playing this daily it relieves a lot of stress and calms me down it s very relaxing the slower more methodical approach this game requires takes me away from a stressful fast lane style of life i find no matter how my day has been that getting on this game tends to bring me back down and mellow me out it has a lot of variety from sniping geese out of the sky with a 22 longrifle to stalking bison through the forest at night with a longbow it has it all if you want to sit in a blind tree stand and use a caller to lure in prey you can do that scents lures and the ability to put a blind anywhere in the game makes it possible if you prefer stalking your prey following blood broken vegetation and footprints that is also viable prefer long range people routinely make 425m shots with various rifles want to get up close shotguns bows crossbows and pistols are a viable option there is something for every play style this game is what you make it my wife and i had a blast running around at night chasing a pack of boar with 50 cal black powder rifles i ve spent a few nights chasing deer down on a 4 wheeler and blasting them with 10 gauge slugs poacher style i ve also sat in a blind all day waiting for a particular buck to pass by so that i could introduce him to my 30 30 i ve shot roosevelt elk red foxes grizzly bears whitetail deer and turkeys at the same time i ve been eaten by lions trampled by water buffalo stalked and hunted by wolves mauled by a blackbear caught in a stampede of wildebeests and even ran over by a crazy whitetail doe who came out of no where and plowed my ass over this game is amazing yes it has its bugs and yeah you have to restart the game when your blood hound yes you get a bloodhound in a dlc glitches out sometimes my gear won t appear in my hand and i have to restart i ve had a perfect shot get stopped by a blade of grass i ve lost need zones because an murdered every creature in 2 square miles it s not perfect by any means it can be frustrating at times but at the same time i literally screamed in excitement when i finally killed my first diamond i have never had a game make me do that it s a great and immersive game it s not perfect and it never will be and that s okay it s still a great game gold star expansive worlds you knocked this one out of the park
