2017 early access review a serious contender for the place of favorite game period if one has a liking for roguelike rpg goodness with a difficulty curve so steep it effectively serves as a wall a lively community surrounding a project that is not merely fantastically made but also clearly loved dearly and bizarre semi randomized plot in a beautifully weird world caves of qud will provide a slaking for that thirst along with effectively weekly major updates for everything from data structures used for game processing to introductions of novel and uniquely interesting fungal diseases a great deal about the quality of this title can be construed from how quickly and directly the development team is willing to answer one s questions and push for rapid bugfixes if you may only own a single rpg for life caves of qud needs to be considered long and hard for that position
