2018 hey there now its time to write my own review about fallout 4 i m not too far in fallout yet but i think that i can talk already about the good things in fallout 4 but about the problems of course too but lets start to talk about the good things advantages the graphic the graphic is great i mean not the best at all but its quite cool for example if you zoom in something its always clear to see and not pixelated i don t think that i have to write more about it it should be clear gameplay just a little thing but i love to play with a controller so i m very glad that i can do it freedom i love games where you can do whatever you want to do you can make any quest and you don t have to follow the line you can stop a quest if you don t want to keep doing it and so on but with freedom i mean much more things like that you can rob all the money and weapons and so on from traders and you can kill f ing everybody may you shouldn t do it but its a cool thing d or that you can choose your buddy and change your look so i think that this is really cool and without that freedom fallout wouldn t be really good huge huge map don t think that i have to add something potential for playing fallout veryyy long i have a lot of games where i may play 20 hours and finished the game after that and then i have games where i may play 100 hours because you can have different endings or something like that but probably it would be boring because there isn t such a big difference in the gameplay and then there is something like fallout i mean i don t get bored because you can do sooo many things all the quest and to explore everything and to build your own settlements and and and if youre done with everything you would need about 1000 hours and i think that already because of this the price is justified disadvantages building houses its difficult i mean it isnt a disadvantage at all in fact its a grat thing that you can build your own houses and so on but i think that its not well implented you can t place walls etc where you want to always the game doesn t allow you to place something there where you want to what is really getting on my nerves is the thing with magnet i mean that the game decides where it wants to place the wall for example it always places the wall right next to the other so its hard to build the houses like you want to so here you dont have the freedom which i like so much but in fact it makes fun to build in the vault etc but i would really really like if there would be a patch to fix it up pls quite a lot bugs things like if you send away your buddys mostly dogmeat there is always trouble to find them i often had to load new because there weren t at the places i sent them to even if i slept a few days or placed a doghouse and so on i would like if they would teleport to the place i sent them to there could go nothing wrong may i will add some things when i played it a little bit longer but for now it should be enough thanks for reading it have a nice day
