product received for free early access review i feel like the free to play model of the game could be improved 30 dollars for a game in alpha is pretty steep especially for countries outside of the us or uk maybe instead of having access to 8 or so slots after purchasing the game have tiers that allow for 1 2 3 etc slots to be purchased not all players need 8 slots that being said not all players can afford to buy the game in full in any case the gameplay is fun and the systems in place for combat seems fluid enough however the matchmaking could use some work as most servers in asia are empty or full of giga farming bised players that will literally 1 2 tap you
