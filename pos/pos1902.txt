2022 i grew up playing kotor and kotor ii on my xbox over and over and over again i signed up for the forums on this site the day the first trailer dropped i beta tested pre ordered the game for early access and was given my first ever gaming pc as birthday present specifically to play this game it has now been 11 years since this game s release and i am now a married man with my first kid on the way working to open my own business and yet this is still my favorite game of all time i have always played it on and off every year since it s release and it has only gotten better and more enjoyable as time has gone by my wife started playing it with me when we first started dating and it s one of the things that has brought us together most we cosplay our oc s at disneyland and write fanfiction and play together and write ingame mail and we are dorky and this is a very dumb review i am sorry if you read this i am high and sentimental because this game means the world to me it has been my literal companion that has persisted by my side for the past decade and i ve watched it grow change and mature with me tldr 10 10 would play this game forever and ever and hope i can somehow
