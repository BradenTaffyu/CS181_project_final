2019 if you like dos1 and excellent turn based combat this game will keep you up at night planning a new strategy to beat that tough fight scrolls and bombs can help while your abilities are recharging love the crafting system when you re low on cash craft things to sell voice acting is top notch character skill and attribute system very detailed and if you don t like how you distributed the points go back to the ship and redistribute highly recommended
