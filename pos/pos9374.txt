2022 assetto corsa is an outstanding driving simulation for racing enthusiasts the value here was placed on realistic vehicle representation and physics frills were generally avoided so there is not even a main menu music i have a lot of fun finding the right vehicle setup for the countless challenges so i can recommend it but without some background knowledge on race car setups the game can be a bit frustrating as even the bronze medal isn t easy to achieve
