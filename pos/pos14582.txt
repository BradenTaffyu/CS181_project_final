2018 i ve yet to actually disrecommend a game on steam but this might be the closest i ve gotten don t take that the wrong way i do recommend civilization vi but i can t recommend it more or less unequivocally like most of the other games i ve recommended here judged on its own by its own merits alone civilization vi is a perfectly fine game it has some issues the ai you over with unjustified surprise wars the ai not suffering from warmonger penalties a sometimes clunky trade route interface and there s some areas where personal taste may vary such as the art style but these aren t really dealbreakers in my opinion and it s certainly better than any of the competitors or knockoffs on the steam store and there are areas where the game really shines the soundtrack is absolutely great as are the governor and free city mechanics added in the rise fall expansion the separate tech and culture trees are a plus the interfaces are generally clear the civilizations are unique enough to be engaging and the little panoramic view you get when you construct a wonder is pretty sweet if this was a new ip or the first game in a series i d recommend it more or less unequivocally but this isn t the first game in a series it s the sixth and in one of the gaming world s most prominent and successful franchises no less civ vi inevitably winds up in the shadow of civ v and it doesn t quite come out of it the ai in civ v wasn t so wantonly and inexplicably dickish to the player there was more content in areas like espionage and trade and religion and while i don t have any problems with civ vi s art style per se i do really like the art deco style that civ v opted for there are areas where civ vi in my opinion does better than civ v the mechanics added in rise fall notably but there s also smaller things some of the new civilizations in civ vi are just really cool and thanks to the changes made to cities i no longer have to worry about stonehenge being constructed in the middle of the ocean but overall it feels like there s just so many things that civ v does better than civ vi to summarize on its own this game is a perfectly fine game it s enjoyable and when going by its own merits i recommend it but it doesn t always feel like it lives up to the standard civ v set
