2020 what a treat of a game colorful fantastic music enjoyable humor miserable events this game is a rollercoaster and not just because it took 6 years to get here it s made in rpg maker but sometimes it s so good you don t even realize it if you re on the fence don t go look up stuff about this game you can only experience things for the first time once after all just buy it or hide under a rock until the cost goes to a comfortable level i loved this game
