2020 early access review 2023 update finished the game with two friends all the earlier points still apply maybe not the grim story bit the later chapters are more easy going than the first few the play through was lots of fun and quite literally a journey i d say this is what makes raft different from the other build survive games your base camp is mobile so you get to build permanent stuff and explore places at the same time thumbs up the start can be very misleading for the impatient among us it might seem like your only goal is to throw the hook around and gather junk it isn t once you expand your raft and get the basic needs water and food somewhat covered the game will slowly start expanding before you and it usually manages to offer some nice surprises as it does it also has the best first person base building system i ve ever seen so far coming from a person scarred for life by vanilla fallout 4 base building if you want to place something somewhere you usually can or there is a clever way of doing so the story at the time i m typing this only the first chapter was released is okay considering it s revealed to you by means of notes static objects and locations oh and it s quite a lot more grim than the colourful visuals suggest and it s not a very easy game if you re not planning ahead and paying attention you ll get eaten you ll drown you ll get stomped mauled or die of dehydration i d say difficulty wise this is somewhat similar to the long dark but quite a lot more forgiving definitely looking forward to chapter 2
