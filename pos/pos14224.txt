2021 early access review there s plenty of reviews on here comparing this game to factorio and saying it s a great game that s just like it this is 100 true but instead of just adding the same stuff onto the pile i figure i d address some of the things i ve seen in the negative reviews 1 controls are not intuitive and hard to use i haven t had this issue at all placing buildings feels very natural even though in reality you re placing buildings with a rectangle footprint on a sphere planet and the fact that it s 3d instead of factorio s 2d i haven t had an issue placing blocks or buildings at all the only thing i would ask for is for blueprinting to be added but that s not something i would expect day 1 of early access factorio didn t even have it day 1 it was added after about a year 2 translation is hard to read idk where this idea comes from i ve seen maybe one or two instances of some weird verbiage but nothing is hard to understand here is an excerpt from one of the paragraphs in the game the photon combiner can convert low frequency photons into high frequency effectively reducing solar energy loss from solar radiation seems like a pretty coherent sentence especially when that is something i imagine would be a little difficult to translate it makes me wonder if people chose chinese when it asks what language at the start of the game and are now complaining they can t understand anything 3 clunky ui this one is partly true i don t have any specific difficulties with most of the ui except for manually crafting larger number of items i would suggest maybe instead of the by the produce button maybe just a normal click makes 1 shift click makes 10 and ctrl click makes 100 but the technology tree is easy to use even allowing for queuing of technology the map is easy to use basically everything except the manual production bit 4 performance i might not be in a place to speak to this much since i do have a nice pc 10th gen i7 gtx 2070 but i haven t had an issue the game is capped at 60 fps default and in the settings to bump it to a max of 100 i can run it just fine at 100 but i leave it at 60 since that s good enough for me when it comes to a factory building game but maybe there are some issues on lower end hardware i would hope as development progresses those issues get ironed out 5 key rebinding yes this should be in the game as of launch it s not but i know it s on the roadmap and they seem to think of it as a high priority but i agree with this one i would love to change key bindings that s about it so far i like the game a lot it is visually nice building big factories on planets is fun stuff i haven t gotten to jumping around from planet to planet or system to system but looking forward to it i d give the game in it s current state a 7 5 8 10 so far main drawback is those keybindings p once those are added i d go to a 8 5 9 maybe higher depending on how fun the late game is and more development could raise my opinion of it even more great fun for anyone who is into this type of game
