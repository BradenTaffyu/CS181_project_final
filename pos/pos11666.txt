2020 product received for free early access review 7 days to die is basically rust for people who aren t sweaty imagine rust s farming looting and hunting mechanics come together to meet an open world random gen zombie horde game basically rust pve or a good looking minecraft this is 7 days to die hostable not only by server but with single player single player can also host online games for your friends to join this game was recently introduced to me but it has become my new favourite for a long time i ve been looking a chill yet challenging game to play and grind on as of writing this review 7 days to die has 111k positive steam reviews with 20k negative i would also like to add many of the negative reviews including one of someone i know praise the game but detract from some changes made keep in mind this game is old released way back in 2013 i am writing this review just as alpha 19 is being previewed by the developers and as beta downloads 7 days to die looks stunning not only does the game have many graphical customisation options respecting low end gpu s and giving newer gpu s some fluffy to play with but there are extensive levels of customisation such as draw distance for certain props etc as of writing this review 11th august 2020 alpha 18 is what we ve been living with since the start of 2019 coming into the game around this time and having messed around with every graphics option i already thought the game looked stunning but with the coming alpha 19 update we have a plethora of huge additions to the game but we have a massive retexturing optimisation and lighting effort being displayed in beta builds these retextures are excellent not only updating different types of props and geometry but also zombies themselves running this game with a gtx 1070 i get an extra 20fps at full settings at 1080p when speaking of 7 days to die gameplay the best way i can describe it is like rust i actually played 7 days to die first but having sunk 150 hours into rust in the past fortnight i am so hyped for the official release of alpha 19 hence this review it s basically 3d minecraft punch trees build a sick base night time spooky if you are looking to get into a new game to grind consider this one if you are a fan of rust definitely check out 7 days to die it s basically the more chill version of rust great to play with friends lots of difficulty settings to mess with great gunplay and great game worth any price don t let anyone tell you it s worth half of a full price game
