2017 stellaris is your typical paradox grand strategy game which is set in space the early game is fantastic and it gives me great pleasure to explore the universe and its anomalies making first contact and react to events once i reach mid game the game grinds to a painful halt many of the features and functions of this game are undeveloped and sometimes not very well thought through but knowing paradox this is something they will work on with future dlcs all in all this is a good game with greater potential waiting to be unlocked all events art a screenshot of stellaris by burn stellaris all star a screenshot of stellaris by burn stellaris trading cards art community created artwork for stellaris by burn
