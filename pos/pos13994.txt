2019 same old stuff not included if you are tired of getting slow roasted by dlc and surprise mechanics by greedy game corporations do yourself a huge favor and pick this up this game will reward you for your efforts by actually teaching you how to use your noodle your head will actually be useful as a hat rack as well and you won t have to spend 5 to change it s color scheme yes hats are a thing and they look snazzy there is quite a learning curve and that s the best part there are far too many games out there that require you to push a or x or whatever to win if a game doesn t have a learning curve it s probably micro transaction hell anyone that pays money for a skin that took a few minutes to make deserves to get their nuts kicked off of them you will get a glorious amount of playtime for your money spent on this i just doinked over 200 hours and i still can t put it down you will build your initial base and be immensely proud of yourself only to redo the whole thing because you discovered it could have been done better you will then bask in your glory grab a sandwich and then be shocked as to why your dupes are now suffering from heat stroke oh and your plants are not growing you are running out of water you have 2 pieces of coal left then when you think it can t get worse you click on the germ button for the first time and wonder why your sandwich you just made doesn t have the proper amount of mustard of course you will figure this all out and rejoice that you are awesome well you won t be as awesome if you snuck too many peeks at how to videos but yep you re still pretty cool when you are eventually too cool for your own good you can play outside the box and only pick dupes with flatulence and name them after different kinds of beans it s all up to you and it s great fun so i need to get back into game and fix my base cooling idea that keeps overheating and tend to my hatches that i wrangled up they need their teeth brushed again if you found this review fun please rate also buy the game
