2019 arma 3 is a timeless creation that represents the pinnacle of military simulators to date arma 3 requires a great deal of commitment in order to experiance the game as intended the controls are over complicated and mechanics require a technical manual however this is not at all to be considered a fault but is instead a gateway to in incredibly immersive sandbox simulator that requires the attentiveness that actual combat requires this in itself is an experience therer is no requirement to know everything only to develop and learn and then engage as your own avatar there is no need to be concerned about the amount of content or the replayability in each of the various modes mods servers there is always a different adventure awaiting the online component of the game is very lively and people are polite this is a game where people stick in for the long haul people you meet online are often experts however this does not mean that you are an underdog every person has their purpose and everyone has to learn the only downside of arma 3 is really down to technology and optimisation this game was developed for machines well ahead of its time yet sorely lacks some of the user friendliness of modern games i am forever excited for the next development in the arma series it would be fantastic it it were possible to jump into a game after a long layover and not have to re learn the controls or skills vr implementation more object inteaction the option for simpler controls and some optimisation would go a long way if you like to become a part of a vast and immersive combat experience this game is 100 for you but to get the most out of it you really need to give it a chance this is not your average shooter in arma your brain matters
