2022 been playing this for several hours now driving many miles through mexico and i dont find the game realistic at all cause i never seen any hooded cartel guys doing their horrible things at the opposite factions 10 10 still searching for guys with drugs and guns edit after the microsoft cashgrab i would never buy the f ing ultimate edition again 99 euro for the version where everything should be included but no ridiculous microsoft and they just bought activision blizzard now i didnt think that they could be any worse but lets see when the king of software gets monopoly on almost everything gaming
