2019 most of the negative reviews are from people who didn t bother giving the game a chance the microtransactions barely do anything and are pretty irrelevant you don t need them all they do is level you up in the game which is something that is pretty easy to do and you don t earn much for levelling up just some bonuses for your towers which are disabled on the higher difficulties anyway the game itself is very fun and in my opinion the best bloons game so far every tower has three upgrade paths and 5th tier upgrades there are lots of maps at various difficulty levels as well as lots of different challenge modes i played the game on my phone since launch and only recently got the steam version and this version runs a lot better than the phone version i was having trouble on the phone because on high rounds the game will lag and sometimes crash but on here this doesn t happen you can also transfer over your data between the different versions and it also transfers over to your steam achievements as well i only have one real problem with the game which is that if you put too many towers the game will crash and this is nothing to do with your pc it s to do with the game engine itself this is a minor issue since i had to get every single max upgrade tower in the game down plus many other random towers in order for it to crash like this but at the same time it s a little disappointing if you re trying to see what the max round you can reach is in the normal modes you probably won t encounter this issue because you won t be able to get enough money you ll only encounter it in freeplay despite some old towers not being in the game yet the game is being updated relatively frequently and one has already been added back in the past so hopefully the others especially engineer will be added soon 9 10
