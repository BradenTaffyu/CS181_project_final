2018 okay so first off i love this game so muchsecond i hate this game so much pros exploration is fun quests are pretty great characters are unique and there are lots of factions the shear ammount of things to do is overwhelming sometimes i kinda like having a voiced character but with caveats people said the guns in falllout games are terrible to use and dont feel impactful i thought they handled well and felt good for an rpg fps cons i have not played a single day on this game without it crashing at least once and thats before adding any mods usually more than once stutters like crazy even on low settings the infinite randomly generated quests are dumb and unnecessary it makes it hard to see what quests are worth doing and which arent every time you travel to nuka world it plays this long drawn out display scene from the train which then makes the game stutter like crazy and usually crash cant fast travel in survival so im basing this off that there are other things like this where the creators really just overlooked sobmething simple and its obnoxious to play with like being forced to talk to someone you dont want to talk to mods get survival options and play on survival difficulty you can turn down or off all the hunger and thirst things and there wont be m any more bullet sponges at higher levels7 5 10 from me they really need to stop using the oblivion game engine please bethesda its getting worse every time for as high budget and popular as this game is the devs really could afford to make a better functioning game
