2022 i ve played this game 18 and 15 love this series just run to a junkyard pick up a shell of a car and rebuild it to brand new as a dealership mechanic myself it can be draining but that s the fun of it if that makes sense if you like cars buy this sh t if you re a mechanic only buy if you hate yourself enough to get back to work after work 5 stars
