2019 i ve played this game for a good few hours now so thought i should review this is one of the most addictive roguelikes i ve played and for some reason i just keep getting dragged back the combinations of different decks and relics makes each run seem quite different and generally there is always something that will mess you up those golden times where you hit a jackpot and every card links into another makes it totally worth it i ve done over 100 runs and i ve won eight times so it s a good feeling when it happens maybe i just need to get better at games i hugely recommend this game
