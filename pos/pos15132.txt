2019 in don t starve together obviously everything is about not to starve but if that was the only way you could die in this 2d open world survival game it would be kind of boring right luckily that is not the case because basically anything might kill you if you don t watch out various beasts catastrophes shadow figures or feeble minded pigs might cross your way and won t make it easy for you to stay alive in this rough world so why not invite some friends the title says it all other than the singleplayer don t starve here you should probably bring some company to explore the world and exist against those horrible creatures but if it wasn t difficult enough the weather won t be on your side for long either it might be rather challenging to play this game and there are a lot of mechanics and tricks that make dst unique but you will need quite some experience to figure them out the very charming graphics and humor will make you love the game quicker than you want characters you can select from a lot of different characters for your journey who all have their very personal pros cons the specific abilities and weaknesses make the gameplay exciting and miscellaneous everytime again trust me from robots and spiders to scientists and warrior valkyries your choice is kind of unlimited even more and better characters are still developed and up to you and your fellow survivors base building of course you can wander around as a nomad gather ressources and be on track all the time but the essence to be progressive in dst is to build yourself a base for all your needs i mean who wouldn t prefer some delicious meatballs fresh from the crockpot over berries and carrots in order to set up your buildings you can t just immediately cobble together some boards and stones like a pig you have to invent them before by the huge variety of items in the game it won t be easy to obtain them all so good luck boss creatures every now and then some more or less scary meanies will come to destroy your well deserved progress better be prepared and packed with armor weapons and perhaps some magical items to defeat them psst they also have unique loot which will grant you access to craft cool gadgets or equipments to make your living easier the caves on the one hand there s the actually quite harmless overworld with its rich land but on the other there s also the underground which has a lot of dangerous and scary beasts lurking for you in the darkness but if you can prevail down there you will probably be abled to find the magical secrets of the ruins which should be discovered by yourself once you have beaten them you can rule the overworld with your knowledge skins and how to get them yes here you ll also find those skins for items you might already know from other games don t worry they re just cosmetic and won t give you any advantage besides the advantage of spicy looking characters tools or buildings and you can even share the skins on tools or buildings with your friends in game so everyone profits from them you get 1 skin drop everyday by logging in and 8 skin drops every week by playing caution science required some might be marketable and some might not be but they look cool non the less dyou can also purchase skin collections in the shop of the game to support the developers and maybe you re lucky and you can even make some money of selling or trading them the game is definitely worth the full price and the long time motivation is assured sooo what are you waiting for you can t have enough time to explore the wild depths of don t starve together the original game nightphilipp
