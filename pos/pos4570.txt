2019 ok where do i start with this game the very first time i picked this game up i was a little skeptical the controls were weird and the graphics were meh to me at the time but something compelled me to keep playing and keep learning and now it has easily become my favorite game the choices you make the alliances the silly dialogue and the battles are all reasons to play but there is something about the game that makes you want to push forward and to learn how to delve into it s mechanics so that you can come out on top it s rare to find a game that has so much you can do and it doesn t need good graphics a simple game to pick up but a very difficult game to master much love for this game and the people
