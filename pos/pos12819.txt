2020 this is like mixing the concept behind a stressball with the concept of a sandbox type game like garry s mod the game is still being worked on but i ve made use of it almost daily whenever i ve encountered a crappy situation and i need to let out some steam it s also just really generally great if you re bored a lot i also have some suggestions for the developer i m not sure if others have made similar suggestions but here we go completely customizable ragdolls such as changing the size of both limbs girth and lenght at once basically a ragdoll customization menu whether it s a male or female the ability to change their color and their sprites the ability to add more limbs so you could perhaps make monsters and demi gods or whatever your sick imagination would allow you to the ability to change the color of blood and different effects maybe even replace blood with different effects for instance maybe change the blood to gasoline which then in turn would catch fire if you shot rounds at it which then could lead to a bleeding cyborg catching everything around it on fire which reminds me the ability to change different types of ammunition for different types of weapons these could be hollow rounds armor piercing rounds incendiary rounds you get the drift and the biggest suggestion yet a type of basic advanced editor that would allow you to make custom props and maps i don t mean just using the game s already in game mechanics unless possible i mean an editor on the side where you can make things from the ground up with sprites and some basic programming this would lessen the workload on the developer and also make better use of the workshop feature these are again not requests but rather just some suggestions i ve been having a lot of fun with this little game making all sorts of wacky and sadistic little creations and i look forward to every time there s a content update i can recommend this wholeheartedly if you re into sandbox games or if you like me were addicted to the abundance of ragdoll stickfigure games that littered the browser gaming of the early mid 2000 s edit i recently came up with a new suggestion being able to take control over the ragdolls could change this game completely being able to jump crouch walk run pick up items weapons and maybe get in vehicles in addition to some of my previous suggestions could easily make this into one of the best 2 d sandbox games currently on the market that s just my thought anyway
