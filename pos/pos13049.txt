2014 early access review imagine the most intricate accurate to life space vehicle simulator you can dozens of toggle switches displays ranging from the strange and esoteric to the vague and incomprehensible buttons flashing angrily at you and daring you to press them the screen shakes and aside from the roar of liftoff the only thing you can hear is your own labored breathing and the pulse in your ears do you have this picture in your head good because ksp is nothing like that take parts attach parts launch parts land parts detonate parts survive falling parts ksp is learning through failure unless you go on youtube and look up the scott manley videos you are going to fail you gonna fail bad but it s okay failure is only data by another name bit by bit you ll learn how to do things right you ll realize that putting the engines under the tanks is probably a good idea putting the crew capsule in a place not likely to be burned or detonated is also probably a good idea parachutes seem like a logical choice but what the heck right maybe you just need a five hundred meter long crumple zone nobody s gonna stop you that s the great thing isn t it you can put anything at all you want on the launchpad and nobody knows well enough to try to stop you the kerbish osha rep is permanently locked into the bathroom he s not gettin out of there we welded the window shut locked the door and put model airplane glue in the keyhole cell phone reception in there is sketchy you re safe so go nuts there s places you can go land at the poles the sea the mountains or all three at once with a creatively timed spray of shrapnel there s other worlds a big burning thing with no surface that ll tan you for free if you check it out it ll tan you to the bone so that s a bonus there s other worlds red world purple world green world with little worlds around it hidden stuff everywhere all of these places are fit to seed with refuse landers rovers living quarters stations battleships pasteboard furniture lawnmowers spaceplanes robots scooters springboards et cetera ksp is a litterer s dream there s so many places you can leave stuff you have no hope of bringing home and it s worth doing it just to see that stuff sitting there but i ve got to warn you you ve reached tl dr level four so here s a bonus this game has very unexpected side effects you will learn things hoffman transfer periapsis apoapsis how orbit actually works why orbit is halfway to anywhere launch windows free transfer windows free returns if you make the horrifying inadvertent mistake of buying this game for yourself or your child somebody s gonna learn things it s unavoidable real things even newton s spectre haunts this game you will find no escape and he fears no earthly garlic lemmie wrap this up for the tl dr folks who check the bottom summary just get ksp already you aren t really learning anything from my review you probably didn t know already let s be honest with each other here ok you don t want to learn whether or not this game is worth buying you re looking for someone to make the excuse for you you re already gonna get it you just want someone to possibly take the fall for you if you catch heat for doing it and to you good sirs and madams i say yes yes i ll take the blame that fat idiot whackjob from ksp told me to get the game or he said he d cut me they ll believe you you re good so do it hit that buy button thank me later whackjob of ksp i imgur com
