2023 while i do recommend this game to other players i recommend this game with some warnings stellaris is a great game and while it is very complex it does make for a very fun strategy game the galaxy is fun to populate exterminate or ally with even before i bought this game i watched many playthroughs of it by people like lathrix however anyone wishing to buy this game should take a few details into account the first detail is the system requirements the stated system requirements are totally wrong they may have worked when the game released on the lowest settings but it won t work now the game has gone through too many updates changes to optimization and is frankly just a poorly optimized game having tried a test world on a computer with similar specs to the recommended i can say that you will need significantly more if you want to actually play this game the recommended specs will open the game and can in fact run the beginning of the game with around 30 40 fps but it has problems as soon as you encounter more than 5 empires calculating all the interactions running your own planets and especially fleet combat kills the computer and makes the game nigh unplayable and thats without any mods or dlc i would recommend at minimum 16 gb ram and at least a 4 core processor made within the last 5 6 years to run the game smoothly and even that ends up chugging a bit at the end graphics are not as intensive in this game so long as you don t try to observe the ship combat too closely in short you do need a higher end computer to run the game well and if you want to play on a larger map then i would recommend some optimization mods and a really nice computer the second detail to remember is the dlc the dlc implementation is not like most other games paradox has a problem with how they insert them which is that they are there in the base game in stellaris even if you don t own the dlc s ai empires will still use content from those dlc s against you i e even without the nemisis pack ai empires will still be able to send spies and perform espionage while you are unable to do those same things this doesn t apply to all dlc but it is still an issue the final and not necessarily bad thing to take into account is the complexity stellaris is not an easy game to play even on normal difficulty levels especially with recent updates the amount of micromanaging fixing and stabilizing you have to do is ridiculously high if you enjoy that kind of thing then this is definitely the game for you however if you have a problem with major micromanaging and want to be able to play a game with a little more flow i would suggest looking elsewhere maybe look at civ 5 or 6 if you have read this and are reconsidering buying the game remember not all hope is lost even if one of these problems will affect you the modding community for this game is vast and can fix many of the problems i have mentioned so before you give up completely look into the mods for the game see if any of them fix some of the issues i have yet to mod the game myself but i have looked at some of them like the gigastructures mod otherwise i hope your time reading wasn t wasted and have fun gaming if it was wasted heres a tl dr the game is poorly optimized and needs a somewhat chunky pc the dlcs can be used by ai but not by you and kind of screws you over and its gotten overcomplicated to the point of drudgery for certain people fix with mods as needed
