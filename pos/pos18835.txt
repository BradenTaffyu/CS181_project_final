2019 i had to write a review for a game in order to get the new steam badge problem was the nominations were all for 2019 games since i am a poor little fella i don t play new games this only left me with one option the labour of love award and well eu4 deserves it kinda eu4 is a great game and so i have heard its even better with all the dlc problem is however they are darn expensive i ain t gonna pay more than 100 euro s for dlc of a game and thats with 55 discount nevertheless its a great game but i just refuse to buy the dlc so enough about what i don t have now more about what i do have the base game as of writing i almost have 300 hours in this game showing that even just the main game has more than enough content everyone with an interest in history maps or strategy games should definitly try this game out the maps are beautiful the game play unique and it also teaches you quite a lot of historical things anyway i recommend just buying the base game and see if you enjoy that for me the base game is enough sometimes it gets a bit stale and i play some other games for a while but i keep coming back to eu4 and i think so will most people
