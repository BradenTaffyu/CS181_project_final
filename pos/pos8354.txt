2022 the city must survive no but for real i never thought a city management strategy game would made me cry but here we are the dread of the calendar ticking down each day until disaster desperately trying to scrounge together enough food and coal to survive only to have half my population perish all the same while the desperation of my people is reflected perfectly in the soundtrack watching the city i d worked so hard to build freeze over and die clinging on to dear life my favourite part of the game is the sound design the atmosphere of the city which changes based on your actions is represented more than anything through sound your actions are felt more than anything through screaming guards or chanting priests the soundtrack is extraordinary too it s not a game for everybody but if you have the patience to see it through it s absolutely captivating frostpunk is in a strange niche of a genre being a resource management city building game but if you can learn its mechanics its well worth the effort it s a story of fear desperation and the triumph of the human spirit and perseverance in the face of inevitable collapse the city must survive
