if you re a gacha gamer or a first time pmoon player if you think the dark story and world building is your type and you love the music you hear at near the tutorial go play library of ruina or if you re a hardcore management game gamer lobotomy corporation if you like ruina you can come back to limbus and probably miss very little it s a pve game and rarity simply opens up deck options rather than flat upgrades if you don t like ruina or single player strategy games as a whole you can skip limbus company because it will not meet your expectation if you go into it expecting a classic gacha game of any sort it is very free to play friendly btw just that the gameplay and gameloop were not designed to be a classic gacha game style
