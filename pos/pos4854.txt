2017 i felt fallout 4 was an enjoyable game if you didn t look at it as a fallout game and more of a spin off i felt it could have been so much more than it was and it did indeed feel simplified for me the special system was there yes the perk system was there yes i thoroughly enjoyed fallout 4 and i enjoyed the story and the side quests i enjoyed the shooter aspects of it but like all games i feel things could have definitely been better many of the big things i disliked about fallout 4 was as follows 1 no bad guy path i never felt like a bad guy when i tried to play one if anything i felt like someone who was an but agreed to help anyway and sometimes complained about it if anything there wasn t a path for being bad there were only a few paths and all of them were good or neutral alignments 2 voiced pc this was a huge strike for me when bethesda announced fo4 during e3 the moment i saw that they had went with a voice protagonist i immediately thought to myself that there went the replayability of fo4 for me since for me half the fun of playing an rpg with a silent pc is coming up with who they are giving them a personality and a history that was taken when bethesda implemented a voiced protagonist and was replaced with you having a character that s already been thought up personality and history wise and you have to structure your personal story around that that s not fun to me and limits the amount of playthroughs i will do this was a huge part of tes fo s charm for me and i was very disappointed to see it changed 3 no karma system or reputation system this was more of a minor gripe then a relatively large one it made me feel as if there was no detriment to stealing something or shooting someone in the head who was innocent in fo3 and nv i could shoot someone in the head who was innocent and actually feel bad because there was a consequence to my character s alignment in fo4 i felt none of that at all i could shoot someone in the head or steal their stuff and forget about it five minutes later the only real consequence was that other npcs may attack you if they figured it out or saw you and were easily dispatched regardless depending on the difficulty 4 the settlement building system this is a personal one for me as i know a lot of people enjoyed this aspect i felt that way too much emphasis was put on building settlements so much so that i felt it was half the game i think it would ve been a lot better if the building was scaled back and that work and creativity was focused on making more quests or more weapons 5 little to no choice briefly talked about in my first point but i m expound upon it here along with the very mass effect feel to the dialog system there weren t any points in the game where your no s actually meant no in fo4 all your dialog choices when someone asked you to do something consisted of straightforward yes sarcastic yes rude yes and yes but not right now you were forced to do things regardless of how you answered and they always lead down the good neutral guy path and this felt really forced the only time you could do anything remotely bad was in nuka world and that dlc felt extremely forced in my experience 6 dlc another huge one for me if i remember correctly we were being promised that we would received more dlc than originally intended and coming off of fo3 s five story based dlc fo nv s four storyline based dlcs and finally skyrim s two big dlcs and a lame home building one i was throughly disappointed to receive two and a half storyline based dlcs and several smaller worthless building dlcs if anything i don t feel the season pass was worth it at all especially with only one of the dlcs being even remotely worth spending your hard earned bones on i definitely felt cheated by bethesda on this side of the game where they effectively turned fallout 4 into minecraft fallout edition with 4k texture mods and prefabricated buildings 7 legendary weapons this one i m a bit conflicted on since i don t use them legendary weapons was a silly thing to do in my opinion making your weapons feel as if they re enchanted and come from a futuristic version of skyrim where they use firearms in place of bows and crossbows i feel they could have put this hard work and focus into creating more weapons 8 no skills i felt this was not realistic how could you expect a stay at home mom to know how to efficiently work military grade equipment or to sneak around without being heard or seen or an infantryman to work on and maintain power armor or create chems like a professional chemist now since i effectively about everything i disliked i think it s a good idea to add things i did enjoy in fallout 4 1 the new shooting aspects definitely an improvement over fo3 and fo nv s shooting aspects this made combat more enjoyable for me 2 the world fallout 4 s world was fantastic i really enjoyed going though boston and seeing all the historical landmarks and how they look after surviving a nuclear war i definitely got a sense of danger sneaking and running around boston and it s suburbs with my rifle exploring and picking through ruins was definitely a high point of the game 3 the quests putting aside the lack of choice in most i still had fun running around doing people s bidding most of the time i did feel emotionally invested in each and especially in far harbor where i was conflicted on who i should side with the main story was great in my opinion and the ending to it definitely hit me in the feels 4 the weapon crafting system this was a load of fun and actually gave you the feeling that your weapons were actually worth something and definitely gave it a realistic feeling of maintaining and improving your weapons i was more likely to scrap my weapons and use them for parts rather than selling them to a merchant really gave caps that last resort feel and forced me to go out and scavenge for parts and materials to build that mod i needed 5 atmosphere the gave did feel like a fallout game and it definitely gave off that nuclear wasteland feeling especially in the glowing sea i lived in constant fear of running into a deathclaw and the new feral ghoul models did indeed startle me at times especially when you enter a dark building and you hear one run and lunge for your throat with a furious scream far harbor was incredibly spooky once i got immersed and i feel this was a strong point of the game 6 characters i thoroughly enjoyed the cast of followers quest givers and minor npcs that you could stop and talk to they all felt like they were real people to me with real lives and hobbies piper nick deacon and codsworth were a few of my favorites 7 power armor i thought they nailed what power armor was a walking tank i liked how they were essentially vehicles in fo4 and not armor you and put on and take off in your pipboy 8 new models these were well done in my opinion and many of them looked great all in all i do feel that fallout 4 was dumbed down and bethesda did make mistakes in making it but i also feel that they are human and it is impossible to be perfect and impossible to please everyone there s always going to be people who dislike something and that s just a fact of life fallout 4 was an enjoyable game for what it was but i sincerely hope they or obsidian hopefully does a much better job next time and put many more of the rpg aspects back if they had only kept the fo nv rpg formula and made fo4 that way i believe it would have been a much more complex game 7 10
