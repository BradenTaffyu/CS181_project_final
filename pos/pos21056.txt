2017 early access review awesome game the game is 20 usd which is a good price to me i ve played this game since early access and now in 2 months it will leave early access whenever you start it s clear right away what you need to do no difficult hard to understand tutorials but rather easy understandable ones you understand in few minutes this game got me addicted i play every day several times it s not one of those games that s really difficult slime rancher is a great game to enjoy hours of fun while relaxing the music is great while you play and the overall gameplay plus graphics are neat the new update glass desert gave a whole new dimension to the game they let you interact with the area through oases and i think this is a really new great update to the game pro s cute graphics and nice grapbics hours of fun to play content is still being added developers actually listen to their players relaxation game many things to do the new recent update glass desert made the game way more fun con s it can get boring after awhile but if you put new goals for yourself it ll be fine it s too easy to survive tarr s and ferals don t do that much damage and you easily can escape both i d like to see more danger in the future so it s somewhat more challenging but still relaxing after unlocking everything it can be easy to make money but this shouldn t stop you from playing this awesome game would like to see more slimes than we already do now we ve a list of slimes right now but more would be great afterall i say this game is worth the 20 usd no matter which con because the pro s add up more than anything in my opinion the game is relaxing fun the developers are great and i m sure there s a lot of great hours to be put into this game i ll continue playing this for a long time
