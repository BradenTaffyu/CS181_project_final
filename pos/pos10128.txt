2016 early access review ben the quiet loner who mines and occasionally sculpts had a mental break down and attempted to bludgen himself to death because his pet husky asphalt died in an angry turtle attack this is rimworld sasquach the pascifist nurse who can build a room like nobody s business got heat stroke and went a little nuts shedding her clothes in the living room and running for the hills in the middle of a heat wave this is rimworld inga likes to beat people with a stick this is rimworld rimworld is a strategy game masked as a top down colony sim with a unique aesthetic and an emergent complex ai system yes you have to build and manage a base like most sim sandbox games however in rimworld there are complex factors that are super important to the success of your colony stories are generated by simulating psychology ecology gunplay melee combat climate biomes diplomacy interpersonal relationships art medicine trade and more key word and more your sims can go insane and it will completely ruin your entire colony when bert decides to strip and run out into the tundra and pace around in an unresponsive daze factions can attack but when taken prisoner can potentially become part of your colony but only if you have someone with social skills that can chat em up this is what makes rimworld so fun and addictive i have started over about 6 times sometimes because of updates but also because i am super curious about how colonies will end up in tundras or jungles or if i choose 3 men or 3 women or 5 tribal members or 1 rich loner no two stories are ever alike it s hard to tell that this is even an early access game it could be balanced a bit more especially in cassandra classic mode however it is very enjoyable i would highly recommend this game if you love simulation strategy humor survival aspects and if you enjoy replayability 10 10 i m totally obsessed and can t stop playing it s summer and i m always inside playing this game dammit look what you ve done to me ludeon studios
