2023 early access review i enjoyed romping through this new version of the island more than i thought i would i think overall they did a pretty good job with this remake here are my thoughts my specs cpu i9 12900kram 32 gb 4800 mhzgpu 6800xtmonitor 32 165 hz 1440pthe great the view from ten thousand feet gives me the same ole island that i ve been playing on for nearly 10 years it has the same basic layout the obelisks are right where they should be all the biomes are the same all the rivers and ponds are the same general shape and where they should be the similarities pretty much stop there the ue5 revamp visually is in the up close details of the island the topography is vastly different once you get up close and is much much more detailed it s hard to even recognize where i am sometimes the changes to the details are too many to list here and it s definitely the standout change in the revamp well done wc the good there at least a dozen quality of life changes to the game that i can think of but i ll only name a few tames can now be tracked on the map as well as the ui from the moment you start taming so you ll never again lose track of where your tames are while taming or if a tame on autofollow gets lost the ui tracker also has a neat torpidity taming progress bar shoulder tames can now have their inventories accessed via a command wheel without having to throw them on the ground nice player structures also got an overhaul walls are now 30 taller this is just an eyeball guess they also simplified structures by consolidating similar pieces for example you can no longer build doorways or windows you build a wall then change the wall to be a doorway or have a window they also improved the way structures are placed and snap together loot crates have finally had their drops revamped they are now much more worth going for even at low levels the meh it s still the same game as ark survival evolved ase level up tame tames grind gear beat bosses i d assume pvp is the same too i don t pvp i can t call this really good or bad it s just the same ole same ole leaves me feeling kinda meh about it once the veneer of ue5 wears off i m unsure if the quality of life changes will be enough to keep me interested in a game i ve ultimately already finished the bad bugs this is a rather minor dig as all games have them on release but i feel it needs to be mentioned i ve had to use admin cheats twice to get my argy unstuck from some of the new geometry it seems to happen to even wild argy as i ve seen multiple wild argy stuck in the terrain i ve also had a handful of freezes and crashes to desktop there also seems to be fewer dinos on the island though this just might be my experience i ve only seen 2 doedicurus over an entire weekend i m not sure all wild dinos were spread out properly the ugly not much to put here really the game has had some optimization problems on launch obviously this issue impacts people differently depending on system specs there were multiple optimization patches over launch weekend that seemed to help out a lot one problem i ve had with my last gen system is i can t seem to get amd freesync to work properly so i have to deal with some occasional ugly screen tearing overall i d recommend the game to old and new players as long as you have a system that can keep up with ue5 on medium settings
