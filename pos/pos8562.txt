2019 amazing game my favourite at the moment and it has been for the last 6 months i ve been playing it i m not a hunter myself and i m not really into hunting but i just thought i d give it a try to see how i got on with it i ve gotta say i don t regret buying this game one bit the graphics are amazing the gameplay is awesome you make a character can play missions in single player which is a good way to lvl up and open up your map and discover new zones and find out where certain animals eat drink and rest you have a rifle shotgun handgun and archery score and you improve this by getting kills and harvesting ur kill with that particular weapon which unlocks different ammo arrows bolts scopes etc skill and perk tree which u can put points into every time u gain a level making u more stealthy less visable less aim wobble etc multiplayer mode u can play with friends trophy lodge so u can mount ur diamond kills yes the game has paid dlc s but they are cheap and well worth it i dont mind supporting the devs on this one because they bring in very regular updates new maps new animals new weapons new features very regurlarly the games about 2 years old but still feels very young due to the new content coming in all the time also the devs listen to the fans playersit does have its bugs but theyre constantly working on fixing these but theyre not game breaking in the slightest if you re thinking of buying this game i would say get it and give it time u need patience its not a run around kill everything game its a hunting simulator so treat it like your out for a hunt and you will enjoy it
