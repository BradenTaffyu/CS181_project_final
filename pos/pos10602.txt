2019 i m a working professional with wife kids mortgage and a preference for strategy games with single player campaigns that can be played over months this review is written for folks in similar situations summary hoi4 is a tactically deep and enjoyable wwii real time simulator and is recommended if long term planning unit customization and managing intense global wars sound appealing to you compared to other recent paradox map staring games eu4 ck2 stellaris hoi4 is very light on diplomacy and has no exploration characters economy or ethical dilemmas to wrestle with instead this game is completely focused on mobilizing your industrial base for war and then operational level tactics once war breaks out this focus and the familiar wwii setting makes hoi4 more accessible to new players that like fast micro intense war games coh2 and might be skeptical of the slower peace war peace war pacing of eu4 that said hoi4 still has a steep learning curve and new players will need to spend some time on the wiki or youtube to understand the best strategies for nation building and designing effective combat units you can find several detailed reddit posts with hundreds of useful tips on unit design combat national strategies multiplayer min max etc any question you can think of has likely been asked before and if not then post it and one of the forum super nerds will get to it steam s 2 hour trial period is not enough to learn this game so check out one of quill18 s more recent youtube tutorials if unsure for veteran eu4 ck2 players be aware that hoi4 is not as rich in nation building and role play and that your bag of dirty tricks will easily outwit the feeble diplomacy ai there is no satisfying progression from local to regional to world power and small nations e g hungary have no realistic chance of challenging the major powers e g germany without exploits satisfaction in hoi4 comes from building superior industry logistics and then effective use of combined arms concentration of force and maneuver to crush enemy formations for veteran hoi fans that have resisted buying hoi4 really is the red headed step child among recent clausewitz games and features like a detailed order of battle are very missed however it still looks fantastic has decent quality of life automation and is good for 200 hours of good wwii fun while we wait for imperator rome to get patched a few times gameplay most of your time is spent as commander n chief organizing armies training troops setting up battle plans and assigning commanders based on skill and traits patton rommel montgomery zhukov and other famous names make appearances and have a tangible impact on the armies they lead combat between units has dozens of modifiers relating to width terrain commander skill flanking air support and many more and is a complex subject for new players units equipment stockpiles are fed by your military factories and are used to reinforce or train new divisions the quantity of equipment needed e g exactly 300 medium tanks is determined by the divisions you create in the division designer an interface that allows specifying the mix of specialized battalions tanks infantry artillery etc that make up a combat division represented by sprites on the campaign map effective division design is the most complicated aspect of hoi4 and min max players will spend a lot of time optimizing and agonizing over the best battalion mix supply logistics in hoi4 is incredibly important for effective combat and units out of supply won t reinforce and receive a nasty penalty to stats and movement any sizable invasions outside of western europe require logistical planning such as building ports or prioritizing the capture of urban areas for supply bases invasion routes actually matter in hoi4 and it s worthwhile to create small light divisions for combat in low supply areas like north africa navy the man the guns dlc added significant content and automation to naval warfare and also more complexity to read up on most importantly naval combat was tweaked in the latest free patch to make decisive naval engagements rare and new fuel constraints have made running a massive and thirsty battle fleet in laps around the pacific impractical there are certain optimal ratios for ship types within a fleet and these are covered in the forums more reading air air superiority from fighters and combat air support from cas requires some re basing management as front lines move around but also confers significant ground combat bonuses naval bombers can sink ships when deployed in force and especially when attacking ships in port air combat is not very sophisticated in hoi4 and future dlc s will hopefully beef up this system to add air chiefs and simulate pilot shortages focus the national focus tree is a structured series of choices that provide buffs change government types give casus belli and push the world towards war in general the national focus tree for a country is tailored towards its historical path and martial strengths for example germany gets buffs to armor research and claims on danzig the us has a strong air force and industry and italy totally sucks at everything the order in which research projects and national foci are chosen is very important for supporting your overall strategy for instance germany may benefit from delaying war with poland to focus on industry buffs or japan may rush torpedo and cruiser research bonuses to have an edge on the usa tips below is a list of tips for new hoi4 players starting up a single player campaign 1 first game start with the italy tutorial to learn the basics conquer ethiopia and then yugoslavia for experience fighting a medium sized enemy with an air force italy rapidly loses fun once the allies start slapping you around 2 second game pick germany for a fun campaign on regular difficulty germany has a very powerful industrial base no overseas colonies to worry about and has the best military leadership the fascist government type makes declaring war easy and hoi4 has been mostly scrubbed of atrocities to ensure you don t feel too evil 3 national focus in 1936 starts your first nf choices should improve industry and research for germany this is the left most side of the tree starting with four year plan unlocking extra research slots is key so prioritize this focus when you see it 4 division design a solid starting infantry division for new players has 10 infantry battalions 20 width with support artillery and engineers armored should be 6 tanks 4 motorized with support artillery engineers and recon big 40 width divisions are technically optimal for combat but aren t necessary for beating the ai and new players will struggle with attrition 5 red menace the ussr is capable of bringing immense manpower and equipment resources to bear pun intended once uncle joe gets them organized if playing as germany don t wait for ivan to kick in your door and instead go on the offensive while they are still weak in 1940 1941 yes you ve heard of this plan before but the right strategy is to attack south and secure the caucasus oil fields before striking north
