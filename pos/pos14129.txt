2023 oxygen not included has long had an overwhelmingly positive review score on steam and it s well deserved few other games have been made and maintained quite so lovingly allow me to add my voice to the chorus when it comes to base building simulation games oni is one of the greatest ever made the game s developers klei entertainment have shown what it is to shepherd a game from early access through an official release and into consistently updated stability i m hopeful that other developers have paid attention let s start with the obvious oni is adorable from the little colonists expressions of delight effort and woe to the kludgy buildings that prolong their survival the game s art assets are both charming and whimsical more than once i ve been unexpectedly caught by a bit of visual delight zooming in to appreciate how a plant moves or gas billows now the slightly less obvious oni is complex though the game has relatively clear and explicit logistics chains the base inhabitants consume oxygen and produce carbon dioxide water can be broken into oxygen and hydrogen etc the particulars of these processes are potentially overwhelming the player may feel clever in discovering how to purify germ filled water those microorganisms die at 76 degrees c so just heat up the water and oh you ve raised your farm s heat enough that you can no longer grow food whoops oni is a game that new players will not win on their first outing they ll likely have fun doing a little building and ordering around their dim charges and eventually something will fall apart perhaps there will be too little food or the game s eponymous situation will come to pass colonists gasping for air isn t pleasant to watch inevitably characters will die and stress will rise and oh how the base will spiral the new player frustrated might want to say goodbye to oni fearing its apparently insurmountable learning curve if that impulse can be set aside replaced by an attitude of ameliorative curiosity the player can then set to diagnosing what went wrong slowly working backwards trouble shooting along the way they ll discover a burst pipe or a hopelessly stuck character who was unable to dig themselves free that awareness is the first step to starting another playthrough to making another effort as samuel beckett puts it try again fail again fail better and those players who d rather speed along their learning can find bundles of tutorials and explainers on youtube the game is well loved well documented and well worth your time the above is in some measure simply prologue there s no way to express the depth of mechanics to discover in oni especially once the player begins building rocket ships yes a large portion of the game is unexpectedly an astronaut training simulator though the space mechanics can be confusing and even alienating though significantly less so with the spaced out dlc i have few gaming memories that match the joy of my first successful round trip spaceflight and even that is barely scratching the surface of what s possible in oni players who want a challenge a crunchy game with significant but ultimately masterable difficulty will find just that in klei s best offering oxygen not included come for the cute characters stay for the de morgan s law and newtonian physics simulation recommended
