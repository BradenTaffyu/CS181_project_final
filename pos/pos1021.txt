2021 early access review i have 14 hours in this game as of the posting of this review i m sure that number is going to rise extensively as an example of how good this game is mistake 1 fighting more than two zombies at once as a new player with nothing as a weapon mistake 2 backing myself into a corner of a house with no where to gomistake 3 not securing a place to stay overnight leading to exhaustion mistake 4 not leading zombies away from where i want to loot leading to starvationmistake 5 thinking i can comfortably survive in a city instead of finding a car and some gas to leave the spawn citymistake 6 just getting merely scratched by a zombie leading to an unrealized sickness and deathmistake 7 leaving my car running while i loot attracting substantially more zombies than i would ve expected preventing me from making a quick escape later i dont want to do numbers anymore dont jump through a window into an unknown building that happens to have two locked doors in a narrow hallway dont go anywhere with zombies chasing you if you dont know for sure theres another exit dont stand near doorways or windows because zombies typically wont be visible until its too late my life it s all one big learning experience
