2018 so this was a really great game i loved it writing was superb imo especially for characters and npcs i loved interacting with all and any npcs i loved that you could talk to them be handsy with them comfort them or be rude to them and voice acting was a it s one thing that usually makes or breaks characters for me and boi did it make even just a few lines of dialogue well written and voiced made me think wow what an interesting characters wow what a creep etc absolutely loved all the companions and i loved how different they were fane is my fave he had such an amazing character growth and his romance was soo sooooo beautiful i died his eyes look like the source and in the divine ending he says my god my darling is there a difference clutches chest and dies beast was so cute and adorable and funny and just good like a real pal no party is truly complete without a dwarf ifan was a literal lonewolf lol and he was flawed and real beacuse of it i have to play another game to fully see sebille lohse and red prince will update this section after i do environment was good and it felt alive people walking around having convos like a real bustling world there was a lot to explore many different and interesting areas all unique and tailored around the enounters there which leads me to the combat aspect that i thought was rly cool it is that each combat encounter was more or less unique and i loved figuring out ways how to deal with them you could never rly know what the next combat enounter will bring and the combat mechanics all the combos and nades and arrows and spells so many things and so much variety however i do think hammering away at phys and magic armors before you can apply most effects was kinda meh i dunno if saving throw checks would be better but eh you can mess around and even cheese your way out of situations things will always explode and cover everything in fire sometimes the big baddie will slip on ice 3 turns in a row sometimes you will do things no other rpg would allow you sometimes you will kite a troll 6 levels above you through an entire forest you set on fire sometimes you will forget your wand is poison and end up healing enemies sometimes you ll forget your rogue is undead and kill him with healing sometimes you will soul link and and bedroll will kill your rogue sometimes your warrior will accidentally all in your rogue my rogue suffered a lot race designs i m glad devs weren t holding back on making elves thin long limbed wiry flesh eating flower sniffers and lizards were literal lizards thanks for not giving female lizards titties they are reptiles after all and undeads undeads were good special mention for devs who listen to the community and fix the problems swiftly at least while i played bugs i encountered were dealt with fast so the only thing i didn t like and that just fell flat for me was the endings bcz nothing was solved nothing was concluded like at all i m all for some bad things some good things and some clues about possible future problems ends but first you have to solve the old problems and they didn t you have to have some closure you have to have some hope that things will be alright it didn t make any sense no matter which ending you pick the god king and the void still threatens even if you purge the source and seal the veil it s implied the black ring is planning something again possibly rip the veil again so what s the point deal with the doctor also makes no sense he offers you a deal and doesn t even tell you what it will rly do what do you gain what why why on earth would your character accept a deal with a demon when not knowing anything tho the idea of light and black divine was interesting bcz it s a balance but then it also fell flat in the end bcz everything is bad everything you do is bad contrary to the precedent set by got and witcher in media not everything needs to be bad and grimdark mcedgy good endings are not boring they are good and rewarding after the journey your character goes through thanks for coming to my tedtalk
