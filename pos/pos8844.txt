2023 tl dr amazing game basically a more complex civilization in space but a bit too complex and overwhelming unless you invest a lot of time i really like this game and recommend it but it s at the limit of complexity for what i can handle in a game and i ve had to put it down because there are too many unexplained mechanics this game is kind of civilization in space but with way more complexity than civilization most people will go the conquest route in their first playthrough but there are ample options for winning through any combination of diplomacy economics trade science dev etc also it was clearly made by developers who love sci fi so there are lots of easter eggs and concepts from many sci fi books tv shows etc don t be intimidated by the dlc and in fact i recommend not getting them until you start playing the game to get an idea of what elements you enjoy the base game is good and complete and the dlc just add more options and complexity as i mentioned the game is complex enough as is and has plenty of options so the dlc is really a way to keep the game fresh for existing players rather than a way to unlock needed features also i recommend watching any of a number of howtoplay youtube tutorials maxthecatfish has a good series about stellaris before playing to understand how things work because most of the mechanics are not explained in game this game is a major time sink so it s probably worth watching a couple of hours of beginner s guides and tutorials before playing to save yourself even more time wasted with mistakes in game
