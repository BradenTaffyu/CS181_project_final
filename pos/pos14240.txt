2021 early access review factorio and satisfactory got married and gave birth to dyson sphere program the child was such a prodigy that it got the best of both parents and even improved their genes or obtained new traits for an early access game released just less than a month ago it already feels like it s 90 complete the devs are very quick to implement small bug fixes or patches to incorporate player feedback i love how base building and automation can span multiple star systems adding more depth and dimension most items you get towards the middle of factorio you can get relatively early in dsp filters for sorters multiple types of splitters which makes early game not as tough the most satisfying part is shooting dyson swarms or launching the dyson sphere components towards your star and marvel at the beauty of the sight i completed the end goal this afternoon and might start a new game after a while to break the monotony to the devs
