2015 good game things i like character customizationvoice acting your player talks the open world quite alot of good locations but not enoughgood variety of monstersgood background musicbetter combat more fun and alot easier looting can loot on the go you don t have to stop and open a menu things i dont like story starts of great then gets worse then worse and i hated the ending not enough weapons or armor just mostly the same with different stats and bonus stats not enough rpg elements it feels like you are playing a story instead of creating one not enough items when builing settlements not enough freedom when creating your settlement either companions its good they talk and get into some cutscenes in the story and have their own background story but once they re your companion you can t build any sort of relationship with them except when the game tells you that you have reached 100 likeability with your companion and you get a special perk woohoo not enough quests for a game that took this long 13 main story quests i ve done everything on the game all thats left is to get all achievments it is like torture playing this game any longer i have just gotten so bored hopefully they bring out some really good dlc in the futurebuy if you expect a fun short game for an rpg don t buy if you expect it to be an endless amount fun like skyrim
