2020 this is not a masterpiece like fallout 3 and new vegas but it is great in its own manner the settlement gameplay is a lot of mess but when you get the tricks it turns into another game the main quest is a bit cliche some characters most of them are full of personality but the storyline is dull what compensates in this game is the world full of details the dlcs also make this great the settlement mechanic is great if you are a fallout fan like me you will find this game weird at the beginning not great as the previous ones but when you move on in the world you will find this fantastic definitely worth a try
