2023 our small colony was flourishing until bacon joined see nobody was allowed in the kitchen except umami and cookie they had things under wraps but bacon pigskin rancher by trade joined right as our colony was descended upon by 47 man eating persian cats and we must have forgotten to tell him the rules he snuck in one morning with the well meaning intention of making the other colonists breakfast as a thanks for saving his life it was a sweet gesture nobody though anything of it until it came to light that bacon despite their name had no idea how to cook what appeared to be some innocent and well intentioned pancakes began the downwards spiral to our demise stricken with debilitating food poisoning we were caught out of position by an invasion bugs swarming teeming up from under our feet right in the middle of our cursed dining room before we could react they d bored through three sets of walls to our nursery the kids didn t stand a chance only 2 year old melons survived and only just barely we thought that was the extent of our misfortunes but delirious with food poisoning still exhausted and wracked with grief one of the despondent mothers snapped attempting to take a knife to melons neck umami a frail old man attempted to intervene but her rage was his end and it was his head she claimed in the end umami a friend of everybody had been a pillar of the colony since day one he d fallen from the stars and survived the other founders he d been a face everybody had known everybody turned to the gentle elderly leader of our colony since anybody could remember and now he was dead you could say that hope died with umami with the kindly old elder slain with our future generation culled before they even understood the world and with one of the sacred matrons rotting in prison it was a slow heart rending spiral the wise left the determined stayed to be bent and broken attempting to carry the colony and so when the raiders from the north arrived you could argue that we were already dead our individual hearts were pumping blood through our individual bodies but the heart of the colony had stopped long before welcome to the rim good luck
