2021 slay the spire is a masterclass in video game combat design it is a deck builder but its balance principles apply to many genres the interactions of health damage shields energy and upgrade cycles are nearly universal game design elements nearly every game has them but very few games understand them like these designers do they have distilled the core components down into bite sized packages and your job is to arrange the parts to try and break the game balance this allows you to start out in perfectly balanced combat and then design your own way to a deck that feels completely overpowered and broken but it isn t that broken deck you built was all part of the designer s plan they were there before you they expected you to break the game they wanted you to do it and then they repeatedly laugh and point out that you haven t broken it enough you beat the game and then find out you haven t beaten the game then you finally beat the real game and find out you haven t beat the game this recurs all the while having a blast and feeling like an op god deck builder then finally eventually you find out that you ve been played the whole time and the real game was the lessons you learned along the way 10 10 will lose the game again and again i am a better player and designer for having played this game
