2021 as someone who got hooked on inital d and then wanted an outlet to do touge racing this is definitely the game for me in my 150 h of playing this as of writing i ve mainly spent it drifting and racing down mountains with my g902 wheel i have a simple simrig going and given these parameters id recommend this game fully i d say to get your full enjoyment out this game you definitely need a wheel at least a g902 or equivalent with ffb and the modloader called content manager its really easy to set up with a google search that all being said this game and initial d are both equally responsible for making me care about cars when i never had before its a new hobby i gained from this game and i feel like you either like it or you wont setting hotlaps are fun on their own but find your niche in the game and absolutely join online lobbies this game is an amazing experience and i expect this will be one of the few games at the top of my most played list on steam 9 10
