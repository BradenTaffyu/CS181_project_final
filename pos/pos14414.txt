2022 early access review like most games in this genre it lives in the shadow of factorio dsp doesn t shy away from this in fact it follows the factorio formula pretty relentlessly your miner structure mines ore you belt the ore to a smelter to make iron you belt the iron to make cogs in a factory motors parts on an on 3 tiers of belt 3 tiers of inserter oil has a second output to balance i wonder about copyright is this plagiarism or is the formula just good when first released in early access it felt like a weak imitation like playing the first hour of factorio with slightly upgraded graphics i played for a few days then gave up lack of basic features like blueprints needing user made mods to fix ui etc i should have read the early access warning mindustry was a better game if you wanted factorio but something slightly different satisfactory if you wanted the full 3d immersive experience or different rimworld oni factory town etc i could not recommend the game at this early access stage a few patches and a year or so later i returned now the core factorio mechanics seem a lot better dialled in i have to say at the point that i can see my own hypocrisy i complain about missing features that are in other building games like holding shift click to chain build at the same time i criticise the game for copying other games the game also seems to have embraced popular user made mods in many cases as far as i can see they simply added the mod to the base game finally the developers have started to branch out with small changes that add new things and really help the game find it s own identity the first little change is applying lube spray coating to things instead of productivity modules if you lube up your cogs before they enter the factory you can get increase production or speed this added complexity adds interesting choices direct inserting saving space or put things back on a belt for lube and added efficiency i lubed everything next you can now stack items on the same belt at the same time this means 4 times as many production facility s on the same belt and a requirement to manage the single stack output fighting the reasonably large and bulky belt stackers all the way along your builds in order to squeeze out every last bit of belt space is rather entertaining and feels much better than exploiting the belt mechanics to build in ways the game did not intend goodbye glitch vertical belt it also a pretty large shift away from factorio the mech builder feels like a bit of a gimmick and is clearly half finished with a section that says these stats do nothing yet but it shows a nice pattern of the developers attempting new things alot of the game feels like its attempting to find it s own way to the same mechanics in factorio that game cast a long shadow eg starports function like train hubs the mech functions like power armour the trick seems to be hiding these mechanics so they feel like a new feature additions like blueprints and late game miners makes progression much faster and less tedious hides the fact your doing the same things 100 times but the game also gives you late game activities to spend these newfound resources and spare time on since initial release the game has improved in hundreds of little ways that combine to make a much more enjoyable experience flying and warping between planets for silicon titanium and rare ezmode resources feels much more natural i sent a solid week building 7 layers of crap around two suns often just spending a few seconds to gaze up at the impressive looking dyson sphere construction small issues still exist the balance feels really off in many ways eg research for me completes incredibly fast eg i unlock red science spend 2 hours building a factory to produce it then seem to complete every single red science research in the game in under 60 seconds same for yellow purple etc i feel like research costs should be increased 50x i guess this is an issue with lube proliferate spray increasing research 40 stacking research labs and the game being balanced around 1 lab i also found the rare minerals to be really imbalanced perhaps this is intentional rewarding players for exploration with free late game resources like mountains of graphene nanotubes or sulphuric acid but it feels like you can remove a good 40 of your factory building by simply researching warp though perhaps this is the point forcing the player to build across multiple systems encourages logistics and so on it just feels very cheap lube on fuel used in your suit is almost required its bonus is too strong compression towards the poles can be very frustrating making tight builds only functional on the equator being constantly told f u you crossed an equatorial line because some tiny thing stuck out was quite annoying i came very close to downloading a mod to fix blueprints perhaps they will implement this mod in the next patch oh and vertical belt belt exploits twisting still exists the game is still in early access isn t every game on steam these days so i look forward to new patches additions and tweaks and hope they manage to pull further away from the basic factorio formula i would recommend this game in its current state 0 9 x for anyone interested in factory builder games
