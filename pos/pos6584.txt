2018 really don t know what is it with this game i don t play simulators and don t like driving games but something about how peaceful everything feels makes play this game at night like i can be driving and lose myself in my own thoughts i ve been playing for a while and have discovered about 20 of the maps i own scs keeps releasing maps for this game after 6 years and will probably continue doing so which i will continue buying and playing the game also has lots and lots of mods people that continue updating their mods after all this time are heroes you can improve the graphics ambience sounds trucks physics you name it not that is necessary but it s a big plus update still loving this game
