2022 fallout new vegas is that game dark souls fans are playing when they aren t playing dark souls and that is a very specific group of people i m calling out you play as the courier a delivery feller that got abducted by the khans and some guy in a nice suit they take your package and then shoot you and leave you in a shallow grave but a robot guy saves you and points you towards the city of new vegas which is just normal vegas but worse now on a quest for revenge profit or maybe just answers you set off to find the man who tried to murder you and also whatever he took from you in the process they say that if you seek revenge then be sure to dig two graves that s stupid i m going to be killing a whole lot more than two people developed by obsidian and published by the todd new vegas is a spin off of the main fallout series because it doesn t have a number but has more to do with fallout 1 and 2 than it does 3 or 4 or tactics i guess i liked tactics now set in nevada rather than california you are thrust into a war between the new california republic and caesar s legion two super powers with like actual armies and they re both moral heads depending on who you ask with the ncr being a bureaucratic hell hole held together with string and spit and the other literally having slaves and crucifying people on the side of roads look trust me on this one if you re a fan of the original fallout games then you ll see some familiar faces still booling around the west coast the khans are still bullet magnets for instance and the brotherhood of steel is still being the fun space marine guys living underground only like in a really bad position gameplay is kind of like an upgrade to the fallout 3 formula you still have vats as well as real time combat damage is based mostly on your character stats mixed with the stats of whatever you re smashing the other idiot s head in with someone with points in guns is going to do a lot better at quick draw mcgrawing someone than they would be hitting them with a wrench or a crowbar what really sets it apart is just how much more you can do in new vegas such as crafting bullets and modifying your weapons to either give you an edge somehow or doing more damage modifying your guns to fire explosive ammunition is the best way to turn someone into past tense is what i m saying obsidian does a good job at making new vegas feel alive with a variety of quests and factions to do work for the geopolitical landscape of nevada is enough of an interesting setting to keep the game going but in between there you have things such as character drama ambiguous intentions whatever religion the kings are on and general decisions you have to make that will decide the outcome of new vegas for me at least new vegas is a stronger game than 3 mostly because there s just more going on and also it works on my pc without me having to sacrifice a finger so the todd grows an extra inch in height but its not perfect its not me my biggest gripe with games that set themselves in the middle of a warzone is that if there s no real combat going on then is it really a warzone outside of maybe some random encounters the two sides are fairly static unless you get involved from how its explained to me the engine they use just isn t really suited to handle big fights between guys in flak jackets and m16s and dudes in football pads and machetes they made in shop class there are entire areas that have stuff like trenches dug and fortifications built that are just empty this is the same gripe i have with skyrim and the 12 v 12 final battle from fallout 3 the game also really really likes to push you in a particular direction with your choices you have to extremely go out of your way to side with the legion or at least that s how it felt like to me the game constantly talks about how a lot of natives just don t want the ncr to even be there and how homesteaders are just kind of taking over the nevada country side but they re still the good guys of the main story there is a fourth option pick the fourth option be a cool guy also if you don t like the quasi rpg shooting of 3 you re probably not gonna like it here you re either dumping ammo or whaling on a damage sponge with your bludgeon of choice or wasting dudes in one or two shots there really isn t an in between this part is in retrospect and you should ignore my point because its just me being a big baby but the power armor system from fallout 4 is really cool and i don t think you can implement being a big stompy science fiction guy into new vegas in any way luckily the modding scene in new vegas is pretty kick ass from getting those big epic battles going to new weapons combat revamps graphic upgrades fan patches adding cut content or just firing thomas the tank engine from a gun to turn the other guy into paste but uh sometimes if a mod interest you you might want to store it away somewhere recently there has been cases of mods just kind of vanishing from modding websites due to reasons also there s a patch you can get that stops the game from thinking itself to death if your computer is even remotely modern kind of mandatory nowadays new vegas is a good game and very special to a lot of people for some its a comfort game for others its the fallout game they like to fall back to because they either don t like the bethesda games or they weren t there to accidentally set off the volcano by pompeii and don t have that taste for games from the 80s and 90s like i do but what is new vegas to me well i like it i think its neat i put over 100 hours into it which is nothing to some people but that has to be some sign of quality right it has its glitches and crashing issues but you can fix most of it if you want to put the elbow grease in i come back to it from time to time but i m getting to the point that i have to move away from games i m comfortable with and seek out new horizons fallout the one with the cool riot armor gets 8 big iron references out of 10 i went this entire review without mentioning mr house and refuse to go back and fix that that s your fun fact for this review i have a physical copy of this game the sleeve reflects it looks neat join my curator
