2023 just finished hogwarts legacy and it s an excellent game i m a student at hogwartseven if there are flaws hogwarts legacy conquered me i m not a big fan of harry potter i watched all the movies and read a couple of books but i like the universe and i had a ton of fun in hogwarts legacy the main story is quite engaging and the companion ones are also intriguing i love the sebastian story hogwarts legacy combats mechanics are simple but really fun only 26 spells but it was enough and there is a plethora of spells combos visual i put everything to max even ray tracing and hogwarts legacy is fabulous but indeed it requires a monster pc two interesting features in hogwarts legacy are pokemon like there are a lot of creatures to catch up and after feed clean them housing there is big room which increase with story where you can decorate as you wish furniture is available in the open world chests character creation is awesome let s talk about the open world well it s quite generic like ubisoft games but not that bad you have a lot of places to explore destroy poacher camps visiting other villages doing quests etc lot of activities to do between main quests i did almost all the side quests but the collectibles thing inherent in the majority of open worlds quickly bored me for example i only did a few trials of merlin performancelike wo long fallen dynasty and like the other recent releases on pc hogwarts legacy is badly optimized there are few guides around to improve framerate and stability but there are no miracles the reddit thread named pc performance tips this got rid of low fps dips for me and friends can work for you it does for me so you give a try on steam deck i locked to 45 fps the game is quite playable but still suffer from framerate drops hope avalanche devs will work on patches for pc version of hogwarts legacy edit with the last big patch 9 march 2023 the performance is slighty better do i recommend yes hogwarts legacy is a good rpg than will make busy for hours also if you play on pc there are a lot of mods for the game it doesn t seem to be planned at the moment but i hope there will be dlc in the future
