2016 i have written this review to negate some of the unfair reviews that give this game a negative score i do admit the last couple of dlcs have been lackluster mare nostrum and the cossacks specifically however if the dlcs are not giving enough content for their price do not buy it it is your choice if you decided to pay fifteen dollars for a lackluster dlc and the opinon of the dlc should not be the determination for the base game s score there are many excellent expanions released for eu4 that in my opinon would negate any negativity from the last two expansions the base game in itself is a game that i would reccomend playing i have played many hours in vanilla itself the game is a grand strategey with much more depth than games like the civ series you play a nation of your choosing and attempt to do as best as you can with it some nations are easier than other due to this game being based on history france is stronger than a native american nation the game is like a puzzle many hours will be spent figuring out alliances truces aggressive expansion opinon modifiers religion to be able to conquer the world without destroying yourself in the process there are national ideas and events which make many nations unique in their playstyle and there are idea groups which you unlock which give you various bonuses that can further specalize your nation one thing that is amazing about this game is whenever something happens that could ruin my game it is always my fault and it is something that you can learn from and choose to never make the same mistake again the dlc is one thing that is essential to review there are a lot of dlc for this game don t judge the game on the the price of every dlc combined many dlc are just cosmetic and music addition packs there are a few dlcs that are expansions to the game res publica wealth of nations conquest of paradise art of war and common sense which in my opinon are all essential and worth every penny spent on them if you are scared of the hefty base price of these dlc combined don t be scared as they frequently go for sale up to 75 off so you can get all these expansions for less than 10 dollars if you wait for good sales if you wait long enough the recent dlc cossacks and mare nostrum will probably be given huge sales as well i would not reccomend this game who are looking for quick fun this is a game you sit down for hours at a time to plan and fail and then restart the game over and then fail but do a little better then fail fail fail and then you may finally perfect your game and do way better a single playthrough can take around two weeks to get through while it may take a lot of time it is really satisfying when all goes to plan and you acheive your goals i would reccomend this to people who enjoyed civ games but are unsatisfied by the lack of depth or strategey in those games i would reccomend this to people to have enjoyed playing risk in fact i reccomend this to most people i have met tl dra lot of reviews are being unfairly negative about this game to their opinon that the recent two expansions are overpriced for the content they delivir i share this sentiment however this game has a lot of other expansions that are really good that balance this out the vanilla game is in itself really good don t expect a fast game or something that you can just pick up and play i have played around 700 hours and am considered a intermediate player while a bit diffcult to start it is an amazingly satisfying game when your plans come to fruitation 10 10
