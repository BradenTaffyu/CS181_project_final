2021 early access review at some point in my lifetime it is likely that the internal combustion engine and its use in transport will be phased out beam ng will likely remain the most complete simulation of such explosive machines and the deadly carriages of metal or plastic if you re saturn not just a simulation of merely operating them the entire machine and its hazards simulated by the time most pistons are replaced by massive lithium heaps that stop holding a charge after 3 years beamng might still be around possibly still in development i will likely be dumping photosynthesized oils into a soot producer to get a nice 0 60 of 20 seconds and still be just as enthused about the simulated machines in beamng drive then as i was 5 years ago
