2016 dark souls iii is everything you wanted from the first dark souls and leaves out what made you dislike dark souls ii while i will continue playing this game even after completing it i wanted to give you guys a proper review prosenvironment is breath taking and puts the earlier dark souls games to shame in comparison far more interesting enemies than humans in armor including bosses nostalgia is strong with this game and you ll love every reference thrown your way ai improved dramatically so enemies are going to give you a challenge weapon variety is great which also applies to armor armor cannot be upgraded so wear whatever you want fashion souls is back if you love exploring this game will consume you easy to get lost in so many shortcuts secrets illusionary walls you ll always stumble on something new co op is easy to access and hardly any problems with the server character creation offers a ton of options for making your character stand out each weapon has a special ability making each one unique on it s own npcs are really developed and don t stay in one spot they re also very likable too quests are back so you can go back to certain areas and activate new events if you like horror films this game has some nightmare fuel for yah can now get your flask out during a fight without searching through slots hold down on down depad replayability is a solid option for sure you ll most likely have multiple playthroughs enemies don t despawn so you can grind to your heart s content your covenant changes the kind of invader you are sunlight makes you a golden red phantom soul memory is gone so get as many souls as you want for upgrades items four endings to earn each offering a strong impact to the story consheavily influenced by bloodborne s mechanics so most enemies are fast furious enemies don t really have a stamina limit so they can spam their combos for awhile lack of spells hexes miracles and pyromancies they re all cool but not many to be found pvp is sluggish inferior to dark soul 2 s pvp which was fun and balanced certain enemies can t be beaten unless you have certain items or do certain tasks game can feel short if you don t take the time to explore any optional areas until you reach more than half way into the game weapons are hard to upgrade too many ambushes which leaves you less surprised when it happens again most enemies have higher poise than you so you re going to be dodging blocking more often game is more demanding with graphics than dark souls 2 so you might need to turn certain options on low certain areas make the fps drop or lag so be ready for that tends to crash now and again depending on what you re doing covenants are weak and not satisfying to rank up in invasions invading isn t fun because again pvp is sluggish wonky and poorly done npcs can die easily from anything so an enemy can kill them during mid conversation ember is hard to find but luckily helping hosts gives you one per successful mission npc enemies invaders deal more damage have more hp poise than you unfair can lose the chance on getting items armor if particular quests failed greatswords and weapons alike are either weak or op there is no middle ground game rewards you for being aggressive spamming over thinking carefully like previous games luck is useless due to the fact you can grind enemies without them despawning conclusionis dark souls iii worth getting yes it s an excellent game and despite there s a lot of issues i have here and there with it they did an excellent job making this game spectacular npcs are engaging very interesting bosses along with nearly every enemy possess unique designs almost all the weapons are handy in doing something useful co op is very enjoyable to be a part of scenery the setting is absolutely beautiful even in the areas meant to look ugly are appealing to the eye and each build is going to be fun to experiment with granted it s a shame that the game wants you to play it like you re in bloodborne instead and most of the enemies are way to hostile fast for their own good but otherwise this game is a solid 8 5 out of 10 for me worth full price plus we haven t even gotten the dlc yet hope you guys were able to get most out of my review and please feel free to ask me any questions about the game
