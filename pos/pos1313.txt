2021 early access review edit the game now fully supports multiplayer and does it pretty well the game keeps updating and it s very stable waaaay more stable than that other zombie game and mods don t absolutely break the game like in that one also not that mods are really needed because the base game keeps getting content but it s nice that the modding is so easy and way more stable than in other games old with a caveat if you plan on playing with your friends note that only an old version of the game supports it if you want the latest build with all of its features wait until multiplayer is implemented
