2021 this is my review for thehunter call of the wild the goodthis game is a truly relaxing hunting game where you can choose to be a reckless hunter or just like a true hunter this game is immersive and i admire every detail that this game delivered the weapons without dlcs are pretty good but if you have extra money to spare just buy all of the weapon packs reserve in this game are big and give players choice to how they hunt their animal i personally think you should buy the top three reserves such as yukon valley medved taiga and vurhonga savanna those are pretty good and i enjoyed them all perks and skills system in this game is balanced but not perfect there are several options that you can choose depending on your play style and how you wanted to play this game the tracking system is an ok for me because there is some bug regarding the tracking system the a i is not the best but they are enough to give me a feeling of the hunter experience the graphics in this game are stunning i can t help but stop every minute to admire how beautiful this game is i played on ultra and well it runs smoothly in my rtx 3060 the reward systems in this game are fair and rewarding you must know how you kill your target effectively and what weapon or bullet type to choose the story is really nice to spice things up and give some backstory to what happened exactly the badfor 100 hours of experience i encountered so many bugs but aren t that game breaking but still can get really annoying the first bug is when you shoot the for example moose sometimes you don t get the animation of that moose being shot it just runs away but actually you hit it with your bullet s it s not annoying but for a beginner it can be a false indicator and make you think that the moose just runs away the next bug is the weapon while in the first person bug this bug occurred at random moments but this rarely happens now sometimes weapon or your hand disappear but can easily be fixed by pressing h to hand your weapon again there is some rare bug such as a track that doesn t appear after you shot the animal a body of the dead animal that cannot be harvested and an animal hitting you and constantly flying far away from lands the last bugs are just funny ones i and my friends found atv bugs while hitting a bloodhound dog if you hit a bloodhound dog the atv will spin a little bit and more funny bugs with it conclusionshould i buy the hunter yes you should this game is a good way to relieve your stress by playing slowly and admiring every stunning view this game had is the price worth the contents yes especially weapon packs they are really good and you should try them all should i buy full dlcs i think yes if it s on sale because atv bloodhound weapon packs and more reserves are the best to upgrade your experience what s the best dlc so far i think atv bloodhound smoking barrels weapon pack and yukon valley reserve are the best dlc those can help you and upgrade the experience should i buy all of the reserves it depends if you buy a full collection it s a good deal but if you re like me who bought the game first and can t buy a bundle maybe consider buying reserves while on sale this game can make you feel like enough for today but you will keep coming back for more if you have more friends to play with like 6 people then you can hunt and have fun with them or just do silly stuff okay that s all from me happy hunting
