2016 it s hard to say anything more than what s been said thousands of other times but this game is worth your money and it ll certainly take up your time from sandbox mode to cinema where you can watch youtube videos with your friends to prop hunt where you either become a prop or hide from the hunters to stop it slender where you play slender but with others and one person is slenderman to many other modes and maps silly weapons and so forth even at the full price of 9 99 this is a bargain for what you get as everything else is free to download overall some things require half life episodes 1 2 cs source or team fortress 2 to be mounted onto the game but get them on sale and it s still not bad absolutely get this game get some friends and have fun
