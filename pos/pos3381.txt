2016 early access review now if there wasn t a recent steam change you d find a review here sadly steam found out they found my den of corruption the most evil spot on the internet it s called kickstarter a den of evil and villainy where devs pay you money to review your game in my case it s gone horribly wrong though and i paid them 100 instead obviously must be a grave error since kickstarter only deals in illigimate shady deals where devs buy positive reviews as steam so openly states if you watch key based reviews popup cause obviously paying twice what you will pay makes me all the happier if it s not up to snuff or something then again bundle buyers are excluded too just the perfect price point steam s price how convient then again no one will read this anyway removed from score hidden away in reviews you wont read this say hi if you do and think about the pointlessness of this entire review but yeah why actually review a game when no one s going to read this anyway might aswell add something for the few who do say wibble wibble potato trampoline so far i m not dissapointed but i m not really playing it as meant to be doing my best to nitpick everything and notice every little thing that s slightly off and thus not far enough ingame to really form my opinion except this if you loved d os1 there s no reason why you shouldn t love this one either
