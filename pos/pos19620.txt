2014 take fallout 3 expand it add more diversity add more interesting locations triple the amount of factions add a better theme and add more immersion and you have fallout nv obsidian has taken a decent game and made it great really a lot more depth in the world and just overall better of course your on the same engine so some of the same problems exist really though the best way to describe it is it makes the fallout 3 world seem boring score 9 10
