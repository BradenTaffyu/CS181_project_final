2020 fallout 76 is a strange game that seems to actively discourage you from playing too much the game is based heavily on fallout 4 and its systems with all the attendant strengths and weaknesses but played in a shared environment with other people the game is at its best when played with a couple friends but after the story quests are completed there s nothing left to do but gamble for powerful legendary weapons armor and grinding a set of repetitive dailies i had strong concerns that this would be a pvp nightmare but pvp is an extremely rare occurrence in the standard adventure mode in 200 hours of gameplay i ve been killed by players less than 5 times and in each of those times i accidentally incurred some kind of bounty on my head the basic gameplay experience is very much like fallout 4 but shackled by limitations your stash is limited so bethesda game veteran hoarders like me will constantly be fighting storage and weight issues for one thing the low daily caps limit all merchants share a pool of 1400 caps this was likely implemented to reduce cap inflation but it also means after you hit your daily caps limit selling things to merchants your options are lugging around a lot of heavy loot until the next day or scrapping it if you choose to scrap it you ll quickly fill up your stash with all the scrapped junk and then you re left with a bunch of junk you can t really sell because you ve hit your daily caps limit granted if you pay for the exorbitantly priced fallout 1st subscription you get a scrap box that holds an unlimited amount of junk items but for what little the subscription offers i cannot support it at its current price point unless you actively play it every single day similarly once you exchange for your daily 150 legendary scrip any additional legendaries you find become a drag on your inventory that you either sell to a merchant on your c am p store or are just paperweights you haul around until the next day when the scrip limit resets overall 5 10the game has definitely improved from its bumpy launch and the questlines are reasonably enjoyable but a lot of fundamental limitations placed on the game loop make the endgame experience consistently more frustrating than fun
