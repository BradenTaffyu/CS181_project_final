2018 if you enjoyed games such as harvest moon or even rune factory then you will like this game i adored both of these games when i was growing up and this in my opinion feels like the perfect match to go with their themes farming mining ranching monster slaying seducing villagers with mainly cheap items and even a bit of secret to it and it can actually make you obsess over it my boyfriend even thought i was stupid for liking it so much but now he is at about 50 hours or so on his account and is addicted to the monsters and mining finishing his skills before me gameplay pretty smooth and can vary thanks to a mechanic of luck giving reason to go mining or even play games at the saloon for a super difficult game bad luck or even seemingly easy game best luck the fishing is a little bit touch and go at times but is pretty easy compared to the fishing mechanic of feel the snow another game i enjoyed a bit too much soundtrack relaxing pretty much all the time setting you into a relaxed mood the sounds get eery in the mines but still can keep you calmer than a horror game the sounds for rainy days confused me at first but now are obvious clues as to the weather of the day overall pretty great music as it should be for this style of game but better than i expected for the graphics story although it is a big chunk of dialogue and farming almost literally for the items involved with the community center ending there was a lot that i found to be lack luster it wasn t as long as i thought it would be the time i spent on this game itself at current being over 250 hours wasn t to just get the items for the cc completion and the joja completion although that badge didn t come through the after story takes a short time at the point of where i was but also adds a tiny bit of extra backstory on a character you encounter mechanics there are not only easter eggs and exploits in game but also kind of cheeky mechanics in this game it can be somewhat hard to understand first off but with the help of the options menu s disable enable features i e zoom show hit marker etc it can turn into a semi easy game with pretty simple mechanics overall although i had some hiccups with the game i enjoyed and still enjoy all of it even the fact of the title screen having too many easter eggs to even spoil as they blur together thank you dev concernedape and publisher co dev chucklefish for the release of this game it really brought back some nostalgia now comes the real question will you reader be good or bad thank you for reading and taking my review seriously if you read every aspect and hopefully you will enjoy it after you buy it
