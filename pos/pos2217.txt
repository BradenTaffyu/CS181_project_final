it wouldn t be an understatement to say i hated this game at launch but now i enjoy it more than 4 though not more than nv really like the setting really like the gameplay once you get to level 50 it becomes a lot easier and exploration is a little less restrained if you gave up on it at launch like i did i d say give it a second chance
