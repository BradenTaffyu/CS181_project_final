2017 i wanted to put at least minimum 20 hours into this game before i gave it a review i can safely say that this is one of the best rpg games you will ever find it s one of those games that will earn the definition of classic crpg decades later normally i don t play a lot of turn based tactical rpgs in my lifetime because i find the genre not my biggest interest but this game did a fantastic job enticing me into its universe q how does the game run any bugs or crashes or technical issues a in 30 hours of playing i have encounter maybe 1 or 2 bugs but i find them minor for example some quests did not classify as finished when i just got the reward for it i have not experienced a single crash in any of my games and did not run to any framerate issues q do you recommend it or not a absolutely recommend it the game is very well made the developers really poured their heart and soul into this game and it shows it has online local splitscreen coop pvp tactical combat controller support mods great writing so much paths and methods to tackle any quest game master mode and much more i can tell the larian studios had a blast making this and it s thanks to them and the kickstarters backers that help fund this fantastic game overall score 10 10pros fun and challenging tactical combat easy to get into but hard to master interesting and unique characters with the companions having their own origin stories mod support a well implemented coop feature that doesn t feel tacked on beautiful soundtrack definitely more than 100 hours of content very well polished with little to no bugs or crashes and haven t experienced any framerate issues so far game master mode which is a dnd style game which is a interesting way to play the game with friends multiple ways to tackle an objective you have a ton of freedom and choice the graphics look great with some pretty locations so much secrets and this game encourages to carefully look and explore its world neutral the voice acting for the most part is good but some are odd and feels inconsistent when it comes to the audio quality but it does its job the quest journal i find to be a clunky with the map when you have multiple quests active you have multiple markers on the map that just seems messy and confusing although it is not hard to figure out what you are suppose to be doing a few quality of life changes would have been nice like increasing the walking speed outside of combat or having the hotbar not be cluttered whenever you pick up an item like a grenade luckily these two problems can be fixed with a mod cons honestly there is zero cons i can think of for this game other than on higher difficulties the enemies like to use a lot of cheese tactics which can be frustrating to deal with but you can use those same tactics on them too i ll definitely play this game much more and i have still a lot more content to explore and be playing them with my friends whenever i get the chance i highly recommend you get this game i gave it a 10 10 rating not as a this game is perfect in every way the game has a few issues but it s more of a this game is worth every penny of your purchase kind of rating pick this game up for yourself or with 3 other friends you will not regret it
