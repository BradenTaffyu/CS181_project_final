2019 early access review if you re looking for a classic roguelike caves of qud is one of the best there is if you re looking for a straight dungeon crawling experience play dungeon crawl stone soup if you re looking for a totally open simulation play cataclysm dda and if you re looking for an open world adventure play caves of qud in terms of rpg mechanics qud is excellently designed every stat has noticeable benefits there is no dump stat even if you don t need the direct combat effects of something you will still be sacrificing something if you have a poor modifier for a given stat strength effects carry weight ego effects shop prices etc the combat mechanics are unique but still intuitive and satisfying the combat is centered around penetration first the game checks if you hit then it checks if you penetrate the opponents armor attacks can overpenetrate if the penetration roll exceeds the armor value effectively multiplying your damage output and many skills and items apply modifiers to penetration the atmosphere is phenomenal the game borrows from classic literature such as dune and a canticle for leibowitz but adds enough unique elements to make it stand out the setting is post post apocalypse long after some vague end of previous civilization the procedural generation of the world provides prolonged enjoyment while there still is the vague sense of sameness that accompanies many procedurally generated games the sheer whimsy of qud often makes for interesting or amusing situations every creature in qud is split into a faction and there s a vague sort of sentience surrounding them while a wild creature is either a simple enemy or an uninteractable set piece the same creature can appear in a village as an npc it s not unusual to ask dogs tortoises and robots for quests for what is essentially a glorified ascii game the graphics are good the tileset is consistently stylized and fits the tone of the game and more so than most games of its ilk qud makes good use of colored text and visual effects such as rippling or displaced tiles to emphasize things in the game world the music is distinctive and very good even though there is a very limited selection of tracks i always end up playing the first few hours with the music on before listening to other things there are of course a few cons for one the game is not finished it is updated on a weekly basis but the main quest is incomplete and there is regularly new content being added also the combat is not always balanced if you play this game you will eventually run into a situation where you lose a character due to nothing but bad luck such as walking into a gun turret by accident finally it is still a traditional roguelike as i mentioned before caves of qud is a glorified ascii game as much as i love this game it is totally understandable if that s not your style still if you ve never played a real roguelike before and are interested in trying this is a good place to start
