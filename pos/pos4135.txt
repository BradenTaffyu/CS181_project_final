2019 most revisited game i have in my steam library it s nearly a daily staple very difficult and very rewarding at the same time perfect game for either playing on stream sitting in my living room on my laptop or playing while in an airplane this game defined the genre of deck builder in the last couple of years even before it was out of early access there were copy cats deck builders today are described as being like sts each of the 4 including beta right now characters has their own strategies and each has different build types that can win so there are many different ways of playing the game each time you start a new run very worth the time and the money
