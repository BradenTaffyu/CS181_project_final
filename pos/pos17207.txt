2019 it s as close to a lord of the rings total war as one could get without actually being of tolkein origin that s a vibe the game will give you every fantasy archetype you could imagine or have yet to imagine is in this game as an avid total war fan i had enjoyed the original tw warhammer game greatly despite it s smaller map and compared to tw warhammer 2 limited faction selection i have bought almost every dlc and each one is worth a play through pros and cons definitely subject to expectations so to clarify pros and cons as if one were coming from traditional tw rome medieval empire and other earth and historical based titles and were expecting similar gameplay some pros variety if you enjoy variety you will enjoy this variety of unit types uses heroes and the macro turn based economics that is to say the greenskins play nothing like the empire for example one needs to apply a different mindset and method to be successful high fantasy done correctly at times the game reminds me of dota lol blended with total war it can be a very busy game when you re applying strategic methods with normal total war units with powerful heroes that require and warrant constant attention when the battles get really big it can be necessary to play it at 75 speed some people may consider this a con i generally don t really count appearance as a driving factor for gameplay but it is a very beautiful game in it s own right highly detailed as all total war games have been high replay quality just one play through with each faction won t do the game proper justice things are random the faction ai is superior to that of previous tw games in my view unlike medieval 2 your allies won t betray you for no reason the faction interrelations are both honored by the ai and generally very sound challenging in it s own right super busy depthy schools of magic that make each different magic user type useful and deadly in their own way every hero has a use as well and can be deadly if used properly some cons or note worthy differences to other tw games they are not cons to me personally depends on your expectations as pure art of war maxims won t apply here completely the campaign ai is super precise if you make a movement mistake you will pay for it choose your army movements carefully use the ambush stance they actually can be fooled use all of the stances you will need them at some point the con aspect of this is the ai s army movement knows precisely where to place each army often just outside your army s range at times it feels a little too perfect instead of being based on the general s tendencies or personality it can take a little time but you will get the feel for army range and sound means of travel without hamstringing yourself moving too far one way or another or not moving enough sometimes the ai should make mistakes in this aspect but never do unless the ai knows it can win but as mentioned the ai honors ambushes nicely instead of magically knowing if you catch my drift if the enemy ai shouldn t know your army position then it won t unless actually discovered lots and lots of dlc this can definitely be viewed as a con especially for one were just starting out i loved the game immediately so it was tantamount to me throwing my wallet at the screen and yelling fine take it if you have the funds and were like me simply had to have some of the factions the wild elves are absolutely worth it for example as are many others then maybe it isn t so much a con but i can see why people would view it that way similarly in order to play the large scale campaign on the big map you need both tw warhammer 1 and 2 these two are essential just to start playing to real game there are however smaller more specific campaigns as well i didn t mind games aren t made like this generally the developers haven t catered to stupid people like blizzard has diablo 3 isn t really an rpg without character builds for example it s all simpleton gear builds with no brain power required but i can see the other side and why somebody would be a little put off by how much cash just to start and dlc one will need to fully enjoy everything about the game but for me compared to elite il 2 dcs even star citizen and other games i dumped money into this one and elite i ve gotten the most out of i feel so far it s a smash mouth total war that is things don t die easily even the human factions have some very tough units compare it to other titles like rome 2 where people die in droves in this one it s super powered super sized rendered in a way to make it playable and to make it so the human units can stand up to a dragon within reason i love the game have loved almost every single tw game to date i mention these cons as i can appreciate the other side of the coin and why somebody wouldn t like it if they were fans of previous tw games this isn t like other tw games everything is bigger and therefore a single cavalry charge for example will almost never be enough to break a unit or to win a flank this can vary faction to faction but some of the units really are super tough and are power houses in fact it s a game filled with power house heroes and units up to and including dragons giants large monsters of many types and kinds even the humans have a steam tank unit that s quite hard to kill but each unit has a weakness but just because an enemy army has a few giants doesn t guarantee victory a big unit means a big target perfect for cannons or other similar units it s just different scaled up just the other day i defeated a roaming horde army that was a single tree general a giant type with about 12 forest dragons i won because i had the right units to defeat larger enemies and because of the tactics i employed it s high fantasy tw done right the best on the market far and away i highly recommend if you enjoy tw and the genre but be prepared to alter your strategies slow the game down and to try different things
