2018 an insanely good rendition of dwarf fortress i dunno if they used the coding or whatever but it doesn t matter it s fantastic it s an amazing game if you want to build an autonomous survivalist community space town you are controlling colonists from above i prefer to see it as the first colonist is boss but not really you re just advising pros developing a survival community from nothing is simple and rewarding early to mid game is very exciting starting a settlement alone and naked is insanely difficult but brilliant if you can get lucky with a mild winter a few drop pods good harvesting and one lucky extra settler modding and addons expand the game if you want to i did about 200 hours without any mods then got into a few simple fixes that help gameplay such as corner wall mod expanded guns and more challenging raids tonnes of options to finely tune your settlement and workers having your cooks work only from the fridge electric oven work order set to 20metres or similar is something i found out after about 200 hours of play stops the cooks from going out to fetch muffalo milk or corn from miles away etc zoning settlers and animals is something i touched on briefly with home muffalo pet boomas and chicken zones this could be brilliant if you want to avoid fighting and possibly split your community into certain work situations i ended up allowing muffalos and boomas full access to the vegetable stockpile to avoid empty animal stores which i couldn t figure out i couldn t quite get colonists to supply the animals with half of the overall corn or something you can prioritize storage zones but it always leaves one empty i guess a mod could fix this clothing armour and weaponry is so damn exiting to build and get in order some funny stuff happens harvesting both lungs from prisoners was piss funny when i found out a bout that although everyone gets a mood debuff if you do hunters will become a bit tryhard and get pumped by wildlife which is so annoying cause i always invest in 1 solidly skilled hunter i had one guy level 17 animals and level 17 shooting or something silly and he got boned by a pack of big animals too far to save there s a lot of little stories you can witness and create it s really good losing a valued member of the community can be devastating expecially if they re extremely valued like a highly skilled crafter cons after you ve researched everything secured the main entrance launched the ship it s pretty much game over i want to have more reason to explore the world around the main settlement maybe more to do with modding some small problems with work orders not a bug just annoying there is a hidden list of work priorities even if you use the number system can t quite put my finger on this one i guess you have no direct control on what you want them to do against where they want to go security is a bit rofl having only one way in or out of the base is gg setting up a kill box with turrets and you can t ever lose chunks of base early game is exciting because some raids hit harder most enemies don t bother to try hard enough to tunnel or drop in if they do have a few turrets spare and organise troops other i d like to have had more things to research build and manufacture a few more colonist jobs would be fun to explore i d like to be able to invite specialist colonists to join like advertise on the planet for a specific role again i want more to do on the planet the early weapon tech is dead as soon as you loot a few normal pistols and rifles it would have been good to have seen more need to use clubs short bows etc but they re almost pointless as soon as you get guns melee is really risky even if the colonist is a mad skill brawler
