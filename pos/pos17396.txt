2019 short campaign 10 10 multiplayer 3 10 so the game for me is 6 10 if you play campaigns and don t bother with 1v1 pvp then this game is deff worth it long i am more of a mp so i will focus mostly on criticism mainly because ca focused on campaign and did nothing for mp pros amazing optimization lots of innovations in campaign 2 modes so that different communities could hf different unit cards duels look pretty nice characters actually matter beautiful artworkso basically everything in campaign lmaocons mp campaign is still limited by max number of players there are some bugs like campaign map going all white fixed it by loading autosave the balance in romance mode is pretty bad the abilities of some gens are insane like 100 morale global silence so 1 player cannot use any abilities during the battle etc ranked can be played only in romance also when i start searching for ranked battles i can t go back so if i want to play campaign instead i have to alt f4 and start the game again lol records mode is boring because ca didn t add anything to it how i wish they reused avatar system for it still no gen speeches even tho there are some scripted but medieval 2 gen speeches are 10x better kinda chaotic tab in custom battle would have been much better to use the old faction system now ppl will get so confused what to pick with all of these heroes last but not least the insane lagfest when europeans are playing with vs chinese having said that we need to keep in mind that tw games at release date have never been exactly balanced or polished and this is one of their best release to date
