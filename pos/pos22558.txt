2014 hi the first big paragraph is me ranting about fps games if you want to hear about ds skip down a bit how to create a review that doesn t just repeat what everyone else has said 10 000 times before i don t know if i can so instead i wish to share a little version of my journey through video games and use that to explain why i settled on this huge gem and why it s the first game in my library about 420 as of this writing that i paid full retail for i m a gamer no seriously that s what i am i play games i collect games i live games for reference fps first person shooterpvp player vs playerpve player vs environmenti have always liked and preferred fps single player shooters and only much later did i start getting into skill based fps vs perk based fps read cod is not in my games library shucks battlefield bc2 flet like a mistake to me after playing it even for 4 89 i only started playing cs source to shut up some young know it all in my internet cafe next thing i m playing tier matches on cs go with 800 of dlc in my account why it s a tight fast paced tactical game with the only advantage over the other guy being my skill not my special gun i actually can t remember why but i got this urge to start playing some slower paced survival type games i do know i was beginning to tire with the fastest fast paces of pvp and often not knowing or caring about my teammates as i d be in a different match in 4 mins anyway i tried with nether which feels like pve until some base camping 12yo snipes you from 3 blocks away i got tired of getting 8h in and then permadeath to that but all of a sudden i like permadeath you failed start again no really start again perks byebye guns gone here s a kitchen knife go stab some guy with a full kit in the back if it had true pve i might still be there i wanted to give nether a go because other games like dayz etc already had a huge negative reputation and i really don t like zombie themed games except maybe killing floor which is team based pve and they are clones not zombies but they are called zeds hmmm don t even know why i got kf in the first place i think it was because it looked interesting and i actually wanted one of their other games the ball a single player puzzle oriented fps with no shooting but lots of squishy puzzle solving via giant rolling artifact of death so at some point i saw this title and instantly dismissed it as a cheap flash based game that was popular in a similar way to candy crush heh that s what you get for not looking into something properly before forming an opinion wish i had was on sale for half price with a second copy of the game for free i don t think klei will ever do that again for this game this game was suggested in a nether thread i had started about wanting a better pve experience i d put in a list of requests prerequisites that would make it a game i would want to play and someone suggested don t starve to me again i thought no but i saw in one of their threads that they adamantly refused to add multiplayer because they wanted to create the best single player experience possible this had my attention as i saw it as now being a truly pve experience and by this time i was craving it i likely would have got into this game much much sooner if it had ever gone on sale it only had sales in the early days whilst it was still gaining traction now they are planning on making it more expensive when they release the next dlc multiplayer patch so it s pretty well now or never ds is a brutally unforgiving game you are dropped of in the middle of nowhere in a foreign world no idea about anything except that night is coming you will die but you will learn and live to day two then day 4 then 7 then 22 trust me you re gonna die on day 22 the first time but you learn you progress a little bit a little bit more you try this mushroom nope not good but cook it and it is good there are no quick save reloads no retries no mistakes because you will be greeted with the realities of permadeath and a new world generated day 1 the reason that i love it is that it s open ended the goal is to get through until tomorrow and that is always the goal and it never never ends it s often a slower pace than fps and you pick days dedicated to exploring resource gathering or building better defenses you gather you plan but when the stuff hits the fan it s all on and if you get through it it feels like an accomplishment and brings a huge feeling of quiet is that it are they all gone and satisfaction because well it s all you and the odds are stacked against you that right there might just be the reason this game is so great should you buy it is this game for you probably should you wait for it so go on special i wouldn t hold my breath check out some let s plays read some reviews ask an irl in real life friend if you can have a jam you ll want to put 20h aside to start to get a feel for the mechanics of this game anything less wouldn t be a fair assessment that s how deep it is but if you want something challenging rewarding and a game that is designed around long term play you have found it
