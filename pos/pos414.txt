2017 i need a button to double recommend a game there are games that i like and then there are games that i pathologically need other people to play i m not worried whether you ll enjoy it if you have a soul then you will if you don t enjoy it then i ve learned something dark about you stardew valley is amazing it is tremendous it fills me with glee and delight i have built spreadsheets to calculate maximum crop effeciency not because i need to it s so easy to get in to you guys but because i enjoy playing the game even when i am not playing the game the graphics are old school but well done the music is lovely the characters are excellent and engaging the gameplay is fantastic every single part of this game is cleverly thought out wonderfully done and almost all of it by a single individual and he s still adding stuff to it the game is great and keeps getting better do you own it already you should probably buy a copy for a friend this game is a thing they need in their life do you not have it yet why not what s wrong with you do you not like fun do you not wish to feel joy because if so you are depressed and may need professional help i recommend stardew valley for your professional help it may not take the place of a trained psychologist but feeling good about your super awesome virtual farm is a hell of a lot cheaper
