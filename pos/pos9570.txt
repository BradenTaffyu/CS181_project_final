2015 i ve waited a long time with my review because i wanted to see what kinds of addition this game gets over time but well here it is assetto corsa is a very challenging and rewarding game it is one of the few titles that truly deserve to be called a racing simulation in a genre where many games proudly boast the moniker and then severely disappoints in that regard pros a true racing simulation on pc one of the very few titles to come out in recent years good production value you can really see that the devs know what they re doing extremely good physics engine good graphics relatively fast ai it s stupidly easy to use mods there are tons of high quality mods of cars tracks and ui apps readily availablecons 80 of the included tracks are italian 40 of the included cars are lotus seriously there are 7 variations of the lotus evora and 5 6 for the exige who the hell thought this was a good idea some other cars are sorely missed instead no r34 lancer evo rx 7 challenger charger c63 amg slr and no audi s porsche s toyota s ford s e at all ai is extremely taxing on the cpu i have a 4 ghz amd octacore and yet cpu occupancy goes above 95 when i race more than 10 cars causing the game to stutter on my system ai is incapable of actually fighting for positions they may drive quickly but once you have caught them you ll easily overtake and they will never undertake even the slightest try to get the position back the flag pit stop weather day night mechanics are not available yet this means no chance for real competitive gameplay yet total 7 5 10 don t get me wrong it still is one of the best racers i have ever played but i have to admit i most likely only love it so much because it has no competition there are a bunch of things that are wrong with this game that need to be critizised but when you re hunting your ghost on the nordschleife piloting a mod mazda 787b on a cold track you ll forget about all of the flaws you won t notice any flaws and even if you did you wouldn t care in these moments the game deserves a straight 10 10 and it will be worth the asking price all of a sudden recommendation hell yes if you are into non arcade racing and have a capable rig you have no excuse to not buy this
