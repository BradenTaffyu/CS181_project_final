2020 great game got it on sale when it was first released on steam i have only one problem with the game and that it s dlc is crazily inflated ea spared this game in a way because they didn t make the game broken without dlc unlike battlefront 2 the game isn t pay to progress you can obviously tell that ea has been quite greedy when it comes to the cost for dlc as many of them are 30 not on sale but even without the dlc it s very entertaining i wouldn t recommend getting the dlc unless you are playing this game 24 7 or if you have a lot of money burning a hole in your pocket
