2018 tldr highly recommended just for the multiplayer aspectpros fun nice art sense of satisfaction and a hella lot of depth and things to do in the gamecons so far not much things are nicely balanced and bugs are being ironed out so all s good when i was younger i played the hell out of harvest moon and i remember many many secret late nights with a gameboy advance in bed fast forward to a few months ago and i ve read so much about this game about how it was all created by one man seen how the art has progressed and even gave it a shot for awhile but the feeling that this was more work than play was something that made it seem less fun so i put it aside but then multiplayer came out and since then i ve never really looked back in some sense it is still work but when you re playing with another person negotiating what cash should be spent on who gets to design the farm and splitting up jobs i think things have become so much more enjoyable and things feel like an actual achievement that you can celebrate with another person it s been hella fun and i would recommend it to anyone
