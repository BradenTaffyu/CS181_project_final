2019 i m not going to review the game i just wanted to address the reason for the mixed review score in steam for anyone who s wondering this game gets too much flak even nowadays there are two main reasons for that the ai and the dlc policy the ai is not very good although it wasn t that great in civ 5 either they often make subpar choices and they aren t very good at war at all which means you can usually beat them even while being outnumbered 1 to 5 easily as long as you re not playing on the highest two difficulties the dlc policy is also not great when firaxis releases a new civ game it s always barebones and lacking in content and mechanics and then they shower you with expensive dlc to make the experience feel complete now this is awful at the beginning when the game gets originally released but as the title approaches the moment when all of its dlc are released they offer decent discounts you can now for example get the gold edition which includes everything minus the last expansion for just 32 and then you can get gathering storm for around 30 to 40 all in all civ 6 is just like civ 5 in a generalistic way but there s new and different mechanics that make the experience quite different too if you liked civ 5 i d highly recommend getting this one but only when it s discounted
