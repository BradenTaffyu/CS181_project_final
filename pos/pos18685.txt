2014 there is a button in euiv that allows you to change culture in a province it costs diplomatic power based on how deeply rooted the culture is in that province and once it is completed you will have instilled your nation s primary culture in the province the game tells you that the benefits of having your nation s culture in all of your provinces include higher taxes received from your citizens and lower risk of revolts so of course you click the button who wouldn t want that what you may not realize is that by clicking that button you are not introducing the local people to your nation s way of life you are systematically wiping that culture off the map you begin the slaughter of an entire people genocide is literally a click away and you as a leader don t even give it a second thought that is the kind of power you experience firsthand in this game 10 10 would destroy an entire people and their way of life again
