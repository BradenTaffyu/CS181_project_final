2022 if you ve played the first game it s very much the same with a few caveats if not i ll break it down pretty easy as best i can pros dinosaurs the highlight of course this game has more variety of dinosaurs especially when introducing the lagoon dinosaurs and bird cage style dinosaurs they have more animations and behaviors which feels even more natural than the first game you can also change the skin and pattern color of each dinosaur in the genetics section it s so fun to just watch them walk around and interact with one another stores there are more stores and attraction buildings in this game than the 1st and with stores being somewhat customizable now you can change the look and outward appearance of the stores in your park while you don t have infinite selections it does helps making themed areas to your park even easier to make there s also a few decorations you can now add throughout your park such as fountains and flower pots which is a step in the right direction compared to the first game which had none but i still feel it needs more variety story the campaign and story mode seem more in depth in this game than the first one it follows the movie stories a bit more and the characters talking to you frequently actually make it feel like your doing something outside of make big money making park consmanagement you have to manage every working aspect of your park constantly send out excavating teams do research pull dna samples etc etc while this is normal for the game yes i don t quite get why we have to be the ones who send the scientists to their 75 000 break time and if you don t they sabotage your park i want to get paid that much to take a nap p also there s this new system where dinosaurs need to be checked in on constantly for status updates while yes this is a thing in real world zoos i don t think dinosaurs in game need constant check ups that are constantly putting the rangers at risk from territorial dinosaurs i also think that the guests in this game need to tone down their need for everything i hate having to build a restaurant drink shopping stall every 5 feet because they want me to i m here for the dinos not your stupid shopping addiction lol alpha perks this game implements a new system where the alpha of each pack can give perks to the rest of it s kind if you have an alpha that s aggressive the whole packs aggressive regardless of their individual genetics or if you have an alpha that s anti social congrats your whole pack is now too now you can do genetic research to counteract some of these issues but early on they can be a bit annoying social limitations no longer can all the herbivores be thrown in one cage some dinos get along well but hate others it mostly comes down to the armored dinosaurs ex 3 horns won t like other 3 horns stegos or anklyos but like this that and the other herbivore it makes organizing them hard if you don t know who likes hates who i wrote down a list as i went and it helped a lot things i still think this game needslandscape scenery options i love making waterfalls and very natural landscapes in planet zoo and it s something i think this game could use i d also like to be able to select which kind of plants i m putting down in each exhibit outside of food forest it s slim pickings and each exhibit i make feels the same to me wheres the swamps rivers cliffs waterfalls and fog the landscape editor is very limited and i think should take some inspiration from planet zoo which basically lets you build anything also more park decor as i stated earlier i want to build my park not just use stuff from the movies benches lights pathways that can hang over exhibits or tunnels that can go under the lagoons something jwe2 is a great game that passes time at ridiculous speeds i hoped this review helped somebody decide if it was for them or not if you have any questions or feel i missed something please let me know i have a lot of fun with this game despite it s limitations on customability big dinos go rawr what else do you need
