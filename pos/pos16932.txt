2020 i am a long time fan of this game i first started playing when plague inc mobile first came out but just recently moved to plague inc evolved which is definitely superior to the original mobile version this game is amazing and there are no game breaking bugs as in mobile version however for anyone reading this review if you like this concept or you are already a fan of plague inc i must recommend you the plague inc the board game which is in my opinion better then any digital plague inc game
