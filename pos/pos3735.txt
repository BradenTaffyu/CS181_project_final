2020 it has been six long years since the game got successfully funded on kickstarter during this time there was not so much information about the development to the point some even thought this was a scam but here it is and the wait has been truly worth it truly excellent and yet even after beating it it seems that i only scratched the surface if you love earthbound mother undertale deltarune and lisa the painful you will love this game just a little note the disclaimer warning is there for a reason and it can get pretty real sometimes so just take that into reference if you need to take breaks from such situations
