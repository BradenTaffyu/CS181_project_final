2021 early access review with 460 hrs under my belt in this game i can finally give an recomendation for it game is playable fun engaging and moding culture did not even sink their teeth in it properly devs are activly working on bug fixing adding stuff and improving game performance there is still alot of job in it but trust me if you have 100 hrs to sink somewhere this is the right choice as for old m b players aswell for newcomers into the game
