2023 this is a reluctant yes but still a yes this game seeks to ignore the existence of aoe3 and bring aoe2 into the modern era the problem they already released a version of 2 that is receiving a lot of love and new content bringing it into the modern era pretty successfully that renders this one a little well redundant what does it do well the economy growth and transitions to age ups is great sure the increased resources on the map especially in the starting nodes near your base make it a lot easier to turtle and play safely but that isn t an altogether bad thing the biggest change for me was being able to build a second town center in the feudal age i hated it at first thinking it made booming too strong but no it just makes age 2 play an actual option and not an all in what does it do badly there are still major balance issues that haven t been addressed and the devs while engaged with a select section of the community more on that later still seem to miss the mark with quite a few of the balance changes age 2 men at arms that only a few civs have access to are still incredibly hard to deal with rams are still oddly powerful and get some age 4 upgrades that make them racecars self repairing race cars for the rus so what about these select favored community members the streamers 20 or so streamers who get moderate viewership get crazy insider access to dev time and attention while anyone who isn t pulling clicks gets told to get bent case in point these streamers got access to the new dlc several weeks before anyone else why they aren t associated with the company whatsoever they didn t hand it out to the top performers as a reward they gave it to the popular kids so they could get more popular it s okay for what it is and what it is is a more casually accessible age of empires 2 if you have and enjoy 2 you can honestly give this a pass the campaigns are unmemorable short and incredibly easy cheese able the ai in the game is such a joke that they had to introduce harder levels that are just that sub par ai with a resource gathering bonus they don t seem to have any interest in fixing that anytime soon so if you re in it for the singleplayer you re going to get bored very very fast however there s plenty of time for them to fix these issues and hopefully after this dlc they ll double down on fixing the broken things rather than trying to add new things that just break even more things i m cautiously hopefully i ll still buy the dlc even though the favoritism burns and see how things go
