2021 war never changes just over two decades old the role playing series fallout launched its latest installment fallout 76 in those iconic words and while the war itself hasn t changed everything else has the game series has kept me fascinated since the first fallout above all with its imagination and its optimism in the midst of all the horror of nuclear destruction the world was over but still life must go on people and beings having hope for a better life to come while the old fallouts were stories of difficult circumstances aspiration and even great bravery if one wanted the player was able to be spiteful or fair and impartial the stories were scripted of course but their tones and outcomes could be influenced sometimes it felt like being able to help someone or something to make the world a little better place f76 does not reach these feelings for its world is empty and hollow spiritless in some ways the familiar postapocalyptic world is no longer just a personal testing environment even if the map is about four times bigger than fallout 4 and the playground is shared with everyone else in this so there is enough space for all that the pure role playing experience has been turned into a lightweight survival experience but in reality it just has that a heavily trimmed fallout 4 feeling in f76 the core is built entirely around base construction resource gathering and manipulating a situation in the gaming world every shield weapon and plant picked up is a suitable building material there are hundreds of different things to learn and collect so there is definitely no end to doing however the current form of f76 will be a thing of the past in the coming months years as like many other online games it is a service model game that is to be developed and supported over the years however just about everything with updates can t be fixed and one of them is the game s outdated creation engine game engine which is also familiar from the previous works in the series nevertheless bethesda most likely intends to continue using their creation engine with starfield and elder scrolls 6 as well compared to other triple a games today the f76 forcibly looks outdated obsolete of course is relative the unpleasantness of the fallout however works you see and experience the misery and destruction of the game world but so is its bliss indeed most of the playing time is spent fighting which is stiff inaccurate and not overly enjoyable in every way and this cannot be fixed with updates artificial intelligence is on average a little pig ignorant which makes some battles convenient when playing from afar or hiding fortunately not much is punished for dying unless another human player comes along and dusts off the scrap bag that has fallen from you after dying the online version of the beloved rpg series breaks the formula too much in my opinion but i can without doubt recommend fallout 76 to new players interested in it but mostly at a respectable discount price it has no longer the same amount of squander and unpleasantness as in the publishing f76 is arguably in its best shape as it can be right now
