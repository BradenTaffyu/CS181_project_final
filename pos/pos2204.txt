2022 this was my first game on steam that i owned i did weeks of chores and work for my parents about a year after that i became chronically sick and spent days and days in doctor appointments and trips to the hospital i brought my computer with me and this game was my constant companion for one of the most difficult times of my life is it full of bugs and glitches yes does it have problems and lag yes but it will always have a special place in my heart yes sometimes i open it and i smell the cold disinfected scent of a hospital room for whoever actually took the time to read this i highly recommend the game it s not perfect but it captures the childhood like magic of the wasteland and if you re creative can help build entire bases to escape to i m on the steady road to recovery and i opened this up and decided it deserved a good review after all these years thanks for reading and hopefully enjoy the game maybe it ll make you smile on empty days too
