2014 early access review let me start off and say this i hate early access games i tired multiple times to get into this game and hated it at first that being said one night i decided to read a guide and see if maybe i didnt like the game because i didn t understand it after that the game became pretty fun but when i convinced my friends to get the game this game became like crack pros basically adult minecraft in depth building system way more so than minecraft customizable difficultly settings huge map random gen map hard it gives you a reason to keep playing after day 5 fun co op at its current state is very playable already so much and hopefully much more to be added cons graphics are a bit of a turn off do not spawn with friends at start but after you meet up you can set spawn with each other zombies can sound close but be far and vise versa online has many sketchy players needs better anti cheat needs more player customization needs more frequent updates with friends is addicting as fudge to sum up think about it like this did you like minecraft garrys mod its alot like that but harder and more realistic do you like survival games this game can be set to a hard ass difficulty personally i like my games hard do you have friends and like coop games this is definatly one of the better ones are you going to ease up on the game and take it for what it is rather than what its not good you should do that got 25 bucks buy it easily worth it
