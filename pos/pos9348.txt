2021 introductionassetto corsa is a sim racing game a sim racer is a racing game that tries as much as possible to mimic real life physics and immersion as far as driving goes the game was first released through the steam early access system back in late 2013 or early 2014 after seven years we can take a look and see what assetto corsa has achieved pros and cons positive aspects negative aspects detailed yet forgiving gameplay minor issues with fov in chase cam huge modding community great performance even on low end devices multiplayer is more than alive one of the best sims ever made gameplayas mentioned beforehand ac assetto corsa is a hardcore sim racer attempting to offer a very realistic driving experience with a multitude of real life and famous tracks other than race or road cars for starters the title should be played with a force feedback wheel using twhich will give you the entire experience that you would expect tyre deformation oversteer understeer and all of these motorsport intricacies can easily be felt using the ffb wheel feeling the wheel fighting against your input while taking a fast corner is truly a great experience not only for motorsport fans but regular people as well the ai isn t the greatest by today s standards inconsistency is a small issue as sometimes the opponents decide to ram you off the track and other times they will barely put up a fight using a controller is not the end of the world but i would be against it doing so will only give you visual or vibration feedback which just bottlenecks your ability to put up a decent racing pace nonetheless using a gamepad will not destroy your experience as ac is one of the most forgiving and manageable simulations that i have played to this day traction control abs anti lock brakes and stability controls are also available in the settings setup of the vehicles youtube video assetto corsa gameplay views 184 the singleplayer experience is also entertaining you can play career mode which puts you in a specific situation for example you re in a race and you need to set up a hot lap on a full track you will progressively get the feeling that you re getting better as you re migrating from weak front wheel drive cars that like to understeer to powerful rear wheel drive ones that get playful every time you press on the gas pedal the entire career section reminds me of the infamous gran turismo licenses the gran turismo licenses being a very well known part of the series you are being put up against a variety of tasks in order to claim your next license the license could be used to take part for the next race the multiplayer portion of the game consists of the usual server browsing and filtering your preferred tracks and vehicles the game has a rather mature community and rammers aren t as common as in other games the servers are rarely having any type of connection issue and most of them are nicely moderated with solid rules and guides content is a huge aspect of these types of titles ac by default and including all of the dlcs is a rich experience but the modding community is the mvp here you can completely transform the game with new vehicles tracks lighting textures huds and so much more i would recommend getting the content manager for assetto corsa as well technical aspectsassetto corsa uses a custom built game engine graphicsvisually ac isn t impressive at all compared to its gameplay section lighting is rather bland and sometimes even annoying as it blinds you on multiple occasions oversaturation is a common thing with colours in it textures do look sharp and smooth but the general environment leaves a lot to be desired compared to the competitors vehicle interiors are fantastic each car is modeled after its real life counterpart not only visually but also in practice included the hud is clean you can completely customize it to your liking the graphs are minimalistic yet informative at the same time the game offers detailed and well animated real time pitstops a screenshot of assetto corsa by sermike animations in the interior are smooth and each movement the driver does is correctly executed the outer animations are slightly weird driving in the chase camera will probably cause you nausea as the car behaves like a fridge on wheels visually speaking of course you can play around with the fov and angle settings but that is a lot of work for something so simple as i ve said the cockpit view is the camera that everyone should use in a simulation racing game a screenshot of assetto corsa by sermike audio soundtrackengine sounds in assetto corsa aren t the best compared to its competitors most of the sounds are muffled and barely give off any grunt even if it s a race car the game doesn t offer a soundtrack other than the theme song playing whenever you start up the game relaxing and calming instrumentals but that s about it performance amd ryzen 7 3700x 32gb ram nvidia rtx 2070s the game was running with max settings at 1080p resolution while mostly hitting 144fps v sync average framerate 144 1 fps minimum framerate 144 0 fps maximum framerate 144 1 fps issues additional stuffin around 70 hours of sliding in turns i experienced no issues whatsoever everything was working smoothly the only real issues i had were with unofficial mods compatibility with ffb wheels is nearly flawless as well thrustmaster t150 pro worked since day one with some minimal tweaking by me i was able to improve my experience even further fanatec csl dd g29 shifter with a usb adapter worked flawlessly as well direct drive wheels feel even better than the regular belt drive ones xbox one mk2 controller worked well enough after a lot of personal tweaking which should be expected conclusion assetto corsa is the dream of every motorsport fan the mod support this game gets even to this day is easily a major selling point excluding the excellent driving experience and the great multiplayer mode this game offers i can easily recommend it to anyone that likes a good challenge and is a fan of racing overall rating excellentfollow our curator page summit reviews to see more high quality
