2021 one of the few survival games that i ve played that has actually felt challenging although the goal of surviving and eventually reaching space stays the same each asteroid contains different resources plants and animals which keeps new playthroughs feeling unique while giving you a different way to tackle problems the game may seem complex and confusing at first but as long as you have a surface level understanding of physics the game is honestly not that hard and takes more trial and error to see what works and what doesn t this is one of the best games that i have ever played and if you are a fan of colony sims this game is well worth the price
