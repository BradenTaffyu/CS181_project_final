2023 6 hours in the game so far and i m only scratching the surface the open world is pretty large and absolutely beautiful if you are a fan of the harry potter series you will most likely enjoy the game the music and sound effects are very much like the movies and are one more step to making you think you re not in a video game the combat though not the flashiest feels extremely fluid and satisfying side quests are actually fun and meaningful just like in red dead redemption 2 exploration is extremely fun and you are always coming across something new to explore and investigate although the npcs are a bit dull in this game unlike rdr2 i still highly recommend playing it hogwarts a screenshot of hogwarts legacy by alleria a new journey begins a screenshot of hogwarts legacy by alleria hogwarts legacy a screenshot of hogwarts legacy by alleria
