early access review it s factorio in space beats factorio in coolness factor watching the sphere come together over hours just makes your work feel so much more concrete than factorios rocket loses to factorio in depth of late game optimization eg lacks circuit network and control over interplanetary transportation is very limited compared to trains combat is decent already thou by the time writing is still pretty fresh and i think balance will still receive further tweaking quality is good didn t encounter any bugs over the 100 hours my first playthrough took graphics and sound are polished different types planets have plenty of visual variation and both player buildings and enemies have quite readable visual style if you like building lots of conveyor belts it s definite yes
