2019 so what s new this time apart from the chinese setting well first of all diplomacy has been greatly improved province management as well family court spy network and of course new character system soundtrack is top notch all these new and updated features make campaign really very enjoyable and in my opinion one of the best ones of all total war games battles are more or less the same that is if you play in records mode i have no experience with romance mode yet since idea of op heroes doesn t sit well with me naval battles are missing but i hope ca can bring them back in the next expansion thanks to ca especially their campaign designers for not being afraid of making a more deep and complex campaign which has a bit of learning curve even for tw game veterans
