after being disappointed by aoe iii this feels like aoe again if you like aoe ii you will like this it has good improvements like placing infantry on the top of walls and the civilizations are diverse in playstyle i recommend getting the 4k upgrade for the videos the campaigns are nice and i really loved the additional videos after almost each mission explaining different technologies and giving you more insight in the history
