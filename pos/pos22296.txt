2023 you know i initially planned on just finishing this game just once with the ursurper of fire ending aka the best one then move on to elden ring which y know reasonable here i am on my third run as john sekiro after finishing sekiro sharp uchigatana 10 only parry as much as possible i am addicted i haven t even touched elden ring yet please stop me i am too hooked i am not good with analyzing details of games i d rather have fun and experience them so here is the gist of my first time experience with this game fromsoft is world class in terms of worldbuilding and setting the atmosphere even in the gameplay i felt uncertain heading towards the next area afraid that my weapons or stats will not even be feasible but then i just kept on heading onward and man the feeling of barely scraping by and surviving endless counters gets my heart pumped early game dark souls experience are always unmatched in terms of uncertainty and ambiguity for your experience up ahead as i progressed through the game i got more gear armor magic leveling up my character little by little it was maybe baby steps but i was getting more powerful i was improving myself as a player i started to recognize enemy patterns i was able to fully read lothric knights moveset and you know how fast their movesets are lol really overwhelming at first i was stuck at dancer at one point and i kept going back to challenge her every time i upped my weapon stats or soul level i did not give up i knew i was improving because i started to be able to dodge through her attacks and read what she was able to do next it f e l t s o g o o d anywai gud game git it even if it never goes on sale it s still worth it full price fromsoft deserves your hard earned cash
