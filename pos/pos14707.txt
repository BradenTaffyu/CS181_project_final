2017 i seem to be in the minority of reviewers but i actually liked this game better than civ v i really enjoyed the district system it was a fun way to spread your city across the map making elements of your infrastructure more vulnerable to enemy attacks and vice versa the culture update was really great i loved culture being split off from the technology track the new way governments work made that system feel way more useful than civ v this game has its flaws but on the whole i thought it was a good entry into the franchise it tired a lot of innovative stuff unlike beyond earth which was just a civ v skin
