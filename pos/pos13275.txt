2017 i consider ksp a staple of my collection and one of my favourite games of all time one of the first maybe the first games i backed as an early access project before that was even really a thing if you love to build simulate and generally enjoy space then you ll enjoy ksp the building is fantastic and there s a healthy modding community that make it all the better there are things i don t like about it though i think that it could be prettier i think that the ui could be slicker generally it could do with more polish i m ok with the fact that it s a fantasy for want of a better term setting it s probably a better game for it but it won t be for everyone i know i d prefer elite dangerous meets ksp but had that been the ambition it d likely have fallen short maybe ksp 2
