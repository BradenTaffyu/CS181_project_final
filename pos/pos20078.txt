2016 so i wrote a review for this back in 2015 but no one noticed it and it was pretty crap lol anyway i ve logged many hours on this for console and hundreds on here steam and ive come to notice good and bad things about this game firstly i love all fallout games about as much as stalker though i first played fallout this is the second game i played first being fo3 the game has many mods and a massive modding community though the cons are mostly just the fact it lags and sometimes crashes to the desktop or completely freezes my pc thats only happened once though still i love this game and if your reading this and dont have it i d suggest to buy it you wont regret it
