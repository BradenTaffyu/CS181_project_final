2018 early access review this is a genuinely amazing game the ammount of detail in the vehicles is jaw dropping and the physics essentially are what make this game amazing where performance is concerned you don t need the greatest computer in existence but you ll need something decent i managed to run this game on a laptop from 2009 with amd intergrated graphics with 30ish fps the game runs just fine at 1080p with a gtx1060
