2017 early access review tl dr this isn t a mindless timewaster type of game time will need to be put into it understand what you are getting into before playing first off this game is not a sim and you can t approach it like one it s hard like don t starve you will be dying constantly your colonies will fail many many times yes it can be micromanagey but according to the developers that issue should be getting better with each major update if you think it requires micromanaging now you should have seen it before it was released on steam this game will require you to put some time into it learn the mechanics and learn how actions affect the game world and boy do they affect the world everything you do will determine how well your colony is going to turn out the traits of the dupes you accept the locations of buildings when you build the buildings what you build the buildings with what you allow your dupes to eat the temperature of your base what plants you plant and where you plant them even the spawn locations of the biomes around you again the game is hard and that s the point i have found that with each colony that fails i have gotten a little better at understanding the game and can survive a little longer a little easier this isn t a game where you have one group of dudes forever and you happily expand forever your dupes will do stupid things they will die sometimes you will actually have to intentionally let them die you will rage when i first started playing i couldn t get past cycle 30 without everything going to heck in a handbasket but the more you play the more you learn and the better you get understand that if you get this game you will not be playing something mindless and easy if you can t handle delayed gratification then this won t be the game for you
