i can confirm this actually is age of mythology i know right if you buy canned tuna you expect tuna inside the can but in a world of remakes there s always the risk of surprise surstr mming juice flying in your face as soon as you cut through that can thank the gaming gods the latter is not the case when playing age of mythology retold you ll get the same og aom feelings but with better graphics and quality of life improvements playing the campaign gives the feeling of experiencing it for the first time all over again and this is exactly what i was looking for if you like the og aom this remake is a no brainer recommended purchase
