2017 i was always a fan of cabela s hunting games but once i tried this i never touched another cabela s game again i love the detail the atmospheres the sounds the perfectly adjusted difficulty and the ability to play with friends the only thing i would hope to see is a slightly faster progression system i ve played for 105hrs and and only just now gaining the ability to use the range finder binnoculars and top tier rifles i havent really begun to explore the other weapons yet as i ve been focusing on each catagory separately i guess this can prolong the hunt but i would like to see the progression slightly increased wonderful job on the game i keep coming back oh please add turkey pheasant and duck hunts and maybe duck blinds and calls
