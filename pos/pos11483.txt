2020 early access review i m one of those people that doesn t do early access i m cautious and am well aware of scams and crappy releases so you won t find me impatiently doling out money for something then finding out it isn t what i expected nor will you find me bunging money on the promise of what a game could be i m content to wait and see so that said there are a couple of games from early access that i ve ended up getting into and 7dtd is one that i did i tried it out some years ago when it was very much still in it s blocky stages of terrain i liked it enough to put it on my wanted list then it released on xbox one and i willingly jumped in it had gotten better there were a fair few problems with stability and optimization but underneath it all it was hugely enjoyable i ve spent a lot of time on minecraft like many people but this has replaced that completely for me when there was the unfortunate folding of telltale and the abandonment of the console versions i immediately humped over to pc version on buying a new laptop and now it is currently still in alpha but yet it is amazingly good other early access games should look to 7 days to die and learn some lessons so what is it the parallels with minecraft go without saying but it s more than that you have all the resource looting and crafting you could wish for and all the building mechanics too but unlike minecraft physics has more of an effect you can t create impossible structures to any degree in this game because it will simply collapse a concrete block for example can only have a limited number of other concrete blocks stuck to it s side before it all falls apart along with the more realistic visuals no voxels here and it feels just so much more realistic on top of this you have the real meat of the gameplay that minecraft does not have the defence where in minecraft you have the plague of zombies and other baddies that appear at night in this game as the title suggests you get a blood moon every 7 in game days and you will be faced with a night long barrage of zombies eager to get to you through any means necessary through ground walls or anything else in minecraft you can just house yourself in mud and have no issues unless a creeper comes along and sees you no other monsters damage the blocks but here they do and that s what makes this game so much more compelling because it gives far more purpose you spend those 7 days reinforcing your base going out scavenging then coming back to improve the defences some more and hope you have it ok for horde night as it currently stands in alpha 19 2 there s also turrets and some basic electrical stuff too so this really aids you with your defences and if you play tower defence games this should also scratch that itch for you it does for me many players will commonly make a base or take over an existing building and reinforce it and then have a short way away or attached a kill base a place that serves no other purpose but to fight the horde from one of my ideal setups is to channel that inner tower defence player and create a central nest with railings you can shoot through connected by a meandering path on stilts that the zombies will follow to get to you along the path you set your turrets and electrical traps and delight in the various ways they get ripped to bits in 2020 there are tons of crafting based survival games too many in fact you could say but 7 days to die is not only a deservedly long lasting one that is still being worked on but it s one of the absolute best you can get it ain t pretty particularly but who cares when the game is so damned compelling you ll easily sinks hours and hours into it i have about 400 since february when i bought it on pc and i ve got more than that on xbox one and ps4 so this should tell you that with an infinite set of possibilities for building the set of hours you ll sink into it are infinite too thoroughly recommended a true icon of the genre
