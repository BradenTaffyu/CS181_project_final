2017 this game has an exciting start up a mid game bit of a slog and the end game turns out pretty alright sometimes either way wanted to review that this game also gives you plenty of opportunity to lift dumbbells and drink a gallon of water with its easy pause system during the down times is when it s best to focus on doing the crazy exercises that don t involve dumbbells overall i rate this game 8 10 fun to lift and i recommend it if it goes below 20 make sure to get lots of mods
