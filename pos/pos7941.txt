2017 early access review beamng drive is a game simulator where you get to drive some vehicles with some incredibly detailed damage models have you ever wanted to experience a piston ring failure in a video game if so this game is for you the cars handle like real cars and they break like real cars the game is singleplayer only but the developers are creating campaigns for the game to significantly improve the available playable content they ve already added quite a few models of vehicles complete with separate trim levels and some neat short missions including randomly generated race courses the game is pretty fun as it stands already and seems like it s only going to get even better
