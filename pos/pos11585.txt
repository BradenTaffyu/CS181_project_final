2015 early access review i ve been hooked on this game for weeks now here s the elevator speech is it a day z clone yeah sure it s what day z could have been if it wasn t abandonwear the developers are very active and release updates constantly is it a minecraft clone sure you could say that too it takes some of the best features of minecraft and implements them well yes as others have said it is a day z meets minecraft love child in all the right ways the crafting system is deep tons of loot and a vast variety of it lots and lots of building options as well now to address some of the ugly stuff a few negative reviewers have said yes the game is rough around the edges it is and alpha sometimes things will happen for better or worse due to error sometimes it s tragic sometimes it works to your advantage sometimes it s just hilarious but when you play this game you need to know you re playing an alpha yes some of the textures are ugly yes there are balance issues yes some features are less than reliable that all being said this is the best alpha i ve ever played and it is always getting better it is also true that there is a learning curve just like any game with deep crafting building etc because there is a lot you can do there are a lot of things to know most of it is pretty intuitive but you will find yourself reading forums and the wiki alot it s just that kind of game i ve been reading about rude moderators in the forums i don t know much about that i jump in to find an answer to a question i have and jump right back out that may or may not be true but at the end of the day it doesn t make the game any less fun bottom line if you like open world survival crafting games this is the best one of the lot and i ve played them all better than rust better than day z way better than all the other abandonwear and halfassed rip offs in this genre that polute the steam store is this a clone yeah it is but it s one of those rare clones that s better than it s own inspiration
