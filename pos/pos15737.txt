2023 a good free aiming warmup application but note you won t improve unless you stick to a specific routine for your respected game and not just play the same gridshot routine everyday and not focus on things that you aren t doing so well on in other games aiming wise or game sense wise don t go into aim training expecting to become a gaming god instantly these only help with hand eye coordination and muscle memory but remember to practice in your respected games as well and to practice just as much in them as you would with aim labs and i m sure in no time you ll definitely improve heavily
