2018 i have been playing total war titles since the first game and i have to say total war warhammer 2 is the best total war game in my opinion i really like history itself so i had mixed feeling about this fantasy total war dragon dwarves and orcs it can t be a good game fortunately i was wrong thanks to these mistical creatures and races we have got many different races to play in the historical total wars there is a lack of differentiation of cource rome has got different units religions etc from egypt but the core and mechanics of the game are the same for all nations except hordes and after playing 2 3 of them game becomes rather boring in warhammers each race is unique and you just want to check all of them of course some of them will be almost unplayable for you but you will love others pros many unique races rpg elements beautiful graphic very playable fantasy lorecons many expensive dlcs but some of them are very interesting lack of sea battles even in pirates dlc there is no true sea battles system requirements if you want to play in stable 60fps in high quality if you don t like fantasy it is not total war for you did i mention about dlc final verdict 8 5 10
