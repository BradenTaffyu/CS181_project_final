2021 as a veteran player of theme hospital i had high hopes given this was touted as the spiritual successor we all craved unfortunately it isn t quite the blast of nostalgic crack i wanted as the visual gags often fall flat it can get repetitive rather quickly plus a lot of diseases aren t represented visually it s disappointing for example that patients with lycanthropy don t sporadically turn into werewolves despite this it has a unique graphical style which reminds me of the original game s cutscenes while the sound and music is fantastic those dj s can be hilarious it s a great game but for theme hospital fans it s like getting a new girlfriend with the same hair colour except she s got bigger boobs and is noticeably more stupid
