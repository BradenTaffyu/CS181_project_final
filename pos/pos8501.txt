2021 excellent game great blend of realism arcade styles call of the wild doesn t stray to far in either direction giving it good balance absolutely stunning graphics if you have a capable rig this game looks insane sometimes i just 420 walk around just to enjoy the view ambiance tons of replay ability because the true end game of call of the wild is the trophy lodge long after hitting max lvl skills perks you will be itching to get back out there to find great one some of your favorite animals in rare fur types diamond awesome option as a 2nd game if you have a main game or a game you mostly play but have a need to mix it up once in a while this is a solid option too highly recommended
