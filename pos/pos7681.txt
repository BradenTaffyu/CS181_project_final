2020 early access review when i first saw the game it was nothing more than a softbody tech demo for the cry engine buti was interested enough to buy the game once it was announced after all this time i never got tired of the game this is thanks to the continuing development and striving mod community if you ever wondered what a small italian two seater with a 500 hp american v8 would become after it met a wall at 120mph wonder no more and try it out yourself definitely a recommendation for all racing and sandbox enthusiasts edit after adding an additional 100 hours this still holds true both the developers and the community keep supporting the game and adding vehicles maps and missions the next big step for the game will be its story mode which is currently playable as a pre release test
