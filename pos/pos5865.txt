2020 early access review despite waiting an eternity for this game and being in early access honestly i love it so far yes there are bugs here and there but nothing that would make me turn and not play this game visuals are fantastic yes the fights are challenging i love how you can order your soldiers around overall i think it s a fantastic game i don t mind the price can t wait to see what more updates they have in store
