2014 early access review tabletop simulator is more of a workshop based game than the game itself but the workshop opens up many possibilities as any individual is able to mod the game to make any board game in the world and upload it to share with the community the game can be a bit buggy laggy and glitchy but that can be expected as it is an early access game however this game is probably not worth purchasing if you are not a board game fan also it would probably be wise to purchase this game along with a few other friends or if several of your friends already have it so that you have people you can play it with i ve never got on a random server to try and play a game but i ve heard from other people that people on them can be trolls which would ruin your experience and change your oppinion of the game itself
