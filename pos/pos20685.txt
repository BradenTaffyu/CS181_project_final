2022 boy just go buy and play it 3 it was astounding astonishingly done absolutely enjoyed it could give 9 99 10 just there are some nitpicks my favorite part was the valkries also loved the other npcs as well being a soul player i crave for proper boss battles idk for me valkries were the only bosses felt like real bosses a proper challenge to some extent although not flawless that brings me to the next point that aside from valkries other mobs and bosses felt mmkay there are hardly any bosses even i was waiting to see a vast variety of things as i progress through the story guess i might have had raised my hopes a bit too high that only made me a lil sad cause this is a gem plot wise they ve bent those renowned greek and norse mythologies almost perfectly even though i didn t know kratos past i instantly fell in love with this portion of his journey now the gameplay isn t bad or anything it feels fluid just not as amazed as i was in the other parts again i just don t mind it gow went directly into my fav bucket they showed exactly how a pc port should be delivered nice work thanks everyone who have put their effort to bring this to us subject to change now i saw the ragnarok trailer that was mmmwah another goty
