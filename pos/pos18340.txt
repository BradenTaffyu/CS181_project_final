2022 review i am going to list my resons for and against buying this game and will conclude the review with my personal opinion pros easy to learn even my 60 year old father understands the game s mechanics nice graphics and effects relaxing soundtracks daily challenges and more events e g boss battles contested territory odysseys lots of ways to customize your experience as a player many unlockables in the trophy shop many playable maps at least 10 many ways to play the same maps not in terms of official gamemodes but you can limit yourself by using only one type of tower for example a lot of achievements they help you in game by giving you useful stuff like monkey money insta towers and more and outside of the game you can flex with them around your friends playable both solo or with up to 3 other players multiplayer can make the game much easier at the beginning gets chaotic really fast no p2w you can if you want to but everything can be done without spending a single cent runs pretty smoothly as long as you stop playing at a round higher than 100 this game gets frequently new content added most recently a new paragon tower the game has an active modding community beware mods can get you banned when used in multiplayer or on ranked events cons this game used to be half the price it is currently recommendation wait for a sale once you reach a high round 100 the screen will be full of monkeys and more making finding your cursor is as difficult as finding waldo or wally depending where you are from the gameplay itself stays the same what i am trying to say is that once you found a consistent strategy to win you will probably not try new things out and that makes the game really boring especially on high rounds when all you can do is stare at the screen and hope that the 1 fps hell finally comes to an end usually at round 150 there is no motivation to play further than round 100 seriously no achievement no better insta monkeys nothing we tried the coop mode many times on many occasions and we found out that the connection is really unstable either you or your friends get kicked out and in the end you play solo again concluding words i recommend this game because it is a pretty fun single player game which can be modded and also played together i got this game for about 6 which is half the current normal price therefore i recommend you to wait for a sale honestly always wait for sales if you are looking for a game with deep lore that is also made for multiplayer only then you are wrong here btd6 is made for casual players with a hatred against the evil bloons who also play solo most of the time new content is being added frequently which makes the game feel more alive if you are looking for a game with many achievents which are also tricky to unlock then this game is made for you you also definitely need good strategic knowledge to properly advance in this game feel free to write your questions in the comments and i or someone else from this community will try to answer them as good as possible
