2021 early access review my friend and i bought raft after she watched someone play it on stream and it is safe to say me and her are enjoying every single second of it we both bought it last night and we ended up playing for 7 hours straight i am yet to play alone but i think this is one of those games where you get the most out of it with a party of 2 or 3 people lest it get mundane it is surprising how fun it can be to be on a raft in the middle of nowhere jumping from island to island gathering resources for your raft that is slowly but surely starting to resemble a viable home diving into the beautiful blue ocean and seeing the corals resources fishes and animals like dolphins the game ran really well and i am yet to encounter any sort of glitch bug or performance issues my favourite thing about this game must be the research table and how you can learn all these wacky inventions to help improve your life on the raft this can be addicting the only annoying thing i found about raft are the damn sharks whilst i do enjoy the danger of the shark roaming around the raft and having to be extremely cautious when you jump off or dive in the ocean i hate the fact that it comes and bites you within seconds most times after jumping off into the sea the shark starts to get really annoying after a while and yes i do know you can build shark bait etc but i just found this annoying other than that this game is genuinely a diamond amongst rocks i only paid about 15 15 for this game which is a bargain especially considering the game is still receiving updates and literally just got one last week that changed decorations etc tl dr fun adventurous crafting is great exploration is amazing enhanced with friends worth the money without a doubt punishing survival game on the hardest difficulty
