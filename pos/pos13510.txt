2015 early access review am now qualified to join nasa honestly though this game is amazing you learn so much about how space travel is done in the real world this game has already taken so most of my playtime ever since i got it and no doubt it ll continue to do so for a long long time it s so fun to build your own aircraft rocket space station rover etc and make them work and when you ever get bored which is not possible but on the vigintillionth chance you do you can look for mods that add parts or gameplay elements having great modding support and an awesome community and this is still in beta and looking at the developers it can only get better if you ever get stuck from the steep learning curve you can watch some tutorials done by scott manley why are you still reading this buy it now and go to space
