this game is excellent i have completed all achievements and its taken me around 60 hours at times where i thought gameplay was starting to get stale the story would progress it is such a great game with absolutely amazing pacing its a blend of a few games farming simulation like stardew valley fisheries and farming restaurant operation which reminds me of overcooked blended with cooking mama take those two key elements above and then add diving fishing crafting archaeology and exploration with an enjoyable combat experience side and main quest lines with constant progression all blended into one it has some of the most beautiful cut scenes and art the soundtrack is great as well all round excellent game full price you wont regret picking it up on sale is a complete steal
