2022 when it comes to simulation games that s one of the best ever it s fun and brutal let me put it that way an accident caused a dupe to make a mess and the piss ran three stories down and ended up polluting my water reservoir to clean it up i walled the mess in the reservoir to pump it through a water sieve and clean it up in the process one dupe ended up walled in underwater and closely survived when he climbed out of the basin he pissed himself totally messing up the whole pool there s lots of memorable events like when compressed chlorine gas flooded my base or polluted slime got distributed all over the base which caused a massive plague outbreak everything is comically animated with much love to the details omg the paintings while the simulation is really intense it s comics physics not a loony toons physics but somewhere in between but with strong alignment to real physics with fluid and gas dynamics also all the overlays are very good and intuitive to work with anyway the learning curve is steep and i don t know how long it will take to master all the mechanics there are quite a lot of internet pages dedicated to construction patterns that work well and most likely you will need it no matter how smart you are
