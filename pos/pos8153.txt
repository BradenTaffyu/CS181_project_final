2022 product received for free a very real review from a yu gi oh vet and ive played since 99 for reference listen ill be blunt dont come to this game if you thought it was gonna be anything like those old gameboy games we once played with updated graphics and pretty animations the game as is has lot of balance issues and has a lot of things that need to be added but its not rushed in any way or form and you can tell they have spent a lot of time polishing things to look great and feel as smooth as possible on launch that being said it can be smoother and it can be tweaked to fit the current player base but for the vets that wanted an old school game this isnt for you yet this game can honestly be their next longevity game but they have to add some things and help balance the game so meta decks dont run rampant and people are not compelled to go to the other community based ones that list is as followed and please add things as you feel needed that way we can hopefully get this the attention it needs and people can see a real review and konami can see some things that will greatly improve there game 1 timer needs to be much lower to force people to play there combos faster and know there cards better and ultimately streamline the game you either know what you are doing and do it quickly or suffer because you sat there for 3 minutes doing absolutely nothing but trying to read your own card my suggestion is 2 3 minutes per turn which is more than enough time to get your combos out and with each successful card use it adds 2 seconds which may not sound like a lot but after 10 cards its 20 seconds and can help stabilize longer combos 2 implement 3 other modes outside of ranked mode casuals ranked gen 1 and ranked gen 2 casuals needs no explanation so for ranked gen one its a ranked mode for all people who wish to test there might against all other who use only cards that involve ritual and fusion cards nothing past that no synchro no xyz nothing now that doesnt mean they cant use cards like the new blue eyes max and such but it means they have to fine tune the deck to be more inline with literally just fusion and ritual monsters at their core and rank two is the same thing but it goes all they way up to synchro and xyz summoning and doesnt include pendulum and link thus creating a more 5ds era of ranked and dueling by doing this it opens up to a more wide range of players and people can compete without feeling power crept by all the new gen cards and it can even bring in old school people who know how to make a ruthless toon deck 3 a few more ways to earn more in game gems even if it takes a bit longer also a way to unlock secret packs permanently for this i believe for more in game gems maybe have weekly missions that people can do throughout the week that give them 1k gems for a 10 pack draw a week not to much but atleast something to look forward too now as far as secret packs i believe that once you get 1 of every copy of the featured card on the secret pack list maybe it should be opened permanently or for every 1 time they get every featured card on secret pack maybe its time is extended exactly one week because at that pint all they need is maybe a couple of copies and if they have a weekly mission that gives them 10 pulls that will literally be there time frame hopefully that makes sense 4 a banlist please good lord having three copies of maxx c is insane and man is that hilarious i crafted exactly one copy because i know its gonna be limited but please make an updated banlist and limited list 5 community engagement you guys have a chance to make this one of the best games yu gi oh has seen since duelist of roses dang im getting old and that can easily be done so long as you listen to the community and watch for the trolls and dont cater to the top 1 and streamers please understand i dont hate streamers and the 1 because ultimately they help grow the player base but when you cater to them the game literally slowly but surely dies off and thats when things get to being unbalanced and none new player friendly there are more issues but those are the ones off the top of my head and hopefully the community here will add some that they feel is important and i will edit this and add them as i see fit these next issues are something that can be added for qol and just to help maybe a few people 6 more animations for boss monsters i e special attacks and effects for their cards for example if someone summons blue eyes and they attack it could have its own special attack animation along with certain spell cards and popular cards having really unique animations to bring the game to life in a new way like if halberd cannon uses its effect you literally get a small animation of him using it etc 7 some deck features that could be nice like a few more cards sleeves a few more search functions and maybe a few more deck slots 8 more in depth tutorial newer players might not skip the tutorial but they also dont get a lot from this one having a more in depth one that actually teaches them the ins and outs for cards and uses could improve the longevity of this game now this issues is a specific one for those that do like to spend money and dont mind uses mommies credit card 9 you guys seriously need much better gem prices and i mean way better look at what happen to halo with there prices when they were not good they had to go back apologize and revamp half their store it was crazy soon you guys will definitely hear the backlash of your gem prices i can assure you that because 25 bucks is 1 10 pack pull and thats insane i would argue that every 16 17 bucks is about 10 packs thus thats like a 7 dollar difference per 10 packs which is 35 i believe now while i understand that its new and the game hasnt had any balancing and such and basing things off 10 pack purchase isnt always wise this is again for those whom wish to spend money and after ding math and looking at tcg and ocg card box prices which this should be based off of because its virtual and there are other cosmetics and such people will want to spend money on its wise to slightly lower the price of gems to help people who do want to spend money and not have them feel ripped off the happier they feel the more they want to spend just saying 10 cosmetics yes i know the game just released and they have some cosmetics and such this is just saying that adding more will definitely be a good idea and i believe the price for them is spot on maybe even a bit cheap but again i digress it a great thing please add more and maybe even have community votes and such on what can be added 11 add in character mates joey wheeler or jaden as my mate sounds freaking amazing and i believe they should be 800 1k gems over the other mates and have a few more animations and should have special animations when summoning cards they either used or know bringing the game to life once again in a unique way if you have made it this far i thank you and hope that you will add what you believe the game needs to help balance it and give it more life for both the community sake and the game sake
