2023 i struggle with suicidal ideation and depression as such i tend to bottle my emotions up frequently locking myself in my room mindlessly passing day by day barely interacting with anyone so as you can guess if u ve played the game already already i liked it anddddd while a lot of ppl say that great game gave me depression tho i feel like allowing omori to be this game that can talk abt these sorts of problems all the while balancing it out with many cute and hopeful moments could rlly help in letting ppl have a safe space to discuss it and all make sure u play the good ending route first tho
