2021 one of the games with great atmosphere 10 concerned apes 10stardew valley is a quite peaceful yet mysterios place with small but very friedly community i am not a farmer type person myself but this game made me enjoy all these things that seemed to be boring and routine moreover you have a chance to explore the farthest corners of valley to uncover it s hidden secrets every character feels real especially as your friendship with them becomes stronger that creates the feeling that you want to become a part of this community to bring something special to stardew valley and finally after a long road to make people there be very proud of you with all good things about the game you even forget that the fector s challenge the nightmare for guys who try to get all achievments like me even exists there
