2019 souls 3 was my first souls game it took me some 3 hours and 20 30 tries to beat the gundyr the first boss the pure exhilaration of that final triumphant victory hooked me for over 2 years long after i beat the game and dlc s i incredibly highly recommend the game to all who can afford it sadly nowadays the online playerbase is mostly quiet aside from a few popular invasion areas hard boss fights if you strive for a challenge this is one of the games ashen one be sure to bring more souls
