2021 early access review dyson sphere program dsp is a new entry into the automation genre is it any good absolutely is it perfect no but it may get close if the developers are diligent pros great art direction plenty of details and wonder where it s needed and little detail where it s not this game also provides opportunities for truly stunning and cinematic screenshots with little to no effort logical progression barring a few small details outlined in the cons section the tech tree is straight forward intuitive and what you need to do next is almost always clear incredible scope it s tempting to say this game is similar to satisfactory or factory in the scale of mechanics but it s not nightmarish logistics challenges will have you planning for days few if any bugs the game s level of technical polish is noteworthy in 24 hours of actual play no noticeable bugs have been found surprisingly scientifically accurate the game contains a lot of technical and scientific explanations in it s tooltips design and focus with only a few exceptions all of them are either very real practiced scientific processes or otherwise widely accepted theoretical possibilities the devs have done their science homework as a stem field worker this makes me very happy a cons lost in translation the developers are chinese and english is not their first language while your ai guide s voice acting is good both the speech and tooltips will contain the occasional bit of engrish and translation errors from time to time thankfully this is not bad enough nor consistent enough to be a problem tech tree still rough at the edges the tech tree is still the part of the game that marks this as early access currently it can be difficult to decipher what your priorities are especially towards the midgame other little inconsistencies in specific cases show the tech tree needs a bit more fine tuning especially with the focus of making sure what players need to focus on next final result this game is good this game is really good i can see exactly how people suddenly lose entire days to this game without realising it i give this game a score of 2421 operational solar sails out of a smoothly operating interstellar logistics network
