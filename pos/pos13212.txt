2015 updated to release 1 0 most bugs are gone loads more to build and experiment with feminine kerbal s are here and they are just as dumb some graphics and sound are still underwhelming lacks a much needed tutorial interface is still clunky slow and filled with buttons you dont know are there tough economics in career can leave you penniless still requires youtube tutorials to find stuff out sponsorships are not easy to figure out bug sets building upgrades to 0 allowing instant upgradewhat was already a solid game is solidifying into a final product i d love there to be some intro and cut scenes to get us closer to our kerbalnauts it s still not bug free and does have an air of indie beta about it but this is one project that is being run correctly and has been a joy to support as of release 0 9b kerbal s are cute and fun to interact with sent screaming into space the complex physics of space flight is accessible hugely sense of reward in achieving even small steps for kerbal kind lots to do and experiment with regular updates and an active community of modders sound already is fun and adds to the atmosphere graphics are not phenomenal but are appropriate loading times are unoptimised but nothing bad some interfaces are unrefined but totally functional still in beta so issues are forgiveable and probably being resolved tutorial leaves out useful info and needs expanding sponsorships are not easy to figure out and brokenwhat a hugely fun and charming game that demands your love and attention you care about your dim lil kerbal s and it s fun to see them flounder and succeed the science is well packaged to be accessible and if you take the time to experiment and read around the subject it becomes all the more rewarding recommended for those who like space science and being educated as they are entertained conclusion 8 10 a work in progress you can invest hours of enjoyment in already update still amazing
