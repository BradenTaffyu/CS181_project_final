2021 this a positive review in context of being a f2p so far i ll start out with a few cons because i know that for a number of people this will be a no go cons 1 walking simulator to start with areas are rather large and being ftp you can t even sprint until level 10 even running in the game seems slow compared to other games even when you pick up your first mount speeder at level 20 it feels slow not as slow as running or walking everywhere but really seems like everything is needlessly spread out and takes too much time to get there granted there is a quick travel mechanic and all the worlds so far have had a taxi service but they are not exactly as user friendly as they could be quick travel is time gated in that if you can use it more than once in about 5 minutes i could see a lot of people quitting the game within the first couple of hours because you literally walk from point a to point b 80 of the time 2 combat is really nothing to write home about mainly tab targeting and not especially challenging most of the enemies are pretty weak and present no threat what made it even more tedious was that the default option for the companions is healer which is not really needed in the beginning parts of the game when i changed the companion to dps and better used my own skills it made enemies die pretty quick so the combat was less sucky 3 graphics game is 10 years old and looks like its 20 i have not made it to later areas and i have seen a little bit of footage from the test live server for the new updates and it looks much better it is what it is and i don t mind playing games with below average graphics as long as it still looks good you can customize the ui to a degree and make it tolerable pros 1 it s the story stupid what more do you want me to say i really feel that that it is bioware at its best its dramatic while still retaining some cheeky humor it has good cut scenes excellent voice acting and the world building is good enough to pull me in and makes me want to keep playing 2 companions this is a little weird in that an mmo would have companions but they are very integral to the story and your character and really help flesh out the world in true bioware fashion some are likeable some are not but they are all memorable 3 its solo or coop friendly in an mmo world i have largely played solo myself as i progress through the game but i think it would be ideal for 2 person coop 4 there is a lot of content even for f2p once you get going and leave the starting planets it does have more of vast galaxy to explore feeling than other single player games the game was released 10 years ago and development started several years prior to that there is just a lot of planets and areas to explore even playing through on multiple characters i can see there being a fair bit of new story and content even when playing on the same worlds if you pay for one month subscription then you unlock almost all the content even after the subscription drops and become a preferred player conclusion if you can stomach the slow pace of the first hours and the combat there are multiple brilliant stories to be experienced in a vast and captivating star wars universe side note i do plan on subbing at some point if you do sub using steam make sure that your steam id are synced with the swtor web site or bad things may happen otherwise just sub directly u dew ewe i am not your dad or am i
