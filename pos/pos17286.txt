2017 i originally wasn t going to get warhammer 2 i felt it was a bit ridiculous they were making a sequel to a game with what felt like a third of the content that most fans and critics simply weren t addressing then it turns out they were planning on combining the content of the first game with the content on the second game to make some kinda huge super mega game that encompasses almost all of the major factions of warhammer into one ridiculously massive map after learning that i was all on board you can nitpick about this being greedy but considering the state of pc gaming with loot boxes micotransactions and the like this kind of industry i can not only tolerate but i kinda like total war warhammer 2 feels like a complete game in and of itself combining it with the first game is just mind boggling to me right now
