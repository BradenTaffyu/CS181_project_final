2017 i will admit fallout new vegas is not a prefect game yet verses fallout 3 this is a far better improvement it sticks rather well to the lore of the western coast of the united states the groundwork set by the old creators of both fallout 1 and 2 the big setting point is that you do not start off in a vault or a prison that seems to be a growing thing with bethesda titles why this title was done by obsidian studios a game company that has a bit of a rocky past and even future yet they have an eye for detail that is nice to see is not lose unlike bethesda fnv is a rough game by any ground yet it is still sound on story telling that there is no one correct route to take you re free to make the choices to effect the outcome of the game even being nearly 7 years old as of this review it still has a strong support of modding and those playing it as it is very well done plus a few mods that add so much also fix things though even with that i would still recommend this game to anyone even a console version as it is the best fallout game
