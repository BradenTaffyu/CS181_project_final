2017 you ll try you won t know what s going on you ll think dying is bad your friends will explain things to you using words like estus shard and praise the sun and it won t make sense you ll give up after dying repeatedly on the tutorial boss only to finally kill it and then die to a dog that scares you into falling off of a cliff three months later your friends will convince you to play again you try it out only to fail yet again this time though you understand that s part of the process just as your friends had reassured you you ll roll you ll roll again then again you ve done it the dog that once scared you into jumping off a cliff is dead and you ve miraculously taken no damage renewed vigor fills you and you continue on this time you ignore your friends resorting to the wiki to answer your questions and your own curiosity to guide you to treasure suddenly things begin to make sense you go to bed you wake up with this incessent urge to play again oddly intrigued by the story even though you re not that type of gamer why do i enjoy this you ll ask yourself soon you re rolling in real life to dodge your responsibilities solely to play this game didn t think it d happen to me it did buy it while it s on sale so the first three months of you not really playing it don t feel like such a waste of money it s not a waste even at full price amazing game and story so damned confusing at first but it s worth it i promise you
