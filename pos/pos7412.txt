2019 product received for free early access review i do love this game you need to work hard in the beginning for food and water but after that it s more chill scavenge build your raft up paint it grow your own food fish for food kill animals and hang their heads as trophy s or scare a friend by wearing a sharkhead d dive for materials be busy on your raft or search for islands which is a good break after a while you can even find big islands with a radar and those have new enemy s and a few animals you can capture and keep on your raft so you ll have some company it s quite relaxing in easy mode but you can change difficulty it s also really fun with friends the devs are really involved if you report a bug the will look into it and help you out they also still implement new content my partner paid for this game but i would buy it in a second now i know how fun it is
