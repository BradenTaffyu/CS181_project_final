2015 so many side quests i ve spent so many hours trying to help randos than i have actually doing the main missions the main story is interesting too but you end up getting lost in massachusetts and kind of want to explore to see what actually looks like reality and what doesn t the fighting is fun most of the companions are likeable there are 13 in total and the character creator is awesome i occasionally run into lag issues but it doesn t really bother me since it doesn t last long i enjoy myself when playing this and would recommend it to those who are interested in it
