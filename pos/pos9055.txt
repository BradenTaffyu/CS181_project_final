2019 stellaris a game developed and published by paradox space the final frontier okay maybe not going to step into that but space has been an imagination playground for thousands of years looking up at the stars and wondering what the vastness between them holds many games attempt to capture the exploration and the politics of potentially discovering alien races and worlds very few games do it half as well as stellaris i break my reviews into 4 categories story gameplay visuals and audio followed by an audio section if you are bias to long reviews please feel free to scroll to the bottom story 7 10stellaris doesn t have a story in any tangible way because there is no physical campaign to play through it s more of a story experience than anything you play as a pre designed or self designed race of people aliens or machines and the story begins there you can give your race as much as history as you want by filling out their bio sections and can create as much of their story as you want prior to actually starting the game from an assortment of what your race look like what they are called flags ship styles etc the story then unfolds once you begin the game this could be different every time you play you might be incredibly lucky and stumble upon worlds that provide you phenomenal resource gains or artifacts aplenty or on the other hand you might stumble across deserted worlds minimal resources and no artifacts at all stifling your growth at every chance in other words the story is for you to build i wanted to rate this aspect of the game higher because there is a huge amount of story available and content to experience throughout your time but i feel as though story defers to scripted events and story line that must be followed which this game doesn t appear to have gameplay 7 10there are a vast expanse of 4x grand strategy space games on the market that do a lot of aspects really well and a lot of other aspects horribly stellaris was one of the few i have played that offered a full and satisfying experience without senselessly creating frustration i personally adore the grand scale of strategy these games provide but often find myself wanting more i want to get lost in a monstrous campaign where you struggle for days or weeks even plotting the perfect outcome stellaris does this wonderfully and devotes itself to your decisions from the size of the play space available small to huge to the minor details that help you more finely tune your game experience as well as allowing you to adjust the difficulty with its ironman mode the only way to earn achievements in stellaris the game is well designed in almost all its aspects the ui is streamlined and intuitive making the overall experience far more entertaining the concepts in the game are well thought out requiring you to validly think out your next move prior to making it from simply expanding your empire to how strong a military presence you want to actively have versus how happy and looked after your own people are designing your ship schematics is rather enjoyable too instead of having a generic fighter class freighter class etc you can specifically design your own in stellaris this adds so much more strategy to the game than you would initially expect would your ships be better suited to being light and fast with more of them or do you prefer them being heavy and slow and fewer in quantity sometimes this greatly changes the outcome of battles because the enemy is actively updating and creating their own as well the bread and butter of stellaris in my opinion though are the random events these are the unknown and completely randomised activities that take place as you explore and expand your empire they can be a positive like a quest chain that will inevitably alter your race or be completely negative like discovering a race that is hell bent on destruction these help keep the game fresh and have for my entire playtime several campaigns played and never experienced an identical playthrough yet a testiment to a well designed game stellaris promptly shows its diversity in its ai the enemy thinks ahead and often suprises you with outcomes you weren t expecting this is a thrilling aspect to the game that doesn t get enough attention often in these types of games the strategy is more dealing with the environment than the people which really dumbs down a lot of the choices you make probably my only real negative comment on the content of this game is that alot of the important game aspects of its gameplay which i would imagine highly important to the overall experience appears to be locked behind real money paywalls in the form of dlc now with paradox this is far from suprising but i feel as though it leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the devoted gamers who love these games and want a full experience without forking over hundreds of dollars visuals 9 10stellaris is beautiful in its own way its far from a graphical triumph not really showing you much beyond a giant map of stars and coloured borders but it is very well designed and extremely satisfying in its own right visually on its higher settings i never see the game drop below 60 fps on a mid to high end spec pc see my profile for details which can quite quickly happen in these kind of games where there are thousands of things occurring simultaneously the colours are vibrant and the entire game is free from any graphical tearing or visual bugs that cause the experience to be hindered not a lot visually happening here but what is there is stunning audio 9 10because this game doesn t offer a lot visually as stated above the audio is where the game has to make its peace the audio in this game is beyond words a beautifully designed soundtrack accompanies the sound of ships making their long journeys and the sound of war and battle soft and subtle whilst at the same uplifting and often battle provoking the overall audio is sensational too a vibrant array of what you can only imagine as space themes from the sound of giant aliens to the boom and clash of laser and nuclear weapon fire and the low droll hum of engines firing off as ships enter hyperspace the menus and selection audio is fairly standard and doesn t wow you it just fits well within the confines of the genre not feeling out of place or overly captivating whilst still bringing your attention to things that you need to know a wonderful audio experience overall is available here for anyone who finds enjoyment in it overall 8 10pros numerous events that keep the gameplay intriguing and adds a depth beyond just the strategy well designed and thought out ui with easy to use menus unpredictable ai keeps the gameplay fresh no matter the playtime interesting resource expansion and population management captivating visual and audio experience that helps compliment the overall experience cons the dlc pay wall taints a lot of the game aspects because you can see it being done better but just don t want to spend the money to fix it stellaris does almost all of its aspects perfectly especially compared to a lot of its competition it provides a solid gameplay experience without becoming boring it gives you freedom of choice often unavailable in these games even though they provide you strategy it wonderfully blends its audio and visual aspects which delights your senses as you actively try and come out victorious again because its a real issue for me and for a lot of people i know the pay wall is horrendous you shouldn t have to buy 10 dlc s to experience the game as it should be the dlc should be no more than a way to enhance what is already a solid foundation not fix it journey far and find peace or war in the vast darkness
