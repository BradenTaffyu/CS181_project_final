2018 early access review well balanced fast paced fun and addictive slay the spire is everything you want from a rogue like with card based fights but not more mostly due to how little content the early access version has what it has however is really really good you start by choosing a character class two available for now and they play significantly differently the character then traverses a dungeon picking up new cards for their action deck after each challenge draft style i e you get offered three and choose one additional modifiers are present in the form of relics that give you more bonuses sometimes very powerful it should be noted that the good feeling this game achieves is partially due to the lack of bad mediocre relics getting a relic is always a noticeable boon which encourages more play and further exploration each of the two classes has their own selection of cards with a bunch of different synergies the strategy you want to tailor your deck towards therefore depends on which early relics and legendary cards you get that makes each run different enough generally the game is more on the fun random side than a serious tactical brain teased compared to very similar games like say the little known card quest in which every battle is a tough challenge that s not a downside though because the difficulty curve is just on point to make your victories satisfying and your failures not too disappointing and yes sometimes you will die to unavoidable rng such is the nature of roguelikes i rarely buy and play early acces games but this one is already worth the price tag can t wait to see more content added
