2016 i was a gtr gtr2 gtr 2 power and glory mod rfactor rfactor 2 kind of guy after watching the alpha previews of assetto corsa back in the day i was skeptical about the sim i had my rfactor 2 pride and was proud to be on rf2 after a considerable number of months later i picked up assetto corsa i kind of got tired of the slow development of rf2 and wanted to try something different it took many hours of fine tuning my ffb and learning the good mods from the bad mods the cars at first seemed so much easier to master than in rf2 after many updates later assetto corsa improved the physics optimized the graphics and continued to develop new and different class cars all of which has enhanced my experience with the sim assetto corsa is my go to racing sim the sound can always use some improvement but overall the total experience is very pleasing furthermore the modding community is huge and there is always something new to try or fall in love with back in the day the lambo miura was a fantastic mod and then it became a part of the official car list the mods such as the mazda 787b continues to impress me the virtua simulazoni cars the ier cars the rally legend cars and all the fantastic tracks make this sim almost priceless i have uninstalled all other racing games and now focus solely on assetto corsa if i am not racing then i am most likely cruising on lake louise or nordschleife in the miura countach gt40 shelby cobra ruf yellowbird and when i want to speed around tokyo city on the c1 shuto expressway i drive the jdm pack cars there is a little bit of heaven for everyone in assetto corsa just my review
