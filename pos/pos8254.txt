konami konami konami why is the format in this game some weird amalgam of the tcg and ocg why are you releasing cards from the last released set of the physical card game when there s stuff that released over half a year ago that still isn t in the game why can t you guys design festivals to be genuinely fun and interesting what the redacted was that new years event why are there still bots in the game why does the tutorial for new players suck why is maxx c still allowed all this said this is still the quintessential way to play yu gi oh online now so you re kind of forced into it if you want to avoid selling your house to play whatever the paper meta is nowadays
