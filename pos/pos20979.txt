2023 3 times over worth the price packed with content tons of nods and pop culture references just finished the game but i am looking forward to play more graphics are adoable 7 10 and animations are surprisingly complex and cute 9 10 game play 9 10 music 7 10 10 10 looking at the track hot pepper tuna best credit sequence in a long while amazing how they managed to balance punishment for greed with rewards for progression beating the main story boss was super gratifying and left me wanting to play the past credits content even more i have not played the full game before the big patch only demo but in this state the game is incredibly good
