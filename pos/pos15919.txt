do i even need to say anything look at my playtime i love this game you start small and get to clean bigger and bigger stuff as you go it is very easy to get lost in the flow which is perfect if you simply want to relax and be satisfied i love cleaning and it shows 100 completion was fun but i needed to buy the dlcs for it and not every dlc was worth its content although i must admit that i am very happy about all the free content that keeps being added and about the general replayability one thing is for sure the main game is worth its price
