2022 i am just now escaping ft joyedit on the fence about this game now that i m a bit further in about 60 hours game play time and have somewhat enjoyed aimlessly wandering and trying to track down quests hoping that i can actually take on whatever enemies pop up to fight there s the real issue i m having 95 of my encounters are enemies that are way too powerful and i can t seem to figure out if it s supposed to be a constant struggle or if i keep missing the paths that would lead me to reasonable fights when i finally eek out a win it doesn t even feel very good the level of reward to effort in this game is not great i feel like i explore every piece of the map but am still missing quest plot points and not getting anything done i don t expect to follow a waypoint to every quest objective but this nearly directionless struggle has become a total chore the quest log isn t helpful
