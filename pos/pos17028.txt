2018 total war warhammer ii is in my opinion the pinnacle of the total war series the first warhammer game revolutionised the series with its new features previously the historical total war games had struggled with providing enough variety between factions however the warhammer fantasy setting allowed for truly varied factions based on entirely different races with completely different rosters providing so much more replay value lords and heroes with real skill trees a robust magic system and of course monsters of varying shapes and sizes also helped breath new life into what was lets face it a stagnating series prior to warhammer so warhammer i was great sure but is warhammer ii an improvement oh absolutely warhammer ii isn t the cherry on top of the cake that was its predecessor its more delicious cake everything that warhammer i did well warhammer ii does even better the new races have much more detailed and unique features and bonuses and as a result they almost make you feel like you re playing different games the skill trees rosters and events have been fleshed out even more everything has been supercharged however what makes warhammer ii stand out as i think the best strategy game available right now are the campaigns firstly the eye of the vortex campaign gives you a goal to strive towards a true endgame a first for total war grand campaigns in previous total war campaigns i would find myself eventually growing bored of the campaign i was playing i would eventually reach a point where i was so powerful that it would no longer be fun the periodical rituals in the vortex campaign completely fix that issue now there is not only an objective to strive towards but also much more challenge in the late game of course you can ignore the rituals and the story if you so choose but it makes the campaign so much more fun and interesting so i m not sure why you would then we come to the second campaign mortal empires mortal empires is essentially the old world map from the original total war warhammer with the new world and all of its factions added to it to create one huge campaign map it is huge this campaign also provides the more traditional sandbox style campaign without the vortex rituals and such though there is still the chaos invasion in the late game so what you end up with is everything you loved about the first game with all of the new features and factions added in to create a wonderfully huge campaign another thing to note is that creative assembly have been so much better at providing new content in a more consumer friendly way this time around too the paid for dlc packs are now more focused on fleshing out existing factions or providing new ones as per request and ever since the launch of the game there has been a steady stream of free new content in the form of new game modes new factions and new multiplayer maps so clearly the developers have learned a lot so in conclusion i absolutely adore this game even more so than the original i didn t know or care about the warhammer fantasy battles universe at all before total war warhammer but two games later i m obsessed i ve been a fan of the total war series since the original rome total war and i can confidently and enthusiastically say that i truly believe total war warhammer ii to be the best yet by far pros loads of variety focused vortex campaign huge mortal empires campaign perfects the first game s formulacons nitpicks at most siege battles less enjoyable than field battles understandable yet still disappointing lack of naval battles10 10not only the best total war game but possibly the best strategy game in general
