hogwarts legacy is a solid game even if you re not a potterhead i m not a fan of the movies or books but i enjoyed playing the game due to the good combat system varied puzzles and satisfying conclusion rarely do i play a game for over 30 hours but i ve spent about 50 hours in hogwarts legacy if you re a completionist it can be a bit of a chore to finish as the game doesn t show you all the points of interest on the map optimisation could be slightly better as the game struggles to keep a steady framerate on rtx3070 not to mention handheld devices along with the optimisation my biggest complaint would be the repetitiveness which is pretty much unavoidable in open world titles if you re a potterhead you may be fully satisfied with the game if you re not just wait for a sale buy it and enjoy an open world rpg with solid combat and a lot of content
