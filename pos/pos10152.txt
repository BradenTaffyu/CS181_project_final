2018 rimworld one of my all time favourite games its a basebuilding rng fueled rts hybrid similar to dwarf fortress dont get turned off by its top down prison architect style looking graphics yet the design has its own charm and is made to be clear and unobstructive it looks stylized quite beautiful and allows for an unprecedented amount of gameplay detail and flawless performance its learning curve is surprisingly steady you dont need 500 tutorials to even start playing and there is an intelligent learning helper that teaches you most of the mechanics on a need to know basis so you dont get overwhelmed controls are easy and intuitive mostly everything can be read up on ingame the rts nature of the game makes it have alot of depth and it will make you want to be more efficient in every aspect easy to learn hard to master truly applies to this title the game also encompasses a broad range of dynamic events tailored by an ai storyteller of your choosing and it never gets boring hundreds of different events in various forms and executions make this one of the most replayable games out there the amount of funny sad and even evil stories i have experienced simply cant be told especially players with a dark sense of humour are mostly drawn to this game because of its possibilities want to feed your colonists human meat go for it want to buff them up with various drugs that make them happy without needing to care for them too much do it want to harvest organs for a living lure enemies into sadistic traps imprisoning people and much more yup this is that kind of game obviously you can ignore all inhumane procedures too your choice pthe amount of gameplay variety is enormous there is farming animals power systems an in depth health system different skills travel planetary seasons strange individuals and even a scenario editor that allows in depth customization of the gameplay you could start with more people or spawn them all as cannibals or give yourself a supply drop every x days its up to you ultimately rimworld is what you make of it a great game recommended it to what must be around 10 friends over time and they all got hooked personally i think that its really heartwarming to see the game evolve from back when i started playing alpha 14 non steam version around 200 hours there and be complete thank you tynan sylvester and thank you ludeon dev team one of the best early access accomplishments here on steam
