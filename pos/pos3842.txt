2020 not since ftl have i felt like i ve ripped off a developer this badly by buying their game i ve got over 200 hours of fun out of this game and am looking forward to more that is a steal at this price if you are in to squad level turn based strategy this game is a treat it does two things better than any other entry into its genre than i can name give you a wide variety of options to customise your characters and make those options feel like genuine differences in kind tactically speaking the real highlight of the game for me is the mastery board a mastery is a passive bonus that can be simple like 10 chance to hit or quite specific like if you deliver the killing blow to a target affected by one of the bleeding debuffs then take an extra turn these wind up being things you want to combo in quite complicated ways because the extra turn is great but your attack will be on cooldown so you need to find a way to reduce the cooldown to 0 so you can use it again also you have to start that bleeding somehow so it d be good to make your attack do bleeding and then to get a second attack straight away so you can trigger your bonus but of course every attack costs vigor so you might wind up spending it all if you get too many bonus turns so it d be good to find a way to get that to come back faster each individual thing is a bite sized ability you can get your head around but finding combinations that let characters fill the role you want and then successfully executing those strategies in game becomes a challenge all of its own the variety of enemies helps to add to that too it s easy to feel invincible once you ve managed to get a character to the point of having a block chance of 160 but then you encounter a giant frog that shoots its tounge through her to any of the characters beyond snipers who take free shots with reduced block chance whenever any attacks a character in your line of sight or something else that stops it being a one approach solves everything game this in turn works because the game is scrupulously fair the enemies are built on the same system as your characters using the same collection of masteries as you whenever you take an enemy out you have a chance to learn one of its masteries that adds up to being able to access a huge variety of strategies but also finding what happens in the game comprehensible when someone throws a punch and a volley of sniper fire follows you don t go well that s t you go oh they re using that supporting fire mastery i looked over it s good but it has a vulnerability each support shot delays that characters next turn so i know i can run someone at the snipers and their turn will probably come up again before the snipers are ready to fire this approach to enemy design means that by becoming familiar with your options and your characters abilities you automatically become familiar with the game s systems in a way that lets you figure out how to counter your opponent s choices and the thing is this i ve only scratched the surface here that s just the mastery board i ve not mentioned mastery sets equipment animal taming drone building the game is full of integrated interacting systems that are generally rewarding to play with and give interesting options there literally isn t space in a review to talk about everything that s good in this game but at the same time they re introduced gradually enough that it never feels overwhelming it has its downsides too it s a small korean studio and the polish and translation sometimes shows it you ll find the odd awkward phrasing or ambiguous description but in 200 hours i ve not experienced a crash or game breaking bug it also has a few mmorpg sensibilities that feel out of place in this sort of game things like a system that sort of prevents you from playing too many missions in a day but in practice one that you can reset for a fraction of a fraction of the payment you get for finishing one mission these don t really get in the way but they make the experience feel a little less streamlined the tactical stuff aside the story is pretty enjoyable while it does lean on some cliches it also has a few genuinely interesting and emotional moments i particularly like how it ll show you cutscenes or even give you small gameplay sections from the point of view of your enemies it makes them feel like intelligent adverseries who have goals and hopes and dreams beyond we fight the good guys because we are the bad guys at the time of writing the reviews are mostly positive and the game outright deserves that it s huge and brilliant and the devs keep adding more and more to it even the negative reviews are by people with 30 50 hours play time in the game so you have to ask what is the likely quality of a game where even the people who most dislike it decide to continue after spending more than a day of their life playing it if squad based tactics is your jam do yourself a favour and pick this one up
