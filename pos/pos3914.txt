2022 troubleshooter is without a doubt one of the best turn based strategy games it s basically nu xcom with 10 times the complexity and a south korean anime esque coat of paint even if you dislike anime and the people of the republic of korea it s still about five times better than the modern xcom games there s just an incredible amount of content customizability strategic decision making builds synergies unit compositions etc that rival any 60 game not just that it s also a lot smoother and faster to play than xcom2 is after a few hours of play you ll be hitting hotkeys and processing turns at a pace xcom wishes it had all despite the added complexity if anything it really highlights how incompetently xcom2 was designed troubleshooter is clearly designed as a pc game with a kb m centric ui and all the settings a pc game should have unlike the new xcoms which felt designed for consoles the cutscenes are in a vn style and the art is great i ve heard the translation used to be rough but the entire game has been retranslated into english and it s fine now the writing s pretty anime but if you don t like it you can just fast forward through all of it easily and focus on the gameplay the game has all the auto advance skip dialogue log etc features of a vn the game gets regular updates including balance patches almost weekly and free new content is regularly added a new dlc expansion was recently released and a sequel is in development but that s only after years of free dlc the expansion simply adds an extra chapter to those who ve already finished the main campaign so by that time you will have made up your mind on whether you want it you can play the game online or offline by playing online you gain access to pvp and some small extra features but the entire game is playable offline an online save can be converted offline at any time but you can t take an offline save online to prevent abuse i played online as i have a stable connection and have encountered no problems with it i recommend playing on harder difficulties even on your first playthrough
