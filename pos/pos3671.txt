2020 i ll never know what it felt like to wait six and a half years for the game to come out but i know that if i had to it d be worth both the years and the 20 spent everything about the game is stunning and that s saying a lot for something made out of rpg maker not much else to say except the themes aren t for everyone especially if you re sensitive to severe mental health issues i simply hope the undertale fandom doesn t lay a finger on this masterpiece
