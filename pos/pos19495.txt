2023 1 word to sum up this game masterpiece after almost 400 hours of in game play time i ve still only completed half of the endings available and never even touched a couple of the dlc available the runtime of this game is what you make it as you can also exclusively explore the main story and finish in a couple hours but if you plan on doing that you shouldn t even buy it for fans of the fallout series this is generally regarded as the go to game as fallout 4 lacks in engaging story line fallout 3 is very linear and 76 is a dumpster fire of a fallout game for being how old it is this is a title i would label as timeless long story short if you played any elder scrolls games and enjoyed them you ll like this one 9 5 10 remaster the game please
