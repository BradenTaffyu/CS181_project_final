2020 so i played the game at release and was really disappointed like most people which resulted in me quitting after like 7 hours and haven t touched it since but with the release of wastelanders i decided to give it another shot and i have to admit that the game improved way more than i expected i do have to add that i did buy a month of fallout 1st with the game though so my experience might be a bit different in comparison to people playing without that the biggest difference probably being that i play solo on a private server instead of an online lobby with randoms and that i got a junkbox which makes organizing resources easier i m 23 hours in currently and enjoying it quite a lot my main points are big detailed map with lots of interesting places to explore i constantly keep getting sidetracked by places i want to go explore instead of continuing my quests which is a good thing in my opinion they added actual quests storylines npc s dialogue options like you d expect from a fallout game these features were missing at launch which was probably the biggest game breaker for me since it made the whole game feel empty and pointless to me but now that they added all of those that problem is competely fixed the quests so far are actually better than i had thought when i learned about the expansion gameplay is pretty much the same as other fallout games which i don t mind the perk system is different though but i don t mind that either i d say the graphics are good at some areas they shine way more than in other areas but overall they re good i saw that there s quite a bunch of people who have an issue with the price point that the game has after it s rocky road which i can understand also saw that a lot of people have an issue with the fallout1st membership with which i d have to agree i don t think this game needs a membership system on top of the initial price the membership is optional the game does have an in game shop you can either buy currency or earn it in game by doing challenges i m never a fan of in game stores excluding some games mainly f2p games and such e g path of exile i haven t felt the need to buy anything from it and i don t feel like the game is really pushing it in my face it s just kinda there from what i ve seen it s mostly cosmetics gun skins clothes emotes etc and the challenges so far haven t been difficult i ve been getting quite a lot of the currency by just playing and completing challenges without even completing them on purpose challenges like kill x creatures hack x terminals etc i can t really speak about the multiplayer aspect of the game since as i mentioned before i m playing solo on a private server if you re okay with paying full price maybe getting the membership on top i would recommend getting it
