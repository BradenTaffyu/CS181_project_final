2021 and there you are again couldn t keep your greedy fingers off my old armor i see oh no don t look at me like that i won t grovel in the dirt this time we ve left those petty grievances behind us don t you think you know i ve realized we really couldn t be more different you and i and yet here we stand the both of us undead yet unbroken me i m simple truly unbound nothing to gain nothing to lose but you i ve seen your ilk time and time again you grasp for the faintest glimmer of hope kind hearted fool that you are you are blinded by the very light that guides you so you stumble searching for answers driven into madness by the things you uncover and still you remember what any sane person would rather forget you want to save everyone pitiful really you can t even save yourself and the more you try to help the more you will lose whether you risk everything for glory or offer all that you have left with boundless compassion no one can foretell the consequences of your good intentions i ll never understand what drives you is it your thirst for knowledge faithful duty petty revenge no matter you shoulder a task far beyond yourself and through all your trials you realize that you measure up to it after all and when even the gods despair and shy from their duty when the last fire fades and the abyss grabs at your heart you hold tight the embers that burn your fingers and face the end unknowing deceived yet always sure of yourself why bloody hell no matter it s not like i care but i suppose i ve amends to make and a debt to pay the more things change the more they stay the same eh so how about i help you with well whatever is behind that door you do like to stick your ugly nose where it doesn t belong don t you well then lead on
