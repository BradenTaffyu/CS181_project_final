2020 this game is not civ v and that s okay if you expect a newer better civ v in civ vi you won t find it here it s more like a re imagining of civ v if it were to come out today it s not as good but it has the edge against civ v if you ve gotten extremely good at civ v and expect to be good at civ vi you ll be mistaken art style changed graphics got better overall and the game play isn t as bad as i ve seen other reviewers talked about for years with the newest dlc and more on it s way this game is on it s way to be better than i thought it would ve been i recommend playing it if you ve played any civ before and wanted to get back into it
