2020 i grew up playing harvest moon on the snes my parents probably rented the game a dozen times before putting up the money to just buy the damn game my brother and i dumped hours and hours and hours into that game beating it multiple times to see some of the different endings a few years ago for the first time a game was released that bested the original harvest moon that game is obviously fortnite jkstardew valley is such a good spiritual successor that it beats the original hand over fist it s entirely it s own game while nodding its head to what i assume is its source inspiration it exceeded my expectations by a lot and it continues to be improved on again and again for free this game has a lot of replayability just ask my wife who has nearly 1000 hours logged by now between different relationships different focuses different game altering choices and different property layouts and designs there s enough content to keep you entertained and coming back for a very long time it might seem minor but the games soundtrack is probably one of the best if not the best out there chrono cross was my former favorite but only stardew valley has led to me purchasing the soundtrack on digital and two different vinyl releases okay one of those was a gift it keeps the game from getting as monotonous as it might otherwise get sometimes its similar to the tetris song after enough playing the music is ingrained in my soul lmaogorgeous pixel graphics amazing variety and loads of charm the creator clearly has a deep passion for this game and it shows in nearly every way this game deserves so much more money and appreciation than it gets 11 10 stop around and buy the game already i dont care if you find farming boring ps shout out to my brother he never got to experience this masterpiece but at least we had good times on harvest moon he would have loved it rip 1987 2007
