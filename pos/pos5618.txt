2023 i really enjoy playing bannerlord as i did playing warband if you liked warband as of now think of it as a warband 2 0 give it some time and hope and with updates and mods we will get a real bannerlord but you can get it now it s good in short many good ideas cool gameplays mechanics but a lot of grind unfair bots and if you want to win not loose you have to play their way lacks replayability if you re not into this genre and many things are missing or to be improved but it s good and i like it things i like being able to make your own kingdom and rolling over the kingdom of the ones that you owe 8k tribute day the possibility to save try out things and correct my mistakes yes i like that possibility no iron man for me some mods are great and now steam workshop s integrated i love diplomacy the massive battles although i don t use the mod to put even more troops as it s not stable for me and sometimes the enemy gets backup way earlier and more often than i do when you have good relation with people they talk you like equals and i don t know i like that the massive parties you can have with many troops i mean sometimes sieges are really satisfying on both sides but defenders are often way to advantaged defending a castle i won a 200v1k battle in auto resolve and attacking i lost a 300v50 the fact that you can outsmart your ennemies and win battles when you are outnumbered up to a certain ratio things i dislike not many options for your kingdom you have general policies but not that deep of a way to customize your kingdom vassals are a pain to recruit you can hardly recruit lords even when you are way stronger than another realm you have to search for the rare ones that will agree on fighting by your side and why does your clan have 7 parties with 100 troops when you are working for the bots and 2 clans with 49 recruits when you are working for me interpersonal relations are super basic likes you dislikes you and sometimes weird i befriended unqid the aserai sultan as my brother married his daughter way later he declares war on my kingdom and when i engage parleys he tells me that i betrayed him me no likey some skills are too long to level up and some are not interesting things i have mixed feelings for garrison systems and the mod improved garrison i m not satisfied with either no female apart from the nobility companions and a pair of mercenaries the sisterhood there s a mod for that but given that calradia is always at war i think female troops could be a logical implement the game is a bit unfair when the player plays a female character maybe there could even be patriarcal or matriarcal policies yes my character s sisters and daughters can be married no i don t want them to leave my clan and be used to join armies to fight against me and also if my character or his brother marries your daugther we could maybe have good relations i like the idea of a campaign but i feel like it s going against me if i don t do that specific thing everyone will ally and beat the it out of me initially you will fight every battle but progressively you will tend to autoresolve almost 90 of them as they are either repetitive and too easy or hard because the in game battles don t allow you to take many troops and the fights get almost 1 1 when the troop number difference is not huge i have mixed feelings for that because in a way i like small battles so i still do some and auto resolve are faster but battles are a great mechanic in bannerlord so i d like to play them more if the systems were better and sometimes auto resolves results in a better outcome for you with less losses smithing too op to make money if you fully focus on it but if you don t you will have to wait almost the endgame to make really cool looking and op weapons which is the real fun of it things i d like to see improved or added deeper relation system family truely befriending nobles and companions better vassal dynamics better or more important global economy between villages and cities and maybe between cities better war dynamics eg raiding villages plays an important role in winning a war bots always do it but try doing it once and everyone will hate you forever eg i captured 17 of your nobles out of 25 maybe you could admit i won instead of waiting a month for them to escape while hanging onto your castles better inventory management better troop management improved strategic choices when you delegate command troops can for example split cavalry to protect your flanks you can t really do that also when you re part of an army the commander can order you to act a certain way or order a given strategic line like playing on defense or getting just close enough for your archers to shoot the problem is you can t really do everything by yourself and if you delegate command your generals will rarely do what you intended there are no dogs or cats i m the ruler of an important clan i want my dog with me why can t we make camp with our party i really liked that feature send your companions and other parties on custom tasks take my prisoners and sell emprison them go defend that castle at the border don t wander around the safe zone of the kingdom recruit more archers cavalry infantry execute these automatically but not these spy on them sabotage this town s doors or garrison try convincing this one to like me or to hate his ruler workshops in cities need to be improved drastically they have no significant use as of now apart from telling yourself oh cool i ve got a brewery a blacksmith and a tannery they give me 60 denars each day what a greatly invested early 15k 19k hardly gained denars at one point trading is loosing it s interesting part as many things in this game it seems you end up selling everything without thinking and cities don t care what mylord you want to sell us for 99k of worn leather boots curved arrows decayed flax and rusty falchions no problem even if we are now ruined maybe playing games in taverns and lords hall would be better if it had an impact on the relations it could create another gameplay loop instead of playing them once and never going back because the ia is too strong for my small brain and i get no reward for winning tournaments they are really good but something s missing the variety of the fights also maybe the possibility to fight and win the tournament as a group the weapons and rewards i don t know you like them at first but then they lose interest pretty fast smithing make it less grindy less profitable and let us craft cool weapons yeah or maybe the possibility to hire a smith back to the last idea maybe hiring specialists could be nice and complementary to workshops this one s a smith he crafts better weapons for you and your army this one s a horse maker english is not my first language he can give you high quality work horses this one s an assassin he assassins or poisons or sabotages i don t know leave me alone this one s a spy he gives you insights on the relations and politics of other kingdoms with useful informations this theater group can improve the mood of a city for x days for y denars hope this will be enough i d love to make mods to improve the things on the list i made but i have no skill nor time to make them maybe one day who knows tw keep on updating the game and adding content we count on you
