2014 this game is love fallout new vegas really tells a brilliant story and although you feel at parts like nothing more than a pew pewing machine other times there are decisions that affect you as a person and your emotions be extreme laughter or sorrow for the smallest of characters without a doubt my favorite dlc is old world blues i highly encourage you to buy this along with the game if not the entire dlc owb had me laughing and giggling with each witty remark and obsidian do a fantastic job in both this and its other dlc opposite dead money a horror type dlc which does a good job of making each step you take a worrying and questionable one due to the enemies ai staying stealth and silent untill the last second good job obsidian i m sure the replay value for taking sides will keep me going for quite some time edit the music in this game has become a bliss for me the music having music from the actual time the game is set in gives a stable feel of authenticity to the game and to its creators each time big iron plays from my pip boy i can t help either go along silently in my head or even start singing it out loud with broken but well meant notes another thing i have to say is something i feel a bit sad about when i began the game i had no clue what i was doing and thus did not like the game at all i had a friend s strong reccomendation that all would get better and thanks to his reassurance i ve had great fun so this little note is just to say that you may not fall in love with this game at first but perseverance makes the game feel like a gift rather than the chore like feel i had at the beginning
