2017 where to start i love the the warhammer universe and i ve been playing total war games since i had a squeeky voice and no pubes so when i saw that a total war warhammer game was being released i litterally couldn t contain my excitement i even bought a new pc that would be able to run the damn game so right off the bat i can say if you like strategy games especially the fantasy type get this game gameplay so like all total war games there are two maps the campaign map where you can see various settlements within your line of sight move your armies agents and there s also the battle map which is selected in relation to where the battle is taking place without any dlc you ll be able to choose from a number of factions in your grand campaign the empire dwarves vampire counts greenskins orcs and the recently added freelc the bretonnians frenchish chivalerous humans and von carsteins vampire count sub faction in purchasing the dlc you can obtain the chaos warriors the wood elves and the beastmen as well as numerous sub factions based on existing races each faction has different mechanics to others with the vampires you can raise the dead allowing you to raise armies more quickly than other factions but you will take attrition if the terrain you walk upon is not afflicted with the undead curse dwarfs and other factions have access to the underway or secret forest paths which allows them to cut through mountains and dense forest instead of going around it also makes them immune to attrition caused by rough or afflicted terrain those who play historical total war may be disappointed by the limited diplomacy options which were much more extensive in previous ttw games there are also no seasons or naval combat which i think they ll be adding in in ttw w2 the options you get in terms of governing your faction are also very limited compared to previous ttw titles combat well what can i say it s a total war game it s massive real time battles that take place on a battle map there are also siege battles which i think are really fun even against ai i have found myself in battles of 6000 vs 6000 i hope you have a good computer lol but most of the time the battles won t be that big most of them usually falling between the 1000 2000 a side engage units head on with your heavy infantry watching them clatter into the enemy in a spray of blood and gore and then flank them with your cavalry use devastating spells to obliterate troops or buff your own every battle is unique although i do like to watch replays of my favortite ones because i find that i m too busy micro managing to appreciate the insane amount of detail that ca and sega have put into the combat you start of with a legendary lord with is basically your faction leader they have their own skill trees and equipment as well as retinues they also have unique questlines which enables you to unlock their unique gear which is faithful to the tabletop lore you recruit heros which also have their own skill trees equipment and retinues which you can use as scouts assassins saboteurs or you can insert them into your armies and use them on the battlefield pros good variety of races each with unique mechanics which enhances replayability good graphics good soundtrack good variety of maps all three future games will be combined into a super campaign you get to kill dwarfs beautiful scenery which differs depending on location and terrain corruption epic battles awesome lore it s a total war gamecons not as many diplomacy options as previous ttw titles including faction governing you cannot colonise certain settlements depending on your race for example humans cannot colonise dwarf or orc settlements vice versa workshop mod fixes this dwarfs dlc abuse but worth it verdict i love this game i can t recommend it enough most of the negative reviews on here are butthurt historical fans complaining about the fantasy genre as much as i do love the historical versions i can say that this ttw is definitely my favorite there are some mechanics missing from previous ttw games which is a shame but there are also many new ones the new total war warhammer game that has recently been announced will work as a stand alone game or it can be combined with the original game this one to make a ultimate campaign it will add on a new continent to the west and another landmass to the south of the original map four new factions have also been announced and i expect more shall be released as dlc so i can t stress enough how good this game is and it s just going to keep getting better the only downside is that like most modern day games they abuse you with dlc but hey i love this game so i can t help but buy it if you like the ttw series or want to discover a new strategy game set in a fantasy world get this game i don t like dwarfs 9 10
