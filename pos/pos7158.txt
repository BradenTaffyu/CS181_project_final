2020 look there s no two cents about this either you like driving or you don t it s that simple ats and the older sis ets is all about taking your time to haul heavy cargo with the big buckos while building an small company for yourself sure you can be a little insane and hit that speed pedal at times but honestly the game isn t about speed it s about precision and learning how to maneouver a vehicle that is actually oversized for the streets we re so used to on our daily basis assuming you re not part of the share that actually works with transportation in short you ll either find it boring and repetitive as day to day driving in real life can actually be for some or you ll end up in youtube at 02 00am looking for videos on how to back an articulated trailer into a barn without putting a scratch on it this is absolutely the best simulator around for the latter group of people
