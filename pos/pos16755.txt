2021 i didn t expect to like this as much as i do but i guess 27 hours in a week probably speaks for itself i will say the garden flipper dlc is a must otherwise you re confined to indoors would be amazing if they had a multiplayer option so you could maybe co own a business and do renovations together i m looking forward to seeing what more comes along and hopefully a bit more building freedom ie adding floors changing or removing stairs etc overall i would definitely recommend now get out of here i have some more flipping to do
