2018 a lot of people give this game flak based on the changes it makes i think most things they ve done has been a positive improvement from civ 5 the gameplay changes have all been brilliant meanwhile i m not impressed with the ai although they are still fun to play against districts tile improvement got a big overhaul this is definitely the biggest and most important change in my opinion i really like the new way city tiles are developed with builder s having a limit on improvements and the use of districts it s a really brilliant change that makes city building more dynamic and engaging the traders make building roads less hand holdey and more reasonable as well cities now have housing which is a new way to limit population housing initially is set on the available water rivers coasts but can be increased with things like granaries etc definitely an improvement combat movement is overhauled now if you want to climb a hill you can t spend 1 movement point on an ending turn you have to either have enough movement points or be on the starting move tile this completely changes how fights work out this can be a little frustrating when you re used to marching spearmen over hills but overall i think it s a more clear representation of spending movement points it does however slow reinforcements and army mobility down which can slow gameplay a little the new civics tree and great person aquisition is also much better the game is more dynamic with the 2 tech trees separating technology and government and great people have an ergonomic section built in to see progress art style is all cartoony now at first i hated this since then it s grown on me civ 5 s style is very nice but once you start to get used to all the new designs the civ 6 style i feel looks very polished and easy on the eyes city states were overhauled you use envoys that you earn from the civics tree and influence points to gain city state s favour i think this is a much better and more controlled mechanic than the money throwing method civ 5 implemented spies are now more like units than an extra feature able to carry out a number of tasks such as sabotaging rocketry preventing science victories stealing techs as before stealing gold production etc these spies are a lovely change to the straightforward civ5 spies and makes non war civ interaction more interesting a negative to mention is that the ai s have seen little to no improvement from civ 5 they are needlessly aggressive to the point where if you go to war with someone they also all hate they will happily drop all ties with you and scream warmonger as loud as they can the warmonger penalties are huge and unrealistic all ai s seem to hate every other ai and player and it s a particularly boring and confusing way for them to act when it would clearly be in their better interests to turn a blind eye and trade for luxuries instead there are a few workshop mods to help this but i think it needs more attention from the developers another setback is no cross platform compatibility i initially bought this to play with my friend and i can t because pc and mac versions are different feasibly they ll eventually be the same once the mac developement catches up so hopefully this will sort itself out the performance is a little demanding for a turn based strategy game probably moreso than civ 5 so if you don t have a war machine watch out overall i d recommend it over civ 5 although the ai are just about worse the gameplay is much better and civ 5 ai are not exacty anything to praise rise and fall dlc rise and fall causes a huge change to the pace of the game the biggest change is the loyalty mechanic causing cities founded too far away or too close to other civs to rebel unless you keep under control with governers this was a lovely design choice and addresses why your own cities blindly follow orders there are also dark and golden eras relying on era points you gain by doing thigns such as buildings wonders or meeting people etc this change adds a nice new dynamic to consider during gameplay but i personally think the eras should not be so hard set in what age you get ie a darker dark progressive golden sorta thing it also tweaks many wonders and policy types to balance the game i d recommend if it s on a decent sale but it s a bit heavy on price without one
