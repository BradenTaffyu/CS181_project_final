2017 early access review even though the game is still in alpha its still a great game with lots of content you can do anything you want you have 3 big challenges lots of scenarios free roam time trial and soon campaign will come to beamng you can do races make your own scenarios crash the cars or just explore the maps from the game also there are lots of mods available on the internet and you can install new maps vehicles including even boats and airplanes scenarios and even objects the maps are well made and also quite big especially the west coast usa and utah maps the damage system is amazing and also very realistic i just love to see how cars are destroyed after hitting a wall at 300km h the cars are also well made and you have tons of customization options for them the bad part is that the optimization is not so good but if you have a powerful pc then this shouldn t be a problem should you buy this game yes
