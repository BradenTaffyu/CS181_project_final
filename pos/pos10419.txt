2023 great game absolutey brutal though takes real dedication to learn the game and become proficient at it not even good just good enough to complete races and not launch yourself off track at random points every other race if you have a wheel it is a must buy will get you up to speed on cicuit racing while not having to do any modding i do suggest getting your wheel set up well briankoponen website has really good guides for pretty much all sim games for wheel force feedback settings it takes time but the effort is rewarding because the skills learned transfer and it gives you a nice progression path as well as a solid single player for you to run as many laps and test as much as you want with ease
