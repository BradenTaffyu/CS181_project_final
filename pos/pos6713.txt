2019 i love driving but i have yet to receive my driving licence too lazy to apply for one with this game i can at least have some driving experience and have fun at the same time wonderful game overall never get tired of driving around a cup of tea and this game would be perfect for me to past time nothing really beats the hum of an engine and the gentle cruising on a highway if you like driving cars like me never fails to paint a huge smile on my face if you want to get rich in this game it would take quite a bit of time and effort however it is all worthwhile when you finally make enough dough to go on joyrides around the map takes quite awhile to master but still fun while you learn to drive i only wish i could wash the truck service the truck get out of the truck for strolls shop in grocery stores at petrol stations buy food in the game its been at least 1 year or more since i posted this review and i am still in the same situation but i got much more richer in game xd
