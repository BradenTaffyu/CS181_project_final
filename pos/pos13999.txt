2018 early access review a shining paragon of how early access should be done perfect communication with the community wonderful huge improvements right on schedule not surprisingly this makes fantastic games the devs have such a knack for game design in such a complicated game there are lots of ways it could fall short but unlike similar games you never hit that moment of how the hell can i accomplish what i want with these stunted controls and menus just remarkable if you like engineer y type games like factorio rimworld space engineers you ll love it
