2020 early access review i spend roughly 5 hours a week using this i would recommend putting on some good music and trying it out even for half an hour a day it is pretty customizable has plenty of modes is constantly being worked on and the discord server is full of great people with specific channels dedicated to help you if you have any problems you can simply report them with the in game bug reporter it provides a detailed run down of all of the stats at the end round screen what you are bad at what you re good at precision accuracy etc there is an ai learning feature that takes information from your past rounds and applies it to the next changing the size speed and location of the orbs i haven t used it very much because i tend to just use the same six tasks but i can see it being very helpful for kicking bad aiming habits all that and it s free pretty much a definite must have if you think you need to improve your aim i personally have improved over the past few months of use and would highly recommend it if you re not willing to spend money on kovaak s or another trainer this basically has all the needed functions and more if you consider ai training a couple quick tips 1 remove the gun model with the option in the settings it can be very distracting and the animations are very boring and bland to look at 2 reduce the firing sound volume or turn off all volume entirely for the same reason as above if you use this software all the time the sound can be very boring bland or even annoying the music is the same 60 second loop as well 3 do not use it to warm up for more than an hour if you spend too long warming up you may burn out before even playing the game you are warming up for at least this is what i experienced when using it recommended 30 minutes a day give or take 4 don t trust leaderboard score s in any of the ultimate mode s because of the varying sizes of the orbs the scores are not 100 accurate and there are even some scoring glitches like where someone s score is higher than yours but has less accuracy and destroyed less targets all in all i think it s a good fps addition even to a new players arsenal i hope this review helped and have a good day
