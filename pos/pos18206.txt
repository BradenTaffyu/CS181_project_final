a very good sequel which improved on the base game the new engine makes it so there is no more lag late game the factions are definitely more diverse as well with unique mechanics that go with each of them and more uniqueness in the sub factions if you were also there since the technical preview of the game you could see the game evolve and the devs listened to peoples complaints which is most notable in the tec ship style which alot of people at the beginning thought looked to plasticy cartoonish but the devs updated to look much better now would definitely recommend for anyone who loved the first one or just like rts in general 9 10 dont have space pony faction
