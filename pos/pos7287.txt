2016 being someone who thoroughly enjoyed ets2 this game was equally if not more enjoyable pros trucking now requires more skill trucks harder to maneuver good graphical detail requires decent gpu cons there are now active police cars on the road no more 175km h on the highway where there are no speed cameras if you enjoyed the scenery in ets2 particularly scandinavia then you may find the scenery in ats underwhelming this is by no means a complete game with only 3 of the us states having been implemented however this does not mean this is not an enjoyable game there were initially a few issues with this game but i have found that most of these have been ironed out through updates not really a con but once again you will find yourself in situations with a truck with a significantly longer wheelbase compared to ets2 and an extremely long trailer in which you will find it very difficult to clear traffic obstacles etc overall a great game and definitely recommended to those who liked eurotruck simulator 1 2 and to those of you who prehaps didn t find ets2 ets2 as fun as you would have liked american truck simulator may very well change your opinion of scs truck simulators i am really looking forward to the release of more truck companies and of course wider map coverage to include more than the 3 us states that are currently in game i know this game is still in the early stages of map development and i haven t looked into the developer s intentions but i would love to see this map to expand out to include not only all the states of the usa but surrounding countries such as canada maybe including alaska mexico and so on maybe as dlc as that would be quite an effort
