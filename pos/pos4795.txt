2023 with so many reviews of fallout 4 posted there is really nothing new to say i played fallout 1 and 2 back in the day and loved both i was skeptical of the newer titles as my action skills are not stellar as a result it took me years to get around to jumping into this game had i known i could play on easy mode i might have tried it out sooner within a few hours it became my new favorite game and i spent a ridiculous amount of time in the wasteland the variety of quests locations and characters is just staggering and i feel as though i barely scratched the surface despite getting 100 of the achievements and experiencing multiple endings it is definitely a game with a huge amount of replay value the next time i have 200 hours to spare i will dive back in with a different character and a new approach i loved the apocalyptic environment if you are familiar with boston it is very cool to wander in a familiar albeit ruined landscape the story was fun to unravel and i loved having dogmeat by my side forget traveling with people robots or mutants give me a good dog any day if you have any skill for action adventures and have missed this game you owe it to yourself to give it a try i should add that i played the vanilla version without mods and had a few crashes along the way i got in the habit of saving my game often and never lost any substantial amount of progress i bought the package that included all dlcs which i enjoyed as well in order to get all achievements
