2023 it would be redundant to be the millionth person to discuss the merits of this game so i m going to share a short story instead how the ai pulled a play so insane that me and my friends are still bringing it up whenever we discuss strategies in turn based games during a late game fight an enemy casted shackles of pain on our ranger the squishiest member of our party the spell makes it so that every point of damage taken is reflected onto the target discouraging targeting that specific person until the spell expires to avoid causing damage to another party member after taking a couple hits our poor ranger was very low on health and i gave the suggestion to just try to run away from the fight and hopefully get far enough to disengage from it two enemies a fighter and the caster started to give chase but due to their lack of mobility skills they couldn t make it to him noticing the distance and the fact that shackles of pain would expire the following turn the ai did the unthinkable the fighter hits and crits the shackles of pain caster reflecting the damage on our ranger and killing him the only think that stopped us from screaming in amazement was the fact that we were playing very late at night on that interaction alone i give this game my highest recommendation
