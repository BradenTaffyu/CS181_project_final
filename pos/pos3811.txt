tldr great srpg certainly good enough to pick up the dlc for another play through at the next difficulty level thanks humble choice couple of gripes but the positives first took twice as long to finish the campaign as i probably should have because really interesting and flexible squad system if more than half the units in a squad are the same type you ll get the benefits of using that type which opens up a ton of options most walking units can catch a ride with your cavalry or a few heavy units can sneak around with a light squad and participate in ambushes there are some exceptions dragons can t ride allied horses for example interesting item system each is used by your entire squad which exponentially increases possibilities when tinkering with your army most seem useful but several have way too much downside or are so niche that when the time comes for them to be applicable you ll forget they exist 60 hps to take 35 less damage from archers and firearms or 50 hps for 16 magic for example maybe if we knew how the damage calculations worked more on that later can spend a few minutes swapping around units and items trying to squeeze every last bit of strength out of your squads then look at the clock and realize it s been two hours or more resources are well balanced you won t feel too stretched but can t just buy everything maybe you have to decide between that unique artifact or high tier mercenary speaking of which the unique mercenaries seem well designed they get an extra skill and feel strong but not overpowered you may find some that make great squad leaders if you can afford them regular mercenaries can come with good skills and may occasionally be useful combat animations are quick and interesting enough never felt a need to turn them off watching what s happening can help to devise new strategies and squad formations a redo turn button is always available so you won t be punished for misclicks or major mistakes during battles comprehensive in game guide covers almost everything only had to google a few times trying to figure out some nuances i don t play games like this for the story but it was compelling enough to feel invested in the characters with closure at the end some neutral things morale system can be a bit finicky winning combat means higher morale and more damage on subsequent fights losing battles has the opposite effect i set up a heavy spear squad with a few healers to counter enemy cavalry when several appeared it was their time to shine sent them up front and they performed even better than expected not a single unit lost while killing several members of each enemy squad but their morale kept dropping with every attack i guess it s the game s way of saying they re tired after a few attacks they were doing almost no damage because of low morale the in game guide says morale can be hurt via combat defeats so i m not really sure what happened not a huge deal was able to mop up the remaining cavalry on my next turn with other units while my still fully alive and healed heavy spearmen were shattered the lowest morale individual units are pretty good about targets in the enemy squad but if you re not careful with formations and or which enemy squads you attack you can do a lot of overkill damage and leave several enemy units untouched as an example say you have an entire squad of assassins probably never would and the enemy has 3 units on their front line 2 in the middle and 1 in the back assassins always attack the rear most units on their first offensive turn so all 9 could target the back line unit depending on how the middle line is positioned which would probably be killed by the first attack the opposite could be true if you had units of the same type that only attacked the front line and the enemy squad was in reverse there is a turn order for attacks for each different type of unit so you d almost have to be trying to create a scenario where you lost a significant amount of damage output but it could happen each unit has an affinity tied to an element which affects their stats earth gives extra hps as an example the system is fine and adds another strategic layer to customization but there are clearly some affinities that are better for certain unit types in most situations the issue is when picking up rank one conscripts most of your army the little guys who you build up you can only see one of each type at a time and they each have their own affinity after hiring one fighter a new fighter pops up with a random affinity if you re specifically looking for a fire fighter not that kind a fire affinity fighter silly you may have to roll through several the issue is it s always better to save scum don t get the affinity you re looking for just reload either that or potentially hire dozens of guys you won t use since you can t effectively take them in to the next combat and they ll be out leveled by the new conscripts after the next mission an option to choose affinity when hiring conscripts not the mercenaries would resolve this issue and i don t see how that would be over tuned since you ll probably be save scumming anyway if you re in to muscle mommies let s see thick thighs check dump truck check corset several sizes too small double check interesting that the game can be played with one hand using only a mouse couple of gripes limited opportunities for combat and experience gains there are only the main story missions a few side missions and arena battles which require tokens arena tokens are pretty rare and the result is if you change your mind about squad composition and want to train up some new units the best way to go about it is trade all your tokens down to bronze then probably get shot by archers over and over not ideal since experience is almost completely hard capped when your squad is a few levels above the enemy a training ground where you can t get loot enemy levels are set to bronze arena level and can t surrender would be helpful then if you change your mind about some units and want to train others there s an option running platinum arenas would feel much better maybe even make the tokens untradeable would probably make permadeath mode easier but that doesn t seem to be the intended way to play there s not even an achievement for it losing gold units would still be a hit there very minor spoiler you can buy unlimited arena tokens before the last mission not sure why there s such a 180 in game design maybe so you don t brick your save with an under tuned squad on the last fight but it s ok to get stuck before that every calculation is hidden this is actually a pretty major issue for this type of game it s impossible to have any confidence in decisions about skills and gear when you don t know the actual outcome of any of it do i go with the 15 skill item on my light ambush squad or is 7 strength better no way to really have any idea which is ideal since we don t know any of the calculations behind the numbers it seems the entire system is intentionally left abstract as part of the game design this works fine on normal difficulty where you can keep it simple with heavy guys up front a healer or two and a few damage dealers both items in the example would have some kind of benefit it s just not possible to know how much the damage calculations should be available for those who are interested in maximizing their squads or trying out the hardest difficulty these weren t deal breakers on normal difficulty we ll see how the next one up goes maybe potentially bricking a save with an under tuned squad is intended design just picked up the legends dlc and looked through the new units interesting stuff should have dozens more hours played in the next week or so
