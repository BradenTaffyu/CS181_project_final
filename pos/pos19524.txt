2016 i ve always heard that people liked fallout 3 better than new vegas to me it should be the other way around new vegas is better that fallout 3 in countless ways the story is much more complex than fallout 3 s story in fallout 3 it was as simple as brotherhood good guys and enclave bad guys new vegas has a nonlinear choose your own path storyline help caesar s legion conquer new vegas give the ncr control over new vegas and the hoover dam or fight for an independent new vegas there are also numerous smaller factions that you can join or fight there is a massive amount of player involvement in the world and your actions in one faction may affect your reputation with another not only does this make the game s story more interesting it also gives the game immense replay value did the capitol wasteland in fallout 3 feel empty i know that it takes place in the aftermath of a global nuclear war but the world of fallout 3 felt barren and boring in new vegas there are plenty of locations to explore and loot around the mojave wasteland the weapon variety in fallout 3 pales in comparison to new vegas fallout 3 had about 50 different types of weapons whereas new vegas has over twice as many fallout new vegas actually allows the player to look down the sights of the gun they are holding rather than the zooming in effect that fallout 3 had if you liked 3 s method of aiming better then don t worry you can toggle ironsights in fallout 3 you could only repair weapons up to a certain point and that point was determined by the repair skill in new vegas weapons can be repaired to 100 no matter the repair skill the repair skill instead determines how efficient you are at repairing a gun for example a person with a repair level of 80 would need less materials to repair a weapon than a person who had a repair level of 30 fallout 3 has almost no color whatsoever most of the time the screen is filled with a dull gray even when looking at what should be a gorgeous sunrise the world is bathed in gray new vegas has much more color compared to fallout 3 which is admittedly not very difficult to accomplish granted it s nowhere near as colorful and vivid as fallout 4 but at least the player doesn t have to stare at the world through a monotonous gray filter all the time i will concede that the dlcs in fallout 3 are interesting however new vegas dlcs tell much better stories in addition to their own individual stories the dlcs in new vegas all tell the story of another courier ulysses in each dlc the player finds out more and more of ulysses story and learns more and more about who he is until the confrontation in the lonesome road dlc to be honest ulysses story is much better the second time through when you can catch all the minor details in new vegas unwanted ammunition can be broken down and crafted into different ammuntion allowing the player to destroy ammo for a weapon that is rarely used in order to create ammo for a weapon that the player uses frequently the option of hardcore mode in new vegas presents an added challenge if the game seems too simple or easy the player muust manage their hydration food and sleep if they neglect any of these for too long they suffer negative effects and ultimately die nearly all of these points add to the replay value of the new vegas which is something that fallout 3 did not do very well in new vegas you can side with different factions use different weapons explore different areas complete different quests learn different things etc overall new vegas feels like more thought went into its production despite only being in development for a year and a half
