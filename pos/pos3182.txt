it s all a tiny part of this huge game i could spend hours telling you about the huge amount of perk and spell combinations in this game or the fact that depending on your race skills and decisions many quests can be completed in any way you want if you need to kill a man but he is sitting in a tavern where there are a bunch of people cook him a chowder for which he will get diarrhea and then just kill him in the back alley this is a game that in the story you get the ability to see and talk to the dead so you can dig up someone s grave its owner poe wishes you a good day or you can come to a sawmill and talk to the sign of an elf tree because it s been sawn and now it s dead so it all makes sense divinity original sin 2 perfect game if you adore replayability and possibility there s a simple test for a quality rpg ask yourself and your friends if you can rp for the big gay lizard in this game if the answer is no then don t waste your time on this game because it s obvious that its creators have never played a real rpg can the game be called good yes i would even say that the game is too good for the modern world while other developers are just talking about freedom and possibilities larian studios is just doing and they re not going to stop and as long as they are bouncer s dad will be satisfied 3the little dog told me he loved me and gave me a task and the dragon i freed from the witch and he said be my dragon queen larion studios thank you 15 10
