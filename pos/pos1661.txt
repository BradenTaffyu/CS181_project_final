2017 i have to admit when i first started this game i thought that i would nt go to far with it for me the pc keyboard controls are not what i m used to how ever the more i ploded along with it i really grew to like and enjoy it i guess you do fall in love with the three characters 2b 9s and a2 all with slightly different quests i m not sure how other people went but i have invested 113 hours into this game guess i did like it thank god for those travel transporters this game with its major endings has left it wide open for a follow on and not just a spin off i really enjoyed this game and highly recommend it
