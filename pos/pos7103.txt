2016 comparing this to ets2 when that was released and its alot easier to see how far of an improvement this game is from the in game ai to the parking locations i see alot of people complaining this game is poor with no content etc yet the same people was demanding the game be released you cannot have the best of both worlds now considering this game is only the beginning of long term investment 14 99 for 2 trucks and 3 states after the arizona dlc is added isn t bad at all and considering it takes around 10 hours to earn enough for the 1st truck if you don t take a loan there is alot of game time and return on investment i look forward to the road ahead because look at ets2 and where that is today with multiple dlcs and continued developer and mod support shows where this game is heading and that is an exciting prospect the future looks great for this game and i cannot wait and once steam workshop is added as pavel said then you will have unlimited potential from a 15 game in short this game provides more than some aaa titles do at launch its isn t broken and it is going to be well supported moving forward with developers who care about the gamers enough to even get steam to release a day early
