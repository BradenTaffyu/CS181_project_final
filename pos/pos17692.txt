2016 now i have to admit i ve been a total war fan since rome 1 but the last few titles had issues for me not so with warhammer though i find the inability to claim all territories irritating the fact mods allow me to from day 1 as well as co op racing with friends is a big plus for me gameplay wise it s a beautiful game i have to run on low spec due to an older system but it still looks great i love the vampire counts and yes if you build your province right you can field a massive host i m about to do battle with 3 terrorgheist i had no issue on start up always a plus there and the races feel unique which i love in short if your a fan of warhammer hit this up and enjoy the power of magic which is amazing to be honest if not a fantasy fan at least try it you may be surprised
