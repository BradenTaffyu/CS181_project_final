2021 very relaxing experience few years back i could not understand how such type of game can be enjoyable but something changed i tried it and liked a lot when you want to listen to some podcasts or audio books while having simple repetitive and pleasant couch gameplay ats is for you just download a demo try it out maybe it fits you too the only downside with scs software s development model they have a prety much old engine visuals sometimes are very basic new regions are dlcs but they have better models and textures often for that reason i can t recommend euro truck simulator 2 it looks to me very ugly at times although they try to update old regions but overall it s just not a very beautiful game series but ats is better in this regard at least
