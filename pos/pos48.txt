stardew valley is a very special game to me it was one of the first games i ever played on steam it helped to ground and distract me when i was going through depression and rough patches in my life i think the charm of the game is its simplicity beautiful music relationships with villagers and cute animals you just seem to slip through time and forget your worries i used to play with a special person who became my best friend and rock but we have drifted apart and don t talk anymore sometimes when i miss the memories i visit our old save and reminisce about the past if you ever read this i hope that you re healthy and radiating with happiness please hug kiss and catch up with loved ones make the most out of the present overall beautiful game please buy it
