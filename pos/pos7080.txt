2019 ultimately i left american truck simulator thankful that it was more of the same hop in a truck drive where i m told to drive and see some sights whiz past as someone who sunk countless hours into euro truck simulator 2 a fresh coat of paint an unfamiliar set of sights and the challenge of driving on the wrong opposite side of the road left me confident that i ll be sinking just as many hours into american truck simulator it s not all of america right now but it s an exciting start while not much has changed from ets 2 to american truck simulator the few improvements are helpful there isn t enough here that really changed though from game to game if you enjoyed the last one this is a lot more of the same right down to the level up screen and hiring drivers menu it s not a bad game at all but it essentially more of an expansion rather than a new game still if this type of game interests you at all it is definitely worth a pick up american truck simulator is a game i ll be investing plenty of time into and since it s priced fairly i m happy to invest more cash into it as well see you on the road
