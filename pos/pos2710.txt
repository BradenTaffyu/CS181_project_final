2018 most animals in modern rpgs player clicks cat cat meow sound end dialogue divinity original sin 2 player with pet pal skill clicks cat narrator as you approach a stray cat it looks up to you with its pupils thin as a needle cat tis a terrible day innit shows dialogue options divinity original sin 2 has reached new heights of what it is to be expected on huge indie games made by larian studios it was able to level with aaa games that it even surpasses the standards regardless of its flaws you ll play as your own character in the story and embark on a journey towards the world of rivellon as you find the answer to the cause of the void s awakening you could also play as one of the six main characters with their own unique story if character creation is not your thing also quicksaving before doing anything else is a must talk to someone quicksave first interacting an item quicksave first opening a door quicksave after an autosave quicksave reviewthe game is very similar to its previous title divinity original sin dos1 there may be changes but there s nothing too drastic as far as i ve observed storydos2 moved towards a more interesting plot while it still does have dos1 s lighthearted haha s the studio was able to put the humor at the right spot in a way they re able to make a decently captivating tale for an rpg what s so interesting about the plot s flow is that the game doesn t make you feel like you need to save the world because when you want to go somewhere doing so will progress your main story the linearity is barely present that i didn t even know which quest i should keep my focus on my first playthrough it s quite unfortunate for me at least how the game treats the party interaction on the whole story as it progresses because it had less interaction back in dos1 s party interaction you re able to choose a dialogue for everyone dos2 removed that feature and only allows you to choose a dialogue for your main character only however in turn they added an attitude system so your party members and everyone else in the game have their own morals and beliefs in the end it sadly lowers the replayability gameplayon the matter of the game s quest system i become lost throughout my first playthrough given that most of your progress relates to the main story a quest that i ve ignored for an in game day since i m focusing on a particular quest at that time suddenly updates along with the quest i m currently taking there are some cases during an update to my current quest a new quest opens up in my journal in a long run the quest log became flooded to a point that i don t know which quest would i continue the turn based combat system is really great given how there s hundreds of skills and hardly countable ways of killing an enemy the fact that good positioning actually gives an advantage it s hard to get bored of it unlike many turn based games the original sin series shines on how your surroundings affect you and your enemy s strategy the lit torch stand the oil puddle poured near an explosive barrel the sea shore everything is interactive in dos2 the height advantage was a great addition the game s challenge is the one that sparks its replayability it s not just how unfair some items skills are it s the moment when the ai actually knows how where and when to use the environment and situation to their advantage once you ve come up with a different build their playstyle changes they are annoyingly smart that sometimes they re three turns ahead of you if you re not aware enough carelessly set a trap mine near an enemy one of them will then teleport you on top of it enemies even face behind a wall just so your rogue character can t backstab him her although there is a time when a hazardous area is too wide the ai keeps on walking around the said area until they die instead of just standing still it has its awful moments sadly aestheticscomparing the two of the series dos2 was able to utilize more graphical features which made it far more detailed than dos1 it shifted from a cartoony colorful vibe into a more realistic and bleak environment even so the graphics were decent at best the music score is an improvement from the previous title just comparing the two themes you could say that they have more budget this time haha it s interesting how you could select your character s instrument theme so you could hear a particular instrument on certain occasions depending on what you chose for one of your characters as much as how catchiness goes however it s not as grand as what i always hear from bioware and bethesda games for short dos2 s music is ingenuinely good sample ost i personally liked youtube video dancing with the source cello version views 97 726 provided to youtube by believe sas dancing with the source cello version borislav slavov borislav slavov divinity original sin 2 original soundtrack black screen records released on for a game that lacks flashy cgi cinematics they were able to compensate it with the expressive voice dialogues you ve gotta hand it to the voice actors and scriptwriters for making their characters and npcs feel alive it s interesting how most of them have something to say inside and outside of the conversation featuresfor a turn based game the playability is good besides the 4 player multiplayer there s couch co op and controller support the game is playable in any way but 3 4 splitscreen multiplayer yet it s still rare to find such accessibility this time around in video games game master mode is a cool feature that you can t believe it s included on the standard game though i m not fond of dungeons and dragons it really seems that s what it s trying to make out of this game mode in my case this is a casual dnd that includes the game s character abilities and such arena mode is quite fun besides the fact that you could play online there s an offline mode called hot seat where you and your fellow players play in one device lastly i have a slight feeling that the classic edition was unnecessary since it removes a ton of new dialogues and enemy encounters along with the updated user interface for controller users from the definitive edition it just adds up more space on your hard drive verdict good ok bad topicdetailsratingstory non linear story progression simple story plot decent character lore different endings

everyone to love it s neither an action rpg like diablo that the majority wanted nor a hardcore rpg like baldur s gate it s definitely not for those who hates reading a lot of texts as well i would recommend this to anyone who for once has played and liked turn based games because this one s the best of the genre as i m writing this review
