2023 got this game from a bundle sale i had this game sitting in my library for a very very long time at first i really didn t get where the fun of this game was i played like an hour when i first got it then uninstalled it right away many many years had passed since then just a few weeks ago i saw a video talking about this game and decided to give it another try i first played a few hours with a xbox controller while listening to my favorite music i didn t think the driving and the process of getting to the destination was fun but once i arrived at the destination i felt some sort of accomplishment so i arbitrarily decided to get a set of logictech g923 with gear shifter hoping that it would enhance the driving a little bit boy did it change the entire experience i am so glad i got the wheel set instead of just giving the game up again learning to drive the truck fully manual with the wheel set was such an enjoyable experience and once i started to get a hang of it it became really satisfying just feeling the smooth transitions between gears highly recommend a wheel set with feature like true force so you can feel the vibration from the engine on your wheel i even went further and purchased a tobii eye 5 tracker and set the system up with a 47 tv for more immersion i probably won t go beyond this setup as it has already made the game incredibly enjoyable for me though it looks cool to have a 3 tv and fully decorated truck interior setup for sure another thing that turned this game into a masterpiece is the amount of mods it has i have so many map mods installed i literally have the entire world on my map and some of those map mods are just incredibly well made the views are just breathtaking my playtime probably doesn t seem that convincing compared to others that already have hundred or thousand of hours but this game is already my go to game whenever i had a long coding session over stressing my brain and just wanna relax and zone out when i play this game i don t feel like i am playing a video game i feel like i am meditating i just drive mindlessly admiring the views while listening to lo fi music on spotify occasionally i would put on an audiobook instead of music so i can digest some of that massive audiobook backlog i have from audible though i guess i won t have any time left for my massive steam backlog then anyways if you are looking for something mindless and chill this is that game get a wheel set and you won t regret it
