2016 total war rome ii emperor edition is a historical turn based rts game based in ancient rome i thoroughly enjoy playing this game and perhaps this review will persuade you to try it out and hopefully enjoy it rome ii is a sequel to the famous rome total war game it s a part of one of the largest historical strategy game franchises to date total war games are similar to the classic board games risk and axis and allies so if you enjoy playing those games you should feel right at home here it is true that as of late the total war franchise has the infamous reputation of rushed releases however i find that this game after over two years of being out has come a long way it may still not be what people expected at release but it s definitely come a long way there are mainly two parts of this game the grand campaign and the multiplayer the grand campaign lets you play as multiple types of factions ranging from rome to barbarian to all sorts of others each faction has unique units that all have their strongpoints and weaknesses when you start off you can come from a small state with a handful of soldiers to domination of the ancient world as you make your way from the bottom to the top you ll have to deal with foreign threats these threats can range from other nations declaring war on yours all the way to widespread hunger across entire provinces a grand campaign completed game can last from a couple of days speedrunners to months of hard work and effort so you should be able to get a large amount of playtime out of this game if you like it grand campaign playthroughs may or may not get repetitive based on what you classify as repetitive in my honest opinion the campaign can have very rich gameplay that does not involve doing the same boring task over and over the battles against the ai can become a bit repetitive but that s only if you exploit their dumb nature the ai in this game is by no means the best out there but it s definitely improved from the release the ai can sometimes be incredibly smart and display great ingenuity but they have a bad habit of running headlong into a pike phalanx not to mention misusing artillery chariots and elephants on mroe than one occassion this doesn t mean the campaign can t be fun against just ai it s incredibly fun for me at least especially on very hard or legendary modes the multiplayer in my eyes this is where rome ii truly shines the multiplayer is where you can go onto servers or create your own where you can battle other players with factions of your choosing this can range from 1v1s all the way up to 4v4s connection issues is a common problem among multiplayer games considering you re playing with people from all around the world however the sheer amount of units you can have on one single battlefield when you have multiple factions going against eachother is insane this can definitely cause major lag and a lot of times people ragequit when it s so bad everythings in slowmotion or the framerate is below 15 like i said earlier each faction has their own unique set of units for their choosing this makes for very dynamic gameplay especially in multiplayer no faction is the same granted there are very similar factions but they still have their unique ups and downs with these in mind you can choose from dozens of factions to find your right playstyle if it s tanky sword infantry that can still pack a punch you re in it with rome if you like to cripple people with charges you can go with barbarians or cav heavy factions if you like to use pikemen to protect valuable skirmishers to pick at enemies from a distance then you can go greek factions these are just a handful of examples of how dynamic the multiplayer battle gameplay can be you can also play multiplayer campaigns this goes for quite the interesting time play with your friends as allies or enemies multiplayer campaigns can be a lot of fun if you can get your friends to play with you random people joining isn t really recommended as you probably couldn t play an entire campaign playthrough in one session one of the biggest problems i have with the multiplayer campaign is the fact that when the other players turn cames around you just have to sit there for 5 to 10 minutes you just sit there doing absolutely nothing you can use this time to your advantage by trying to help your friend out with what you two should plan with the help of your trusty paintbrushes but normally you just sit there like a lot of multiplayer games voicechatting can really help it might also help make the time it takes for the other player to play his turn go by with a bit more excitement this game has a serious learning curve to it so if you really want to get into this game and know how to counter things with the right tools then it may take you a lot of playtime and a lot of watching videos this isn t necessarily a bad thing but for those of you who like to just sit down right away after getting a game and then being good at it in the first 10 hours then you may be out of luck here in my opinion the large learning curve just makes for more time to enjoy this game the battles the battles are probably one of the main reasons why you re looking into this game with thousands of soldiers at your command you can fight equal amounts smaller amounts or overwhelming larger amounts of enemy troops in a dynamic game of intense strategy and timing you ll have to move your troops around to effectively counter the troops they have in a certain place make sure you have backups move those backups in when necessary and strike at the most opportune moments learning all of the stats of every unit is a big help knowing the stats will greatly benefit what you know will kill and what you know will not kill an enemy unit with the smallest amount of casualties on your end you can see why there s such a large learning curve now overall this game is relatively well optimized for my pc the game runs into a bit of trouble when there are 6 000 units on the battlefield at once but to be honest that much is to be expected at max graphics i can get a steady 50 fps in normal battles on the campaign map i get lower frames around the 30s or so so if you want solid frames all around go with a lower graphical setting and you should be fine this game is very fun and i recommend it to you as well especially if you re a strategy game fan to me 9 10 i love itto strategy fans 9 10 definitely look into itto average gamer 8 10 this game is a lot of fun
