2021 your first question is probably is this a good game now is this a no man s sky situation where the developers did not abandon their game and decided to patch it up and update it enough so that it s good in short yes i played the game for 200 hours 6 months after release and then over 200 hours 2 5 years after release performance wise 6 months it crashed at least once twice a day 5 6 times on average it also disconnected from servers randomly around 5 10 times a day 2 5 years during the 200 hours it crashed maybe 5 times and disconnected 2 or 3 times the pc is literally the same in both cases with the exception that i was using windows 7 back in 2019 and am now using windows 10 in summation stability isn t a problem at all anymore the fallout 1st subscription is not pay to win but it is pay to gain huge convenience so much so that now i cannot imagine playing without the scrapbox or access to private servers having a survival tent on a new character cuts the travel time a lot further the 1650 free atoms you receive monthly is the best bang for your buck on atoms you can get fo76 has the most beautiful and varied map ever in a fallout game it s divided into 5 areas the forest the starter area self explanatory toxic valley a large flat area covered in white gray ash looks the most like areas in previous fallout games ash heap a hilly miner area covered in ash and with toxic air savage divide a mountain region the mire a swamp stuck in perpetual autumn during sundown with varying shades of orange and yellow or at night in buildings where the darkness is jet black my favorite cranberry bog a large flat area with trenches and alien looking forests before the npcs were introduced in wastelanders the game was creepy af all you had were notes and holotapes from people that died horribly or were turned into the scorched you had to puzzle together what happened to everyone from scraps of information you were feeling in constant danger not being 100 sure whether you are actually safe from the disaster that wiped out the humans however due to the outcry about having no npcs dialogues skill checks etc a ton of both were added to the world especially to the starter area the storyline was officially pushed a year after vault 76 had opened to accommodate a plot thread about people returning to appalachia the holotapes and notes commenting about missing people are still there but so are the humans which ruined the creepy apocalyptic vibe the game had previously no need to puzzle anything anymore since the npcs straight up tell you what occurred fortunately there are some storylines that survived the rpg upgrade e g the entire complex political and business story surrounding the hornwrights which includes the free states miner strikes earthquakes and even child kidnappings which spans over a dozen locations and tons of holotapes notes and or terminal entries the separate threads of the story are so well intertwined you ll be shocked at how well written it is without the use of npcs or dialogue the biggest problem still present in the game after 2 years is the lack of meaningful endgame you have tons of endgame gear but no endgame dungeon or even true boss which would require top of the line equipment to tackle all of the most difficult challenges do not require the most powerful weapons or armor high tier yes but not the best unless you want to solo them this makes grinding for the mentioned endgame gear kind of pointless another issue i have are legacy weapons legacy weapons are old legendary weapons which do not drop anymore because they were ridiculously overpowered so much so that people who do not know about them might think a player using these weapons is hacking bethesda did not remove them entirely so as not to upset players who earned them fair and square but that has got to be the dumbest decision ever most of the time legacy weapon users arrive at a public event just to spray their sh t all over killing enemies nearly instantly along with the fun of all the other participating players there aren t many of them but they do bring down the game a bit as for nuclear winter it s a battle royale mode and i have an intense dislike towards br games so my opinion doesn t matter much i only played it for the achievements and never touched it again overall i think it s well worth the try
