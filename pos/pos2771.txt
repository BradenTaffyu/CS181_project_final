2017 remark 1 i never tried the game in ea i knew it was wiser to wait for full release so everything here bases on the final thingremark 2 i don t give a damn about hype or hate i usually don t read a single word about a game prior to purchase and decide to purchase based on experience and judgement of the presentation and due to high age and experience i usually don t fail there hehe woah what a masterpiece rpg i really already liked the first dos and its predecessors although completly different too and i m not much into turn based top down more or less i know it s 3d rpgs at all and this time they really managed to drag you into their world many races interesting locations tons of secrets tons of sidequests billions of lines of conversations it s not a perfect game and surely has some tiny flaws but the overall experience damn rocks that love for all those details like at some point there is a pianist ghost which you don t see usually without a skill and beside her is a book of kirill s sigh best songs and you can ask her to play those and she does spent like 15 minutes in that mansion just standing there and listen to kirill s songs that pet pal talent alone is worth a thumbs up it s so enjoyable talking to critters on a map getting hints secrets or even quests or just nonsense pro hint super tiny spoiler try to keep that cat alive at all costs you ll met very soon into the game if you love rpg like or can endure turn based there s no way around this one get it if you dislike rpg or turn based stay the heck away this is not the droid you re looking for the good what to love play as one of the origin characters with their own complete backstory which is highly recommended for your first playthrough but you can still customize your character completly graphics are really neat sfx music is really great sadly no more new obviously tracks from kirill rip man you can talk with animals one of the coolest features ever in an rpg meet snobby cats cynical crabs hopelessly positive dogs etc not only for fun but also for quests hints secrets or for pure distracting amusement awesome feature mods the best thing a game could have you don t like a particular feature get a mod there is none make one every game should have that period this is and often was the distinct feature that seperated pretty good from awesome and long lasting games completely voiced not one sentence is not spoken i know many people don t care but it doesn t hurt either does it i personally like it for added immersion no bugs crashed so far after two complete playthroughs at the moment of this review not even a misaligned texture often many ways to solve a problem for example getting of the first island there are around 11 right different ways to do that sure most are pretty similar and end in more or less the same result but as i often say it s a game and not reality impossible to give you real freedom it still feels like you chose the results many actions do have consequences some minor some major well done turn based from my noobish pov though fights are fun and can range from relaxing to omfg what have i done comparatively short loading times once a map loaded you instantly switch areas like to a cave or whatever else transition very much appreciated nothing kills immersion more than stupid 1 minute loading screen in and out of a cave in not a second yeah great thanks tiny details like being able to make notes on the map very helpful if you discover something that you might be able to solve do pickup catch later you can specialize all of your companions upon you first meet them great detail like one of the characters but don t need their supposed role fine change it no problem end of act 1 when you finally got a grip of things and how this crap works you will get your option to respec every character completely including apprerance yes i love that some of us gamers don t want to put hundreds of hours into one game and multiple walkthroughs and be more efficient in just one walkthrough thanks for that if you hate a feature like that you don t have to use it the mediocre not good not bad but no show stopper either some schools talents skills are somehow pointless and you will never use them good idea bad execution some ambient chatter become very annoying very quickly when you re e g shopping near and micro managing equipment damn stupid npcs from time to time it doesn t really seem to matter much how you re playing be the nice guy or the sociopathic arsewipe some or most encounters are bound to happen anyway either way but well this is a game and not the real world it s impossible to be prepared for everything very high replayability not a pro for people with not much sparetime for gaming many ways to complete quests enough people to form a party and hence change the quests suprises sidequests this might be a big plus if you have much time at your hands if you hate micromanagement you might even be a lil frustrated at the lowest difficulty you will have to manage gear skills talents and spells for four characters nearly every 5 meters when you ve found a new thing lower difficulties are very forgiving though but can still challenge you if you have zero idea of what s going on but if everything s too much for you there are still mods or even cheats no real set items well on the first island there is a set but not wearing the complete set curses you and by the time you ll have it complete it s of no use at all and there isn t even a set bonus reducing this to a boring errand for the completionist the ugly what to hate may kill the fun items rarely really feel unique or great found a legendary yeah well walk 10meters and you ll find the next better one plus most non unique items are random which often results in horribly sucky items intelligence requireing pants with x strength strength requirement ring with x intelligence and some mage stats yeah great for selling boring for example the first set great to aquire requires lot of work details but you ll end up selling that stuff for some coins before even completing it to wear it meh very unsatisfying sometimes it can be hard to even spot your enemies in between turns due to all those status effects on the screen could be worse but could definately be better if you play on higher difficulties you might find some schools classes character combinations pretty useless unfair that might kill it for you but balancing a complex rpg like this perfectly is pretty much impossible to admit no excuse you re to judge crafting sucks no filtering no sorting and you learn new recipes every few meters but i failed to find the need to craft anything besides runes anyway recommended if you can wrap your head around turn based and like rpgs yesyesyesyesyes don t hesitate even if you don t much like top down games you ll quickly forget that i usually prefer 1st person this is one beautifully crafted gem with love for details i d name it the witcher series of turn based isometric rpgs and i m a witcher lover
