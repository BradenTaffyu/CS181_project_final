2023 played 170h of m b warband this is a a barely finished reskin the ai is still dumb as bricks both on the map and in battles i can t imagine why they didn t deem that trash worth working on instead of smithing maybe rushing to engage 500 vs 1200 soldiers and losing half of a kingdom s nobles to defend a town cramming all their infantry and archers on a hill near the edge of the map and waiting there until half are lost to your archers an army or caravan rubberbanding back and forth between your army and the edge of the campaign map when they are cornered same as in warband an over a decade old game this is the biggest flaw for me all this very annoying as one has to rely on ai more than in warband there is a limit to how many workshops you can own after 40h i can have only 4 while having the funds to get a dozen more so you need to create caravans using one of your companions as a leader they make good money but they cost almost as much to create as a workshop and are ai i could not get a net profit on even one caravan before they get ran over creating them in an allied kingdom there is a quest type where a workshop owner wants us to sell his produce in another city since he can t make a profit locally there is a policy of only being able to sell locally and on a set price so we can help him illegally sell elsewhere but we can t ourselves illegally provide our workshops with base materials one has to sell the materials to the town to drive the price down and increase workshop profit even though the quest giver says the price is set what s all this for very little quest variety the dialog is abysmal sieges are way more interesting smithing is a nice addition but can only make melee and thrown weapons combat is still the highlight for me grindy for a single player gamemore troop variety every kingdom culture can have every type of unit for some reason so the north kingdom got cavalry for example the only thing the fabled dragon banner the only main quest in the game gives is the same buff as a cheap generic banner this left early access supposedly
