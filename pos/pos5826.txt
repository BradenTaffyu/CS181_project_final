2021 early access review this game is just honestly incredible my first time playing this game i was a little overwhelmed not really knowing what to do or how to continue improving my character and army but once i finally got the hang of it i ve now enjoyed every minute of my bannerlord adventure if you re new to the m b series you may want to do some tips and tricks for bannerlord videos before jumping in hopefully there is perhaps a bit more involved campaign to help you understand things better as a new player if there is one thing that keeps you coming back for that 1k hours is mods having a game that supports mods keeps you enjoying the game even after doing a full play through the modding community is incredible and i just started checking some out and can honestly say that i haven t even scratched the surface of what this game all brings to the table with some early access games you get the initial release and then new updates can become scarce this is not the case with bannerlord over the past 3 4 months of playing this game i have seen an abundance of updates bringing so much to the game i am so excited to see what comes next i don t normally do reviews but this was so worth my time thank you taleworlds for a great game and looking forward to see what is to come
