2021 early access review gameplay replayability to the extreme hours upon hours of fun good stuff good at parts nothing to remember ping pong is better teardown is the game i ve wanted my whole life ever since the gamecube days you ve seen the trailers you ve seen the gameplay if you re anything like me you ve been itching to get your hands on a game like this for a while now and guess what it s here graphics a reflection of reality gorgeous great better than minecraft it barely passes the test ps1 graphics are better who knew voxels could look this majestic not to mention the ray tracing mwaa magnificent audio better then actual music pretty great better then most games about average nothing special as bad as nails against a chalk board when you step on rock it sounds like rock when you step on wood it sounds like wood from the tires of a monster truck slowly driving on gravel to the waves hitting the shore this game sounds perfect soundtrack buy the soundtrack just buy it i listen to it in my spare time good eeeeehhh just mute it in options nothing silence overall good it s the type of music that doesn t get in your face it s there when it needs to be but more importantly it s not there when it shouldn t be atmosphere it s so dense you could cut it with a knife i take a moment to appreciate it every now and then quite enjoyable it works well enough welp they tried little to none from a misty cold morning on hollowrock to the sun rays hitting the lake cabins in the marina this game is just a sight to behold every building object and corner was hand built and it makes just walking around the levels great fun story you ll deeply invest yourself into it really good enough to not skip the cut scene glimpses of good writing better then hotel mario no story anywhere a story exists but it s easily the weakest part of the game not to say it s bad i like the back and forth feud between the characters but it s mostly there for an excuse to destroy as if we needed one difficulty almost as hard as breathing need an iq higher then 60 nintendo levels of difficulty a good challenge a lot of skill to pass the first level superhuman ai has trouble with this most levels follow the formula gather intel plan a route execute route repeat almost every level is fair with varying difficulty but there are a couple oddballs looking at you fine arts 100 community perfect almost zero toxicity once in a while it can be bad above average but don t expect a lot a lot of good a lot of bad pretty toxic every good player 10 bad they ll kill you first chance they get noticed a few needy and rude people in discussions and similar areas but gotta say most people are kind and just want to have fun bugs not one not a single one noticed a few can happen often persistent in the game too many to count call the exterminator these types of games are usually bound to be quite buggy but teardown has managed to once again blow the competition out of the park pc requirements you could use your monitor to play anything past windows 98 the average computer can play it it s gotta be decently good you re gonna have to be rich be a nasa employee to play i m not very skilled in computer specs and what not so i d recommend watching this video made by 2kliksphilip teardown benchmarked price it s free to play free but has micro transactions full price wait for a sale wait for a mega sale only if you ve bought everything else a game worth 60 dollars priced at 20 what a steal ranking g o t y 8 10 better then average it was ok eh not for me don t bother even looking at it just watching the trailers i knew i d be addicted to this game and i was right i ve beat the campaign but keep coming back for more plus the fact that they re adding stuff for free completely worth the ranking
