2019 best civ game ever made if you are a veteran player to the series you will definitely like it civ vi will blow your mind and if not i m pretty sure it will still manage to impress you if you give it the chance for players who are new to the series at the begining game looks very complicated becasue there are lots of i mean lots of content in this game you can spend your 100 hours easily it has incredible ability to make you lose all sense of time you will keep saying alright one more turn and i will logout but you will not until your brain starts to give errors and your eyes fails you you will blame your organs and hate yourself because of this game but it is still worth as long as it is on discount i mean seriously what kind of a pricing is this single dlc is equal to a aaa game final verdict 8 5 10
