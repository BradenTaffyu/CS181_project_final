2016 if you think i missed something in my review feel free to tell me the time has come for war total war warhammer is a star in the franchise with such differences between every single race that you will want to try them all i will add a tl dr at the end gameplay like previous total war games you will be constantly moving across a turn based map improving your empire as you engage in rts with battles crushing all those who resist your might currently there are 4 base races and one dlc race to play as each race containing different playstyles and unique units creating a true sense of uniqueness that i have not seen in the franchise until now i have currently played as the vampire counts which lack ranged units but make up for it insanely with no routing and great damage dealers even the warriors of chaos shall fear me only a bit behind them in units since archaon came out and boosted the numbers so here is a kinda quick overview of the races the empire more classic oriented but superb cavalrythe dwarfs love to hold grudges and have flamethrowers so very revenge oriented greenskins waaagh fight or see the consequences vampire counts corruption spreads and while lacking ranged units are still insanely deadly ha punny chaos warriors dlc no settlements instead a horde whose only goal is to bring the end times spread chaos and kill allthe game is fun in both the turn based state and rts battle state it also includes magic magic can literally turn the tide of the battle insanely please help me i have an addiction graphics sounds ok no denying you need a good pc gaming laptop to run this game no denial there i choose to run it on medium and do not have problems as units go the designs of each unit is amazing i personally love to look at my armies descend and destroy the empire the soundtrack um i ve been too busy fighting but when i did hear it i thought it was rather nice pros cons pros unique factions races magic good launch after the hotfix addicting steam workshop multiplayer cons problems for some machines not really a con but be aware of your specs final thoughts oh god help me i come back from school and i want to do work i really do but this game has other plans it has grabbed me and forced me to devote myself to the von carstein family as everyone is slowly destroyed beneath my might they may whine they may try but i fear nothing for i am fear itself tl dr if you like warhammer and total war then you already own this game now this is the game for people who always wanted large scale battles with a universe like lotr or just any fantasy setting each race faction is incredibly unique without sharing traits of others making each different one a fun experience honestly this is the best total war i have ever seen and if your pc laptop can run it and you like the idea or game at all do yourself a favour and try it
