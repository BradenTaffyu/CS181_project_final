2018 there isn t much to say that you haven t heard already nier automata is a masterpiece and without a doubt the most emotional video game i ve ever played the story told is one of such colossal importance that you can t step away from the screen without questioning your own life and the meaning of life itself a large sum of people rag on the steam port and that is for good reason during my playthrough i needed to rely on third party programs to even smooth out things like frame rate and texture quality and it still didn t look nearly as gorgeous as the ps4 version gameplay and functionality is everything you d expect from platinum games and you come out of most boss fights really feeling proud of the you pulled off automata is an experience that is felt deep down in the core of your soul and will stay with you forever
