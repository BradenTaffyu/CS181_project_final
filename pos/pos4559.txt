2017 actually i had played this game for above 5 years 2000hours before starting using steam and i am so happy to find that cdkey and add it to my steam game list i can remember that i was really infatuated with this game at first it s so great to be a leader of a team in the game most of all you only control one person the protagnist but meanwhile you can fight together with your soldiers and npcs you can also lead a village a castle even a country mount and blade is not like rpg games because in rpg games you only act one person it s also not like rts because in rts games you can only fight with macro perspective mount and blade s success is a miracle it was developed by a couple of wife and husband of turkey it only takes less than 400mb of hard disk but depicts a medieval world of europe which you can do any thing by your will and freedom you can experience every thing of medieval europe including marriage war knighthood life of village or town it s really a great game i am looking forward to playing mount and blade2 next year
