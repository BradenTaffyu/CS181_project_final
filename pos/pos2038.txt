2020 let me preface this by saying that the time on this account playing this game is not an accurate reflection of the time i ve played this game i ve played off and on since launch in 2011 12 ish and have the founder title and seemingly 300 pieces of mail whenever i make a new character to play with friends i was formerly a pretty active raider in the community on ebon hawk before the server squish but after the content drought post shadows of revan in 2015ish i took a break and wound up going to final fantasy xiv as my main mmo now let s get into the meat and potatoes this is a star wars game based on lore that is no longer relevant if that s going to bug you i doubt you should play it if you enjoyed kotor i and ii you ll largely like this game as it has similar stylistic choices and follows the mostly natural arc of the events in the game to the point your character is at now with many obvious inspirations after knights of the fallen empire or eternal throne i can t remember which the companion system was significantly retooled so every companion could play any of the trinity roles as a dps tank or heals which allows for players to feel much more connected to their favorite companions without feeling like they ve been pigeon holed into using treek or one they don t like the interactions with companions in this game are similar to previous iterations of the game where how you interact with them changes how they interact with you eventually leading to possible romances yes fellow gays and gals there s lots of choices for you too while the system and engine show their obvious age in comparison to some of their counterparts which seem to have better funded and staffed development teams swtor makes the best with what they ve got and it shines the best storytelling in this game is the 1 50 storyline main scenario quests which follow individual classes jedi knight consular sith warrior inquisitor bounty hunter scoundrel so on and so forth and that s all free to play without any fees ultimately i would highly recommend swtor to 1 people who like star wars or mmos who are looking for a free game to scratch the itch or 2 old players who are returning to see what s changed the two further recommendations i would have for new players seeking to maximize their enjoyment is to 1 at least sub for a month to get the secondary tier of benefits that are permanent even if you decide to unsub and 2 find a guild to join so you can maximize the exp gain buffs you get through various guild promotions as well as personal items etc the old republic is an extremely fun game that you should give a shot to try out the different classes specs and factions to see what you like the republic and sith empire are largely direct mirrors of eachothers classes jedi knight will play the same as sith warrior just with different flavor animations so don t feel you have to make a choice that one side is inherently better than the other in terms of pve content swtor has enough of it for free that it ll last you until quarantine ends maybe
