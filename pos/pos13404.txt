2023 it s the best space simulation exploration game that i have ever played it s hard to say but the original game is better than the sequel you can play it or any hardware yes i tested it on pentium 4 and it worked you can download some mods and upgrade graphics if you have a better pc than a pentium 4 it s very fun and if you re bored you can install again mods to make the playthrough more interesting it s sad that the developers abandoned the game to work on that sequel in my opinion this game doesn t need a sequel it needs some patches and updates to be better than the second game ps modded ksp is better than ksp 2
