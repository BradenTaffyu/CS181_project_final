2017 played the ea and it was a very polished and enjoyable game even in the early stages then i played it on release and the game felt even more polished and looked quite better the voice acting and sound track are top notch and the gameplay is engaging and the combat is a blast i do find it more enjoyable playing with friends than solo so if you find it bland get some friends to play with because the game really shines in a full group
