2018 i purchased dark souls 3 at full price knowing very little about it got to the first boss ten minutes into the game died like ten times and immediately got a refund but i kept thinking about the game and when it went on sale recently i decided to give it another try i just kept at it inspired by the idle thumbs playthrough and now i m almost 60 hours into this character and i love it it may be one of my favorite games of all time sometimes it s infuriating but oh man when you finally power through whatever boss or obstacle is holding you back it s an amazing feeling give it a try and don t give up on the first day like i did the first time i tried it it s worth it i m thinking about getting the dlc and i simply never purchase dlc for anything
