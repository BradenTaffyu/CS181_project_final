2014 early access review my first impression was lackluster i expected another half hearted pseudo sandbox with pushover survival mechanics my expectations were way off mark 1 7dtd has one of the most comprehensive crafting sysmtes i seen even in building within the world with many tools that provide a variety of benefits and a plethora of resources differing by biome that alter the way you manage your survival the world is fully detructible being able to dig and mine with some decent physics as well as destroying parts of the landscape or cityscape thrown in with many gatherable items for survival purposes 2 survival itself is key and is directly tied into game play managing your hunger and thirst will determine not only how long you will live but more nuanced features like stamina and wellness there are many resources available to satisfy both survival mechanics but you have to manage them well to maximize their effectiveness and you have to gather them without dying 3 zombies are no joke even during the day time if you re hammering on zombies with your crossbow all it takes is for one not so noticeable zombie to flank you and you re dead taking hits from zombies can detriment you in several ways including bleeding infection and being temporarily stunned at its stage in development this game is already basically a fully fledged game and it only continues to get better with bugfixes and additional content 10 10
