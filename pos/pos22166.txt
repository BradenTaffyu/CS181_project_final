2019 this is my little christmas present to this amazing game a plus one from me this is possibly my favorite game of all time tl dr at the bottom if you don t want to read this long love letter how to play deification simulator before we begin a small definition deification de i fi ca tion d f k sh n noun 1 the condition of being treated like and considered to be a god 2 the act of making something into a god people often misunderstand the goal of dark souls they think it is to beat the final boss and possibly achieve some comprehension of the vaguely told story however i say different the goal of dark souls is not to defeat a boss but to become a boss in dark souls 3 you begin as a filthy undead that doesn t know which way is up your first challenger is iudex gundyr another failure of a warrior cursed to be in the same wastes you were resurrected in when you defeat him you begin the path from nothing to everything soon you run through a ruin of a cursed city searching for the lords of cinder far less failed warriors than gundyr as is stated in the game they are not made lords of cinder for merit but for might when you have defeated all of them you prove your superiority point down along your journey you kill all sorts of outcast lords and warriors you come across other players trying to complete their own journey some you may kill others may kill you some will become your allies you ll find that in this brutal masterpiece of a game allies can take you a long way even when they are your partners in crime as invaders throughout your numerous interactions with them you will learn things obtain new items and gain experience at this point you will unconsciously begin to realize the goal of dark souls 60 70 hours after your first victory over gundyr you will arrive at the final boss of the base game like before you can go alone for an ultimate challenge to prove yourself or fight with your sunbros to fulfill the quest that the story has you chasing after then you will begin the dlcs which have the better parts of the game in all aspects the most interesting weapons the most fun and well designed bosses the best part of the story which is actually really good it just takes effort to get into the further you go into dark souls the more challenging and of higher status your foes become by the end you travel to the ringed city to finish the story of the whole series this dlc has the best bosses of the series and is a must buy if you get this game then you are done with the first step of your journey some think they are finished when they defeat slave knight gael but no you begin ng and the journey repeats but with a twist you now have your status from before the overpowered weapons from the lords and warriors you defeated the experience from fighting with and against other players the levels from the time you invested also up until ng 7 the damage and health of all enemies gradually increases it s for this reason that i think ng 7 is the true ending of the game the ultimate challenge the final test of all that you have learned and accumulated you see dark souls is not about beating all the bosses it s about becoming a master of the game it s about ascending from a lowly hollow to a lord of lothric or the bringer of the apocalypse or a pvper who never loses dark souls is about overcoming its massive difficulty again and again until you become a part of its challenge for future players dark souls is about deification the ascent to godhood become a god and then you win and then you have the undisputed right to point down at those filthy casuals stop playing this extremely addictive game tl dr one of the best rpgs of all time because you truly become a part of its world and it s not by choice in lures you in forces you to defeat its challenges and lets you slowly realize that you are the center of it all that bettering your own skill is the true goal role playing so damn immersive you actually aren t role playing you as the player are actually the whole damn point a game truly dedicated to itself everything that defines a masterpiece
