2021 i recently got a decent amount of hours into this game it is by no means flawless and there are some minor bugs but when it s on sale its more than worth it a rather soothing game where you really feel emersed in nature with all the fun things of hunting without having to kill an actual animal some of the dlc s are better than others and some parks are not amazing but if you like nature and a relaxing game please give it a shot 10 10 would get run over by a bison again
