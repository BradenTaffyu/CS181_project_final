2019 magnificent game i recommend playing solo in the first run because you will be re creating your character for a while remember to press f5 right before combat for the immersion a slow approach to the quests is highly recommended and it shall help you see the bigger picture i have played this game on another platform and i enjoyed it by the way do not forget to check fextralife for builds guides etc in this game players have a free approach to everything and their actions effect the conclusion that is why you will re create and try again important for the multiplayer part i do not recommend to urge your friends or being greedy since this game has a great capability of destroying friendships play with an easy going friend whom you enjoy doing everything together otherwise the situation may escalate to another matter i had some greedy friends who wanted me to play a wizard for them so did i and the final scene was disastrous one of them called me thrash while the other one was a clown who was yawning and just walking around this triggered my urge to quit the game and take a break to sum up i recommend playing with only one friend in lone wolf if you want to learn the cores and an easier challenge do not play with the ones who might sell you for two pieces of armor great game 10 10
