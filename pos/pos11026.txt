2023 the performance issues people are having are from bugged graphics settings which are enabled by default i can understand the frustration but i think it got review bombed heavier than people give it credit for followed this tutorial and have been sitting at 50 60 fps with a city of 60000 people performance tutorial youtube video improve cities skylines 2 performance now without an expensive pc views 92 322 cities skylines 2 has been released and lots of people are reporting issues with poor performance lag low fps bad graphics some of the editing tools for things like terrain and roads are a bit finicky with a learning curve but once you get used to them they are very powerful and well made overall the game is super addicting if you liked the first one with lots of really well made updates
