2018 tl dr yes you should buy it if you re like me and you read as many reviews as possible before buying a game congrats you get to read another one euro truck simulator 2 is a truck simulator set in europe simple enough you drive a truck with different cargo each time starting out using trucks that your employer provides until you manage to buy your own truck you can expand your garage hire drivers build multiple garages and create a trucking empire but for now focus on the driving don t get too ahead of yourself pros map is quite detailed most cities are pretty close to their real life counterparts just scaled down did i mention the whole game is scaled down driving across europe in real time wouldn t be as easy on the brain nor the hard drive space incredibly detailed trucks trucks are all brand name licensed trucks with the interior and exterior recreated in painstaking detail even minute things that you probably would never see are added door bins little switches to the left of the steering wheel floor mats etc when you finally get around to buying your own truck you can customize it and make it fully your own paint spoilers body kits interior bits and bobs everything can be changed the game is relatively relaxing if you get your kicks from getting your blood pumping while running around spraying bullets this game is not for you that s not to say there s not intensity there is especially when you re running late and you ve still got 20 kilometers to your destination and you re hitting every red light in town cons graphics they re not bad but they re not knock your socks off photorealistic you can tell you re looking at a game not real life it s to be expected though since the entirety of europe is scaled down into this game the graphics aren t that bad and sometimes a landmark catches your eye or the sunrise glistens through your window and you get entranced by it and cause a crash highways which are the majority of the roads you ll be driving on can sometimes be not that realistic especially in small rural exits they can be a bit janky or sudden sometimes in the big cities however the highways are very detailed this game makes you have a burning hatred for highway police and speed cameras i hate speed cameras odds and ends this game is worth full price 100 however if you get it on a sale like i did you re going to be very happy with the bargain you got especially if it included map dlc which brings me on to the next point map dlc get it it s worth it the base game map is good but with the dlc you just have so much more map if you can t afford them all i ll reccomend getting the scandinavia dlc and the going east dlc france you can do without mainly because i hate their toll booths i hate you france stop charging me 88 euro for 100km on a toll road this game has a very active modding community this includes visual mods so if you fancy your game to be a bit more spruced up you can do that be warned graphic enhancers destroy your fps like nothing in this world seen before so take caution and don t pile on all of them at once in my opinion you don t need the truck customization packs yes they re nice and if you re a big fan of personalization you can get them but in my opinion the game is more about the journey not if you have a dancing hula girl on your dashboard though it s nice glorious duck best way to play this is the best way to play the game though i may be biased because this is my method the key aspect though is that this game should be enjoyed and savored like a fine wine not gulped down like a shotgun beer 1 get yourself a meat pie with a thick flaky crumbly crust 2 get some iced tea 3 bake pie pour tea 4 turn on ets2 5 turn on smooth jazz 6 drive along the highway eating your pie and drinking your iced tea feel your truck hug the curve of the highway bask in the glow of the virtual sunset and soak up the smooth jazz as you cruise down the road pure bliss
