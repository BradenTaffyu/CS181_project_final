2018 dark souls iiimany times have i ve stood at the summit of this dying world and longed for it to let me in and thus lighting the last flame but for some reason the gate has always slam shut and i ve never really felt the warmth of its disparity this is the first time i have managed to traverse the kingdoms and give it new hope to become a lord of cinder throughout the age of video games there are a few titles that are possible to admire without even having to play them but sometime you are fascinated by the vivid hints of its concept the art the unique experience overshadowing any flaws it might have because dark souls have flaws oh yes flaws that would be cut into history as the most strange of decisions if you have been living in a world of darkness until now dark soul is a game about never feeling at ease never being secure never knowing what will come and always dying at the smallest of mistakes you traverse this masterpiece of level design trying to reach the next safe haven of a simple bonfire at times you may find yourself on the other side of a fog wall fighting an opponent five times your size but with twice your speed but don t be discouraged by those daunting battles the essence of the game is in the gratification of an impossible victory the genius nature of the dark souls universe is not telling you anything giving you snippets of poetry or the ramblings of a knight turned madman not making any sense anyone not dedicating a large quantity of time will make little sense of the story but that is ok because for a vast number of people trying to interpret the story puzzling it together makes the whole community come together as the archeologists and historians of dark souls filling the internet with theories and story arches even if you are not part of this collective watching the community collaborate is a awe inspiring thing if you are pondering the question of should i get into dark souls this late the answer is an overwhelming yes this is the most polished version so far all the clunky technical issues of the past have vanished the bonfires are abundant the frame drops are a memory and it is most certainly worth dying for
