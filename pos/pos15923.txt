2022 early access review what happened to me how did i go from side scrolling beat em ups on the sega genesis to washing fake dirt off of fake structures with fake water and loving every minute of it jokes aside this game is so very satisfying in its simplicity yet strong attention to detail on how filthy surfaces react to water of differing pressure soon you ll find yourself doing lawnmower patterns on immense dirty surfaces pausing an hour in to look upon the exact line of that filthy skate park that you stopped at and reveling in the stark contrast between the finished and unfinished a secondary draw of this game is it s fantastic for the kind of adhd like myself that can t keep their hands still anymore but still need to concentrate on something audio based got a boring zoom meeting to attend an audio book to catch up on doing audio based research or are just on a call with friends that you can t zone out on turn down the game audio as it s not important to your progress and as long as you got a second monitor to peek over at from time to time this game is a wonderful companion that doesn t demand hard concentration of you just let that dopamine drip feed of getting a satisfying task done at your leisure carry you through hours of listening and communicative tasks on the side before you know it you ll have bought the best power washer in the game completed all the career mode tasks available at the time of writing this and be sad that you have to wait for more to come out
