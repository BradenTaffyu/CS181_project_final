2020 slow methodical satisfying and beautiful once it s sunk it s hooks into you it s addictive in a relaxing in a very moreish way the maps are stunning too and there s plenty to do on them following the missions and exploring the huge landscapes there s an awful lot of dlc to get hold of some more important to improving the experience than others but if it keeps the developers creating content for what i expect is quite a niche game then i m happy to support it personally it s definitely not for everyone unless you want to scare every animal in your vicinity you have to walk and move slowly especially closer to your prey patience is absolutely key in this game if you re happy to take your time and it appeals to you on any level there s a lot to enjoy here though it s also quite slow to level up acquire skills perks and the money for new equipment i can t comment on how realistic it is as a simulation as i ve never hunted these animals in real life
