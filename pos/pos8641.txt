2023 after 131 5 hours i completed all the quests in hirschfelden and discovered and build every single poi i even got my first diamond trophy not the one with the quest it was random spawn and it s hella rare in hirschfelden im quiete happy with this game didn t touched the other maps so far but im taking my time currently moving to layton lake i beated hirschfelden as vanillia experience meaning i didn t used any dlcs related items like tents or free weapons to make the quest line easier and some of them were tough because of it also had to grind a lot for bows and pistols it also took a lot time progressing on the huge map by walking so i packed up some dlcs this time and see how useful they are in layton lake wish me luck
