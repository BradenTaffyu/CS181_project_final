2016 this game makes space great again it s got one of the best nation race creation systems since stars unique races that are different every game it s got a anomalies events system that is far more expansive than i realised quest lines to discover precursor race homeworlds and unique techs lots of star trek like stuff including finding primitive races you can be entertained for hours without even interacting with the other alien races it s pretty as well everything looks sharp the icons and alien race portraits are all well drawn and distinct i d go on but i want to get back to playing the game
