2023 as a partisan warband player this game is a great sequel and provides a solid foundation for hours of fun sieges are satisfying and battles are excellent through more diverse ways of organizing and deploying troops as someone who plays video games in general however bannerlord is only a solid foundation a lot of negative reviews have already pointed this out and they re correct this game is by no means finished yeah combat is fun but i don t spend all my hours in combat there s a whole world out there that involves travelling politics trading and management if all these features look shallow and feel incomplete to first time non warband players well that s because they are other reviewers have listed these in more detail but maybe what bothers me most is how the whole workshops feature doesn t work a good representation of the rest of the player experience you re introduced to a promising idea but it is by no means finished a placeholder or iou from the devs thanks for the money but trust us this is what we want to do eventually maybe i ve already seen modders shout out to them finish workshops and i find it amazing how a few people with often no secure financial backing can finish entirely void bannerlord concepts versus an entire team at taleworlds currently there s about 172 000 reviews on this game leading me to believe they ve made at least this much in sales i m just curious as to why then there have been such infrequent updates and incomplete features modders are great but taleworlds lets not forget their jobs are to modify the game by adding new features or overhauling systems for gameplay or rpg purposes it is not to fix this incomplete garble you ve released this is already long and i m sure no one will read it but to wrap up i d give this game a 6 10 there are some cool features that can give you a few hours of fun at the same time i d also give a word s of caution don t let the blue thumbs up fool you this game is incomplete new and returning players will initially be impressed but if you re like me this awe will quickly fade once you come to grips with the true unfinished state of the game and be disappointed by the thought of what it could ve been
