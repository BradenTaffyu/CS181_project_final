2014 i bought a cd version of this game when i was vacationing in the philippines and it helped me absolutely destroy any jetlag i played it for probably 10 hours straight until 9am then went on with my day with circadian rhythms now synchronized i fell in love with this game so hard the m b series easily fits into my list of most favorite games ever if you like open world rpgs army inventory unit territory management tiny to massive scale battles and mod potential then you will absolutely love this game the aesthetics are very good nothing too crazy or graphic intensive there is a lot of detail in the different weapons armor pieces and unit types at the end of the battle you will most likely be covered in blood if you like to jump into the thick of things with a melee weapon the music and sounds are amazing there is nothing quite like hearing arrows soaring over and past you the controls are easy to familiarize yourself with however for a real challenge i suggest you switch blocking and attacking to manual if you do this you will block and attack in the direction you move your mouse this is essential for the game to calculate proper hit windows it is totally possible to die from repeatedly blocking incorrectly and this adds to the intensity of every battle be it a 10 man battle or a 300 full scale massacre you can also select how many units are allowed to appear on the field at a time the game gives very good feedback on the difficult depending on the options you select so you can better tailor your play experience to suit your tastes the beginning missions provide a nice and helpful tutorial the learning curve is moderate to difficult once you have a large enough army you can take over castles and or towns once this happens you must then consider territory management keeping a garrison to defend your lands while you are away the character customization is pretty expansive and there are a multiude of skills for you to select from you can specialize in bow arrow polearms sword shield horseback riding commerce etc to help strengthen the areas you are lacking in you may hire bodyguards their applicable skills will be added to a party pool which can boost the effectiveness of your army considerably the open world gameplay is spectacular you can side with the different factions vying for conrol of the land if that doesn t suit you you can even help different individuals with claims to the throne each faction has one such person doing this will result in the claimant becoming the new faction leader if you manage to succeed if you are feeling particularly suicidal you can even try to leave your own mark on the land by taking over a territory for yourself however this is extremely difficult if you do not have allies to call on as you play you gain reputation and this will cause faction leaders to seek you out for recruitment as a lord allowing you to be granted territories if you join them you may build different sttructures ex granary watchtower prison that provide different bonuses but these usually take an extremely long time to complete reputation among other things also contributes to the maximum party army size you are allowed to field the battles are vicious especially if you can handle increasing the difficulty to the higher end fighting an intense 6 vs 12 battle in the enemy s favor can feel so rewarding when you loot the bodies after the amount of loot recovered is influenced by your loot skill so many items can be lost if you do not invest in this or if you do not have a bodyguard with the skill skills like firt aid and wound treatment will boost your army s recovery outside of battle and minimize the amount of your units killed instead having them knocked unconscious when you are besieging a castle town the enemy can sally forth forcing you to meet them outside the walls the very first time you try to take over a territory will be memorable you will be racing up ladders while arrows hail down upon you since garrisons are fairly large you may find yourself fighting long battles that last several minutes if not an hour the different unit types and equipment allow you to experiment with different army configurations and loadouts issuing commands in batttle takes some getting used to but once you become familiar with it you will be able to better dominate the field of battle when fighting on horseback and or against other mounted units you can kill the horses to remove their advantage works well if you are a mounted archer you can try to court noblewomen in order to be accepted into a powerful family participating in tournaments allows you to earn reputation and favor with them and the rest of the realm on the world map you can see all units within your field of view you can attack any army caravan etc you see if two parties are in battle you can usually join and select a side to help useful for farming experience one of m w warband s best features is the super extensive and powerful mod support the community provides just about everything i suggest you check out the clask of kings mod as well as the floris mod back adds a lot of features and graphical updates there are even mods that add warhammer 40 000 themes units other fantasy overhauls and many more the entire m b series is phenomenal and i strongly suggest you check it out if the open world war theme interests you highly recommend cheers djsf djsf s rogue reviews
