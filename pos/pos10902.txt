2020 one of the best strategy games i have ever played after 420 hours of playing i can say that it is even spicier with the dlcs but it is still good in default game i recommend you waiting for sales as it usually goes down a lot it is a difficult game to understand as eu4 or ck2 ck3 but when you master the game it results in a lot of fun
