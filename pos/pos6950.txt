2022 yes i tried many games looking for the perfect one for my open world survival craft itch i found it in raft you start on a 2x2 square raft about the size of four wood pallets roped together in the middle of an endless ocean hungry thirsty and harassed by a shark who is determined to eat what little of a raft you have out from under you then eat you too the first half hour is brutal i spend my first three hours restarting a half dozen times as i struggled and failed to survive or made stupid mistakes once i built a water purifier a little cooking pot and a sail and had gotten past that initial period of panicked survival the game became a glorious time gathering resources researching crafting and eventually building my beautiful little yacht where my maya lives out her days with tala sailing the tropical seas and occasionally plundering islands for their riches past that first panic survival period this game becomes a delightfully chill experience the sea is full of refuse and fishing it out of the water is your primary source of resources there are over a dozen hand crafted islands most of which are small that are procedurally placed around you as you travel they have an abundance of resources both on land and in the reefs below that you will need to gather to flourish i got more than my money s worth in hours of enjoyment before i even started the story while you get the blueprints early it takes a while before you are ready to build the receiver and associated antennas once you do and you start following the signals the story really begins the coordinates you get will lead you to unique locations each with its own challenges and lore the notes you find are voice acted and i loved them especially detto your raft is your mobile base you can expand upgrade and customize it in many ways but be warned you cannot build a new one from scratch so don t die the same way i did on my first try by getting overly excited when i saw my first island and jumping on it without anchoring my raft if you lose it you cannot just build a new one the environments are beautiful the enemy types are limited but most are an enjoyable challenge combat while simple feels good in this game but the biggest standout has to be the music the music is so good so chill and relaxing and it just makes me feel happy i could easily listen to it all day the game has a lot of qol features i give an especially hearty thank you to the devs for including a motion sickness mode that drastically reduces the rocking of the raft especially during rain any negatives are scarce and minor it is silly that you have to cut down trees to get their fruit all plants grown from seeds should produce at least one seed when harvested i wish certain things stacked in inventory which do not like shark bait after over a hundred hours i added in a few mods to my game nothing game changing save perhaps for a mod that makes sure seeds drop but a small number of little improvements such as being able to mirror build engines that i think were overlooked in the design i have played long after having completed the story and i continue to come back to the game and play it more even after starting other games it is just such a calm and enjoyable way to spend a weekend or evening i absolutely recommend this game raft is practically perfect tala is one of the alternate playable characters you unlock during the game while these characters don t actually appear on your raft with you their introduction is phrased as if they are joining you on your raft
