2017 hey there been a lil while since my last review on account of reasons ive been trying to play this game to completion a few times before saying anything about it 148 hours in and decided it was time to take the plunge a video review is available here youtube video total war warhammer 2 a one minute ish review let the dlc come views 374 thanks for watching that aside here goes were you aghast when launching the first total war warhammer 1 total campaign to find its limited size to be more reflective of a game called medium war rather than total do you like having to labororiously click speed up turns every single turn or else watch the ai factions take their turns with the largest faction looking at you dwarfs feeling like it takes ten minutes do you enjoy having to spend roughly 130 quid on a game when not on sale to get the full experience then total war warhammer 2 even more hammers and a more total form of war might be the my childhood daydream simulator for you that said get out of my mind i ve played the eye of the vortex campaign but ive been dreaming of the combined mortal empires component since well before total war all the hammers and total war was a thing so as soon as the patch landed that combined both games i dropped everything and commenced some large scale lizardinga quick shout out to folks who are thinking of buying just total war 2 the total war 2 campaign is probably the most ive enjoyed a narrative esq campaign for a while the good but smaller than expected experience of total war 1s grand campaign and the often non event that chaos were is replaced with all the races competing to perform rituals with large armies spawnded to prevent you from performing yours i had a blast with the portal camaign aand will be looking into it more once ive tried mortal empires a few times now for the main event the total war warhammer games function much like station from bill and ted one is cool but if you merge them together you make a smarter larger more effective whole the mortal empires campaign is vast and wonderful the game is now what i expected it to be when it first came out a huge sprawling multi continent many factioned massive mess not being able to colonise large swathes of the world has been replaced by suffering a penalty outside of your factions optimal environments allowing huge kingdoms once more each faction seems to have at least 2 warlords with the expectation of more coming in dlc form we now have so many factions the hardest part may well be picking a race to play as i should quickly mention you get multiplayer and all the historic battle custom battles as usual so dont worry if thats your thing but the biggest talking point for me with the newer game is the awesome gampaign map and the almost intimidating selection of armies leaders units and warmachines the epic scaled map finally doing the scale and diversity of the fantasy world the justice it deserves the games diversity is imense the warhammer world is an amazing place to set a total war game without question if i had to point out a fault then it might inevitably be balance playing as dwarves or high elves just feels easier all the good things about the first game remain and are either the same or enhanced the new chaos makes chaos the threat it ought to be the game looks great plays great and finally provides the experience i expected when i first heard rumours about the first total warhammer being developedas a fan of the warhammer world before games workshop broke it to make sueing people over ip easier i couldnt ask for more in an ideal world it would be cheaper but i d sooner the devs eat well and craft the game with love than have made a product less clearly constructed with love and researched to the nines would recommend
