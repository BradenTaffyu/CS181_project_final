2023 i play both this and ets2 on a regular basis why ats is installed on my laptop which i only use at work i play that because i grew up watching hollywood movies so north america is my favorite setting sometimes i get so much downtime that i don t have any lectures at all and my coworkers find me at my desk and love to yap about their day for hours on end ats keeps me company enough that i don t have to devote a lot of processing power to play it like i would say call of duty or battlefield and i still get to just enjoy watching the scenery when i m tired of their ets2 is installed at my pc at home i play that because i grew up watching hollywood movies so i know virtually nothing about europe and it s cool to discover it my family has this ritual that they love to do a conference call after work and talk my ear off about something or the other for hours on end ets2 keeps me company enough that i don t have to devote a lot of processing power to play it like i would say call of duty or battlefield and i still get to just enjoy watching the scenery when i m tired of hearing whatever they re mouthing off about which is usually something i m not even interested in but while both games are based off the exact same engines there are some differences that i personally have noticed and that s mainly that ets2 s economy is more difficult than ats garages cost more in ets2 than in ats trucks cost more in ets2 than in ats payouts are with all dlcs in ets2 than in ats without any dlcs with the all skills maxed out in both games vehicle insurances are a thing in ats and for a small one time fee you re covered for all damage for life whereas in ets2 you break the bank everytime some dumbass scratches your truck employees are more likely to turn up empty handed in ets2 than in ats employees have negligible to negative income in ets2 than in ats
