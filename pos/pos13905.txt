2019 literally no other game can provide experiences like arma 3 does more detailed review arma 3 is by far one of my favorite games ever i d say the sky is the limit with this game but we ve gone beyond the sky and onto the moon when it comes to the amount of things you can do in arma 3 section i scale and difference from some other gamesnow to me arma 3 is a large scale military with aspects of realism in it by default you re given 3 massive maps to play on malden counts as a 3rd as it s free which are actually islands full fledged islands like it d take half an hour to cross the smallest one that s the scale of the terrains in this game for the soldiers good guys bad guys you ve got the infantry of course you have riflemen riflemen with rocket launchers snipers almost everything plus you ve got an entire supply worth of vehicles to blow each other up with jeeps tanks apcs anti air and so on when it comes to the selection of what you can do in arma 3 think of yourself as a kid playing with toy soldiers just cranked up to 11 now again you can do anything and i mean it there is no leveling system you just pick a gun from the box and fire away like there s no tomorrow at the enemy or at your buddies if you don t know how to play section ii where do i start i heavily suggest you start with the bootcamp campaign and the vr training to get a good hold on what s what as you ll need that info to progress well in the campaign after that give the east wind campaign a try cool stuff now you may wonder to yourself and go what do i do now after completing the campaign s you re seemingly left with a blank template now and you can draw and put things onto that template using the editor i ll get to that in another section as i type this up right so you have quite a lot of options on what to do after i suggest you try out multiplayer to get a feel for the high fun factor that s hidden in many servers try out a gamemode called zeus think of it as d d but tactical some guy up in the air creates missions for players on the ground to complete this so called zeus can be your best friend or your worst enemy depending on the mission option 2 is the editor you can place down soldiers vehicles everything pretty much if you re new to the editor try out the little tutorials that bohemia interactive provides once you get the hand of it you ll be creating great scenarios to play in no time section iii modsmods are a fun subject when you launch arma 3 you get the option to select mods you want to load if you have any installed usually the best or most common mods you ll see others use are in the most subscribed part of the steam workshop so pick something out that looks fun if you wanna try it one thing i insist that you get is cup core and cup terrains both of these mods add in all of the previous terrains from the arma games except arma cold war assault though you can download cup cwa terrains from the workshop if you want those too the reason why i say get these first is because you ll be a little shy about installing mods for arma 3 at first also get cba3here s a big list of mods i use may not be for everyone or first time players but it gets the job done hotpocket s big box o mods by hotpocket my big box of mods not all of them but most of them that people would be comfortable with using that s a lotta mods notice jsrs and ace 3 are optional to install just like the rest of the mods in this collection section iv performancedon t stress over view distance your lag is probably from setting it to be 12km i advise you use bohemia interactive s preset settings so ratio out your view distance and object render distance higher when increasing your overall view distance for example short view distanceview 4500object 4250medium view distanceview 6000object 5500high view distance i hope you have a good cpu for this one view 10000object 7500arma 3 is a mostly cpu reliant game so if you want to have the highest settings i suggest you get a ryzen 5 3700x or i7 9700k overall arma 3 is one of the best games that i ve ever played
