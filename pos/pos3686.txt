2022 basol but also just a few heads up if your unsure about getting it or not make sure your computer can go over an hour or few without crashing saving the first hour or so the first part of the prologue can be a bit boring so keep pushing on the content warnings are no joke this game gets dark its not all cute and 8biti would say the age rating depends on who you are its gonna be a bit scary either way but id say the main age range is about 12 but depends on the personi spoiled most this game for myself out of pure fear but please don t make my mistake if you do at least just spoil one of the 2 main routes and leave the other one a mysterythis has a lot of content so its a long game its not boring its just largetl drits a good game get it
