2023 i ll be that person if the hogwarts exploring experience doesn t sound like it s worth the game price don t waste your money if you grew up playing the original trilogy on pc definitely get it because without even questing the visuals and exploration to me make it worth the price and more yes it is lacking optimisations but a simple graphics tweak can fix it in its current state pre release opinion this game was a dream come true and i m glad i got my old trilogy cd s out to play them prior to this launch i now vouch to be a hogwarts legacy supporter for life can t wait for the mods and the sequel most underrated game of the year all over people hating j k rowling for speaking facts no hate here the last great game i played was elden ring so i m very grateful to be blessed with these games 2 years in a row goty for sure unless possible elden ring dlc visuals 10 10exploration 10 10optimisation 8 10main story 10 10side quests 9 10don t be fooled by the haters this game deserves goty for sure
