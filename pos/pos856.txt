2022 this is it this is the best game i ve ever played nothing else comes close there s so much i can go on about how satisfying it is to farm crops raise animals fight monsters and even start a family this game has all that and more its just so satisfying farming a lot of crops collecting animal products fishing etc and selling it all to see the money flow in the townspeople feel very alive and like real people they have schedules and likes and dislikes you will not feel alone even if you are playing by yourself there are so many different places to visit and explore the best part of stardew valley is that you don t have to stress about playing you can do anything you want you have all the time in the world there are no real deadlines to doing things to stress over sure you can die or pass out and lose some things but you dont have to fight either there is so much to do in this game but it leaves it there to be done you dont have to do anything right away if you thought the game was already amazing well it gets even better the game fully supports mods you can install a variety of texture packs change sprites or even full fledged expansions that add new places npcs and items if you dont want to change much from the vanilla game you can also just install quality of life mods that help increase efficiency in some areas there is also a very friendly and accepting community behind this game this game is such a masterpiece there s really no way for me to properly describe completely how good this game is 10000 10 for me
