2020 the best and most realistic sim on the market for competitive online racing and if you are really talented then you can win big money prices and race with real pro real world drivers side note half of the playerbase is talented upto extremely talented tip before you buy your iracing subscription check the iracing com website first on their website they have a 40 discount for first time subscriptions while on steam you are lucky if it s a 25 discount the retail version of iracing includes a steam key so you can activate it on steam with the big retail discount and last buy a 1 year sub with that discount if sim racing is your thing and your hobby it will save you quite a bit of money over 1 year with that saved money you can buy extra circuits cars my first 10 hours experience as stated the cars and the physics feels really realistic you think assetto corsa is realistic multiply that realism factor by 10 and then you have iracing realism it s definitely a challenge and surprisingly a rookie class mazda mx5 car is more difficult to drive than a high end gt3 car especially in the first hours i had the tendency to overdrive the car because i was so used to assetto corsa and project cars the whole online system works well and it is easy to join open practice sessions and races there is also a lot of info about your stats on the members website and there is even an telemetry app if you want to analyze your performance into the fine details the bad to be honest i also have to mention the things i am less pleased with one of those things is how limited iracing feels because most of the content is locked away behind a paywall while paying for a subscription i am only interested in normal road racing and if i want to go up in race licenses and do other race classes i will have to buy more cars and more tracks i already bought a gt3 car but by the looks of it i will also have to buy several more tracks to compete in the official gt3 league so be ready to spend more money if you want to broaden your racing experience spreaded out over 1 year buying some tracks and cars is not a problem but it is still a whole lot of money for an online race sim with pretty old graphics
