2020 main pointfallout 76 is a mixed bag of a game and that s mainly due to the mmo aspect although i personally found the game mmo aspects to be quite entertaining at times the game itself was rather lacklustre in comparison to previous instalments with that said i d say it s ok at best more details in a pro s con s list below pro s story expansions expeditions atom shop additions map locations the game doesn t get as much attention as eso or other bethesda games but it hasn t been entirely forgotten there are plenty of decent quests the game play can be rather challenging at times it s a big story with an extremely large map i m not sure on the exact size of the map but if i had to guess i d say it s roughly triple the size of the fallout 4 map so too put it lightly there is plenty too discover it took me 200hrs to explore the map complete the main story line with the brotherhood of steel there are some easy achievements for achievement hunters but the game requires a solid 300hrs two separate playthroughs for 100 completion given the fact it s a mmo set in a recently ravished nuclear wasteland i thankfully only encountered a handful of douches con s game is rather laggy due too it being a mmo requires a constant internet connection can t play offline the game is also rather buggy i could kill a feral ghoul by shooting at its head with a railway rifle although it s technically dead now the corpse would remain stood up with the severed head floating 2 feet away the game can also feel clunky in areas where the fps goes smoothly one moment then the next thing you know it s jumping frames if i could describe it another way i d say it s kind of like going to a vr art gallery looking at a da vinci then quickly doing a u turn jumping right into the closest picasso world dialogue options may take ages to load up even if your internet connection is great stable it can also randomly ignore some of the decisions you ve made for example say you decided to spare someone s life 5 minutes later the game would go on as if you ve killed that person in cold heart also some interiors never fully load up would require you to restart from a checkpoint from 40 minutes ago because the game doesn t always save your progress whilst inside interiors insert angry face here the game can get boring at the beginning if you are by yourself i would suggest you get it with a friend as it s genuinely better that way if you want a private lobby to play without the need of interacting with other people or for your friends to join you privately simply give them a monthly subscription of 11 99 for fallout 1st insert another angry face money that can be better spent if you ask me atoms although earn able through daily weekly challenges they really do emphasise the fact that majority of people who have fallout 1st will get the stuff the you always wanted at a discounted price that only comes along for normal players every once in a blue moon conclusionif there was a neutral review option i would ve clicked that there s still plenty of room for improvement however the game isn t completely terrible does have some entertainment value buy it on a decent sale 50 minimum
