2018 i m a bit torn on this game it has been one of my favorite 4x space strategy games and maybe even flat out one of my favorite games of all time however there has been quite the number of changes from 1 0 to 2 0 some of them while i understand why they made the changes just don t make too much sense i don t particularly enjoy any game changes that pigeon hole players into certain play styles and sadly 2 0 seems to do that somewhat does it destroy the game absolutely not the game is still very much fun but if you ve played this game for years and suddenly come back to it you might be frustrated with many of the new mechanics like star lane only travel and war exhaustion there are some lingering issues as well ai pathing can be a nightmare when reinforcing your fleet the new ships you built will simply travel the fastest way to rejoin the fleet even if that means they are one by one suiciding themselves along the way also selecting multiple fleets to move together can sometimes hiccup and make or break your battle for example i selected 3 of my fleets to travel to the next star system to battle a fleet that had slightly less fleet power but one of my fleets took it s sweet time and didn t arrive with the others and i lost that battle hard the 2 that arrived first were over matched and by the time the 3rd fleet arrived they were all but destroyed frustrating there are also quite a few issues with multi player expect to have to reload the game because players fall out of sync at least once per session at least the auto saves are frequent enough to limit the damage but time is precious and i hate wasting it on reloads still i do recommend this game before 2 0 i would rate this game a 9 10 but however now i sadly must drop the rating slightly 7 5 10follow our curator page here
