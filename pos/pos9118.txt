2016 very good game a couple of shortcomings that i expect will be addressed in the expansions that are bound to follow 23 hours played still having lots of fun the ai is weak at the default difficulty in war it just follows you everywhere you go combat ui is very rudimentary no real control over the tactics or individual ships personally i applaud the decision to move away from micromanaging stuff la galactic civilizations micromanagement nightmare having most of it done with a few clicks but it needs ai improvements to work properly still a very good move currently 8 8 5 10 for me a diplomacy war expansion would make the game 9 10 stellaris is well worth it
