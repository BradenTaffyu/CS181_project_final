2020 i bought two point hospital a year ago i played for 45 minutes and it didn t grab me i tried again a couple of months ago same thing however once i really gave it a try i ve been quite addicted and very pleased i think you will be too two point hospital is the spiritual successor to theme hospital with two point studios being founded by the very people who made theme hospital back in the 90s i didn t play theme hospital much back so two point is a novel experience for me so what it is it s a business simulation that appears cartoony and shallow but is really funny and deep you have to build a hospital to heal the sick you build rooms hire and train staff set prices research and upgrade your equipment in the quest for health and profit it s not overwhelming but there s almost always something to do you re given a series of scenarios each one posing a different challenge to build your most optimal hospital in the shell of a few buildings the layout of the exterior of the buildings are fixed but you can build internally however you want part of the game is making optimal layouts for both your staff and your patients that means minimizing walking providing restrooms food entertainment and the like the longer the patients are there the more money you can make this is a serious sim but it doesn t have serious diseases no covid or cancer here light headedness is a patient with a light bulb for a head it of course has to be unscrewed with a wacky device animal magnetism of course has animals stuck to the patient you ll have freddie mercury wannabes running around patients that are made out of cubes mimes people with pans stuck to their heads pandemic get it and even clowns running around each might take a machine coupled with a doctor or a nurse or a psychiatric treatment or even surgery to fix most of these diseases require their own treatment rooms each with unique machines and decorative items you might only need a drug mixer to have a pharmacy but you ll want to decorate it up the better the decorations the better the prestige score of the room this in turn gives your patients a more positive feeling and helps the reputation of the hospital decorations are unlocked over time spending a currency earned in game so you can prioritize what you want if i had any complaints here it s that there are few objects that can really enhance your score like a particular plaque so that plaque tends to get spammed a lot but as you build your rooms you personalize your hospital this goes a long way in giving the player some pride in their creation as i mentioned above this is a scenario based game you ll build your hospital to meet objectives which unlocks other hospitals you can quit at one star or continue to get 3 stars for your hospital you never have to stop playing one though so you can continue as long as you like two point does a great job of introducing mechanics the first 2 3rds of the scenarios so you re always learning something new but there are a few issues with this one in particular isn t great fun it s the only one i just did the 1 star so i could move on the last few scenarios don t introduce much new and the objectives can take a long time i shouldn t have to just let the game run and go take a shower to wait out an objective finally because you re almost always starting from scratch you tend to have the same build order for quite a while thank god you can template rooms because i d have stopped playing if i had to build another gp office the last scenario is more of a sandbox than anything else so that s waiting for you at the end making money isn t hard once you have the hospital going it s just a matter of expanding as the money rolls in training your staff and growling ever bigger most of my hospitals tend to look similar at the end but that s somewhat expected i ve only had to restart once when i didn t understand the scenario otherwise it hasn t been a great challenge but i ve had to think about the pace of expansion and how to best spend my so it isn t a cakewalk the graphics are perfect for this game they look like toons and given the nature of the diseases they re perfect they nailed the art style here this is in large part because the diseases are hilariously absurd my machine is a beast so i can t comment on how it runs on older machines but i think it would be fine sounds are similarly well done with appropriate pops clangs and other sounds you d expect from a loony toons hospital the two point radio station plays in the background and is often funny the music got a bit samey after a while and i finally turned it off about 30 hours into the game that s unusual for me it s not bad but there simply isn t enough of it to keep it fresh okay so are there any other downsides not really beyond what i mentioned above the game is really really well done there s a goodly amount of dlc if you want but it doesn t offer new mechanics the dlcs offer more diseases items and scenarios so you aren t missing anything by just getting the base game but if you want more then you can add on to the base game for a relatively small amount of money as for the time you ll get in i m playing around in the last two hospitals all other scenarios have been 3 starred except one that i didn t much care for so you re looking at 60 hours or so to play through the scenarios that s good bang for your buck even at list price but the game is often for sale at about 10 15 either way if this genre interests you then pick it up and when you do don t be like me give the game a chance you won t regret it the only thing i regret is waiting a year to get into this one
