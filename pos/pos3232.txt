2018 another brilliant game from larian studios it took me much more hours to finish the game than i expected even though i didnt made all sidequests the graphics are amazing and so is the sound and voice acting the story is a bit confusing to be honest but you play good evil or something in between and go your own path probably one of the best rpg made in recent years
