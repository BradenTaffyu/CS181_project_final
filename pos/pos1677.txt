2022 everything that lives is designed to end we are perpetually trapped in a never ending spiral of life and death is fantastic this game is very original even from its inception the timeline in which the game s events take place spawns from a joke ending of the first videogame however you do not need to play the past games to play in fact this is a great starting point to the franchise as it is a very polished game with a self contained story and a few callbacks to the previous games the game is open world although it focuses a lot more on its story and themes than on its map size the explorable areas are interesting but not that many still do not let that deter you you will be spending a vast amount of time completing quests all over the place the only complaint i have about the map is that the city ruins feel a bit dull there are lots of buildings but nothing inside them no vegetation nothing they look like unfinished models which threw me off at first but i soon learned to ignore it once i started getting immersed in the game another problem with this game are the invisible walls these buildings have big open windows yet you cannot go inside them in many other areas of the game there are invisible walls for seemingly no reason and it will not let you take a shortcut even though this is a game that encourages fast movement and exploration despite that all the areas in the game have a very unique feel and theme to them and it is clear they were handcrafted to fit the game and its ideas in the distant future in a land abandoned by man machines wage a continuous war unaware of the futility of their actions the combat is a basically a third person hack n slash rpg with a very small amount of twin stick shooting involved it is fairly complex there are four types of weapons there are light heavy combo mix ups weapon upgrading a pod program which contains a special skill that can be switched by finding or purchasing new ones and some hacking mini games too you can evade attacks double jump glide do air combos and holding down the attack buttons gives you a different attack this is followed by a stat based system called plug in chips that androids basically install into their os these give you more health points or damage defense reduction the ability to slow down time when evading and more you also have the pods which besides the special skill i mentioned earlier can shoot different types of ammunition while you melee attack another interesting thing about the combat and exploration are the camera changes the game varies the camera angles depending on the location you are in which sometimes turns the game into a side scroller or a top down shooter it is fun and refreshing there are a variety of enemies from animals to machines big and small there are goliath class enemies that are well you guessed colossal in size and which you have to fight in spectacular boss battles all of this is accompanied by a mind blowing musical score i am telling you has one of the most memorable and unbelievably beautiful soundtracks i have ever listened to there is not a single track in this game that is forgettable it is that good and it makes the game s impact on you hit ten fold along with its superb soundtrack the story is where this game truly shines i cannot tell you why but this story has it all fortune and tragedy it can be extremely sweet or sickly gut wrenching it questions existence itself and what it means to have a soul along with the meaning behind war and the purpose of an individual i thought the story was a bit simple at first but boy was i wrong the last third of the game changed it completely along with the extra content i urge you to read after finishing the game stage plays such as and and the novels if you are really into it there are also multiple endings 26 to be exact the vast majority of them are joke endings which you will not see unless you go for all the achievements five of the endings are more serious one of those being considered the true ending along with the stage play keep this in mind when playing in conclusion is a very distinctive game with a great story and soundtrack interesting areas to explore and fun combat i strongly recommend it to anyone who is considering playing it i never quite realized how beautiful this world is a2
