2020 i love this game but the price on here is just not worth it half the time it s free on origin or selling for 5 unlike the 40 cost on steam btw origin won t allow you to take the game to steam only steam to origin to top the cake you gotta pay around 700 for all the dlc sims 3 had more content in the base game then this game could every wish for sadly ea is just milking people with sims 4 overall the only thing i like about the game is the clean looking graphics and small things they have only recently fixed like stairs but not worth the cash money and extra spending just to have dlcs i ve got with sims 3 for a better price ps most dlc barely has anything mod creators offer more if you really want to get the game warning do research on the dlcs if you purchase i only bought this on steam to have a easier time opening my game since i deleted origin a while back but found out i had to download their launcher to play love sims but frustrated on how ea operates good luck uwu
