2021 honestly its my favourite civ because it handled city development very nicely districts are good and there s a lot of little things and improvements that just make this a good installment say what you will about the dlc s and whatever this civ is genuinely fun to play in my opinion you can also do a myriad of different strategies and its not as much a linear meta as civ 5 or earlier titles if you want to go with a cultural victory religious science military they re all viable and they all have their own difficulties and challenges you can also go tall or wide in terms of empire expansion and generally speaking just wonder spamming isn t as powerful anymore because you may be giving up precious time to develop districts army or economic benefits that isn t to say wonders are awful though they re very good still my only gripes with this is the ai the ai is very limited and doesn t use aircraft or artillery properly and its been a problem with nearly every civ game i ve played make sure you get ai improvement mods also playing with mods is a hell of a lot easier than in 5 the mod support is a load better
