2016 ok i come from a background of playing pedal to the metal and haulin respectfully i ve never played ets or ets2 so i can t compare this game to those the following review is on ats fantastic game i really enjoy it it s really well done and is superb even though it only has three states and two trucks more on that later graphics 8 10 my computer is pretty good it can handle fsx fine but for some reason it struggles with this game i had to turn down my settings in game and i have to live with jaggies or else it becomes an unplayble slideshow i refuse to upgrade to windows 10 currently running w7 just to improve the performance as the aforementioned fsx may then have issues however that being said the graphics are absolutely beautiful the landscapes at dawn or dusk are truly a sight to behold the trucks are extremely well done both inside and out shadows moving across the dash the interior views of the sleepers etc you can tell alot of time and effort were put into designing the trucks one small thing i really like that wasn t doable in the games i mentioned is the ability to turn on parking lights only without turning the headlights on this is a cool feature as just like in real life i can illuminate the dash without the headlights needing to be on as well also the rain effects are impressive if you want realism since it rarely rains in the states included you can turn this effect off gameplay 10 10 yes gameplay is nearly perfect in pedal to the metal and haulin the trucks all drove like high performance autos i e 0 60 mph in two seconds even while pulling a fully loaded trailer here the trucks are slow to get up to speed and definitley feel heavy going up hills gives that bit of realism as i struggle to get up to 55 mph while ai cars pass me only small gripe is the cops are really picky go five miles over the limit and you will get ticketed however you can turn cops off in settings and fly if you prefer fun factor 10 10 whether you re a real life trucker or one who never got the chance to be one but wonders what it d be like to live life on the road with 18 wheels under you this game is definitely for you i find myself spending hours and hours driving around and delivering or dropping off loads i usually bore of driving sim games after a few days not so here every day after work i come home and start this game and you can say farewell to me for hours lol in summary as mentioned above only three states are available thus far but you know what i don t care each state is extremely well done and since i live in vegas it s where i started my career i can say it s pretty darn accurate right down to the sculptures alongside the 95 freeway only gripe would be freeway offramps and onramps do not have stop signs they have traffic signals but ok driving from vegas to tucson for example feels like a long trip just like in real life no it won t take 6 hours real time but it sure feels like it so three states are enough for me so long as each additional state they create is just as well detailed the states included are more than enough to keep me busy my first time driving over the golden gate bridge was simply stunning i almost wrecked trying to enjoy the scenery lol the available upgrades to the trucks levels are impressive almost like they borrowed features from previous modders i recommend starting with the kenworth w900 i was able to upgrade it to include the studio sleeper an abundance of lights and a beautiful dashboard after just reaching level 12 i m only using the included defaults but for those interested in other trucks and aren t willing to wait for scs there are plenty of mods available on the internet www modsats com has a nice selection also for those who want a full usa map and again don t want to wait the same site has one called the coast to coast v 1 8 map that s getting positive reviews they also have one that includes mexico and canada so if you wish to go across the borders there you go in summary i really enjoy this game almost every day i see something new as an example the other day i took a wrong turn and went behind an apartment complex i actually saw a guy dancing in the back of the building with a girl sitting there watching him little things like this really make the game world feel alive even little things like an obvious ups van although it s called something different in game being unloaded by a guy in his brown uniform pedestrians milling about on street corners the blowing tumbleweeds across the desert road etc all are a huge step up from the previous games i played pros great graphics great gameplay hours of fun great rewards cons poor performance on my better than average machine hoping that as more states are released it doesn t kill my machine limited trucks to drive and only 3 states but that can be solved with mods as mentioned earlier recommend highly
