2016 pro s plenty of eye candy didn t even mind the cartoonish civ leaders more flexibility for the 1 unit per tile rule with the escort and corp army system the wonder movies yes they brought it back from civ iv awesomesauce governments and civic cards make it more flexible to govern your civ love the districts and un stacking of cities actually playable with a steam controller ok i know i m probably in the minority but it s a nice touch that they pre defined actions that you can map to different buttons religous war is neat fight with your apostles missionaries instead of swords and guns return of city based happinness yay like the re working of city states so civs can t just buy them all off loved how trade routes built roads makes sense reallyneutral combat didn t experience much of it played a cultural game first but it doesn t seem much changed from civ 5 music is ok pretty much what you d expect from civcon s plenty of micro management city building selections and citizen assignment no city governors seriously i would have thought this would be one of the most requested features can t automate workers missionaries ui needs improvement it was not shown how many luxuries were going to a city just a generic uncover more luxuries when you have negative amenities the whole amenity system seemed like an unnecessary change made more sense when it was happy sad faces it was a bit confusing about envoys at first because it was hard to see the little arrows to increase them at each city state would have been nice to have something like trade route range because i didn t really get how to increase that other than just wait for the modern era there are a bit too many notifications gets overwhelmingoverall i like it better than civ 5 with the huge caveat of the missing city governors i would definitely recommend as long as you don t mind some micro management near the middle to late game now that i ve finished my first game i probably won t play again until they patch some things
