2018 set on rough difficulty with no loads allowed main ai i started my colony with three people duvallo sweatpea and red they quickly worked together in the early days to build a house some storage and got working on growing crops all good so far duvallo gave me cause for alarm early on he had been trying to hit on sweetpea and she was rebuffing him also he was mad jealous at red s room he had more space and a better bed i did try hard and changing his attitude but duvallo got closer and closer to breaking point finally he broke and went berzerk killing all the animals he could find in the place this included our new muffalo and red s jack russell poor red though it was worse when sweatpea the resident cook prepared that night s dinner with yeah i didn t catch that in time duvallo calmed down and red developed a mild depression that made him sometimes walk around aimlessly he was my researcher so that got delayed a little bit but besides that everything got back to normal we rescued tony and penny from raiders and they were joyful inclusions but all of that changed when the raccoons turned up i thought they were just raccoons but they weren t rabid things they mauled penny sweatpea and tony before red and duvallo put them down tony went into the medical bed as i thought he was worst hit wrong penny went to her own bed and i didn t notice all the blood pooling around her bed until it was too late it didn t help that as sweatpea was the cook and she was in bed too that red had been feeding the sick raw meat penny died we prepared a grave for her said the words etc we got back to normal sweatpea finally said yes to duvallo and they moved in together there was even whispers of marriage when the rabid foxes arrived i knew what to do i restricted everyone to the house and waited for the foxes to leave two got killed by our traps which left just one we could take him right well tony went out alone just one fox after all he got bitten once and started running away the coward all around the map i sent sweatpea duvallo and red after them but then a small fire broke out while everyone was away i sent red back to deal with it but by the time he did it was already too big for him to handle seems i had too many wooden walls and floors around red went down so i sent duvallo and sweatpea back to help they were making headway but then tony got mauled by the fox and the fox returned duvallo accidentally let the thing inside the house and it was mauling him while sweatpea was dealing with the fire the fox was killed by duvallo but then duvallo went unconscious from the smoke the fire engulfed sweatpea and everything went up in flames a mysterious stranger came to help frenchy was his name with the help of the rain he put out all the flames and went to sleep in penny s old bed in our homestead which now had no walls or roof in the morning frenchy went berzerk from the stress 10 10 i can t wait to start another colony
