2017 early access review gameplay is really fun you can destroy cars in thousands of unique ways smash it against ground with entinity mover or go straight to wall with 120km h speed everything is possible with cars definetely a fun game to mess in oh i almost forgot it has multiseat multiplayer yes you can play with your friends at your pc make a derby race or just drive around pros great physicsreally fun gameplaycar handling is so realistic that i regularly drive into road barrier cause i don t have a steering wheel and i have to use keyboard cons this might not be game nor developer fault but performance with amd a8 processor is pretty bad if you try to use more than 2 cars can get boring after a while if you have completed majority of missions no steam workshop and now i will tell why yes i know that devs made additional website for mod downloading and that is really cool it shows how much they actually care about modding community but as i am one of those dumb people who just don t want to dig deep in game files to put in a single mod it s really confusing for me and hard to get a single mod i know that they made their own workshop to delete all the joke mods that just spam useless things but i would like at least little more simple look of website or built in game website thing like you could press download and it does everything for you that s it for my review thank you for reading it
