2023 i started playing this game because my so suggested we buy it when it was on sale and it kind of gave me like cities skylines vibe but we could play together well it has been an amazing game so far i got it on sale but i would honestly pay full price for it based on my experience it has so much content i played 140hrs within almost 2 weeks of buying it the animations and soundtracks are really satisfying it can get overwhelming with all the dlc so i would suggest buying a few at a time
