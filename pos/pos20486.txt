2022 what can you really say about plants vs zombies it didn t get a game of the year version for no reason it s older from 2009 and i admit i chuckle a little reading the comments about people finding it nostalgic from their childhood only because when it came out i already had kids who also liked playing this game when i think of games i m nostalgic about they are usually from the late 80 s to early 90 s yet this game is old enough now to have nostalgia seekers looking to play it that s part of how good it is though it has staying power and is considered a classic i enjoyed playing it back in 2009 and so did my kids i enjoyed replaying over 10 years later i don t know if i d call that a nostalgia play for me just a game that you don t mind returning to over the years 13 years have gone by between my first play and my last and i have to say the game has aged very well its interface graphics mechanics and even background sounds are still great if you didn t know the game was over 10 years old you could easily mistake it for a more recent release while the story is minimal it s as detailed as you need to enjoy the game basically zombies are hungry for your brain and are trying to get into your house for some reason plants are the best defense and if you plant things well your brains are safe there s occasional little cutscene moments where the zombies politely ask to eat your brain and other ridiculous things but for the most part there s no real dialogue or story and this is in general just a nice casual strategy game each level has unique plants zombie types challenges and in some cases optional purchasable with in game money not micro purchases goodies and upgrades you can play one level or push through a dozen it s a bit of an addictive game but can be played as casually as you like you can replay levels trying other strategies or trying to earn more to buy things in game there s mini games that unlock as you progress that offer alternative ways to play and enjoy the game too i don t remember if there were achievements in the original game but i wasn t much of an achievement hound back then either so it could have been something i overlooked however this version definitely has them 21 to be exact i liked that there s actually a good variety of achievements in this game while some are just progress unlocked others require a lot more skill and playing in new ways that really challenge you some are easy most are moderately easy to a slight challenge and others are downright hard those really give you a sense of accomplishment like you actually did achieve something and really earned it personally i found some like the ones involving lasting a long time in endless mode to be the most difficult and some of the most frustrating but with a little effort and commitment you can achieve all the achievements just don t expect it to happen too quickly it took me about 130 hours to get them all but most of that was enjoyable time spent playing as opposed to just grinding difficult missing achievements this is the type of game you can open up and play for 5 minutes or 2 hours and even if you ve played it before the levels have replay value it s the kind of game you come back to to waste a little time and unwind with as many levels and mini games as this has and how much entertainment value it has i d say it s well worth the 5 it costs at full price whether you re playing it for nostalgia or experiencing it for the first time
