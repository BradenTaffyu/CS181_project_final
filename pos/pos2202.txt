2022 fallout 76 sounds like a no brainer on paper i mean wouldn t you want to be a part of an ever evolving fallout world with new activities and events constantly being added online world where you can encounter other players in the wild trade with and even pvp with this is basically what we have here but it was far from it at launch the launch had no npc s to tell the story with various quality of life issues and plenty of bugs and bad performance that are still quite present add on to that a monthly subscription model for convenience and no modding option it s definitely something fans of the franchise were not expecting but the game is in a much better state today and is worth checking out pros the world design is great with a lot of cool looking areas to explore story is pretty good maybe not on par with other fallout s but it was still interesting lots of content doing all the quests can easily take 100 hours build crafting although there are only a few meta options for the ultimate end game build you can experiment quite a bit along the way and make a lot of different things work crafting system is nicely implemented for customizing your gear and very resource cheap fair monetization with daily free items and a decent free tier in the battle pass cons end game grind after all the quests are done you may want to have an optimal build with the legendary weapons and armor it is not necessary but this is the end game content repeatable daily quests and activities that you need to do to get resources to be able to craft your perfect build these become boring real quick enemy tankyness some enemies are just bullet sponges especially large bosses for which you hope there will be meta players around also doing them in most cases there are monthly subscription is very convenient when it comes to having unlimited junk storage and a mobile survival tent although not necessary if you don t plan on grinding the game performance depending on the area there are some frame drops it s playable but just the overall feeling of the game doesn t feel smooth it s more sluggish seems like its just a game engine limitation bugs and glitches are still present enemies glitching out or even some missions needing to be restarted by changing servers game still crashes sometimes for no reason whatsoever pvp is nonexistent because of all the previous things mentioned no modding support means community cannot bring fixes and customize the game like previously fallout fans are a passionate bunch so it s understandable that they are still upset by this version of fallout although the game is in a much better state today than it was at launch it is still a much different fallout you can choose to play the game for just the story campaign and not worry about all the end game grind stuff if you go in managing your expectations i think the game is a pretty good experience overall
