2020 go do deliveries for truck companies until you can afford to buy your own truck then you get all the profit for your deliveries instead of just a portion then you rent other drivers that will happily drive around the map and give you part of the profit because they work for you then you take over the world and rule your trucking empire with an iron fist leading to revolt and an uprising so large you simply cannot continue as before that s when you download the multiplayer mod and join thousands of other failed dictators all pooled into the same server strap in for a massively chaotic delivery run as you fire up your truck and enter the mayhem 10 10 would keep on trucking again oh and this is one of those games you just buy don t even wait for a sale unless you want to pick up some of the dlc s you don t even need the dlc s to get the full experience as they either unlock cosmetics for your truck or new areas in which you can perform the same deliveries as in the base game large cargo dlc is kind of awesome though
