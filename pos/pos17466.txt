2019 the game is good but a lot still needs fixing customer service from creative assembly is as poor as any i have seen they do not answer questions in their official forum or let players know what ideas are being looked at this has lead to many players quitting the game already as creative assembly have failed to address real issues within the game if you want a game that has loads of potential then this game is for you hopefully creative assembly will eventually make it into the great game it can be i now have to choose if to recommend the game or not yes if you want to play a game which could become epic but no if you want to use their official site and get a response
