2018 finally finished the game so let s review pros very in depth rpg there are a lot of opportunities to personalize your character and play style tactical turn based combat loads of interesting quests packed with different ways to complete them four player co op even though my experience was exactly as chaotic as you may expect adding to the above point you can do almost anything and fight anyone without breaking the game cons some bugs will make you wish you saved more often ex characters frozen in dialogue armor buffs not applying anymore players can sometimes progress quests even origin character personal quests or big story shifting moments without input from other players were you the first guy in the room well hope you have high persuasion and or need to talk to the npcs because your pals are out of luck decide for yourself 80 100 hours of content for one playthrough most of the rng elements from dos1 have been stripped away for a more straight forward if not always more rewarding experience ex armor system to resist cc character tags open up new dialogue options but don t provide any combat civil buffs combat cheese or abusing the system i haven t encountered an impossible fight yet but there are plenty that can be made a lot easier by adding some deathfog barrels applying buffs while in dialogue before the fight fleeing with one character to get full health before returning to the fight etc ending spoiler no matter how you played before unless you swear to the god king or demon you can choose any ending you want mass effect 3 style overall i would completely recommend this game i even started another playthrough
