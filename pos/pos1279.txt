2014 early access review i woke up one morning cold and dreary to find the monsters outside my window bold and eerie i grasped my lucky baseball bat and swung hard into the black to my suprise it was not two or three but a whole army of undead waiting for a snack they grabed my arms and pulled with such fright pushing me to the ground out of the corner of my eye i see my shotgun oh old friend you ll never shot another round the world fades to black you survived 457 days 11 hours and 37 minutes time to start another game muldraugh or west point 10 out of 10 would play again
