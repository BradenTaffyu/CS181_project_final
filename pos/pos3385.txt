2022 if you re any good at all you know you can be better lindsay buckinghamdivinity the original sin was a success sure it wasn t perfect far from it but it proved that divinity series is still alive and can exist in the whole new format this time as an old school turn based rpg experience and it can achieve all that with just the kickstarter funds personally i had a lot of complains like a lot of them heck i had so many complains that i actually gave the game a thumb down in steam not like i wasn t glad that the series survived exactly the opposite i always had very special place in my heart for divinity games it s just like i said i had way too many complains see the original sin was more like proof of concept larian wanted to try something different but they didn t have any experience with that i mean let s just look back for a minute divine divinity and beyond devinity were pretty much diablo clones the advanced ones sure but still in divinity ii ego draconis larian tried to turn series into aaa 3d rpg without much success but that s not the point the point is larian never worked with complicated rpg titles like you know baldur s gate planescape torment and the original fallout and as the result they ve made heck of a lot of mistakes and that s where the original sin ii comes to a play like the previous game the original sin ii was funded by kickstarter and that s the worst thing about it i mean you know how it is about kickstarter games you re supposed to work on project without having a proper budget and it always shows always in this exact case it s the progression that suffered the most in the original sin ii there s no open world not modern one with the free roaming not even the one we had in our usual baldur s gate fallout thing instead larian s game feels episodic the world here is divided by chapters and once you re progressed to the next region you won t be able to return to what you ve left behind you can clearly see the reason for that because that s exactly how kickstarter works but still should i said that it sucks i don t know about you but personally i enjoy saving certain quests until later and here you just can t do that you play this game chapter by chapter and every chapter is like a separate episode which sucks everything else though it s the opposite story because larian the guys did learn from their mistakes one of my biggest complains about the first original sin was the fact that that it looked like a proper rpg experience without being one for real for example dialogues were there but there wasn t enough room for choices you know the ones that matter and make impact on game s finale now look at the original sin ii it looks like more of exactly the same but it s actually way way more advanced and dialogues are a nice proof of that a lot of juicy choices this time like a lot of them you ll be able to properly use your stats in order to persuade npcs the choices will have serious consequences and there s fallout like non linear finale it s all here the whole package unlike previous game the original sin ii is a game for true rpg fans you love such stuff stop reading and go buy this game end of the story there are still many things to talk bout though and the most important one is of course the fact that like previous game the original sin ii is confusing as f not only this game won t give you proper quest markers it won t even tell you how exactly you should achieve certain things in other words the game just puts you into a certain territory and the rest is up to you you ll need to explore talk to people read the books look for secrets and use your own mind in order to figure things out of course many of us will find something like this annoying even i complained about that quite a lot in my review of the previous game which had the same exact problem but in the original sin ii it s not really a bad thing let me explain see in the first original sin there wasn t enough variety it was just that a bunch of painfully and therefore terribly annoying puzzle like objectives that you were supposed to accomplish without even knowing what s going on and what you can really do now in the original sin ii it s exactly the same yet completely different thanks to how there are many ways to achieve the same goals now and with all of those juicy dialogues abilities that make huge impact and surprisingly tricky in a good way level design everything in this game feels totally different from what we had before in other words yes it ll still feel annoying to people who prefer their games to tell em exactly what to do but this time it s actually a very enjoyable experience for old school rpg fans thanks to how most of the time there s more than one solution to your problems you want to return to times when proper exploration was a thing and there was a surprise to find on every corner welcome to divinity the original sin ii guys the only problem i had with such an approach is the fact that this game is also way too slow which makes exploration to feel worse for fast thinkers like yours truly i literally can t play this game without speed hacks it s like 3x slower than i can possibly take and you can t change that in options menu but hey it s still a very nice surprise splitscreen co op which was one of the most popular features in previous game is still here and thanks to how this time we take a role of one of the pre made characters we can customize them any way we want and of course we ll be free to make any choices we want but still we ll need to pick up a certain role it feels even more fun i mean it doesn t sound like a good thing but it actually is because let s be honest when it s about computer games you never have time to explain your character to the other players while here having a bunch of pre made heroes makes things simplier to enjoy but guess what there s actually more this time because well remember neverwinter nights both of them i mean not nwn 1 and nwn 2 but beyond software s 1991 game and the one from bioware that was released in 2002 both of those games were like a multiplayer revolution during their times while beyond software brought our classic computer rpg online bioware allowed us to re create our tabletop experience in multiplayer computer game larian larian is offering us something like that too now and you can even have mods which will obviously disable the achievements learn from this bethesda but still you ll be able to customize your game in any way you want now well customization here is not nearly as advanced as in neverwinter nights but still it s a mind blowing amount of features for us to enjoy so do i recommend this game yes yes i do and i m so freakin glad that i can finally give the divinity game a thumb up not only the original sin ii is the best divinity game since the very first divine divinity it s actually a fantastic rpg experience for all of those who prefer the real deal not without buts of course because yes this game is a bit too slow and kickstarter sure made an impact on progression but still what we have here is a great game and no rpg fan should miss it
