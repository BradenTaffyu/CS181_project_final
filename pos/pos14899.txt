2020 early access review this is quite genuinely the most fun i ve had in a while the ability to manipulate and destroy pretty much anything in the environment is such a blast pun heh and the amount of planning required to create the quickest and most perfect path to get the mission done in time really does make you think honestly it s a terrific game that s very promising and with it being in early access i can only see even greater things to come 11 10 edit 12 5 21 just finished the newly released second half of the campaign and oh my gosh well done tuxedo that was brilliant brought back a lot of memories when i was playing through the campaign last year good memories nostalgic i dare say even though it s only been a year the winter weather was a phenomenal touch and felt perfect and the new locations beautiful all in all that was a wonderful end of the story to a engaging game to all the team at tuxedo labs well done i had a wonderful experience
