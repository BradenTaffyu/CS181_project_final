deciding whether i should give it a positive or negative review was a bit hard but overall i went for a positive one pros extremely f2p friendly given enough time you should be able to craft a few meta decks without spending any money decent yu gi oh simulator everything seems to work great and you should get the hang of it within minutes if you have played a single gba ds ps2 psp game solo mode can be fun although it definitely won t help you learn the game you ll mostly use it to get rewards take a look at home some decks are played and try out your new decks one of the best passes in f2p games it pays for itself you can get it with nothing but 5 days worth of dailies and the rewards are really good as they include a lot of crafting material on top of some cosmetics cosmetics are cheap on the store and once again can be acquired with the in game currency regular events granting roughly 30 pulls worth of gems which you can play with premade decks so there is no need to make a deck for every single one you should be able to craft a decent deck within the first few hours of playing the game with even non meta decks making it to the highest rank i m not great at the game but even so i can manage getting to low diamond consistently with semi meta decks so you can probably do that as well great content creators with some really fun videos cons steep learning curve especially if you haven t played in a long time you ll need to learn about basic mechanics like synchro xyz pendulum and link summoning along with how chains work add the hand traps to that and the fact you ll need to learn how many decks play to be able to stop them and its clear how much effort you ll need to actually play the game a friend playing the game is almost required if you want to learn it from scratch as there are tons of cards that are staples and you should craft asap along with having someone explain a few very frustrating stuff you ll see in the game it s not confirmed but there is a possibility that new accounts get way better pull ratios than old accounts so after a while your pulls will usually be decent but not great 80 of the decks played will annoy you and will feel like they are overpowered and almost cheating that s usually not the case but if you dont know how to stop them you re in for a bad time often there are decks where you just have to draw open the out or you re done note that you ll probably be on the opposite end as well at times the game is f2p but still needs to make money aka there is a circle of new pack releases with op stuff gets hit when the next pack or 2 release to make it less op than the new stuff rinse and repeat playing your favorites won t always be viable outside of duels with friends tips for new players start by getting some premade decks and find a guide on how to build and play them or find out what is meta atm and build something that looks interesting to you once you build your first deck or 2 focus on crafting staples these cards are often used in multiple decks with certain decklists having up to 20 25 staples that means that there are fewer deck building options but you get to craft half of most decks in one go some staples are available in bundles so you should grab those as you get 10 packs and a copy of a staple for a lower price than an actual 10 pull typically you ll need 3x ash blossom and glorious spring 3 maxx c 3 infinite impermanence and then a few of whatever counters current meta dekcs depending on your deck you may need to craft a few extra deck monsters as well usually at 1 or 2 copies try crafting at least a single meta deck at some point it will probably stay relevant for a while and at least be playable even if hit by a banlist currently snake eyes fire decks are the meta choice but you can also go for mathemechs kashtira labrynth branded despia tearlaments superheavy samurai and many many more do not underestimate the daily quests they usually take 15 20 minutes to complete and can give you about 4 350 gems month add the events that may be going on and you can easily get roughly 7k gems every month 70 pulls without any other missions or solo mode
