2022 just from taking apart the vehicles and putting them together i went from knowing nothing about car s to have a solid knowledge on all the parts placement and what they do i m not a car guy mechanic or interested in breaking things down and building them up but here i am i love this and wish it expanded into real training in this field and in others if this was school i d burn through it in no time i love this it s really fun just wish it was even bigger and had people and life in the game maybe even multiplayer lol work for someone or get employees and play around with that but i understand it s a smaller game with a tighter community but a boy can dream
