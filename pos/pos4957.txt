2017 in my opinion this is probably the weakest of the bethesda fallout but it s a great game that i have no problem dumping hours into modding really helps increase the great amount content that is already avaliable and adds more variety i highly recommend this game to anyone new to the series but highly recommend you also play fallout 3 and new vegas
