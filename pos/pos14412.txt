2021 early access review it puts satisfactory to shame that statement alone tells you what you re in for it s nothing short of addictive and phenomenal ever since i was a kid i wanted a game like this to exist and finally my wait is over and my god is it polished for an early access game the game is extremely well planned and feels like a complete product as is which makes me excited to see what the devs have in store for us speaking of the devs did you all know that only five people made this game let that sink in five devs made this game with unity worth every penny and more be prepared to dump hours of your life into this masterpiece in the making because you re in it for the long haul but that plays into what you re doing you re not just building a factory you re building a solar collector larger than a star that requires planet wide factories and infrastructure that spans an entire solar system this game doesn t hold its punches on the work either you will struggle if you don t plan ahead resources are finite and it is possible to make it impossible to continue the game but that s only if you don t plan ahead the longer you mine a resource vein the less resources it will spit out for you until finally being depleted exponential growth and planning for said exponential growth is key to making your dyson sphere in as little time as possible the only things i can criticize is the lack of a fleshed out soundtrack and the broken english it s pretty much 4 or 5 songs at the moment but i have no doubt they will add more tracks and to be clear the tracks themselves are great but it will get repetitive for now play some stellaris music in the background and settle in while you lose yourself in the beautiful visuals gameplay and look upon your work with pride the writing can come across as very broken but i don t doubt they ll address that in the future prepare for a stellar experience
