2017 i m both a massive games workshop fan and massive total war fan i loved warhammer 1 i played several campaigns and countless hours of multiplayer battles but warhammer 2 has blown me away graphics looks much better than the first game in both battle and campaign maps even units from the first game look better it runs much smoother even on launch than the first game im getting 80 fps in large battles on the highest settings where as i only got just above 60 fps in the original gameplay a lot of unit variety more then the first game had at launch army movement in battle feels more satisfying factions all feel unique in how they play in both battles and campaign they have added some nice new features to the campaign such as rites treasure and of course the vortex campaign map is massive im 60 turns in on my dark elf campaign and i still haven t explored more then 10 of it sound music is great voice acting is amazing overall i am shocked with how good this game is i was expecting it to be just a new map and factions and everything else to be pretty much the same as wh tw 1 but they have expanded the game quite a bit and its definitely worth the price tag i can t wait for more dlc races and of course the mortal empires map which will combine both maps and factions of warhammer 1 2 it will be amazing
