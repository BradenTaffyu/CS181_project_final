2021 update as of november 2021 the issue i was having with the crashing is completely resolved i am thoroughly enjoying playing again and have had no issues with game play and or smoothness of play the highest ram usages is in the low 30gb range so far and have had zero issues cheers and game on update i finally figured out why i have late game issues the game begins to stutter after 10gb of ram is being used and crashes the moment it breaches 15gb of ram being used as such i can lower settings or build smaller but keeping my ram use under 15gb is the only way to keep from crashing and under 10 gb ram use for smooth play the pauses during each cycle save begins slowly after 7gb of ram is in use i tested several things and it seems that gasses are the main catalyst and having a vacuume in large vast open spaces will allow for larger builds for those that enjoy more than just building the rocket like myself i was able to test and confirm all of this after turning on the debug mode which also allowed from some fun experiments such as 50 sun bugs in a confined space looks like a small universe is being formed i also found that i can have 100 s of critters and 50 duplicates without any performance issues my performance issues seems to be mostly limited to the gasses and its amount of space along with number of interactions i hope that this can help anyone who is as confused about the performance issues as i was cheers and game on the game is fun but does not run smoothly my system has 64gb ram 11gb gpu and running a new intel extreme processor and the game still has issues the later into the game i get around cycle 350 to 500 the game becomes frustrating with taking up to a couple of minutes for the auto save function to perform its task before the game will continue it might appear that your game has crashed but this is just how the game performs this does not seem to be as reliant as system design as just the bottleneck in game design the speed up process also become a bad choice with any more than 16 duplicates as the game takes the same amount of time to go through its checklist to see who performs what task regardless of speed selected to play this means that playing accelerated gameplay will result in an increase duplicate idle time ratio comparatively when racing the clock on anything always run in the slowest normal speed else you can end up wasting time and failing to accomplish tasks by their deadlines be careful altering the priority settings as this can essentially stun lock duplicates making them do jitters instead of accomplishing anything for some reason if two tasks are equal in importance for a duplicate they will sometimes and often in later cycles cycle between the two tasks doing nothing but a two step shuffle between the first step towards each task but no further i found this especially problematic with tidy tasks between gathering ice and anything else i had to set the resource box for the ice to a lower rating so it would end up getting those last which solved most of the two step shuffle issues the game performs excellent for the first 200 or so cycles and is very fun but after that it because a race to patience versus success i find that i reset the game often starting over just because i am tired of the auto save feature making the game play tedious i consider this a major game issue and would rate the game far more favorably if they can fix this as is this is a fun game that i recommend but expect your patience to be tested if you venture through many cycles instead of rush to the finish line
