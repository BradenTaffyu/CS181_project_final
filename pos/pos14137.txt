2018 early access review not only a great game but a good time killer ive spent near 100 hours in this game and it has become a go to game for me the concept is simple and satisfying bugs are few and far between typically the few are small graphic or audio issues despite being the same thing again and again it doesn t get repetitive the devs also do a good job with updates to keep it fresh and constantly fix any issues if i could tell everyone about this game i would 5 stars all the way
