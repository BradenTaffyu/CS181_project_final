2022 it got good as most expected it eventually would do i forgive them nope have they turned me off of buying any of their games at remotely full price in the future yup is the game fun sorta it s good on it s own has some decent moments but it s great with friends i still find fallout 4 to be superior in every way but this is essentially a less good fallout 4 co op
