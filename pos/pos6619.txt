2021 product received for free perfect game for streaming so many great moments has been experienced while convoying with viewers i do wish for the game to develop more when it comes to loading unloading rather than just dropping off a gravel trailer at a food terminal it would be so much more fun with different choices loading gravel with a wheel loader unloading pallets with a fork lift and so on maybe calculating how to secure the load imagine loading a big machine and the game gives you chains to manually strap down the machine with maybe in a first person view and the chains would turn green when fully secured but overall good game recommended if you want to roleplay being a truck driver and learn how to reverse trailers buy on sale get a steering wheel it s worth it
