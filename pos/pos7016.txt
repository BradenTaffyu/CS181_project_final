2021 early access review i enjoyed this immensely as a solo player alone nothing but bruce the raft and myself i beat it twice in about 80 hours my kids 6 and 8 now 7 and 9 enjoy this game alot and its fun enough on peaceful to get my brain and raft management going while my kids gather kill fish and be noodles to one another can be very relaxing or a stress fest depending on the difficulty
