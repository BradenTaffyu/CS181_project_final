2020 on launch fallout 76 was quite possibly one of the most insulting gaming experiences i have ever had massive bugs direct misinformation from bethesda and worst of all no respect for the series i am happy to say that from my perspective the game has improved greatly since the last update wastelanders was added not just the npcs being added but many other improvements have set this game on the right track i am looking forward to what they have in store
