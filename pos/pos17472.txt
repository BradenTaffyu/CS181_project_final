2016 cavalry charges actually work again units have weight and factions have variety again a good return to form after rome ii and especially the factional blandness of attilla runs reasonably well comparable to rome 2 but don t expect to run it at ultra 60fps unless you have topend hardware and even then it may be iffy amd users supposedly should get better performance due to hardware based asynch compute when running in dx12 but as an nvidia user i can t confirm that loading times are a bit iffy but i won t say for sure as i am running a budget harddisk so it may simply be the system however if you were the type to play divide et impera mod for r2 it is much faster but that s more a comment on dei than tw w conversely turn times are perhaps the fastest they ve been since mideval 2 and difficulty this is perhaps one of the most ball busting tws yet which some may find good others less so lastly mp i have no idea how the mp is because the servers are completely hammered right now because of launch but sadly from previews i can say it is more of r2 and attilla style mp than the avatar conquest of shogun there is a mod on the workshop that moves the secondary lord to a new faction of the same race and i highly reccomend it for co op play so you can both be the same race however edit no idea why but texture detail seems to have a massive framerate impact dialing it down from ultra to high made it so i could run at a decent 40 50fps in battles with an aging gtx 760 probably the first time i ve had texture detail severly effect framerate as opposed to just causing loading issues or ram issues edit 5 26 the game has been out 51 hours and i ve logged 30 that should sum it up
