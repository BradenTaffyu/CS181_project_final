2023 early access review before this game leaves alpha my daughter is gonna turn 18 and she s not even born yet oh and it s a great game always gets me to return whenever a big update is out although there is still alot of improvement needed to be done here starting with graphics because it is really outdated and brings even the most endgame pc s into their knees optimization is awful and bugs a plenty still good regardless
