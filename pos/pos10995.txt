the drivers in this game are morons massive traffic jams just because they cant change lanes in advance you would think the people over at co would see the number of downloads on tm pe on cs1 and implement it into cs2 even the tm pe port to cs2 is not complete that might change on some maps you start with one 2 lane highway once your city grows it becomes a traffic nightmare to make more connections you have to spend absurd amounts to buy tiles to get to the edge of the map i do want to give some praise i love how they changed the electricity system so much more realistic they should have done something similar with the water sewage i would still recommend the game but i would wait to play seriously until the traffic mod matures
