2022 early access review being a player of m b warband i bought this game as soon as i could i have played it for a fair bit and boy it s nice the newer graphics are a treat the weapon crafting system is a rabbit hole that saw my first character go from 0 smithing to 288 smithing and earning basically all of his money on swords the combat is as good as ever and the sheer size of the world means that you can explore and explore and explore the world that the developers have built is it perfect no of course not there was a time when two handed swords were overvalued to a ridiculous degree my character could at one point make 120k per sword and the way you unlock new parts is still obtuse and doesn t feel rewarding the ai still makes silly decisions which lose it cities for no good reason the game crashes occasionally however if you ve played previous m b titles you ll find yourself at home here if you like medieval sandboxes where you can command battles and take part in them as an active soldier if you like trading travelling crafting engaging combat then you will enjoy what this game has to offer
