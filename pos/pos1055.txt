2014 early access review one of my absolute favorite games of all time however it still needs a lot of work no other game has ever captured the true essence of zombie apocalypse as project zomboid has in zomboid you have to be smart resourceful and careful in many cases not scouting out and planning your approach could very easily mean your death zombies are a real threat here the smallest scratch can be fatal despite the graphics and the camera style which personally i love there have been some situations that have had my heart racing and my hair left standing up the smallest event can have great consequences if incorrectly handled don t like your slow one bite kill zombies customise them the way you like in the sandbox mode live in the zombie apocalypse you want with the world rules you want don t like that the water and electricity shut off after a few weeks change it don t like the way the zombie virus is spread change it maybe you re a fast runner left 4 dead type zombie lover good luck you crazy bastard or maybe you like the slow but intelligent zombies that open doors and like to watch you sleep all up to you zomboid is the zombie game for the strategic man the man that thinks before he does and the man that cries himself to sleep at night if you are any of those things this game is a thrill to play i have yet to try out the multiplayer but i m sure it ll be a blast
