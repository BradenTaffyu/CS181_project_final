2019 i m not much for writing reviews but i think it about time to enter in my own two cents first before anyone thinks this no i m not some hardcore paradox fanboy i too am tired of the whole expansion and dlc scheme most games have these days but this is now our reality no matter how much we complain no matter how much we boycott this is the future of gaming it isn t going away anytime soon if ever complain all we want that won t do much to change the marketing departments ideals it sucks i know this wasn t always the case but i must make something clear i ve been playing games since the early 90 s the idea of paid expansions is a relatively new and often double edged sword for me and have been hit or miss with me depending on the content value added versus the price games continuing to be developed long after their release has been a very welcoming change so long as the changes don t completely destroy the fun i m having with the game more on that below as for paradox s dlc plan i personally believe that it has been one of the better ones honestly if you re just coming into the game now i can see why you d be upset at all the dlc you see with such prices and such small content however keep in mind that almost all of these expansions including the race and story packs have always been paired with a free update to the game that contained most of the content for that update anyway in fact all of the updates have been free the dlc you see is the completely optional icing on the cake so to speak all of which are not necessary to play or continue playing the game as new updates are released they are simply there if you want them i should also mention that if you play with a friend with deeper pockets than you you can play with the expansions in multiplayer for free i ve been playing stellaris since its release with each update after 2 0 making huge changes to major game mechanics while also adding new ones of course this pretty much always means splitting the player base especially the ftl streamline change in 2 0 i personally believe it was a necessary change to add more strategy to the game as empire spread and defence structures require the hyperlane function to work in a more strategic manner it was always frustrating to me pre 2 0 to attempt to catch a fleet that warped all over the place then straight to my home world cap it out and beat me before i could launch a counter offensive or defend my home since that was the case i continued playing with only hyperlanes anyway so the 2 0 change didn t effect me as much i was still playing stellaris as i always have been and i still have fun with it it was to me a very welcoming change i understand where this change was a huge deal breaker for most as the complexity of having 3 separate ftls was quite unique to the space 4x genre and i believe more people were partial to the warp ftl they have all been very large game mechanic changing white washes of what everyone expected of stellaris so it didn t fit with everyone s expectations and left it up to each players idea of what stellaris should be as you can expect this split the player base hard and repeatedly as the game is now i can recommend it only if you are okay with the game to continue to have such large changes to it if you are okay with a lot of optional expansions and if you are okay with updates being rather buggy from time to time only to wait for the hotfixes t l d r if you are just coming into stellaris expect more huge changes to how the game is played expect free updates with completely optional dlc paired with them expect bugs with each update to be patched out with subsequent hotfixes as with all games these days really and expect a completely fractured player base but most importantly formulate your own opinion on it
