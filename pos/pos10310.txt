2016 early access review first day the planet overheated all my people died of hearth attack second day i said i have experience now i will name my people one was my name one was my girlfriend and one was a friend of ours i tried to make a romance between me and my gf i even forced them to sleep together after one day she felt in love with our friend and i could not stop that me and my gf agreed that the right thing to do was to kill him she could not accept that she cheated on me in the game i killed him in the game in his sleep after the character of my gf felt into depression and left the group and after i was bitten by a rat and poisoned all my body and no one was left to cure me it was a very sad game i dont recommend using your name or very close friends i will definitely start a new story again
