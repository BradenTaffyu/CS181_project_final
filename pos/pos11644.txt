2023 early access review 7dtd s newest patch a21 is a slam dunk and one of the best patches any early access game has gotten everyone by now is used to early access being the standard for small teams getting their games out to the public for better or worse the most disappointing part of early access is how very often the devs will either promise something that isn t possible for their team take the money and run or the worst outcome in my opinion put out half assed patches that make the experience worse in the name of adding more content everyone is always begging for the fun pimps broke the mold and i could not be more satisfied i was worried about the magazine book system changes but after playing the new build i can t believe how wrong i was you know what really sucked pre a21 having to find specific items to unlock specific crafting options out of the several hundred craftable items you know what sucked way more having to spend valuable skill points on an attribute you didn t care for and then the skill to do something simple like craft a minibike or a forge they were all things you needed and nobody likes waiting on luck to bring you into the iron steel age so valuable points got put into things that made the crafting menu better but slowed down everything else the game has to offer the overhaul to reading solves this by naturally feeding recipes to you over time in a way that makes sense and suits your game state at pretty much any point even better that it takes what you spec into and allows that to decide what books you find more of allowing you to expedite your progress in areas that you as the player are interested in speaking of freeing up skill points the perk overhaul i thought i was going to be permanently sad at the absence of sexual tyrannosaurus but seeing how tfp put its effects into the perks you are already using to play the game how you want is just such a big qol improvement and that is only one example everywhere across the perk trees things are just better and now without being forced to put a bunch of early points into unlocking recipes you re freed to start doing what the game is all about much sooner busting zombie heads and grabbing sweet loot speaking of busting zombie heads the new gore system is a ton of fun hitting a zombie across the neck with an axe and just ripping the whole throat out was a shocking thing when it happened to me the first time and it never loses its luster i look forward to the times to come when hopefully this system is expanded and takes fighting zombies to the next level especially if with that comes updated new zombie models still miss my dearly departed every time i go into diamonds men s club though the random world generation improvements alongside the upgrade the game s visuals received make everything feel much more immersive cities in particular feel like they are packed with a lot more poi s layouts that make sense sure there is the odd occasion where you ll have two mo power stores on the same street but i ve been playing this game long enough to remember when cities were no where near as packed full of things to kill explore and loot everything about these changes is just great i will end by saying that for a long time player of this game over many of its builds when the fun pimps say this is the biggest and baddest version of the game to date they mean it each time they shatter expectations for a team of their size i could go on and on about how they pretty much made every aspect of the game better but i ve got zombies to kill and glass to eat before the infection finishes taking hold tl dr a21 sets a standard for how indie developers should operate and given the fun pimps history this standard will only get higher over time if you aren t playing 7dtd you should if you are playing make your friends you re missing out if you don t
