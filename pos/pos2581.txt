2023 since i already hit 450 hours in this game i think i ll still add my 2 cents beware the big text wall the game is pretty good for gacha standards i d dare to say with a bit more of work it could pass for a normal pc game the story is great at least for me if you already played the past 2 games of the company you ll get a lot of the baseline stuff like the city and what was lobotomy corp that said you don t need to know anything as the lore of this game is designed to be more at an entry level for new fans yet it has plenty of things for old fans the game play is good it is no auto battler it has a win rate button but there will be times you will want to do stuff yourself specially in endgame content abnormality battles are more complicated than connect the colours when you can as they have mechanics and gimmicks example stack x thing on your units x amount of times and then clash against y to return it to the enemy as every id your units have you can pick and mix teams focused around something or someone or just bring 1 of every or just bring 1 guy instead of a full team if you know what you are doing the gacha i see it as a convenience thing as every unit can be farmed in a game mode that gives you bp battlepass xp for rewards you can exchange for tokens i do pulls every now and then but most people just save the money and grind for units and even then the grind isn t nearly as much as other gacha games are and i play 2 more gachas beside this one other 2 i quit and even when you decide to roll the dice the rates are quite generous most people get their things in 2 or 3 ten pulls worst i ve gone through is 8 ten pulls and best is 1 pull that gave me the 3 identity and 2 e g os that was pretty neat resources wise personally the farm stages at the time of writing are a bit lacking on resource ward they are ok and even generous if you are a new player getting 18 thread with the daily bonus when upgrading a 2 id to tier 3 costs 50 and a 3 100 is alright in 2 weeks you can tier 3 bunch of stuff with the daily bonuses keep in mind max tier is 4 and its not necessary for any content at the time of writing xp tickets are only needed for campaign and specific endgame content namely refraction railway and hard mirror dungeon normal mirror dungeon caps your units at max level even if you have them lvl 1 once you start they will get boosted to lvl 35 said that next season season 3 they are overhauling farm stages and every week you get 3 bonus rewards for doing mirror dungeons nmd consumes 1 per try and mdh consumes all in 1 go gacha money reward 250 per bonus for a max of 750 stays consistent on both but battle pass xp reward and therefore named shard boxes is bigger in mdh each week they give 300 for maintenance compensation and every now and then they gift stuff varying amounts of funny money for milestones celebrating a promo maybe celebrating an event can t remember if it happened in limbus sorry or bug apologies or translation error apologies or they step on an ant that day and felt bad the gacha cost is 1300 that said the norm seems to be to just spend the funny money on energy so you can do the md and get the funny boxes to shard every id i mentioned the battlepass many times big buck for your bang you get resources funny money thread for uptier xp tickets xp tickets that raise the lvl to a specific number 10 20 30 and soon 40 next season named shard crates and random shard crates and 4 2 free if you didn t buy it and 2 extra if you brought it season themed e g o and an announcer among other cosmetics for your profile and once you max the bp each level gives you 2 extra as of season 2 named shard boxes to speed your grind that said there s no fomo everything will be available the season after the next s1 stuff will be available in the exchange in s3 and s2 stuff will come in on s4 and so on that s all i can think about hope it helped wish you the best and happy limbus day
