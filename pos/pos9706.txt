2018 rimworld is without a doubt the most phenomenal game to ever come out of the mess that is the early access limbo this is a 35 game that could very well be worth 60 the replayability is way up there and you can play it however you want it is a sandbox colony management simulator afterall wanna have a colony who s sole economy is reliant on human organs go for it wanna do a cannibalistic nude amazon only colony that genocides males and leaves their corpses in mass graves on the outside to deter raiders totally up to you just wanna take it easy and come home from a stressful day of work to a comfy boring ol colony hey i ain t judging and this is getting off track but you get the general idea with rimworld the only limitation is your creativity time to murder and sacrificing your soulsocial life for just one more colony run the workshop community is enormous so if you ever get tired of just a vanilla game or two you can always dive into the rabbit hole to spice up your game more there s things ranging from simple quality of life ui improvements to full blown overhaul packs there s a mod for everyone on the workshop i mean there s even a mod for having catgirl colonists i think you get the idea rather you re a fan of colony management sims or interested in trying one i think rimworld is more than good enough for that criteria it s easy to get into thanks to the various storytellers mechanic that you can configurable to your leisure but it can and will get despairingly cruel and unforgiving at even slightly harder difficulties which depends on storytellers as well the best part is you can change them to your hearts content so if you re feeling overwhelmed by the difficulty you re able to tone it down a notch and play at your own pace without much of anu bad events in the way there s even mods that add new storytellers for even greater enrichment of your experience overall rimworld has a speculator design philosophy if it was a religion i d be a devout follower the stories that are generated from this game are just wonderful and it s always great to read other about other people s colonies too additional 12 17 18 thoughtsat the time i made this review i couldn t think of any shortcomings the game has other than the game can be and will be unforgiving if you re not prepared for disasters however originally i wanted to point out that the game can get tedious in the end game department so let me make one point that i admittedly did not describe in the original review you have the choice of several scenarios for starting a game you have the classic mode where you start off with 3 survivors of a crashed space liner that was destroyed above the orbit of a in the sticks outer rim system in this one your goal is to guide these survivors off the planet which there are multiple ways of achieving either by constructing a spaceship yourself or treking the planet and finding one yourself i want to point out that this is in fact entirely optional and you are free to do other things as you wish be it conquering the other communities that inhabit the planet or whatever this was something i also forgot to mentionl being a management sim you will be managing your colonist s day to day lifes from setting their schedules dictating what jobs they will be doing and everywhere else in between their skills will help you determine what role they will be performing in their activities for the most part they are capable of being left to their own devices but you can also force them to do certain tasks above others this is also where the job prioirty system come in so you can have a single colonist mine for minerals cook make clothing and everything else in a elaborate order every colonist has their own backtory that gives them unique behavior you might have a drooling braindead colonist who hates mundane work and has skills of 0 in everything so you might have a use of using him as cannon fodder during a raid a planting seeds in your farms for example the other two starts is starting off with a single dude with a handsome amount of supplies and another one where you start off as a 5 man tribe and researching is far worst because of the nature of this start these starts are regarded as being extra difficult there s also the choice of player made scenarios on the workshop if you ever crave more plus you can customize them to your hearts content and upload them for others to enjoy too so what are these tedious things i spoke of well if you re determined to get off the planet finding the components for the spaceship isn t easy the research required will take a tremendous amount of time both in game and in real life hours you have to essentially research the whole tree to get the required tech to add to this without the proper mods it is not possible to actually tell your colonists to research because research is regarded as something that is a long term investment which i don t particularly agree with finding the ship parts can be risky since you must trek out of the safely of your colony over long distances to get these items which may or may not be guarded by strong guards in the maps they are in so if your colonist dies that s food and any weapons they have wasted and there s no way of regaining the items back i hope this supplementary review was helpul for you the ever so hesistant buyer and similar so sos who think the original review still wasn t conving you at throwing 35 at this amazing game without seeing some of the silver linings of it as well i m trying my best to explore everything when i do reviews like these so i apologize
