2018 for a game in early access dead cells has a surprising amount of polish to it it s a blend of silky combat and smooth platforming combining the difficulty of dark souls with the scale of symphony of the night you re going to have to git gud if you want to get remotely close to the end at least in its current iteration while there is a steep difficulty curve for new players dead cells never feels unfair the combat is tight and the weapons varied there s a flexibility here that allows you to play the way you want if you improve your twitch reflexes and have a ton of patience you ll have a lot of fun gliding and hacking your way through each level take the path you wish and keep grinding until you reach the end if you can just be prepared to die a lot and to hate yourself for just not quite being good enough when you eventually complete the gauntlet laid out before you you ll feel like you truly accomplished something rare and beautiful as someone who has been burned by early access releases before i can safely say that dead cells is worth a buy right now edit 1 0 looks great motion twin s set the bar for early access and how it can be done right
