2022 as someone who s dedicated most of my gaming life to simulation games which are essentially my go to titles i can t really endorse the sims 4 over any of its earlier versions despite its commercial success the sims 4 has some specific issues that have caused quite a stir among fans online it all started with the absence of babies pools and ghosts initially and other problems emerged that didn t sit well with players both the base game and the various expansion packs stuff packs and game packs for the sims 4 saw a significant price hike especially with the release of cats dogs many fans weren t happy with this move as the increased costs imposed by ea made it even more challenging for players to afford the game s additional content i must admit emotions take center stage in the sims 4 promising a shift in how sims navigate their feelings for the first time we could observe our sims experiencing emotions such as anger frustration fear or even boredom and responding accordingly the game incorporates several emotions with some introduced through expansion packs although emotions were touted as a significant gameplay changer they don t quite have the impact on the unfolding of the game as expected given that emotions are the primary focus of the sims 4 it s crucial to familiarize oneself with at least the most important and common ones the mechanics of emotions function in a simple manner quite similar to the well known mood modifiers from previous titles what sets this title apart is the potential for situations people and even objects to influence a sim s emotions furthermore each emotion can manifest in different degrees evolving based on the sim s current state for instance a sim could feel embarrassed very embarrassed and ultimately mortified the maximum stage of this particular emotion one of the most persistent gripes from players regarding the sims 4 revolves around the exceedingly fragmented content within the game the company intentionally divided specific items or gameplay to generate more expansions or packs a glaring example that left fans fuming was the my first pet object pack introducing the option to create hamsters and small animals the discontent stemmed from the pack launched post the cats and dogs expansion which easily could have had its content seamlessly integrated into the animal themed pack eliminating the need for a separate sale it s undeniable that ea s latest title has its fair share of drawbacks but for anyone who s a fan of the franchise and enjoys simulation games the sims 4 still holds its ground as a reference boasting enhanced graphics and a handful of commendable expansions the game certainly has its high points delivering an enjoyable experience yet its tendency to poorly recycle expansions from prior titles lends it a repetitive and eventually tiresome feel here s a swift and personal piece of advice steer clear of purchasing the dlcs don t tumble down that rabbit hole opt for mods instead they breathe more life into your base game than any dlc ever could plus they won t set you back nearly as much considering the limited value and opportunity cost of dlcs
