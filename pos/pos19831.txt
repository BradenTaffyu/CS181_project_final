2020 overallpros a bunch of new nations a bunch of new campaigns good campaigns basic and still complex mechanicscons not a balanced multiplayer public servers repetitivedifficulty regualar hardreview age of empires ii defenition edition a game from the unique franchise that i can t see my past don t playing i grow up playing this epic strategy game and i felt in love seeing the first notes saying that portugal my country was finally added to the game was almost like see a cute baby for the first time in a hospital i bought this game a while ago last christmas and i wasn t still thinking in doing reviews soo it s probably my favorite strategy game and i don t have really nothing to do sooo here it is like i said on the overall the mechanics of the game are amazing they look simple however they are soooo complex i see pro players playing and after i compare with my play style and i don t know what to say the way that you will use the mouse a lot in the beginning to put the infrastructures military camps houses etc and control the army show a basic mechanic you don t need to be a pro to click mouse one 2 times however in a certain lvl u will completely forget your mouse and you will just use him to move cuz you will become already a guy that s playing with the same mechanics however in a fastest and more complex way using your keybind age of empires is a obviously a strategy game and like all the strategy games you need to use your brain to be who use the best strategy and this will make you suffer a loot in multiplayer i don t touched age of empires ii for 5 years and when i boght this one i wanted to test the multiplayer and sadly i suffered a lot i catched people already knowing some strategies to defend and attack better and i was taken from the map in record time after that i felt that the game could have some kind of balencement and don t just have ranked or public server cuz in rankeds you will catch obviously a guy that already have some experience and in the public server you can catch someone of your lvl or someone 300 lvls above you when i talk in lvls it s skill lvls i loved to see a bunch of new nations being added to the game however no one can t say that in a moment age of empires becomes repetitive i would love to see some events with some specials game modes time to time i know that 20 years ago was hard to do such a think like that however today is regular games have some small updates like aoe have and in that small update could be added in the festive seasons a new mode to play multiplayer with the friends and have some fun the campaign of age of empires never disappoint me and this new ones aren t different i loved the portugal campaign don t finished however loved this game campaign old and new will make you interested to see what will happen next and that s probably the best felling that a player can have the one that makes you wanna know more we also have the legendaries battles that i liked it s cool to make a battle that we read in the stories books different i just found a a stupid crash that happens time to time that will make you restar the game it s without anything a litle bit annoying and i don t know that already was fixed however it s good to talk about him in terms of audio the game isn t from another world however in graphics i guy like me that saw the pixels see now the minions like they are just make us old guard player happy this game it s definitely fun really fun to be honest however it s possible that some times you got mad with the multiplayer and it s normal soo just take a camomile tea and chill age of empires ii defenition edition it s a game recommended to everyone that wants a challenge and that needs to improve his concentration because you will need to think twice your decisions everysingle time final evaluation 87 100
