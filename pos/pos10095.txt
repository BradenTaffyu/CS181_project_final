2018 early access review this is the game you sit in work and think about you will become attached to your colonists and become very sad when they die i remember pausing the game for a solid minute after my favourite colonist died and just didn t know what to do i ve even stopped an entire playthrough over a colonist death and that is just a small fraction of the game it is a fun base builder micro management ey type of game and i have never regreted buying it
