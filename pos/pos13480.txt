2022 we never thought it would be possible to cross from one planet to another as such a thing would violate those fundamental laws laid before us by god yet we were wrong as we could see those gleaming worlds up there and if we could see them than there must be light and if light could cross between us and those glittering worlds than so could we and so we reached our tender hands to the stars and so the stars beckoned us forth tempting us so and so we plunged our unknowing hands into the merciless pool of the cosmos blissfully unaware of its unforgiving depths and grabbing at the beautiful worlds suspended there in its clear waters and so the cosmos grabbed back and ripped us down into the icy ocean of inhumanity intending to drown us in it keeping us from paddling our way to these other worlds prohibited by god we did not drown however rather we dove and changed in an instant into something so great and so terrible we became as gods in our cruelty innocent kerbals doomed to orbit the sun eternally unable to die and condemned to a ceaseless torment so undeserved more kerbals still thrust forth into the dim and horrific depths of deep space ungraced by even the light of our sun much less its comforting pull kerbals slammed into celestial bodies in terrible time manipulation accidents eviscerated in completion without even a moment to register their fate or beg for mercy and so as gods we dove deeper into the pool of the stars weighed down by the corpses and pleas of those kerbals we tormented so and when we reached its cold barren depth we stood not in the garden of knowledge which we sought and sacrificed so many in the name of but rather upon a meaningless altar of sin and before laid before us the universe all of it every inch perceived and so in this moment something came to us upon the altar be it god or something else it did not love us for it spoke unto us but three words feel and understand and immediately god was gone and immediately we felt we felt every single plea every bargain made by each poor tormented kerbal soul confined in their hells wrought of silicates battery and steel every single prayer for saving which fell upon deaf merciless ears every microcosm of pain inflicted upon those fortunate enough to be treated to death in a failed launch or time accident every sob and agonized moment of aching and longing felt by the families of those brutalized and abandoned kerbonauts every ounce of sin we had wrent from the wet cloth of our tangible realm we felt and we understood in an instant and so it was understood that we were not as gods in our actions but as devils that what we had wrought in the face of that something more that true deity was unforgivable and irreparable we were forced to perceive the torment we had brought down upon every kerbal we sent beyond our world and it was too much we cried out then from the pain of our punishment in its magnitude and our incapability to bear it any longer we cried out then but two words be not and so all was not for the only way to atone for our egregious miscarriage of godhood was annihilation suffering cannot be born out of an abyss and so our everything became just that abyssal the light of the cosmos was snuffed out in an instant as we uttered those pitiful words from our black altar deep in our ocean of sin buried beneath another mountain yet of viscera and glittering beneath a blackened sun and so all matter too was stripped away nothingness in absolution an end peaceful lethargy be put upon us an end to the disorder which hath been brought down upon the sweet innocent world now nothing may happen and nothing may keep happening forever
