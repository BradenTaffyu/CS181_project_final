2016 after the huge dissapointment that ruined the fallout franchise and decided that fallout should be a fantasy first person action game with an ilusion of choice codnamed fallou 3 we actually get a fallout game ladies an gentlemen welcome to vegas new vegas now i ll be comparing this masterpiece to both fo3 and fo4 new vegas is set much closer to the original fallout games on the west coast where super mutants don t exist everywhere for shooting things reasons there are no colapsed buildings to force you to go around or use console comadns that annoyed me so much the only way i was traveling the dc ruins was using tcl there are no enemies named raider the raiders are part of different gangs there are factions something thatwas missing in fo3 and they don t shoot at you for gameplay reasons in case you haven t figured it out i m talking about the enclave who even if you side with them still try to kill you just so you have something to shoot at that shoots back at you speaking of the enclave wtf are they doing on the east coast in dc i tought they blew upp at the oil rig back in fo2 you can still find remnants of the enclave scattered across the mojave and they are well aware thet the enclave blew up at the oil rig one of them can be your companion companoins who won t hate you because you want to make money oh and inn this game you aren t a concerned middle aged white parent or a 19 years old daddy s boy no you are a mailman the mailman who has more than 4 answers to a question in fo4 you had 4 options 1 yes i ll help you 2 a question that lead to the other options3 sarcastic make a bad joke that will make the player feel embarased they chise it and help him 4 i don t care about you but my character and quest marker does so i ll help you anyway kind of option that will make your companion hate youin new vegas you can talk your way out of most situations with a skill check and not having to quicksave before you choose something in case you have 10 charisma but you still fail also this chr checks are not color coded for people with low int see what i did there who can t read numbers also in fo4 int no longer affects your speech because they could t record so many lines take this for example fallout 4when you meet kellogg no matter what you say all options indicating that you are a middle aged concerned white parent your options are i ll kill youi ll make you sufferi ll make you paya bad joke about killing him again in hell or something like thatyou can t convince him to leave either by a speech check or by having low int you can t side with him but you can shoot him because this what fo4 is all about shooting things and being a middle agedg concerned white parentin fnvwhen you talk to the legate you can tell him to f ck off you can convince him to fight you 1v1 with a karma check karma no longer being in fo4 orwhen you meet with benny you can just kill him have sex with and kill him in his sleep let him escape and tell him to let you live etc also new vegas includes dark humor not bad and embarasing jokes that only a middle aged concerned white parent would say in fnv you have no family no friends it s just you the mailman and that makes you feel like an adult making your own choices that affect the game the 4 main factions are mr house the ncr the legion and yes man s independent new vegas when you finish a faction s quest you don t get the same end mission yeah you have to face lanius but under different circumstaces like you do in fo4 also some may disagree but its better if the game doesn t allow to play after the main quest because if you sided with let s say the ncr you ve probably done all of their quests before the second battle for hoover dam if you would still be ablle to play there d be no legion no mr house so it s better if the game ends with the main quest also this game includes gambliing just like fo3 and fo4 but unlike fo3 and fo4 it s gambling with chips and money and all that not your skills and dialog options there are also plenty of smaller factions such as the great khans the bos who can either help or work against in the second battle for hoover dam take this for example colonel moore from the ncrasks you to spoilers deal with the bos you can initiate the self destruct sequence just kill them of sign a truce between the ncr and the bos each of these options will give you a diffferent end slide and the courier can decide if the choice was either good or bad you can play as a saint or thedevil s right hans if you want you don t have to be the wasteland s hero fo4 wants you play as a good guy but it doesn t really let you help people in fnv you can really help people if you want to like helping people in freeside kick their habbits not making you build houses like a minecraft for settlers who are never happy there are plenty of houses in boston you don t need more
