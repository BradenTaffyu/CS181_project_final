2016 hearts of iron iv is drastically different from hearts of iron iiialmost in every way better hearts of iron iv manages to remove all of the extra complexities of hoi3 without sacrificing the in depth nature of paradox games for example i have almost 250 hours in hoi 3 and i still don t fully grasp naval combat i have almost 2 hours in hoi 4 and i almost fully get naval combat the one thing i would say is that personally i prefer hoi 3 s graphics but that s just my preference i know a lot of people prefer the new graphics more paradox rebuilt this game from the ground up and in conclusion made it amazing
