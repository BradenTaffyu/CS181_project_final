2019 while this isn t very good fallout game i can say i still enjoy it one of main reasons i pick fallout 4 are the older fallout s game engine are like y know aged and it s not well plus i can t play vanilla anymore once you into mods you can t stop and just like skyrim this game are made for mods the fallout s good old rpg recipe aspects are kinda lacking if u compared with older fallout games when in terms on combat this game are way better because fallout 4 s aim to become practical action shoot and loot game rather than classic arpg game the story i think it s decent just like older fallout game you have multiple ways to go through your story and you ll get multiple endings the thing is you can t really become a bad guy even with nuka world dlc but you can be anti hero ish the mechanic some people might not agree if a talking protagonist are improvement but i on the agree side and an improved companion mechanic are nice too i mean i can get to know them better i can say i like all of them unlike older fallout games some of companions are hard to get close by the romance mechanics although it s simple i think it s a great addition all and all the companions are more alive than before the combat system though are improving the ai are smarter now they cover when shooting and throwing grenades but it s not much except feral ghouls sentry bots and deathclaws they re way nastier than before yes this game are not running well even on vanilla i ran it for a while until i install some mods lol you can get major fps drop in crowded areas like downtown or inside a factory or other cramped place but i still fancy it this game are like one of my happy places wish fallout 76 are single player based i ll buy it 7 5 10 for mods mod highlight if u hate pesky settlement system use sim settlements mod i kno y all been there before you guys wanna search of decent retexture mods for clunky fallout 4 check out this modder s page he s awesome
