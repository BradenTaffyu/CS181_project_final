2016 early access review tl dr for people who just want the quick and silly reviewsi convinced my friend to eat a roasted cockroach and then watched him succumb to disease 10 10 would make my friends eat roaches again now with that out of the way project zomboid is a zombie survival game which has been in steady development for the last six or so years it takes place in the town of muldraugh kentucky and the surrounding areas of knox county fun fact the scene in which the villians men are marching up a street with a tank towards fort knox in the james bond film gold finger was shot in muldraugh over the course of it s development project zomboid has suffered some outstanding set backs paypal and google freezing indie stones accounts piracy of the game early in it s development and the theft of a large amount of code stored on a pair of laptops despite all that project zomboid is still here and it has come a hell of a long way gameplay involves scavanging supplies from the houses belonging to your ex neighbors fortifying a house to hold off the steadily increasing number of zombies and generally trying to set up some kind of long term survival zombies have infectious bites scratches which is an issue i have with the game when you get bit or scratched you might as well just quit no point in continuing to play a doomed character fortunately the sandbox mode allows you to turn the infection off or tweak the gameplay and zombies in many other ways the game also features basic crafting and construction which allow you to make a few small utility items or build very simple structures cooking is a good source of fun especially when you are playing with friends the best part is making rat soup and making your friends eat it the game also features a fair bit of random variable when it comes to the zombies noises of any kind usually attract them including the ambient noises you hear around you as you explore a major source of game ending noise are burgler alarms and helicopters the burgler alarm triggers sometimes when you break into a house the noise it makes can be heard for miles and will attract every single zombie within that area of effect they will descend upon the house and rip it apart searching for the source of the noise not to mention you if you are fool enough to hang around said house the other source helicopters have a large range of noise and if they come by while you are outside they will follow you around imagine a news helicopter trying to get footage of an unfortunate survivor unaware that their presence is dooming him her other noises such as gunshots barking dogs screaming people serve the same purposes but to a lesser extent the ambiant noises occur once and basically just move zombies in a shortish range towards the sounds origin point it also serves as a bit of atmosphere speaking of screaming people npc are planned you can go to the community hub and see as everyone demands and complains ceaselessly about the lack of npc s some of them even know that zomboid did have npc s once they were horrifyingly buggy and were removed to be worked on at a later date for now the game is perfectly playable as is if a little empty if you want to fill that world out a bit make it seems a bit less empty you can play zomboid with your friends the new easy co op is out as of 5 9 2016 and i am deeply thankful that it is hosting multiplayer with friends has gone was a horrifying hassle of opening and forewarding ports running external server programs and friends issues with relayed tunneling it is now a simple streamlined click and go system thanks indie stone and thanks to general arcade for helping them get it worked out the new co op multiplayer is great you can even allocate how much ram you want for the server from inside the game it is really easy to use and thanks to it i can force my friends to eat rat based meals and roasted cockroaches
