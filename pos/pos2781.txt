2018 i m 35 years old and the first time i ve had a happy cry in my entire life was playing this game i didn t even know that type of emotion existed inside me just just hurry up and give them your money hell buy it twice and for all your friends excellence in story craft like this happens once a generation so don t miss it also whatever you do do not go for spoilers of any kind just take some time off work and play this game trust me the only danger here is that after i finished the game i kinda feel like i m done with gaming i feel complete like every game i ever played was building up to this and nothing could ever be better than divinity 2 particularly lohse s story arc so keep that in mind you might be spoiled after playing
