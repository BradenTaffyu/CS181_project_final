2019 might be the best medieval role playing game ever maybe only daggerfall or morrowind would top it with kingdom come deliverance right behind it or tying it definitely top 5 you can play as a noble knight ragtag mercenary even a trade merchant how you respond to lords will either raise or lower their disposition to you which can effect whether they will support you in battle or support you in receiving fiefs and what not the combat and controls are solid and very well done for such a small company i would also say this is one of the few games to actually have solid horse combat down i feel when you play most games with horse combat its usually just easier to get off your horse and fight not in this game being off your horse will get you killed much faster there are no quest markers and there is no main story this is a game where you create your own story you will need some creativity and imagination to get the most out of this game most peoples goals will be to help a certain kingdom take over the world or to create their own kingdom and take over the world the early to mid game is probably the most enjoyable as end game can be kind of repetitive still i highly recommend this game to people who love medieval rpgs 8 10 please note that i m very conservative when giving ratings with a 5 10 being neutral meaning there is usually nothing notably special about it p s it also has a ton of great mods including one of the best lotr mods i ve ever played
