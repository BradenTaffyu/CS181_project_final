2020 so let me start by saying i hated this game i hated this game so much i uninstalled this game 4 times until recently downloading it one more time because i was very bored i don t know what happened this time but everything i had learned just clicked despite not playing the game or watching tutorials for 8 months if you are just starting this game out let me say it is worth the time it takes to learn typical of paradox they offer a game experience you cannot experience anywhere else and it is definitely worth learning i have a newfound appreciation of a game i went out of my way to tell people i hated and was terrible so long story short get this game
