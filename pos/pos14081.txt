2020 this game is all about solving problem not problems like what is beauty but practical problems what more is that you have to start solving problems long before they actually appear running low on algae for that precious oxygen generation no more coal for energy generators suddenly a water reservoir you thought as unemptiable is empty yeah gotta not just start thinking about the solution when the problem appears but build the base around the solution from the beginning obviously you cannot do that if you are just a beginner and know nothing my first dozen of so colonies were a mess and i pity dupes who had to live in them but learning in this game is surprisingly fun once i realized my fatal mistake i would restart and apply acquired knowledge to the next attempt and finally 100 hours in i managed to launch a rocket in the space which is just the beginning i gather have to spend another few hundred hours to make sure
