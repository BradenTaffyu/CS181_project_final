2015 early access review it was the middle of winter our farms were no longer supplying us with food my friend and i were barely surviving the winter when nightfall came we both rushed to our little camp we carefully rationed out food plotting our goals for the next day suddenly the ground shook we both stood confused the shaking continued until i came upon a realization before i could speak a large bipedal deer who had a single eye approached our camp we attempted to flee but we had no torches the deer tore through our structures first went the thermometer then the farms then the science station then the crockpot my friend and i attempted to fight but its claws tore through us like paper first my friend fell then i did with our last waking moment we saw the beast destroy the campfire and our remaining structures chests were spilled we then rage quit 11 10
