2016 i v been a total war fan for a long time and i v got to say this feels like the best way to play it with the new unit types and magic and so on it really breaths fresh life into the game i have had some issues with the game starting and trying to play co op campagin but this happens every time i v played a game on launch but to sum it up if you re a fan of total war or warhammer or both get this game
