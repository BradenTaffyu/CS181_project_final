2017 for someone who s tried to get into the kind of games paradox produces for a long time and never really succeeded stellaris has opened a door to previously unknown experiences the game starts you with a rather helpful and annoying tutorial once this is complete you re fully ready to throw yourself in and start filling your plate with everything this game has to offer the first thing i did was create a race of highly intelligent and fascistic penguins ruled by ping gwon un on the planet of pyeonyang my empire sprawled across the galaxy discovering incredible and interesting tidbits scattered throughout the stars absorbing our foes and spreading our culture it was pretty goodafter you ve done that a couple of times though the novelty begins to wear off the game is still a gripping strategy game with multiple elements to keep up with and no two games will ever be alike but the little miniquests and flavor texts get repetitive system names become familiar and the sheer randomness of ai races causes them all to blend into an unimpressionable sea of likeness every time there s a new expansion this is refreshed to a degree but it always comes back this isn t really a major negative point all games do this eventually and the rest of stellaris is still enough to keep me coming back for more it s just a shame that the great feeling of discovery is so fleeting overall great game great soundtrack great atmosphere there is almost always a new tactic to try a new technology to utilise or some new forgotten horror from beyond the edge of the universe to conquer you are given a lot of freedom in how you choose to play this game there s always some uncertainty to how politics will play out among your neighbours and there s a good chance you ll be spending a lot of time thinking pretty hard about your next turn far more than once
