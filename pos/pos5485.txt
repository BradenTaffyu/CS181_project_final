2017 early access review after a untold journey i arrived in joppa a small vinewafer farming community as i arrived the local warden quickly murdered the first quest giver and i was left to question what to do with my time i headed north to red rock and cut my way through the snapjaw that inhabited the caverns there i found and slayed the girshlings but was unrewarded for my work due to the death of mehmet at the wardens hands i found another mentor in the local tinker who works on the western edge of joppa i turned in some of the artifacts i had found and he sent me off to collect some wire which i happily did with his device working he sent me off to meet with the great tinkers in grit gate to decipher the strange signal his device was now recieving the tinkers at grit gate needed me to prove myself so they sent me to a nearby garbage waste facility rescuing some out of service droids i returned victorious and lost my tongue to glowrot unable to continue on with the quest or communicate in any way other then nnnnnnnnnnnnnn i murdered and robbed the tinkers of grit gate and claimed the underground laboratory for myself
