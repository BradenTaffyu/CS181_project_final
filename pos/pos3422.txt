2016 undertale what to like about this game warning undertale is best played without any prior information go in blind then you will understand what the game truly is the morality system your every action has consequenses unless you go into the game s files the game could potentially remember you killing a single enemy and then reseting 100 times the game is not afraid to shatter the fourth wall and when it does it does so with glee the combat system the game is a combination of traditional rpgs and bullet hell shooters you can dodge every attack if you are good enough also with the ability to spare of kill any monster you encounter it challenges what we think of as good rpgs the story while the story is basic at first it is more about the characters you meet along the way flowey the master of fourth wall breaking and a terrifying creature toriel the motherly character who will do anything to protect you sans a skeleton armed with bad puns and bad times papyrus the brother of sans who will do anything to join the royal guard and loves cooking spaghetti undyne the leader of the royal guard with a hotheaded personality alphys the royal scientist with a dark secret and a passion for anime mettaton the killer robot tv host asgore the king of all monsters not to mention each monster in a battle has a personality the endings neutral pacifist and genocide the three endings i can t spoil to much except that each ending accomplishes very different things for example while pacifist gives you a feeling of happiness genocide is physically and mentally exhausting in genocide you re gonna have a bad time the music oh my days the music beautiful in every way is this a good game yes this surpassed all my expectations 10 10
