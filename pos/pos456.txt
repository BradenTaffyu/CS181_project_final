2019 stardew valley is a wonderful game filled with character heart and there is also farming and mining there is so much to do in stardew valley and i appreciate that you can do it all at your own pace the game can feel a bit daunting at first and you will find yourself playing on one screen and having the wiki open on the other screen there is so much packed into this game there s farming selling mining fighting crafting cooking and building all of which are done very well aside from the clunky fighting where this game truly shines is in the people that populate the game and the story that unfolds as you get to know each person is shane the town drunk or just a young man fighting depression and hopelessness is haley a stuck up princess or will she realize there is a good life in the simple and mundane will leah do something with her art will clint overcome his low self esteem and ask the girl he pines after out is penny destined to live a hard life with pam her alcoholic mother why is george such a grump he will tell you and you will look at him differently afterwards will the two secret lovers ever become public will lewis put himself first instead of the town will elliot get the courage to write will the governor ever like the town soup will marnie ever be available when you want to buy animals nope each character in the game has personality and a story to tell as through these stories your first impressions of characters may not be the impressions you have of them later in the game shane s struggles hit home for me as did penny s longing for a different life this game helped me get through some dark times in my life and i am grateful i purchased this during the steam summer sale i am even more thankful that i took the time to play the game and understand it putting in a little effort makes the journey a far more enjoyable experience lastly the modding community for this game has turned the game into an even better version there are many mods to choose from and i appreciate all the creators for the work they have put into this wonderful game mods i use and enjoy docs google com
