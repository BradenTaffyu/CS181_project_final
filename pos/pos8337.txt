2021 this game is so amazing the best describe of it is like 1st day of play graphics is so awesome every detail around is so nice and smooth you can feel that cold around yourself so many possibility and features touch you every ingame minute art is amazing you just find yourself looking at pictures that game throwing on you during events and traveling phases your first decisions is like oh this guy feel cold so let him heat his home a little your second decision is like this kid needs to rest and be in safe so you build shelter for kids and let them be in warm safe zone your third decision is like nobody will work overshifts in my town ppl need rest in these cold days we have tons of rss for now so your ppl will be happy and less discontented also for first time you never pass another law which can do some harm for your ppl because you want be true and correct ruler if you are normal balanced person ofc you want save everybody and be kind to everyone you build them nice cemetery where ppl can rest in peace you also start you way of believe in god because ppl need something to believe and you think that faith is a way how help those poor lost souls find their path again and motivate them to survive this frozen hell you dont push it hard just a little faith to survive now you think you are doing very well yeah well hell no with this style of gameplay you probably end your first playthrough in first two weeks with no resources frozen population and even much worst scenario d so here we go our second try another day 2nd day of play graphics is so awesome every detail around is so nice and smooth you can feel that cold around yourself cold is a core of this game so you have to like it afterall right so many possibility and features touch you every ingame minute even after few hours of playing huray art is amazing you still just find yourself looking at pictures that game throwing on you during events and traveling phases sometimes you can start yourself a little sad because you again see some hopeless places in those pictures and descriptions of totally lost world but still art is amazing huray again now you are smarter you are trying to find a little better way how to farm some more resources to survive that bloody cold so coal is primary right you focus some more production for coal and also consider that ppl may work a little longer they are not happy but that is must for our city kids are kids you keep them safe for whatever happens this round you consider who will come to your city and who not because last time you died from overpopulated city it is hard decision but you will not let come more ppl until you are prepared spoiler you will never be prepared in this game but for now you still have thinking like that so far you survived few more days than previous run so you are so happy and you think this is the way a hour later you find your city ruined because your panicked again during cold night and your generator just exploded from overload because you wanted to warm up every ill homeless person to lower discontent to at least playable level well that is it you finished all three dark souls games for 100 so you think those previous runs you were just out of luck yeah just unlucky so there is it third day 3rd day of play i still like that coldy graphics feel but sometimes its a little too cold devs were crazy during development but its a challenge i like it so many possibility and features touch you every ingame minute even after few hours of playing but you starting to hate some features especially random hazards which killing your ppl because you forgot to make hospital on day 1 art is amazing you starting to skip some pictures because you already seen them on your previous runs but you cannot wait to see more new ones ending especially and finally this time you swear you will not repeat your mistakes again so you will be a little harder to your ppl we must survive you say so you employ few of your kids in some gathering jobs at least they will not be bored anymore right also faith is not the best way for ppl we need more working morale to survive this city a little police can help here to keep a watch for my workers we will consider radical treatment this time we need heal our sick ppl faster even in case of more deaths and amputees eeeh nah that extreme cold at the end of scenario is just too much for your poor city game over again bro and thats it this is how game works motivate you to try find optimal way in scenario for reaching end this game do it in very good way because its so much fun to see those fails and decisions and after many days you just find yourself in totally different playstyle like 25th day of play looking for even more challenges achievements etc dont care about graphics anymore just need to finish it on extreme survival dont read descriptions or looking on art anymore just give me those steam cores who needs features i just need coal and steam cores your playstyle now is like in my town every ng amputed kid will be employed in coal mine 24h per day damn we have one bed for two patients and you all will be eating sawdust also preventively we will execute everynigh one person to keep a order here damn oh i so love this game it is so much fun 10 10
