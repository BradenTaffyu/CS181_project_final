2017 if you re a fan of the civ series and a fan of strategy games in general you ll enjoy this hours can go by quickly and with four initial races with mutliple lords there s a lot of replayability yes the dlc is ridiculously priced and is bad practice but you re not being forced to buy it and the hours you get for the price are much better than the alternatives
