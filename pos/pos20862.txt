although the game was mired with controversy at launch surrounding the author jk rowling the developers did not take part in this and sought to create a companion story to the original harry potter series 100 years before they began as the batman arkham games gave you the power fantasy of what it is like to be batman so to does this game in the wizarding world you fully as immersed in the world of hogwarts and hogsmeade each of the four houses you choose have their own common room and supporting characters the combat is quite fun giving you a range of spells to choose from the game is not much of a school simulator at rockstar games bully or atlas persona is as it opts for a more action adventure open world genre i would definitely recommend it on sale if you haven t already or at full price if you re a fan of the wizarding world
