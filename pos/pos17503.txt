2017 tl dr i really enjoy the game despite having no attachment to its fiction it s deep technically well balanced and a whole lot of fun with a great setting and an excellent tense campaign and if i someone no real interest in rts or warhammer am enjoying the game this much then i can confidently recommend it to pretty much anybody this game is worth paying full price for in my opinion but if you find it on sale for around 30 you ll be getting a steal there are potentially hundreds of hours here so if you re a fan of turn based strategy real time tactics or anything in between pick this up without a second thought more detail i m not a classic fan of the total war series the only game i ve played in the series was rome ii which is referred to by many of the series longtime fans as the overall worst game in the series i actually liked it quite a bit but just couldn t get around the various glitches bugs and jankiness and eventually stopped playing the game in frustration of having battles stolen from me by units glitching out and getting slaughtered i decided to pick up warhammer after seeing it on sale last week for 15 and boy am i glad i gave the series another shot because i m really enjoying this game i have no attachment whatsoever to the warhammer world i m such a neophyte that i didn t even realize a fantasy element to this fiction existed i thought for almost a year that this game was a total war based on the warhammer 40 000 variety because i didn t know there was anything else i believe that coming from such ignorance allows me to judge the game purely based on its merits rather than viewing it through the rose shaded goggles of a warhammer fan the things that ruined my experience most in rome ii are completely removed from warhammer the bugginess of combat and the convoluted way that some of the strategic layer worked are gone all refined and streamlined into a system that s very easy to understand when compared to that game i find myself greatly enjoying battles now that they aren t plagued by units bugging out on walls or geometry or getting themselves killed when they don t do what i m telling them the scale is also far longer here in rome ii you can only have units be so powerful when at the end of the day they re all just at most human beings riding horses in a fantasy setting though you can go balls to the wall you ve got nearly indestructible emperors riding huge winged beasts wizards that can blast apart entire enemy lines by themselves giant cannons capable of raining destruction upon enemies which is great because you re going to be fighting some pretty terrifying giant monsters on the other side of the map it adds an entirely new level of flavor to the total war system it s fantastic a big change that i love is that the leaders of armies are now single units with upgradeable equipment rather than elite groups of spearmen cavalry etc there is truly nothing more bad ass than watching the emperor swoop in on a giant man eating griffon to save one of your infantry units that is about to rout by smashing half of the enemy s and routing it almost instantly i also like that there is no concept of passing time in this game as it allows you to become more attached to your leaders rather than levelling them like in rome ii only to have them eventually die of old age even if they re your best units it s wonderful and the light rpg leveling system adds a lot of attachment to units that could otherwise remain pretty generic the different factions in the game operate so differently from one another that it s almost unbelievable the way chaos and greenskin factions work is so different from the humans and dwarfs that it may as well be another game it s really astounding just how much meat is on the bone with this game i never had much desire to play units other than the empire or bretonnia but the sheer variance in their gameplay styles provide literally hundreds of hours for somebody who wants to try them all that is an amazing amount of value considering i paid 15 for this game but the thing i love most about the game so far is the incredible tense feel it has you re told pretty much from the beginning that there is a chaos invasion coming and that you d better prepare for it as a warhammer noob i had no idea what that meant but holy hell did i find out your first campaign in this game is pretty much doomed to fail and i kind of love that rather than leaving me deflated and frustrated as i would have expected it left me feeling challenged could i play again and knowing what i know now succeed it also left me with a completely different feeling playing through a second time like there was a dark shadow on the horizon and i better get my crap together and be ready for it it adds one more additional quirk to what is already a very competent turn based strategy real time tactics game and makes it a truly great one in my opinion i ve seen some people complaining about the chaos invasion mechanic asking for an option to turn it off and i can see how it would be frustrating if you re a fan of the series and are looking for not much more than what you ve gotten in the past but for me it led to an extremely tense dread inducing experience like the pressure was on and i was the only one on the map who could deal with it it feels very much like mass effect 2 on insanity a creeping sense of being completely outgunned and wondering how the hell you re going to deal with the that s coming your way and desperately trying to make the most efficient moves possible to tech up as quickly as possible and equip yourself for the great challenge ahead from a narrative perspective it feels remarkably like the oncoming invasion of the others in martin s asoiaf fantasy series or sauron s and saruman s war in tolkien s lotr series i found the warhammer fiction to be really intriguing as well and far more inspired by reality than i expected it to be while tolkien s middle earth is not tethered to anything but his own imagination and martin s westeros is loosely inspired by british history warhammer seems to be clearly inspired by the early holy roman empire and its struggle with the viking invasions of europe at least from what i see int his game i m lukewarm on fantasy but a huge fan of historical fiction and warhammer piqued my interest enough to make me want to pick up a few warhammer fantasy novels and see what they re like i do have some complaints about this game though though not as bad as rome ii it still runs somewhat poorly on my gtx 1080 with most battles hovering somewhere around 50 fps at 1440p additionally this game has some of the grimiest dlc i ve ever seen blood and gore has actually been removed from the base game to sell at a 3 price point which is just as ridiculous as it sounds i ve got a feeling that this is more on the publisher side rather than the developer side but whoever is responsible for this reprehensible practice should be ashamed of themselves that said a lot of the dlc is actually really good as the additional factions freshen the game after a few playthroughs
