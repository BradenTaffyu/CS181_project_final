2023 i m a little late getting to the ets 2 party i started playing ats a little over 2 years ago i ve since amassed over 6 000 hrs in the game i actually knew about ets before that i was searching you tube for info on head tracking diy s when i saw a demo of one using ets i was really interested but ended up going with ats then i got in to doing skins in ats and i actually spend far more time in the game testing skins than actually driving now i delayed getting into ets for this very reason i ve slowed down on the skin making and am taking time to make you tube videos so i thought good time to try ets it s great i wish i had purchased it sooner the game play is very similar to ats and the menus don t look any different what is different is the truck trailers and scenery the trucks are a little strange for a canadian at first but i quickly grew to like them the scenery is fantastic in ats the buildings look the same wherever you go as it covers one big country in ets you go through many countries all with their own style and the game reflects that i ll probably never get to europe in real life but i am gaining an appreciation for it through what knowledge i do have plus playing this game i highly recommend it
