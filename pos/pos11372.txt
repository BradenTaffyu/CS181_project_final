2015 early access review i m surprised i didn t play this before last week because it s amazing this is what i ve been wanting out of all the dayz and rust style games that are out now sure dayz and rust have appeal in their own right but this feels more like a simulation you can pretty much do anything you must use strategy and if possible teamwork this game is super fun and addicting the way it s designed makes sure you never feel safe or secure there s always something that needs to be built or crafted to survive and you have to explore often to find supplies i ve had a few truly terrifying moments while playing this and it s generally the moments where you can t see what s going on that are the scariest
