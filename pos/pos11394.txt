2015 early access review the first few nights i spent huddled in a dark corner of a scrap metal shed hoping they wouldn t notice me then i set up camp in a brick building in a town i found eventually i built outer walls with steel doors and they noticed that night they clawed through my doors and my walls killed about ten with my crossbow but then i ran out of bolts a few more with a barbed club and then i hid until morning after i had gained a respectable amount of loot i moved to the city picked out a concrete parking garage and filled all the walls with reinforced concrete and metal bars lived fairly comfortably for a week or so it had been pretty quiet since i cleared out the area built a farm on the roof and put in a small well and a bridge to the next building as an escape route lots of loot self sustained great i had built a foyer shooting gallery so that after they got through the front door they were stuck at another door and i could shoot at them then one night they just wouldn t stop comming i must have killed forty before they got through i went to run but the dogs got me respawned with hardly anything and right next to where i died died again then a few more times before i retreated back to my small town with no clothes and my tail between my legs sigh 10 10
