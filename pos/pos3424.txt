2023 there s nothing i can say about this game that hasn t already been said hundreds of times but it really did change the course of my life for the better i still take inspiration from its morals and listen to its music on the regular it s not without flaw no game is and it s certainly not going to be enjoyed by everyone either maybe the humor doesn t click with you or the gameplay is a bit too slow for your liking but please if the fanbase and its reputation have scared you away from giving this gem a shot put aside that perception and try it its critical acclaim and massive fanbase didn t spring up out of nowhere after all
