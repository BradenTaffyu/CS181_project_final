2015 early access review joined a mysterious map with friends i worked hours on hours perfecting our base to live through the winter friend finds a fire staff in a chest i created wooden walls and trees all around us unknowingly pissed off a tree and started to chase us friend pulls out fire staff torches it to the ground the pissed off tree caught our walls on fire whole entire base that took hours burned to the ground in seconds friends laughed as it all burned to the ground friends were trapped in base friends burnt to ashes10 10 would watch their friends catch on fire from their own base
