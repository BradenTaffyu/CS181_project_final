2019 early access review if you love cars whether it s driving them or playing around with drivetrains this is the game for you i ve spent more hours than i care to admit just playing around and building cars in this whether that means downloading one of the many many mods such as 10 speed automatics turbos new engines etc to improve some of the very well replicated 90 s american junkboxes with 3 and 4 speed autos or simply taking a relaxing mountain drive with your logitech steering wheel there are hours of fun to be had in beamng the driving characteristics are very realistic with realistic clutch and shifter usage depending on wheel of course and the game takes full advantage of 900 degree turning couple this with the realistic crash deformations and the possibilities for a unique gaming experience every time are endless
