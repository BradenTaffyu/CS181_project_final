2020 early access review a great game that does exactly what it promises in short teardown is a voxel based destruction simulator pros challenging but rewarding gameplay nice selection of weapons everything is destructible great physics engine independent ray tracing did i mention the destruction already huge modding potential sandbox mode map creator lots of vehicles ranging from race cars jeeps or trucks to heavy industrial vehicles cons occasional performance drops mostly when there is a lot of debris fire particles etc some buildings lack weight majority of missions while being fun and challenging basically use the same scheme minor bugs for example phasing through locked doors
