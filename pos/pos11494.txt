2021 early access review after 2 complete game crashes pretty sure on my end but maybe not and 100 hours later giving this game a big yes if you love minecraft and zombie killing absolutely try this game sure it s been in alpha for 7 years sure there s some bugs sure there s a lot to make you frustrated but there s also a lot to be enjoyed this game leaves you to do what you want at your own free will you can spend your time base building completing quests exploring new areas killing zombies more it can also be modded great weapon variety and very enjoyable with an xbox one controller there is a balance to this game however as with any other game you aim to improve and upgrade this game leaves you trying to survive for as long as you can until the blood moon arrives these blood moon events really set the boys apart from the men you re probably going to die a lot base building perks upgrades really help in this area expect to have a decent rig for this game though i m scraping the bottom with an i7 laptop 8gb ram and 2gb graphics holding steady at 30fps with medium details on 1280x768 resolution take it from a beginner who hasn t played before this game is absolutely worth trying tldr minecraft zombiekilling what more could you ask for
