2020 so this is going to be a long review ye overall so compared to thehunter classic this game is much more fun and the game looks really beautiful and i am not even playing on max graphics this game is not pay to win the sounds of the game are really nice and atmospheric if you play on singelplayer there are quests you can do and if you play multiplayer you can hunt together with your friends there are 16 weapons you can buy with ingame currency overall i would say the game is worth the money maps and dlc s you can play on all maps without buying the dlc s the problem is you can only join the server of other people if you do not own a map dlc if you want to play singeplayer on a dlc map you have to buy it but there are still free maps if you d like to play singeplayer if you join a multiplayer map you do not own and the owner leaves and noone else in the game has the map dlc the server will shut down in 15 minutes but it will tell you before the server shuts down so you have time to collect your animals or make some kills you can shoot all animals you want you do not have to buy a stupid license or some to hunt you aim you shoot guns and items the game has some weapons types to offer rifles handguns bows crossbows shotguns yes some weapons are dlc s when you start the game you get 3 free weapons a rifle a handgun and shotgun you can buy 8 rifles 3 handguns 2 shotguns and 3 bows with ingame currency and without any dlc s all dlc s guns are free if you buy a dlc there are different types of ammo you can choose from and you have a lot of scopes you can use for your guns all items for attracting animals are not dlc you can buy different camo clothes for better hunting and backpacks to carry more guns and other items all backpacks and camo clothes are not dlc items all not dlc guns can be purchased with ingame currency gameplay you can choose how you hunt may it be with a bow or a rifle or handgun or whatever do you want to wait for your animal to come to you or do you want to be sneaky and sneak over to your animal or maybe just sniping them from a long distance its up to you you can see animals tracks like footprints and other stuff so you can find them easily the animals behave realisticly and can smell hear and see you the animals look and sound really realistic sometimes it can be really challanging to shoot a animal you have to think about the bullet drop and the travel time
