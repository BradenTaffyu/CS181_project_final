2017 i have to say that this is perhaps one of the most beautiful games i ve ever played the scenery and the level of detail from terrain to lighting effects is amazing i am running it on maximum setting visuals are absolutely stunning there are couple of things i d like to see addressed 1 addition of a vehicle would be welcome the area is expansive and talking simply takes too long to get from one area to another of course the point of the game is to walk the vast terrain to observe the pray and scout locations it s a simulator in the true sense of that word but having a vehicle to quicly reach a hunting area would be great yes there are check points with fast travel but it s not enough 2 walking noise could be improved you have to move very very slowly to avoid making noise that s also a very realisting idea but taken a little too far in my opinion 3 tracking animals is unreliable at times the track simply stops as if the animal was abducted by aliens at other times it reaches a point where it goes in a circle it s a little frustrating when you track game for a good while only to reach a dead end 4 some bugs although the developer seems to be very engaged it s a minor problem at this point no crashes or anything just weird visuals once i shot a fox that was standing next to another fox and the second animal didn t even move just stood there i could walk up to it and shoot it point blank odd unless he froze on purpose which i doubt overall very unique experience visually stunning first hunting game i bought it really is great and i would recommend it happy hunting
