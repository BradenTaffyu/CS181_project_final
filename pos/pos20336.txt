firstly shoutout to michaelalfox and northernlion on twitch whose runs of this game had me hooked from months ago i haven t played much yet of 1 0 but i have over 200 hours in the demos this game is wonderful it strikes such a cool balance between big number dopamine we re goin crazy and actual strategy you can sit and work out what will be better or you can just vibe it and either way you ll have a great time there s so much replayability here but even if there was only one or two decks in the game there are a lot more i found myself finally beating the starter deck and instead of thinking sweet onto the next one i instead found myself wanting to run the starter deck again but better if that feeling translates to every deck in the game i may never put this bad boy down on top of that it s incredibly easy for the very involved and creative dev to expand should we ever get bored add one more deck into the game and watch everyone flock for another 3 months trying to figure it out a handful of new jokers or a new tarot card here and there it is so well set up for expansion and has a dev who i think will look to improve and expand as time goes on though i wouldn t blame them if they took a few months off hits all my endorphin reactors makes me happy makes me lose track of time makes me theorycraft on public transport all the giddy feelings i haven t had for many games over the last few years
