2018 fallout new vegas vs generic and predictable storied fps shooter pretending to be a fallout game a k a fallout 4 in this game you play as some random jack off who delivers mail but news flash somebody else wants the mail for themselves so they shoot you in the face for it but you survive because plot and are pretty much free to roam the wastes and pick sides with one of the 3 major factions or being a rebel and try and over both factions with a robot programmed to do everything short of sucking you off i e chose your own storyin predictable generic story 4 you play as generic father and or mother with a happy family but then uh oh da bombs r droppin so you gotta take your plastic ice cream cone looking ankle biter and book it to the nearest vault which is conveniently located on the hill behind your house where you wake up short of one plastic lookin baby so there ya go you gotta go find it fallout new vegas vs fallout 4 perksfallout 4 was really lacking in perks and diversity between perks with only a few to choose fromfallout new vegas has many diverse perks like the rad child perk that regenerates your health more and more the more rads you have or the unstoppable perk which basically makes you deal more damage to npcs who attempt to block your melee attacksfallout new vegas vs fallout 4 skills fallout new vegas has an extremely wide set of skills for you to pick and choose from that actually make a real difference in how you play and what you can dofallout 4 however has a very very watered down perk system which takes place of skills i mean for sake non automatic shotguns count as rifles to the rifleman perk major emphasis on shotgun and rifleman fallout new vegas vs fallout 4 weaponsfallout new vegas gives you a very wide range of weapons to choose from each with their own unique benefits and each with their own unique weapon attachments that provide even more benefits and effects in fallout 4 however there s only a few weapons and the only variety comes in weapons that are unique as in same weapon model but with special stats or abilities while fallout 4 s weapons have more customization options there aren t a whole lot of weapons over all and most of the mods and attachments are useless after you get the ranks required to upgrade em fallout new vegas vs fallout 4 power armorin fallout 4 you get power armor in 5 minutes after leaving the vault depending on how quickly you wanna get get it not to mention other suits of armor that are scattered around like poorly hidden easter eggs however bethesda decided to nerf the new and improved le epic power armor by making them run on rare power cores not really you can buy em from vendors for 500 caps each if your charisma and barter perks are gud enuff in fallout new vegas you can get power armor in the first 30 or so minutes of the game again depending on how fast you wanna go but you need power armor training to use it where as in fallout 4 you can just jump in and go and i know what u boize and or grills may be thinking but but he s a veteran yeah but his wifes a lawyer and it doesn t stop her from using presteige military grade armor which is pretty lore breaking honestly but that happens more than a few times in fallout 4 look it up eh that s pretty much it if you re looking for a worthy sequel to fallout 3 then fallout new vegas can satisfy your thirsti still enjoy fallout 4 but not nearly as much as i have enjoyed new vegas fallout 4 was overhyped and didn t stay true to the fallout name where you can create your own character and be who you want instead in fallout 4 you re cliche father looking for his son and the things you do and the people you kill in the process have little to no effect on the story literally every ending except the institute ending has you pressing a button to blow up the institue in the same place and over all the story just feels lazy and generic tl dr fallout 4 was over hyped had a generic story with lazy endings but i still enjoy it not as much as i do new vegas because war war never changes but guess what fallout 4 did for the worse in terms of what a fallout game used to be and should have been and i hope so much that the next fallout game doesn t follow in the footsteps of 4 but rather in the foot steps of fallout new vegas
