2017 this game and perhaps ds1 has ruined every other game for me since i ve started playing the souls series i have not been able to fully get into any other game i ll start playing something else but am always thinking about yet another way to play this game building yet another character why oh why can i only have 10 using a different weapon and style of play people ask me whether i get bored playing it again and again for me it is no longer about level design but rather about discovering new ways to play and challenge myself for me i feel there will never be another game like this
