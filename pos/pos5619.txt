2022 early access review this game is still in early access after all this time and it s still getting large updates and it still has some wonky design decisions but it s entertaining and addictive if you like the genre and easily worth the asking price in its current state first accept that the game cycle is repetitive you ll visit towns to pick up troops and quests you ll attack roving bands or static locations to level troops or complete quests or get loot you ll return to towns to do smithing heal or get new troops and quests you ll read or skip dialogue choices because you know what is at the end of them i thought that so much repetition would be a dealbreaker for me but it isn t first off the game presents a difficulty curve with at least three distinct phases that each have unique challenges at the start you do a lot of running away from fights and getting captured recruiting randomly and fearing you ll run out of money exiting this stage requires you to learn how to personally fight trade or pick better battles for loot that justifies troop losses in the mercenary phase your success leading a small band becomes stressed by a new need to be wary of diplomatic entanglements of your faction in this phase and the next you gain a new appreciation for the interplay between speed and force in the vassal independent phase the mechanics of armies sieges party reinforcement food and influence take a new meaning now speed force and cost along with the burden of caring for fiefs is all equally important in the king phase if you choose to attempt it you suddenly thrust yourself into the crosshairs of every sovereign nation and the combined force of all their vassals will successful players learn tricks to make these challenges seem easy sure and you can go looking for guides online if you don t like the satisfaction of learning for yourself but if you do like learning this game is a nice puzzle to unlock dozens or hundreds of hours spent unraveling what makes the game tick against this backdrop of player growth there is a well developed personal skill tree with progression tied to a combination of points spending and actual activities of the player there is a trait and relationship system which just might cause you to think twice about the person you marry or the quests you accept there are 6 different nations with enough variation to justify divergent play choices and starting builds even before considering flavor alone as a motivating force each weapon not only has tier and damage but speeds associated with different kinds of attacks and defense lengths weights and effective sectors of engagement your equipment horse and fight style preferences are personal rather than dictated strictly by leveling up the option to roleplay all the way down to a walking simulator or ignore the tedium and interact purely through menu interactions is a nice touch unit choices party and army compositions command choices unit formations counter compositions and counter play timing and opportunity recognition are all more relevant in this game than simpler get big win type titles the game world is alive with factions and parties following the rules and trying to get ahead by doing it they may not be as effective as the player but the map borders will move allegiances will shift and prices will fluctuate following supply and demand even without player intervention compared to a stale experience like x4 this was a welcome feeling of immersion concernsif you don t intentionally go into settings and consider performance and graphics choices you may be disappointed with stutter or unacceptable cpu loads for example the default fps limiter is set to 200 which causes my decent system to spike resources to fulfill 200 constantly reducing it to 60 gives the same experience for a third the resource cost ironically this complaint is also a side nod to how ambitious the game tries to be in allowing 400 1000 individual models to interact with each other with terrain to ragdoll and subject each other to attacks that are hit location dependent in interesting 3d environments the game is technically multiplayer but not in any meaningful way i strongly prefer multiplayer games for long term fun still the singleplayer campaign and sandbox has offered relaxed enjoyment for too many hours to complain about in case i didn t mention it the basic play cycle is actually pretty repetitive ask yourself if you enjoy similar party mercenary trader free agent games like port royale or star sector if the answer is yes you probably don t mind this kind of repetition you will be tempted to restart a lot as you learn things what is interesting about this point is that it s hard to actually lose but easy to feel like you should have done better i have played from the beginning on ironman at hardest difficulties and still i have known every time i restarted that my game wasn t over each time i was starting over because i learned something important and wanted to improve even if i got bored with this game in the near future it s hard to claim that 200 hours is anything less than a full price value
