early access review i ve been a fan of caves of qud since the early 2010s it was one of the first roguelikes i played and it captured my imagination unlike anything else i ve been playing it off and on ever since since then the game has evolved and become bigger and better than ever before the game is supposedly releasing sometime this year i m excited to see what they come up ps this is one of the only roguelikes i ve played that has great controller support i ve been playing the game with a controller for the past few weeks and i don t plan on going to back to keyboard mouse any time soon the controller support is that good
