2019 early access review awesome game i ve just done an hour long race in an m6 in one of mrgit s lobbies with a full grid the race started on a rainy afternoon and with accelerated time finished in the evening no longer raining but a wet track except a dry racing line i ve got a decent enough pc to run in vr and i can honestly say towards the end i d forgotten i was playing a game the sunset and light reflecting of the track was stunning physics utterly convincing well done kunos the game s a work of art thank you
