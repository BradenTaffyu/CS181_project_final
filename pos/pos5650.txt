can t do a properly review but i can tell you my short storyfirst 2 5h of game spawn on map randomgo to first town and buy some gearrecruit 5 peasantsi saw a group of 12 bandits and my warrior instincts push me to battle i should realise early i f ing dont have any warrior instincts got captured and abused by those bandits for 1 2 days this story repeat few times 25h in game restart few times and learn basics of games and from previous mistakes no more shopping in early for gear so focus only on troops and get an army of peasants around 30 35 at that point in game i see myself like genghis khan or something but another huge mistake they are quite good vs normal bandits looters etc but very weak vs steppe bandits i got r ed again and lose all my peasants 35 40h in game i learn to do saves and avoid to get my army wiped every time huge progress right i kissing a55 of rhagaea and become a vassal get some fiefs of my own and decent army companions caravans become a rich bi h and everything going very well but somehow my lovely queen start war with all kingdoms in game and those npc target only my fiefs racist npc s after long battles and few maybe more beers i lose all my fiefs and get angry at rhagaea capture her and hasta la vista baby here i learn the consequences of execution not recommended 70h in game manage to conquer 80 of map and get bored take a break 1 week and accidentally discover mods of this game on nexus steam workshop spend hours playing with mods to realise some are outdated and they destroyed my saves but it s okay i started again to play with game of thrones mod get an army of giants and fight with crazy queen for westeros domination she has dragons on steroids black slaves with no pp but my little army of 300 giants with huge clubs win at limit our last battle for westeros i couldn t kill her so i propose to become my wife another mod she refused because low relationship keep her in chains for weeks kill most of vassals and propose again she willingly accepted the marriage after p s jon snow you should have done the same in the serial edit 115h in game after few hours spent in the wonderful land of westeros where the giants seem to hit harder than the train i said to dragon queen auf wiedersehen schl mpe nostalgia and memories where get bandits abuse every 5 minutes made me go back to the classic version sadomasochistic most probably this time i decided to play the role of a roman emperor so i installed ca eagle rising chose the name nero and started the long journey to find sporus i hope you know a little history after 1h in the game i realized that groups of 10 20 bandits are no longer enough of a challenge for a god like me so installed a mod and set bandits party with a limit of 180 never in my life have i participated in more brutal gangbangs than those made with this mod i m not going to lie i really enjoyed it except for the part where they captured us and my wife get killed rip khalifa
