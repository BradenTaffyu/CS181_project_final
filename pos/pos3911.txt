2020 this has become one of my favorite games of all time it s as if every creative person making the game had a brilliant idea of what they could put into the game and actually implemented all of it the story is amazing and actually keeps you captivated throughout the adventure along with characters you learn to all like crafting tactical combat music art customization beyond belief over 150 hours in and still only around half the game took my sweet time with every side mission and crafting options
