2022 early access review fantastic game very addictive gameplay loop great music great game to play to destress and relax and hilariously entertaining cutscenes my only complaint is that it is kinda short as i ve been able to do most everything in it in about 15 20 hours of play but it s only 20 and it s still in ea so i m sure i ll be getting a lot more time out of it anyway and they re constantly adding improvements as well was going to put in feedback that we could use a sort option in the recipe menu and they did in today s update are they psychic very addictive in all the right ways update post release still loving this game but with the full release we ve got some new content that doesn t feel fully fleshed out yet stuff like enemy movement can get kinda jankbug where the game forgot my keyboard existed only once thankfully some minigames are a little wonky mario one has weird spacing and the stealth level is mehcould use more breathing room between eventsless button mashing could use an accessibility option for it and just turn it down anyway my keyboard is going to call the police on meoverall still loving the game would be a 10 10 were it not for the above issues and it s still like 9 10 with them excellent game that could use a couple updates
