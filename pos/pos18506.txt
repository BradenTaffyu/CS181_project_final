2018 i ve already put a lot of time into the moblie version so i highly reccomend the game the game is fun and not very pushy with its microtransactions and is being updated with new features constantly engineer pls now for the advantages of the steam edition going high rounds on mobile was very slow and laggy but now on pc im flying through the freeplay rounds positioning is also much easier for those ouch chimps attempts that need pixel perfect dart monkey spots several hotkeys have been implimented like in btd 5 like tab for targeting backspace to sell space to fast forward or start round and comma period and slash for each respective upgrade path one thing i noticed that could be improved is if the tab button could be used to re target the mortar edit there are hotkeys for each tower kinda wish this was explained better or was customizable but its better than mobile for sure that i noticed with these hotkeys is that the powers cannot be spammed with shift namely the red hot spikes this used to be a feature in btd5 when spike piles were not powers
