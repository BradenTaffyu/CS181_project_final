2014 190 war thunder mmo 5 war thunder 10 10after i played 190 hours of the game i want to write a small review about war thunder this is one of the best mmo simulators i ve ever met the battle aviation armored vehicles and in the near future are likely to add a fleet also there are 5 countries to choose from nothing like this i have not seen the game for an amateur do not judge it in anything bad in the course of the game i found no cons except that there is not a big imbalance that does not spoil the game the magazine igromania called war thunder breakthrough of the year the game is done professionally and deserves the highest score 10 10
