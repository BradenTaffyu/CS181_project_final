2017 when and if you buy fallout 4 its a bit different but still fine i still give it an positive post it is way different from previous game sand a lot new stuff were added and some stuff got removed but still it is pretty good but i would like old features to make an comeback for the next game to feel like the old way how it was before with karma and faction systems like make it feel that every choice you make has a real consequences new vegas and f 3 was a masterpiece fallout 4 is far from that but still pretty good id say din its own way
