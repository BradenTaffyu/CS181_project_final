2018 early access review i can understand people s frustration with some of the as yet unfulfilled development progress and its pace but there is already a unique stable and highly detailed game here taken to an incredible depth by an extensive modding community personally once a game has more than discharged its value and is a a viable and essentially complete game as is i m not fussed about extended early access this is a cracking and unforgiving survival game and deserves to be highly regarded and well reviewed its slow progress notwithstanding once modded it has the depth of unreal world and its entirely possible to forgo the zombie apocalypse altogether and just carve out your existence in the woods in a highly detailed survival experience consequently its not a game for everyone but if you like this sort of thing this game is almost without paralell its a little clunky the graphics are basic the combat merely functional but the survival aspects which is what i personally am really after is superb if you re after a zombie splatterfest you re probably going to be disappointed they exist pprimarily as jeopardy for your scavenging but if you want the best survival experience i ve yet discovered do yourself a favour and grab this one
