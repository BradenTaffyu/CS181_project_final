2021 early access review love the game but has serious lag issues with menus which never used to be there so every menu it stutters for 5 10 seconds on an ssd pretty sure its having a major problem with loading the thumbnails for items and units so every time you wanna trade lag every time you take prisoners lag every time you wanna upgrade your troops lag may seem small but having this constantly with every menu you open gets seriously annoying id say get it because its great and the mods will be unbelievable but wait until they fix this damn stuttering also dear devs literally no one cares about mp thats not what your fanbase is so stop updating that rubbish and focus purely on the core game cheers
