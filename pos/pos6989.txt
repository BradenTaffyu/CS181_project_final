2019 early access review raft while in real life this would be one of the worse things that can happen the game is actually fun and enjoyable playing it together with a friend partner is even better it makes all the farming and scouting easier aswell unless your partner is a meanie who pushes you in the water when you re not paying attention building stuff really does make the days fly by i ve build a tower so far up i couldn t even see my own raft below me anymore the game could easily put in more features items and building options but so far the devs did an amazing job love the graphics designs and visuals all were to my taste was fun to spend my time on this game do note this game has a lot of repetitive gameplay so for ya ll do your homework on this game first before buying and giving it an bad review just for that
