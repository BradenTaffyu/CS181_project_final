2017 only played throught the high elf campaign and i am very happy with this game i can t get enough of it great improvement from the last three titles don t get me wrong i like warhammer 1 but in it s release i felt like i was playing a platform with a lot of lazy reskins but this game is far from itthe good very exciting objectives and gameplaybeautiful graphics compared to the firstvery well optimized my system is 2 years old and i m still getting around 50fpsgreat battle soundsand i love the treasure hunting mechanicsmall settlements are back but not as big as normal tw small settlement siege agent activity actually works the bad some glitches like summoning rats will glitch and beat up your lordno bloodwhen using intervention armies they tend to bunch up over one settlement the best mortal empires is going to be free this is an amazing thing that they are doing more races and much larger campaign map that ties both worlds together definitely worth the 60 bucks good job this time off to play the lizardmen now
