2020 early access review i ve put a lot of hours into this game and i feel like it captures the spirit of the original and brings new life into a game that had strong foundations bannerlord expands upon those foundations without losing its charm it s fun and as deep as you want it i can t wait for mods which are the true life to the mount and blade series
