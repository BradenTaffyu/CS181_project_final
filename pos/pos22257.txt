2019 i lost my souls virginity in 2015 when i spent the night at a friends house and he had just finished his first sl1 run of ds1 and he wanted to show me the game i was hesitant just being a human being in high school everyone has heard of dark souls and its ridiculously high skill floor that will punish anyone unable to take a few poundings for the sake of growth i gave it a whirl and he told me to play as a knight because it would be the easiest if i was new to the game later experience has told me that he was either full of it or genuinely had no idea what he was talking about a few years later i went home for winter break my first year of college and one of my best friends had gotten really into ds3 and offered to lead me through the game in co op i had very little experience in soulsbourne games and playing in co op seemed like the way to go so i could at least try to have some fun about 90 hours later dark souls 3 is one of my favorite games of all time easily in the top 10 along with the original jak and daxter game dishonored and dark souls 1 as of late this game was my first in depth souls experience so i m very familiar with it and i have a fairly easy time playing it which leads me to feel that this is the easiest of the 3 ds games whether that is truly the case or not i absolutely love this game as of writing this i have almost 450 hours most of which were spent grinding for the sake of hitting max soul level and i have completed the game 8 times including an sl1 playthrough that absolutely obliterated my pooper some of my favorite parts of this game i have four different favorite bosses each with a different category nameless king for challenge because midir just makes me sad also he has one of the best boss fight songs yhorm is probably my favorite boss in terms of the lore of his plight i feel genuine sadness when following siegward s quest and i really appreciate it conceptually the watchers of the abyss are my favorite boss as well as exceptional boss music artorias from ds1 is such a cool idea and the fact that this boss is an homage and continuation of artorias is very nice and well done in my opinion my favorite boss to actually fight is the dancer the fight seems to balance all of the skills you ve acquired throughout the game and she s just dang fun to fight my favorite environment in the game is farron keep calling back to artorias the wolf covenant is located here and the whole feel of the area is eerie and memorable
