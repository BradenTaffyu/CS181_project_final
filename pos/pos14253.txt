2021 early access review i ve always had a fascination with astronomy engineering and physics but this took it to a new level the idea of a dyson sphere was always one of the most alluring concepts to me as far as future tech was concerned to live in a day and age where a society can collaborate so perfectly that it could create such a structure felt like a dream to me but this game gave me a window into that dream to be able to exist in world where even hypothetically as a collective we can create a theoretical concept for the future regardless of whether humanity will ever get there it gives me a little hope for a possible future i never played games like this before builders and factory games were never something that even crossed my path let one drew me in but this game opened doors for me gave me ideas plus the concept of being a lone individual with such a god like power to shape your part of the universe carving out planets and owning stars while you contribute to the whole of the galaxy along side other engineers in their own cluster is a very empowering idea the gameplay mechanics are phenomenal the limitless possibilities of factoring in resources from planets across multiple star systems planning to create massive structures with nigh infinite power at your disposal harnessing the power of the sun itself in the palm of your hands then exploring further to touch another this game has so much potential and it s still only in early access if you have a head for a game like this or if you are looking to try something new it s definitely worth the inexpensive price tag i dont think i ve gotten this much out of many games for a very long time i definitely think freeman would be proud to know that his vision came to something of a realization so close to his lifetime
