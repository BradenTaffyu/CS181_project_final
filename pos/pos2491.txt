before i start the review i am a f2p player who has been playing for over 7 years the game is definitively p2w however it s not insanely one sided for context i am able to compete in pretty high ranks even though i am f2p if someone today were to spend 10000 they would not be able to catch up to me even remotely if i face a high ranked whale in pvp content i can win against them if i play smart draft well and have a tiny bit of luck on my side the progression quests when you start the game are very helpful in understanding boss mechanics and general knowledge about the game they also give very good rewards early on i would recommend following them until you get a hang for how the monsters work and what monsters you enjoy using the early game pve content can be very fun while also being very challenging for newer players understanding the mechanics of the dungeon you are clearing and what monsters to bring to counter that is a very big part of the game and gets more rewarding the better runes monsters you have my favourite part of the game is theory crafting and building teams that clear the dungeons very quickly as a new player i would not worry about rta real time arena at all for a while this mode is usually where people who have been playing the game for years and know the game in and out compete if you do not know what you are doing you will get destroyed basically every match guild content is good and provides decent rewards for newer players i would recommend trying to join a lower level guild pretty early on there are many guilds that allow new players and love giving advice to help new players out overall i would say its worth giving the game a try if you go through the progression book after about a few hours you should know if the game is something you may enjoy
