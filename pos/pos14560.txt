2023 more in depth game than civ v while keeping the hex grid based structure allows for incredibly in depth planning for maximum efficiency but that s mostly for personal satisfaction than wins but certain poor placements certainly can cost you wins leaders feel very different from each other and really tilt you towards playing in certain ways which i find keeps things interesting absolutely hate dealing with sweden though something about her rubs me the wrong way overall a deep strategy game that will last many many dozens of hours before becoming dull i generally play level 6 ai and it s challenging enough but every game feels winnable
