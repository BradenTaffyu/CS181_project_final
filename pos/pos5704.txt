2021 early access review with all the recent updates i d have to give this game an 8 10 i really do like it and want to see it the game finished and out of beta phase there s a ton of things i d still like to see implemented in the game but i will wait patiently even if nothing more is added my rating for this game won t change i enjoy the game as is and mods only make it more fun the current game is set to feel more like a warhammer game with you as the physical commander unit unfortunately for you unless you re up against a bunch of peasants with pitchforks or bandits with pointy rocks and butter knives you re going to struggle in larger combat scenarios if you try to go head to head against the enemy the ai isn t very smart and they ll pull some really stupid moves when given control i can t count how many times i d given the ai free reign of my troops while i charge the front lines with my personally crafted 2 handed sword and i find myself in the same situation as optimus prime fighting in the woods alone surrounded by 6 150 enemies with real army equipment unless i m late enough in the game to have my fitness skill high enough to outrun most troops that s a good way for me to find myself dead the easiest way to go against armies is actually pretty realistic skirmish with an archer unit while cavalry flanks with their lances and have your infantry advance from the side to surround the enemy when the enemy has heavy cavalry themselves just use your own horse and aim for their riders with your 2 handed axe or a polearm if you re practiced enough with the bow you can get headshots on other horsemen for days even at range in close combat with the real men it s heavily recommended to use a 2 handed axe or the sword shield i like to make the game more of a challenge and turn off the auto directional block feature so having a shield is very helpful to my survival especially because more often than not i end up veering away from my infantry line and picking off a group of enemies that leave me backpeddling while swinging my sword trying to survive outside of combat the other game mechanics are pretty interesting there are several quests offered at random from settlements be they villages towns and noble lords the longer you last in a campaign the more challenging the quests become on average the hardest quests are either raiding settlements of a warring faction or capturing a town that might have upwards to 700 defenders that leads me into raids and siege battles raids are pretty simple and somewhat difficult to fail i ve never seen a village with more than 60 defenders and it s set in an urban area with houses and fences so it s normally no trouble to deal with the peasant levies i fear no amount of infantry troops it s when they have archers and stupid amounts of cavalry i start to be worried unless you prepare to fight them in the battle by changing up your formations you can estimate each enemy horseman is worth 2 of your infantry troops sometimes more if your line of archers is left undefended from their charges in a siege battle on a castle or a town sometimes the best answer to the siege being successful is to not build any siege engines at all there have been numerous instances where i have had better success less casualties by just using ladders to scale the walls than a wheeled tower if you have more men than the enemy defending a settlement and you re able to breach the walls the rest is a cinch and you can essentially auto resolve unless you re using a monster of a computer and set the maximum unit capacity to it s highest setting there will be several pocket groups of soldiers spawning once a set amount of their unit type die infantry archers horsemen horse archer and have set spawn points not too far away from the ai sets them to defend once a castle or a town is broken into and your troops start flooding in you can wholly expect a plethora of the initial craven defenders to break ranks and flee for their pathetic lives it s a favored pass time of mine to hunt them down before they can escape into the lord s hall since each killed man is nothing more than experience points in my eyes when attempting to build relations with lords of the realm the best way possible is to spend time first as an independent mercenary instead of immediately selling yourself out to the nearest faction take your time and do quests for the leading noble houses to build relations and work on your roguery skill by raiding caravans from far away kingdoms and performing jailbreaks for any and all lords when you see them locked in a dungeon they ll be eternally greatful if your efforts are successful if they re not you ll find yourself in the same dungeon behind bars alongside them in the worst case scenario you ll perform the jail break but either you or the other escapee won t live to see the light of day again yes your player character can and will eventually die either from combat a warriors death or from disease or old age this can also be toggled on off in the campaign menu but it s far more fun that way and losing can be a very painful experience especially if you happen to have a spouse or kids thankfully if you have an heir of age death is not the end your new player character will instead be your child who inherits all the assets of your clan and potentially your kingdom if you had been named as the ruler it s most amusing to see the npc reactions to your new player character especially if you happen to run into the noble lord that remembers executing your past character in combat lol once again i give this game an 8 10 rating because it s so much fun and it s always replayable combat never exactly gets boring because of the changing terrains and battle conditions and the variety of ways you can approach most interactions i recommend to all gamers that enjoy games like total war warhammer conquerors blade kingdom come deliverance empire at war
