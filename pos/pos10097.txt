don t be confused by the name this game is not about rim ahem sorry what i meant to say is that this game is a spiritual successor to dwarf fortress a game where you watch little brain dead dwarves build mine and craft an ever growing empire you try your best to keep everyone alive but sometimes things happen disasters raids forgetting to clean the floor causing your cat to walk through spilled beer and dying of alcohol poisoning by licking its paws rip sniffles you were my baby rimworld is the same in spirit you watch your brain dead pawns build mine craft hunt research and farm with the ultimate goal of leaving the rimworld roll credits you are on you need to monitor them almost constantly in the beginning watching out for things like their mood their health and their work schedule forget to build a table so your pawns can eat like civilized folk well the next thing you know one of your pawns goes into a blinding rage while the other dies of hypothermia from being stuck in the freezer during a food binge babysitting pawns is not the only challenge you will face the game has several story tellers basically settings for how random events generate in the vanilla game there are only 3 1 to choose from randy random he is the perfect embodiment of an uncaring god giving and taking from you as he pleases just barely survived a manhunter pack with 80 yorkshire terriers i m sure you can deal with a strike force of 30 bandits armed to the teeth that is about to construct a mortar to shell you into submission but i see you are struggling to tend to your wounded so i will airdrop some drop pods filled with medicine that should sort you out right the random events combined with managing your colonists makes for great emergent storytelling once you are bored with the base game you can delve into mods there are thousands of mods adding things from extra hairstyles to complete overhauls of the theme tired of sci fi try the medieval overhaul tired of boring old humans try the myriad of mods that add alien races want to be able to get intimate hold hands with your elven waifu try lover s never mind anyway enough rambling this game is definitely worth checking out if you re into colony management emergent storytelling and pain and suffering i rate it 10 10
