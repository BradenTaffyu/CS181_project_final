2016 oh dear where to start first off this is a great game people who love total war and people who love warhammer will enjoy it there will be some people from both groups who hate the game and there reasons are sound but there on the extreme end of the player base the games fun changes everytime you start a new campaign no two campaigns are going to play exactly the same which i like its everything you have come to expect from a total war game but is that enough for me the answers yes but only just let me explain i do enjoy the game last nights first play through on the vampire count campaign had me coming up for air at 3am but some things i would have expected arent there now this wont take away from the game there just things i expected from both a total war and warhammer title let me explain lets start with the total war part of me the dev s made a choice it seems to make the siege system simple so as not to bore the younger warhammer players who might not enjoy it so much which i understand but i expected more i expected to be assaulting a city or walled town not a corner of it or an empty field it seems in this you have taken to far a step back another miss was giving me cannons and volley guns and catapults then forgetting to add mounting points to my walls try as i might i dont see how that one was missed then from the warhammer side of me im gonna use the empire as a reference for this cause its the easiest but it does apply to all current factions you have your basic army list in there nicely structure well thought out but you missed all the depth that makes its warhammer an empire army just isnt that generic wheres the depth yes i want to see my swordsmen and halberdiers all lined up in formation but where are the units that make the empire armies what they are my knight or the blazing sun or my nuln halberdiers that were always considered better than normal the knights panther or knights of the white wolf you added the lore in part to your building tree but then missed the units out completely its little things like that take away from the game for me overall a good game shame its just drops the ball alittle on the great game i was looking forward to
