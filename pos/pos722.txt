2016 i have never played a harvest moon where i didn t say man i wish they had done this differently or why didn t they include this or even that s annoying i wish they had made that easier this game satisfies everything i ever wanted or wished could be different in a harvest moon and it does it well the other reviewers have done a great job of detailing why this game is great so i ll add a personal thing i ve noticed that is really nice about stardew valley you aren t rushed to finish you aren t rushed at all i have to keep reminding myself to chill out because there aren t any omg time limits on things like other people attemping to marry my love interest or characters moving out if you don t meet their requirements etc the game is exceptionally satisfying in that i feel relaxed about the idea of playing into year two three four etc it s a great new feeling and i can t wait to keep playing
