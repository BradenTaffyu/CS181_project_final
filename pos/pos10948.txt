2016 product received for free wonderful game and aguably the most solid title paradox interactive has ever launched although it s being criticized i feel that the switch to a more sandbox and slightly less railed wwii experience provides both historical grognards and world war microbebies a chance to live out their strategic dreams come on neo ottoman empire that s friggin awesome however for all of the progress made in the field of accessibility and player inclusiveness we still have a ways to go i say this for the thousands of people who are looking at hoi4 or have purchased hoi4 with no experience with paradox grand strategy games the italy tutorial while better than the one included in hoi3 lacks serious depth if a newcomer were to hop in and play only the tutorial then pick a major power they would be screwed a very small nitpick and i understand that in a sense i m trying to have my cake and eat it too you can t have grand strategy without complexity but newcomers could use a little more information they shouldn t have to rely on the wiki for basic info about game mechanics like how to use your navies something completely absent from the tutorial or how to increase the reinforcement limit of airwings so you can continue to fill them with the planes you re producing or how to manage occupied territories and switch occupation methods etc i feel that for the in game tutorial to be successful the player should be left with enough information to hop into the game as a major power and have some idea of what they re doing the fact that the tutorial doesn t cover all types of warfare land sea and air is just inexcusable make jake s entire job working on tutorials with that sweet sweet glaswegian asmr voice of his either way i love this game and see myself playing it for a loooong time to come
