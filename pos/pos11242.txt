early access review it is a lot of fun in the beginning but when your store is at lvl 60 it would be nice if you got more customers and made more money during one day since the expansions and the licenses get more expensive your profit should augment too else it gets a bit frustratingi would like to know what items from the next license are gonna need a fridge or a freezer even just one or two snowflakes respectively would be a great improvementi don t really care about the restockers atm they would make more sense if we get more customers but atm they even make me lose money if they get stuck because then the items they carry just poof out of existence would be much more helpful if they would put the boxes from the curb into the storage room and then if you could tell them which of those tasks to prioritize and when to take a break because you just want to rearrange stuffwhy do cashiers not get faster i expected the fourth one to be the fastest he isn t and even when the store levels and no matter how many customers i check out myself they stay their slow selvesit is great i wouldn t have played over 100 hrs already if it wasn t but since it s still in early access there is room for improvementedit new patch gives more customers can we also pls get snapping for the shelves and lights my ocd would be highly grateful
