2023 alright look did sega launch the game feature incomplete yeah there s still no replays or player names but you know what the core pvp multiplayer game is really good the game is fun if you re here for ai battles or singleplayer campaigns skip it at least for now multiplayer could definitely do with more maps and they re working on that but if you re after competitive multiplayer matches the game design is great and i personally enjoy it the most out of all three games get it on sale if you prefer but the reason why all the critic reviews shower this game in laurels is because they re reviewing the gameplay not the ancillary features and i think the gameplay is worth your time if that s the main thing you care about don t let the bitter gamers talk you out of it
