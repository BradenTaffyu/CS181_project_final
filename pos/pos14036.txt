2020 this game is quite fun but also infuriating in a good way though i have a bad habit of starting over whenever things start getting hard so even though i have over 400 hours of play time as of writing this i have never actually completed the game still really love the game and i can t really think of anything wrong with it to be completely honest 10 10
