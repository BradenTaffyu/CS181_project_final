2019 i bought this game as a filler cheap and something different when i m bored with everything else i had very low expectations this is the best 7 bucks i ve ever spent on a game as a matter of fact i felt so guilty about how much i paid for it that i downloaded the oregon dlc within a few days that was almost twice the price of the game i find this game pleasantly enjoyable and surprisingly addicting i can t stop playing it the graphics are great and the simulation is amazing for the tractors the ai for traffic is another story although not horrible i m at the stage where i ve hauled plenty of cargo both small and large that i have now started using the game as a business simulator although i still haul loads i currently have 3 garages 7 trucks and 6 employees i m at around 80 hours and level 18 and i see no signs of the game getting old to me i truly enjoy this game this game may not be for you but if you are looking here at the reviews you re at least mildly curious so let me say this if you have a force feedback steering wheel buy it i could t even imagine playing this game without one also if you do buy it turn the detour slide bar all the way down in the settings trust me on this nothing worse than driving 600 miles only to have your off ramp block by emergency vehicles and the game forces you to drive a few hundred miles to get around it happens often so turn it all the way down also the traffic violations are very annoying you can turn those off too you ll get a red light traffic ticket simply by going past the white line at a light if a cop is around an there is a ton of cops in this game plus you can rank up real fast if you turn those off and pick long high cost deliveries and put the pedal to the medal and git er done it s also fun to blast past a cop at 90 mph with a 60 000 lb cargo attached to your tractor one thing that would make this game totally awesome would be a vr headset which the game supports i haven t sprung for one yet but this game makes me want to update well i bought the oculus rift and i believe i wasted my money at least for this game gameplay is stuttering mess i ve tried all the online tweaks it got better but not good by any means i have a ryzen 7 1700x 16gb 2400 corsair vengeance ram and an overclocked rx 580 8gb not the ultimate vr system but certainly not the worst sitting in the cab is awesome but once you start driving it gets bad real bad in cities i have a samsung 28 4k monitor and can run this game native 4k at 40 fps while not vr it s way more beautiful imo update 2 i bought a vega 56 for my new vr experiences while it definitely helped the stuttering surging issue the graphics are just not there for me there are other issues that come with the vr version as well i d much rather play this at 4k or even 1440 on a flat screen than what you get with the vr just my opinion this does not change my opinion about the game i love it
