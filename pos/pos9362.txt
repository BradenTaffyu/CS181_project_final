2023 to all the players that put negative reviews because you can t play this game on controller i have legit been in league races and touge servers and cut up servers with my own controller its a xbox controller and i have had zero problem the things with the controller players they usually come from forza or nfs and the driving model in those two games are literally arcade racing sim assetto corsa is a actual driving sim that tries to replicate a real driving experience of course its gonna feel like you re driving a pencil because of how you re used to forza steering but please if you re controller give the game a chance also not all the buttons you find in a car will be available to be binded to a controller don t listen to me play the game yourself
