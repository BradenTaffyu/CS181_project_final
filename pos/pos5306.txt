2019 the end of the world imagine living your life starting a family with a baby and a servant robot and then one day the nuclear alarm siren goes off you leave everything behind and run into the vault tec nuclear shelter nearby seems as if you your wife and son are safe and sound but vault tec people don t want to shelter you they cryo freeze you as some kind of a test subject frozen for years one day you wake up just to witness your son being taken away and your wife shot dead while being locked into the freezer unable to do anything once you get out you find out it s been 200 years after the great war which turned the world into the wastelands what now it is time to begin your quest to reunite your family the fallout previous fallout games were great and succesful mainly because of their amazing storytelling if you are looking for that in fallout 4 you will be sorely disappointed no matter how good the introduction to the game is all the questlines not only the main one are very austere shallow and simply put uninteresting some questlines can be entertaining but lack of choices neutralizes effect other aspects of the gameplay are pretty good it is like playing tes skyrim only with guns and after an apocalypse the game can be much improved by mods which sadly disables the achievements also fallout 4 offers you an option to build bases which could be great and probably is when you mod the hell out of it but in vanilla it is so exhausting to build anything the way you want it summary pros world is vast and immersive perk system well arranged interface weapon mods vaults are amazing post apocalyptic skyrim with guns cons quests are not that great or interesting base building was very frustrating for me very limited roleplay lack of choices power armor can be amazing but it needs repair and new power source all the time shallow story overall rating 7 10
