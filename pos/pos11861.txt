2017 early access review this game is easily one of the best metroid vania type games i have played i thought hollow knight was going to top my chart for the genre in 2017 but with dead cells that has been beaten this game feels remarkably good to play with a controller i ve never quite seen a game so responsive that can make you feel like such a total bad ass one moment to getting wrecked because you slipped up the way the game is set up is also beautifully done and i have to say being afraid of the words rogue like rogue lite this game has nailed it without losing any of the in depth details that random generation usually lose the entire world changes when you die making each play through a completely new feeling of exploration with secrets to find this is what i d imagine if ninja gaiden dark souls castlevania game together and said lets make a kick ass side scoller every single level is challenging and will make you sit on the edge of you re seat as you fumble with your controller trying to not slip up for a single second trying to dodge and parry the platforming is also quality jumping from cliff to cliff and avoid hazards never felt cumbersome and any mistakes i made were becasue of me and not the controls all doing this while listening to a very good soundtrack that will have you feeling the game and moving with it the graphics suit the game perfectly and don t have that stereotypical retro look it feels quite fresh and unique in my opinion if this is kind of quality is early access for the developers i sincerely cannot wait to see the finished product please note this is a extremely fast paced game when i compare it to ninja gaiden you should automatically understand the struggle of those games extremely quick reaction time and a controller are heavily recommended
