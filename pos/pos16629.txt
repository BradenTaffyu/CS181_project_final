2019 product received for free early access review comfy game for car nerds or someone just looking for an escape nothing beats chilling in your garage listening to your custom radio mix working on your pride and joy while drinking ungodly amounts of alcohol or playing dos games on the computer late at night or even just chilling outside and listening to the wildlife all the while learning how to build an entire friggin car highly recommend this game to everyone my only regret is that i didn t join the msc community sooner
