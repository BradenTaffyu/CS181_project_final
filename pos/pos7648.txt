2022 early access review this really isn t just a hurrr car go crash sort of game on the surface it may look as so but the customization of this game is top notch no other game comes anywhere close the amount of parts and tuning you can do is astonishing and there s so many varied options across so many different cars what has me sold is the car handling get a gamepad or a wheel it ll elevate the experience substancially the handling is beyond superb and hard to master once you do though no other car or racing game comes close every other game will feel archaic and clunky and honestly just utter garbage this game has spoiled me and left me honestly surprised at how much value and hard work went into a relatively inexpensive game the developers in my personal opinion have made singlehandedly the most realistic and accurate depiction at how cars genuinely are also get the multiplayer mod nothing really hits quite different than joining a police chase server and having high speed chases with real people
