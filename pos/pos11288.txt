2015 early access review update 11 28 2022 yeah haven t really played this in a long time at the time of this review the game was in a much earlier state it seems that 7dtd is still in early access which should tell you everything you need to know to be honest i have no idea how this game is now don t trust this review i guess just enjoy my 17 year old self s story telling and catch a snippet of one of my exaggerated core gaming memories three friends and i spawn in the wasteland biome thought we could make a shelter out of this apartment complex was going well at first gathered many supplies fortified the door was supposed to be temporary started turning into something permanent everything was going well they broke down the door everything went to hell they started pouring through the stairwell dogs everywhere the only way out was down started running down and dodging walkers we got separated in half two of my friends made it out my other friend and i were still stuck inside figured we d spend the last night hiding the moaning of walkers never stopped morning came it was time we had to go my friend and i continued to drill down passed the horde got desperate i jumped out the second floor broke my legs they were everywhere managed to limp through the horde met up with my other three friendsdon t look back we crossed the river into a forest started off with a small shack turned it into a four house village we had a wall a trench around it we had something we never did forget about what happened that day in the wasteland that right there is just a small story that wasn t even in full detail of what 7 days to die is like very few may say that oh it s just another zombie survival game or oh it s just a dayz knockoff well i m here to tell you that this is not the case at all i own h1z1 dayz and 7dtd i have to say that this is the best one why 1 the developers are actually going in the right path 2 loot system is pretty awesome 3 crafting system is also pretty awesome may take a bit to get used to but still awesome 4 instead of just piling blocks and making a box house there are actually physics to the building system like in some cases you actually have to put support otherwise that sniper tower or that neat house will collapse on you which has happened to my friends it s kind of satisfying to watch but damn you re mad if it s your structure 5 the different variety in enemies is cool right now you have bees dogs and zombies and other different kind of zombies to add to that 6 speaking of zombies this game s zombies have something that dayz doesn t have you know they actually pose a threat and can move in numbers there are moments when you see that police station surrounded by a horde of zombies and you think to yourself no i m good because they actually threaten you the fact that they sprint at night by default settings can be changed also adds a thrill to the game to a point in which you don t even want to leave your shelter at night because you can hear a spider zombie calling a nearby horde hordes also happen randomly at anytime and anywhere this is also unheard of in dayz you never see a horde in that game also as the days go on the zombies start to get a little tougher you start to feel that the apocalypse is worsening zombies are also smart 7 there s nothing more satisfying than fortifying your base to prepare for the undead this game does a very good job at that you can do almost whatever your mind imagines wanna put a trench that surrounds your base and put spikes at the bottom of it do it want to salvage land mines from an overrun military base and use them as your own do it want to build a huge wall around your base do it however don t think that just putting a wall around your base will help zombies will rip through it and actually dig under the wall we ve seen this done in our server before and it s frustrating but it s so awesome having to constantly keep maintanence on your base and look for new ways to prevent them and to see your weak spots these are just some of my points and you wanna know the awesome thing this right here is just an alpha a alpha and the developers have already come this far as i type this the alpha11 update is imminent and should be released any day now this is said to be the biggest update this game has seen this game is going nowhere but up unfortunately i can t tell you about the pvp because my friends and i just normally play on a private pve server and survive together i have no idea how well pvp works if i ever play pvp i ll tell you how it goes
