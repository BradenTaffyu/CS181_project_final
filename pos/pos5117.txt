2015 game starts off a bit slow but then once you get into it you re addicted 7 9 10 the only three things i don t like about the game are 1 no three dog reappearance and 2 the stupid cinematic cut scenes when talking to people yes i know you can move your mouse to skip it sweg and finally 3 how short the main premise is the dlc content makes up for that though and bounced the game back to 10 10 for me if bethesda fixed those three errors then the game would be better for me at least story line is interesting as well as the map of historic boston and the all new characters keep you intrigued and wanting to learn more about them plot twist is similar to new vegas and fallout 3 where you decide who you wanna join and the weapons are also similar music is great maybe should of added a bit more instead of the same 15 songs but i think more were with dlc and updates it s worth owning very fun game
