2020 euro truck simulator is quite popular between my friends so i decided to try it it s actually a lot of fun it s also a nice game to calm down on after a race on f1 for me good graphics very realistic for example driver actually gets tired and when they start to fall asleep the screen gets darker you refuel like in real life stop the car and hold down a key to put in the fuel i enjoy the multiplayer as well it s pretty much the game itself but with real people instead of ai but it s fun d all the apps you have to install regarding this game are very useful for example truckersbook it logs your deliveries and also you can join the trucking company of your friends it s honestly a different kind of game for me but i enjoy it the only negative about the game is that the ai sometimes has low iq and they do dangerous things on the road which is annoying if you are stressed and you want to relieve it this game is recommended for you dgreat fun game
