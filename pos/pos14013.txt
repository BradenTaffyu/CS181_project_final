2020 oxygen not included has been for me a master class in making multiple failed attempts into a fun gradual learning experience trial and error in some games builds up frustration but in my oni colonies when things start to unravel and the writing is on the thermo conductive wall the sense of failure is quickly overridden with the eagerness to start anew and explore a different world with your newfound understanding of whatever mechanic or factor failed you in previous attempts outpost delta learned the hard way that steam vents make crop tending difficult now outpost lambda is thriving with that knowledge in hand this game would work if it took itself seriously and it doesn t even see the need to do that there s something amusingly corny about watching a duplicant inadvertantly seal himself into a wall and suffocate because he s also a notoriously flatulent cartoon man named stinkywho has sideburns there s a few ui choices and interactions that seem questionable but unlike many games many being early access it only puts a small dent in the gameplay experience could more detail be included to guide players towards using materials and buildings right the first time probably but this is the first time i feel like i can say it s simply not necessary to keep things interesting and fun klei has something special here and i hope they re as generous with their content and persistent quality of life game maintenance as they ve been with don t starve this one s a home run edit i want to add in here that it s been a long time and i think i can conclude that this game has an intensely demanding heavy learning curve hundreds of hours in i have never seen the surface of the planet i have never surpassed 120 days basic mid game guides and videos seem to make no sense like they re six steps ahead of my understanding it is increasingly clear that there is a skill level required here that is not within my capabilities and the frustration is made all the more heavy because i want so badly to love this game i m keeping this review positive but will probably uninstall it soon i can t get excited for new content i will never see hitting walls i don t really understand it feels almost cruel i don t even know what i could ask klei to change
