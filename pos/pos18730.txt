2014 i have played this game over 20 hours more than dark souls which was my most played steam game for a long time so it s 20 hours better even though i don t know what 1 hours equals in review points at least it has a higher metahour score in my library this the dark souls of grand strategy games since you need a dark soul to play it at least in mp if you don t recommend this review i will have to annex you
