2018 pretty sure i sold my soul to nurgle for this game back in 200x thank you ca for literally making all of my childhood gaming wishes come true what is there to say about this game it s some of the best stuff from the total war series balls deep in warhammer lore plus you ve got deep charcter progression and asymetrical races with wildly different playstyles battles look insane and for the first time in a total war game characters are actually interesting besides epic fantasy battles tm everything else in this game feels like an afterthought and that s ok i m not interested in having political discussions with the greenskins and dwarves i want to watch hordes of them smash into each other with blunt instruments and squigs in slow motion if you need a deep 4x game look elsewhere while the campaign includes typical 4x strategy features they re shallow and don t add much to the game so basically if legions of monsters killing each other for your entertainment sounds pretty cool and you aren t particularly interested in civ style spreadsheets this is your game on a final note the base game includes hundreds of hours of gameplay for 15 the people complaining about 7 dlc are the same people complaining that their parents started charging them rent after they turned 30 don t be those people support awesome games and the people that make them
