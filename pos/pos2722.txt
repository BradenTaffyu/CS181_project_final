2021 i started this game during covid in august 2020 when a couple friends suggested that it s like a tabletop rpg ttrpg and might be fun to play together weekly i couldn t get into it at first mostly due to distraction but once we got a good third of the way through the first act i was intrigued i then became more hooked each session and by the fifth or so i was loving the game and actively looking forward to our game nights once we were halfway i started a solo save to catch up to where we were more thoroughly following the story on my own it took us about 6 months to finish the game but we never missed a week of playing in all that time and i completed my solo game soon after while it was partially the social aspect of hanging out with friends online it s not an exaggeration to say that this game helped me stay sane during one of the craziest times of my life thus far and it will always hold a special place for me because of it but that was also in large part because this game is simply awesome it s probably the only game that i ended up loving despite not enjoying the first solid 8 hours or so of gameplay os2 is essentially a ttrpg adapted to a fully realized digital world while it has mechanics you might expect for a game going for that feel such as dialogue options it does several other unique things to achieve that feel for instance one of the appeals of a ttrpg is that you can do whatever you want within the logic of the game not just narratively but with how you maneuver in combat considering the limitations of a finite game os2 allows for a multitude of combat options that never feels limited even though obviously it is to some extent the environment is highly interactable and can be used to your advantage with dynamic and creative environmental conditions skills like teleport and various battlefield warping abilities also do much more clever things beyond just dealing damage there s also the system of physical and magic armor that prevents conditions adding a layer of complexity that encourages strategic play even though it s deceptively simple on the surface i still felt like i had the variety of options available in a ttrpg even if it was limited to a finite combination of options it says a lot when being stuck on a given fight could be solved by a better approach rather than simply trying to level up other ttrpg elements deal with the world building story and tone there s a rich world with lots of peoples with their own rich histories and varied proclivities interacting with internal and external factions and nations with their own agendas i like that the different peoples and factions aren t the usual monoliths common to fantasy and demonstrate internal diversity there s plenty of lore to be explored in rivellon that makes the stories and locations you encounter come to life the tone achieved by the narrative is also on point one commonality to a lot of ttrpgs is a serious story that inevitably has some silliness as the players get up to some mischief or another this leads to dramatic and intriguing storylines that are willing to step back for a moment of humor that ideally doesn t break you out of the story this is exactly how i d describe os2 the story is fairly serious and involves some dark themes at times but at numerous points especially side quests there are amusing npcs and conversations galore that never quite break the narrative but add a good deal of clever humor and even some laugh out loud moments without straying into the just plain goofy territory that pulls you from the narrative this isn t the prettiest game i ve played for its time but still looks great and i think it s balanced very well with the playstyle offering vivid immersive appealing scenery that isn t too confusing to navigate the audio design is amazing sound effects are fine but the soundtrack is superb i generally dislike the sort of generic dnd folksy tavern style music that this soundtrack mostly fits into but for whatever reason these songs just click with me and never blend together like much of that kind of music usually does to me if i hear a song from this game i ll recognize it immediately some tracks are better than others but overall they all work quite well the vast majority of the massive script is also competently voiced which is incredible i found the story pretty strong there is a main quest full of twists and turns personal to your character that you must progress to move on with the game there are a number of side quests as well a staple of rpgs that can be really hit or miss while not quite as good as some of the best side quests like witcher 3 i think the side quests are generally very good os2 dodges dull fetch quests and please kill the rats in my cellar quests even the simplest quests often are made more interesting in some way such as an early quest in which you have to fight a trio of saltwater crocodiles who have swallowed a pair of teleportation gloves that will be super useful once you get them the quests are almost always engaging in some way given the strong writing of npcs and the worldbuilding features that makes these quests entertaining in their own right even aside from the consequent exploration and challenge none of the quests did i feel like was just some random i was doing solely to get experience there are 6 pre made characters to choose from i ll call these canon pcs each canon pc has a continuing personal quest such as lohse s quest to rid herself of demonic possession or sebille s quest for revenge these quests are a great way to flesh out the main characters even if they re not super long and only come up intermittently through several playthroughs i played through the story quests of every canon pc while my favorites are lohse fane and sebille none of the personal stories fell flat and i can t imagine playing through the game with one of them in your party without doing their personal quests beware if you make a custom character you don t get a personal story the gameplay is great this is almost definitely my favorite combat system for a pure turn based rpg the combat is in a lot of ways closer to turn based strategy than purely rpg but this fits the ttrpg style with line of sight distance range positioning area of effect enemy weaknesses and build diversity all being important to your success in a given battle there s a wealth of options for each of your four party members to invest in and combine even after three playthroughs there are still styles and skill combinations i m interested in trying out some time this game can be played in a group or solo in a solo game you get one main character and fill your party with up to three of the other canon pcs as a group each of you has plays their own main character filling any other slots with side characters it was really fun experiencing commentating and poking fun at the story s events as a group of three i enjoyed my group game a bit more on balance but that will depend on your group if you have a hard time following the story when communicating with your group it may not be as enjoyable but we mostly were able to follow it despite talking the whole time on voice chat the gameplay is solid but you re really missing out if you can t pay attention to the narrative this game has to offer so i d prioritize that i found solo play easier as it gives you more control over party synergy and coordination and i was better able to engage with the story and learn the basics of gameplay and strategy the other major difference is in a group you have to make sure to listen in on conversations with npcs or you simply miss story so you have to coordinate ultimately this game rocks on the whole i loved it and would have to look for things to complain about the majority of them very minor
