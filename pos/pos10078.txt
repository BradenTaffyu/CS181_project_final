2019 i only recently bought this game after a friend recommended it to me after playing it for the time that i have i can definitely see the appeal to this game the amount of content that is provided through the modding community is what has kept this game alive and moving forward and that is a good thing but i do feel that if you was to play this game with no mods whatsoever it will very much feel like somethings are missing from the game some small and some every quite big things i do not like the term it will be fixed with mods because like myself and other modders who work to create these kinds of things we are starting to be relied upon to fix or add common sense things to a game that should have been in the game in the first place and it s not our job to do this with every game we don t get paid for this and it is starting to become the norm and far too often companies are starting to rely upon this something bethesda does with their games far too often having said that if and when you do start to play this game with mods turned on you won t be able to put the game down it will suck you up like ants into a vacuum cleaner their is so much content for you to play with and to be able to create your own story your own immersive campaign you will be thoroughly surprised with the amount of freedom and how much of a good time you will get out of a simple 2d game just for a mental note if you feel that you are starting to get burnt out with the game do something a little different in the game try a harder difficulty try not playing with mods that make the game easier try going for a full random colony build a colony let your people die and start with a wrecked colony the options are endless you will be able to get hundreds of hours out of this game with mods even more my only really gripe was the price point of 30 when i bought it that s 38 and for a 2d game where i do feel though that price is artificially inflated because of the mods because it is them that allows you to get these thousands of hours out of this game and really does make this game what it is all in all a great game to play and a must have to own however if you do not want to pay full price wait for a sale but apart from that you won t be disappointed
