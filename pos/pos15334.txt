2021 product received for free tldr tons of fun with friends or alone lots of options well polished regularly updated great price so i did receive this for free but i should explain the context of that a friend gifted this to me recently for two reasons the first was that i was constantly having technical issues with fallout 4 constant and regular save corruption crashes clipping sticking issues and other bugs that ultimately made the game unplayable and he felt bad for me the other reason was that he plays himself and wanted to get more friends in i am glad he did after my experience with fallout bethesda don t starve together reminded me that video games can actually just be fun and in fact that is their purpose this is a well polished game no surprise since the devs continue to actively work on it while games with microtransactions and lots of buy able dlc generally turn me off none of the buy ables are needed to win and i believe they are all just cosmetic not only that but you re not spammed with solicitations while you re playing on top of that you can even buy these things with an in game currency you basically naturally accumulate over time i only even know there are buy ables because my friend told me about it you can honestly just ignore it and enjoy the game as for the game itself there are so many great parts it isn t just a mindless point and click you need to think strategize prioritize and really learn your character they all play a little differently the characters themselves are great they are not only different in terms of gameplay but also personality which the devs evoke both in game with their observational quotes and out of game with animated shorts for each characters created by the devs all the characters are each voiced with a particular musical instrument ala peter and the wolf it s clever endearing and they match instruments to character s personalities really well there are a lot of mod options and tons of support if you want to make mods of your own the experience is diverse whether you play with friends or alone whether your world is a massive pangea or tiny island or a variety of options in between depending on the character you play depending on your game mode depending on if you re a casual versus hardcore played depending on what mods you use and so on i should drum up some actual downsides of the game the best i could come up with was that while it is brilliant how they used musical instruments to voice characters some of the voices can be a little grating lucy the axe carried by woodie is voiced by a singing saw but it sounds more like a garden rake scraping across a chalkboard than what a singing saw actually sounds like when played a similar thing happens with wortox an imp that can blink through space he is voiced by a violin but it sounds more like a violin being played by someone who mistakenly thinks the violin is a percussion instrument these are minor gripes though and don t detract from the fun most of the characters sound great and it would actually be relatively easy to mod the voices with better sound samples were one so inclined all in all i totally recommend this game even though it was gifted i think it s worth the price if some dlc comes out that is the quality of what i ve seen so far i d drop the money on it a mere 15 would have been worth the fun i ve had so far and i m sure i ll get a ton more play and a ton more fun out of this game
