2019 as a newcomer to the civ franchise i would recommend this game yes i am aware of the much discussed downsides in this review section graphics which i find easy on the eye and smooth dlc policy i bought the game on sale so yeah maybe not a full price recommendation and ai problems which are a minus but in no way are detrimental to the game experience civ offers depths decisions diversity in a way that keeps you engaged love it so far
