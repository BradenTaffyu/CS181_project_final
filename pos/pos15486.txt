2022 as an automotive technician in training i think this game so far is fantastic it really does a good job giving the player a glimpse into my trade without all the potential hazards of real life although it does make my job look easy i look forward to future updates and dlc i have a few recommendations for future updates 1 more complex repairs and parts i wish things were a little more complex there are many aspects that aren t in the game that i feel should be for example there are many connectors wires hoses etc that aren t shown in the game and i think they should 2 transmission repair so far i feel this aspect of the game is sort of over looked and has serious potential i believe in depth transmission repair would go well like repairing valve bodies clutch packs torque converters and various gears nothing is more satisfying than tearing down a transmission with this being said i feel they should focus on both the automatic and manual transmissions and making them there own respective entities not every car has a clutch and fly wheel 3 air conditioning and heating this would be a great addition to the game as it would introduce new tools and shop equipment to the game in order to repair and recharge the mvac system of a car with various refrigerants 4 more in depth electrical repairs electrical repairs in the game are nice but could be so much more realistic there is a whole lot more that goes into electrical work than just pulling fuses relays and batteries 5 interior repairs and dashboard removal this one ties in with a few of my previous recommendations interior repairs such as the srs systems and seat belts would be a nice touch removing the dashboard is essential for many different jobs such as heating and air condition repair steering and suspension work steering column and gps entertainment systems repair other than these recommendations and the obvious having more licensed car manufacturers i have to say this game is near flawless and i highly recommend if you like cars and simulator games
