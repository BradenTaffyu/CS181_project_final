2017 early access review ya know i love the idea of combining roguelike with platformer but hardly any games ever manage to do this well provided they do it at all i also love the idea of combining those two with metroidvania dead cells pulls off that first bit wonderfully but as for the metroid part ehhh but we ll get to that later as it s actually not really the focus here the thing that is going to take center stage here is the game s fantastic combat system it is one of the very very few games that truly reminds me of symphony of the night not because of graphics or anything like that but just because of the feel of it and the way combat sort of flows together along with your movements the controls are basically perfect allowing for very accurate movements as you do assorted complicated maneuvers to take down your foes you have many ways of attacking them you can carry two weapons some of these having a hard time fitting the traditional meaning of that word and two skills your weapons can be used whenever the heck you want and finding the ideal combination of them is important to maximize your effectiveness skills however are a bit more limited in that they have a cooldown after being used weapons tend to be very direct things like swords or bows or throwing knives while skills tend to be alot more unique such as a sentry turret that sits where you place it and fires at foes or a frost grenade that produces a powerful freezing aoe effect finding the best combinations of weapons skills whatever is very important but much more important is the mastery of these things dead cells is very much a skill based game usually and practicing it s mechanics is the path to victory rather than just accumulating crazy stats and power each weapon and skill behaves differently from the last and using them in tandem properly isnt easy to do there is a ton of variety in the different things you can find there are a ton of different item types for the most part they re balanced well enough but i do have issues with some of them shields for instance i honestly just dont see the point of these to me the awkward timing of the blocking maneuver and the limited utility it offers just pales in comparison to the smooth and intuitive dodge roll that you have access to at all times the shields end up seeming out of place and any time i use one i always think but i could just be dodging this stuff and holding a second weapon instead of this shield to a degree i have the same issue with bows generally these are very slow to fire often slow enough that all you are doing is putting yourself at risk for something that s honestly not all that great particularly when compared to the many better ranged options available to you still for the most part items are balanced well enough they re not created equal though any given item will have some randomization to it in the form of secondary effects that they will produce when used you might have a sword that also throws small darts forward when swung or a grenade that causes the defeated monster to release a big cluster of biters crazed things that will then chomp at nearby enemies these traits can make a huge difference so it s always worth taking them into consideration this mechanic just adds that much more variety to the game as a whole of course this game is often described with metroidvania being somewhere so there s more to it than just weapons and skills right the term brings forth memories of finding new powers and using them to cross into gated areas that you just couldnt get to before something lke a high jump item that allows you to handle a jump you couldnt do before or something like metroid s bombs that allowed you to break destructible blocks dead cells though honestly just doesnt really do this very much there are exactly two abilities that deal with gated areas and both of them are glorified keys at best only able to be used in extremely specific spots and all they do is things like causing a ladder to spawn there or teleporting you to specific nearby rooms these just arent very interesting not only that though but the game world is not one big continuous thing instead it s a fairly linear experience where you are going from one level to the next like in many such games and the unlocking of these things is permanent persisting from one run to the next so the gated aspects dont even matter anymore once you ve gotten these things exactly once traversing the game s complicated levels isnt really about the metroidvania aspects but is instead about dealing with all of the many threats that will come your way enemies are extremely numerous and have all sorts of abilities to make your existence miserable and traps such as spikes will get in your way as well as i d said the combat in this game is fantastic and that s good because it s what you ll spend the majority of your time doing you have to be careful though the game is a difficult one and you can be shredded to bits pretty fast if your foes get the best of you however i found that the difficulty in this game is a bit deceptive the game gives the illusion at first of being super hard but once you get the hang of it it ends up not being hard enough something like that first boss can seem insurmountable when you initially meet him but you soon find out that he s actually a bit of a pushover even the game s toughest areas can often seem this way all in all while it does have a few flaws dead cells has turned out to be a pretty good game so far it may not do the whole metroidvania bit all that well but it sure gets everything else right for the most part you ll have a good time with this one
