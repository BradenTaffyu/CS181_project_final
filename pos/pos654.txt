2022 you should buy this because it s worth every penny i was never the type to like resource management or non intense pvp games until i played stardew it s easy to write off as a minecraft terraria type game but once you play it you realize the genius behind stardew it has elements of roleplay it allows you to be creative in a challenging way and you have different events to look forward to year after year yes after awhile it can get repetitive but that s where the mods come in stardew is incredibly easy to use mods on even if you get bored of playing vanilla stardew you can explore other aspects of vanilla like the other farms some challenges adjust the money margin etc there s so much to do in this game and always not enough time and i think that even if you stop playing this for years it s not difficult to imagine you d play it again it s one of the few games you d rarely regret purchasing as it s been around 2 3 years now since i ve had it stopped playing it for around a year and came back to it with joy and vigor
