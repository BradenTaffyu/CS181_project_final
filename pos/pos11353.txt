2017 early access review ambitious and addictive but terrifying for all the wrong reasons i m a big fan of zombie games crafting open world survival 7 days to die was a dangerous combination in that regard the developers took the creative aspect of minecraft and tried to make it grown up in a pseudo realistic zombie setting they pulled it off in a refreshing but incredibly sloppy way before i go further i ll point out that i have about 100 hours in this game as of writing and i ll probably play it still so obviously i enjoyed a lot of it the open world aspect combined with leveled items customization and minibikes is extremely addictive after you get past the steep learning curve but before you get fatigued by the bugs anyway if you like those things you ll like the game you already knew that let s talk about all the things that are wrong with this game developers please get out your notepads now athletics and combatthis isn t a huge complaint but a lot of the combat and movement feels stilted and artificial like the game really is just minecraft bugging out under a facade of extra polygons it d be greatly improved by minor parkour elements a way to climb some obstacles and fences would be great the hot mess of unoptimizationmy laptop isn t top of the line but it s pretty new and is capable of running games like portal starcraft ii and skyrim without major lag and stutter on the very very lowest settings where trees disappear and reappear at an arms length away and hills turn into instant mashed potatoes from about ten feet away i get about 20 fps and noticeable lag when turning or moving i have low expectations for graphics but 7dtd is absurdly bad vehiclesthe only vehicle in the game is a miniature motorbike that s cool and all but a normal bicycle would be vastly superior in a zombie apocalypse would it be too easy and effective too difficult to implement i don t know why it hasn t been done drivable cars would also be nice but i m not holding my breath bike the worst audio of any video game i ve ever playedharsh sure but true i can forgive the annoying immersion breaking spooky noises that happen at night and during certain biomes what i can t forgive is the awful horrible terrible no good balance when the zombies make noise the voices themselves are okay enough the volume is ridiculous a gunshot should crack through the night echo off the sides of buildings and leave a ringing in the ears whereas a telltale breathy moan gives away the zombie shuffling slowly behind you instead we have gunshots that sound like a call of duty soundboard on downers and zombies whose horrifically loud grunts should come with the warning zombies aren t anywhere near as close as they appear or maybe they are you can t tell because they all sound the same and they re all way too loud okay that may sound like a bit too much whinging but it really grinds my gears directionality is poor and abysmal when the zombies are actually close to you worse still there s no recognition of obstacles at all a zombie inside a wooden store should sound quite muffled compared to a zombie outside of it no difference but it gets much more ridiculous even in a concrete bunker with 30 feet of dirt over your head if a zombie walks by aboveground you ll be startled out of your beauty sleep by another canned moan that sounds like it s right in your f ing face misczombies glitch through doors ladders and sometimes walls lumberjack and biker zombies are just obnoxiously tanky and a chore to fight the former is not okay because they re the only zombies in the winter biomes also f k zombie dogs and vultures i hate those glitchy monstrosities with a passion but that s arguably just a personal problem endoverall i still have to respect this game for being so ambitious and coming together as a cohesive whole patchwork though it may be it s given me hours of entertainment but it s still severely suffering from some major issues that remain unresolved the devs recently released a large overhaul update with all sorts of new places and things this was nice some code optimization and audio fixes however would have been a much better use of time
