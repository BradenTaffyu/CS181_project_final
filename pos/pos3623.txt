2023 before i actually played omori myself i heard positive words about it but at the time i didn t really want to try it out due to my laziness until recently to be honest when i was buying this game i thought i d just try it out for an hour or two and then not proceed further how foolish i was back then on my very first game session i was stuck in the game for 4 hours straight and liked it totally not expecting that the point of no return for me though had become the junkyard area with the track playing in this location and that s when i literally fell in love with the game i managed to finish omori within 40 hours for the first time while most people finish it within around 20 hours but it was all about taking my time and sticking nose in every corner i notice interact with everything that s interactable and immerse into the story actually everything about this piece of art is brilliant making it hard for me to talk about anything specific because all of the aspects of omori are intertwined and each of them plays a significant role gameplay characters story visuals and of course music with caps yes all combined i somehow felt nostalgic for something i never really had i felt familiar with locations as if i was actually there spending my summer vacations and characters felt like they re my friends or siblings this is pure magic this game is one of the prime examples of why story based games are valuable for players and for the game industry overall they are unlike online session or grinding kind of games in which you can spend hundreds or thousands of hours it s not necessarily a bad thing to spend that much time for a game but something story based which might not even take 50 hours to finish can end up being much more memorable and make you feel alive refreshing from routine carry you through a roller coaster of emotions ending with a thought what a blast it has been in case of omori you ll additionally have so much to think about afterwards look up at discussion forums come up with certain ideas and most likely tear up or cry fun fact no piece of media has ever drained so many tears from me even though i wasn t ugly crying haha a couple of important parts about the game it does contain psyschological horror elements it covers quite sensitive topics and it demonstrates some things which might be hard to take for certain players be advised about it and if you decided to play this game or started playing it and you re determined to finish it try to avoid spoilers it is important this is the first time i m writing an actual review for a game i really don t have expreience in writing those p but i got this inspiration to deliver my feelings and some points about omori as it felt important to me maybe i really needed to get through such expreience for a long time and i hadn t even known about it until recently for anyone who reads this thank you for your time
