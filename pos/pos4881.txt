2023 product received for free merry christmas to everyone my friend z00t bought me this game last year before he passed away dec 26 2022 i am filled with emotions as i am writing this review as it was one of the last few things he would do before departing earth the game itself is definitely worth the price when on sale i was a bit disappointed with the graphics as they really need to improve the graphics for example deus ex mankind divided had awesome graphics for a game that came outthe game play makes up for it though i would say 8 10
