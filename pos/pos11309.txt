2014 early access review 7 days to die october 17 77 hours played will continue playing today at 17 00its really hard and scary in the beginning all those growls whispers in the wind and many other sounds that you hear the whole time but you somehow get used to it and start to ignore them as the days go by started alone in navezgane on medium level was like a real hell died 7 times a day i was really thinking about quitting this game then started to play with a mate you gotta learn from your mistakes and find ways to overcome obstacles thats probably the best part of the game switched to harder level in about 7 real life days and after another 7 days we realized we need even more challenge dieing once in 7 days is no fun at all while sitting on tons of supplies now playing on random generated map 70 zombies and all furious and running the whole time hordes unlimited 0 setting thats when you get the real taste of it just like a first day in game you can only survive for more than 3 hours on hills or in desert thats where they cannot catch you if you use the setting that they are always running we managed to build a little tower on 3rd day and it was almost destroyed the same night no food except cactus and blueberries few bottles for tea have not found any metal tool yet scared to think about visiting a town or green zone man only now i come close to understand what zombie survival genre actually means
