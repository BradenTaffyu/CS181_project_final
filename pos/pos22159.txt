2020 overview dark souls 3 is the third entry in the brutally challenging dark fantasy series created by from software it is a third person action roleplaying game with a focus on intense fast paced combat the game offers many hours of content and fun amazing boss battles which really are the highlight of this game finally beating a boss after the 20th or so time gives you a level of satisfaction unrivalled by most games out there on top of that is some truly amazing level design and a gorgeous soundtrack the graphics are good for its age and some locations in the game look stunning thanks to great art direction it will also offer you a generous amount of replayability and you will discover new things even after several times beating it highlights phenomenal boss battles unrivaled by other games third person melee combat soundtrack level design that requires you to think zero handholding very fun with a group of friends cool magic brutally challenging difficulty downsides multiplayer is laggy sometimes unsatisfactory pc port lack of proper mouse and keyboard controls online co op is needlessly confusing questionable placement of two certain bonfires gameplay this has to be one of the hardest and most challenging games i ve ever played the gameplay consists of walking around decrepit environments riddled with tough enemies secret pathways and hidden items the level design is truly amazing feels quite interconnected with many shortcuts and you actually have to use your brain except for one instance where there are two bonfires right next to each other for no reason that combat in this game is amazing with a huge amount of enemy and weapon variety and it is very fast paced with a large variety of playstyles are you someone who plays as a tank with a massive sword or a wizard who shoots spells you can play as both leading to lots of replayability and messing around with weapons to find the one you like the best part about this game is the boss battles which are so good you will find all non soulsbornekiro game s boss fights lacking in comparison to this game there is also online co op and pvp to play with friends however figuring out how the co op works is very confusing until you get used to it i ve rarely bothered with pvp but it s usually laggy and frustrating visuals the graphics are good for their age of the game and some areas look outstanding it is also a very good game to see in motion thanks to the fluid enemy animations in combat however every single one of the default characters in the character creator screen look like they re constipated and have brain damage npc s mouths don t even move when they speak except for one and the game always looks like it has a light grey tinge to everything audio the sound design is good but reused sounds from previous dark souls games the voice acting is consistently good and there s not a single bad performance the soundtrack is incredible and sounds great you will be listening to the soundtrack on youtube long after you re finished with the game and gotten bored functionality unfortunately the pc port of this game is rather meh no 21 9 support and it s locked at 60fps as someone who uses an ultrawide 100hz monitor i am rather disappointed and it is my main flaw with this game however the gameplay is good enough for this to only seem as a minor issue in the overall experience also when you use a keyboard and mouse there are only xbox controller inputs for the ui making it almost impossible to play for people who don t own a controller conclusion i m not a fan of rpgs but this is an exception it s made me want to play and finish the other two dark souls games bloodborne and sekiro as it s just that good everyone should give this game a try even if they think they re not going to enjoy it follow our curator page ocg curations if you like and want to see more reviews like this one
