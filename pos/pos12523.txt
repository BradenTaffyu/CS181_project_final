a grand refinement that is limitless introduction1 where to really begin on how amazing and intuitive this game is to not only me but to many unique individuals within the whole gaming community revolving the source engine as a pre teen during my time with access tothe world wide web as with finding the team based first person shooter team fortress 2 2 i also found this game in particular after some time i felt destined to play this video game but alas it wasn t freeand i didn t any source of my own income to purchase garry s mod yet alone a operating system of my own this is segment above is cruel to this review because of how fixated i became to these games and the wholesphere surrounding the written and un written of rules and surveys that have built up as i was grown up to be a teenager wordy daze ahead3 my very first exposures of garry s mod were indeed yes goofy ahah ragdoll animations and the absurd humor contextualized by many animators on youtubebut also the complexity of the addon s that have been implemented the game engines compatibility to building very specific devices and or machines just within a sandbox game youtube video in memoriam kitty0706 views 307 429 colin wycoff kitty0706 era un ragazzo creatore di video machinima e non che esordiva sempre con un originalissimo stile comico ispirato molto probabilmente ai cartoni degli anni 80 90 originally posted by author r i p kitty0706 4 the many interactive multiplayer gamemodes that came along from the community prop hunt trouble in terrorist town jailbreak roleplay slender deathmatch and open community sandbox yet there are so many more gamemodes that deserved to be mentioned up till this very day it still has many things to offer given with my experience with the concepts of art 5 objectively garry s mod has a lot of replayability because it is up to us as human beings to set limits to take breaks on video games from being repetitiveand may becoming boring within our minds it is not a simple case of thinking outside the box it is more of a case of what your true intentions to this immersive video game 6 later in this review the upcoming refrains would be more subjective once i finally got my hands on garry s mod i became a young adult getting into the game s mechanics was a pretty breeze from already a decent playtime on team fortress 2 simplistic yet soothing7 as i started embark on what i really want to do all i wanted to do is immerse myself into cratingspecific liminal creations with my favorite characters build places as if there were my own in reality to crate art and make canvassing screenshots to express myself mostly although i wouldn t play more then one session a day a maximum of sixteen hour sessionsat best for up till this day i use a low end laptop for using all things video games internet usage etc 8 all this just in your standard gamemode sandbox singleplayerat first i just made things to impress others i am still such a fanatic on how much fun it can be while playingalone and sharing my screenshots and video clips with others is what still drives me to playand it isn t the only reason to come back to as previously mentioned addons like cinema wiremod and pac3 are concepts i d get into moreif i had a more efficient operating system 9 until then i am curtain that as long as garry s mod can be played offline even if the worst case scenario of all addons being removed due to not being online compatiblefor any odd reason steam may mention in the future it is not a assumption of it happening moreof a thought that those chances are never zero side letter10 the fact that you could add anything to this game of course taking account of copyright infringement i would love to learn how to make my own addons of any sort weapons models maps as stated before only time will tell if i can get myself towards that point intothree dimensional editing programming 11 personally i am no longer worried if this game bores a lot people nowadays especially since this game being a little over a decade old this is who i am and almost nine years later i would come back to it for any reasons mostly being for immersive escapism co operative multiplayer with friends or modding behind the scenes in conclusionif you got a wide range of imagination and a fixation for crating digital things intoa open world video game i would highly recommend it for it s wide range of choices a vast modern shooter of course this video game being based of halflife up till wacky and absurd addtions with in this game s engine if this review was too biased to that all i can say is yes it may not be of your interest dues to multiple reasons the community having it s own sub catagories spefic achievments not being able to be attained currently too child like for the induvidual overtime garry s mod a screenshot of garry s mod by all things do is end to those who have came along they inspired others to start there journey here and forthose still playing this day you are unique and you are the soul reasonwhy this game is still alive a screenshot of garry s mod by 7 2 10
