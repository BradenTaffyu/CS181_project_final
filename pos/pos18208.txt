there are a lot of people that get their panties in a twist over this game as far as i can tell the arguments range from idiotic to just ignorant of the game that came before this one what you need to know is that this is a modern remake of a game that s over a decade old that has a good following of dedicated fans and modders it s a 10 10 remake of an already great game and they ve done an amazing job keeping the spirt of the old game alive and improving on it once all the modders come over you will see some of the best star wars star trek mass effect and halo mods that anyone has ever put together into a game my god those mods kept me coming back to sins for over a decade i paid for the game on epic the devs gave me a key to allow me to play it on steam and that s available to anyone that purchased it on epic before june this year that s true love for your fans and supporters so people that want to hate and moan about everything will but this is only getting started lots more amazing content for this game on the horizon
