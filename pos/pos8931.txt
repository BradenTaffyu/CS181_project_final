2018 finally thanks to version 2 0 i managed to complete a playthrough of stellaris before this i started and dropped about a dozen playthroughs you might be surprised to hear version 2 0 as it is unusual for a title to be updated 2 years after initial launch even more unusual is for some of these updates to change the game significantly version 2 0 changed some of the core mechanics in a fundamental way some people are not happy with these changes and although i completely understand i see that this was done to be able to balance features going forward i have seen valid arguments that maybe they should have saved these changes for stellaris 2 but it is refreshing to see that this title is here for the long term the game itself is full of emergent gameplay there are many mechanics to this game and your empire selection means each playthrough interacts with each mechanic in different ways this assists in making playthroughs different some of the game settings allow you to customise your game quite a lot one of the most important settings being the speed at which various systems run i e research could be sped up for all factions some other settings allow players to add in extra challenge the difficulty is there especially as everyone is racing to get ahead in the case that you do not your empire could be reduced to ashes on the other hand it does suffer from the usual problem in strategy games where your empire has no challengers but to win you need to play another 10 hours or what have you many people comment on the dlc costs which in total are huge however i suggest the only mandatory add on is utopia it adds a lot to the base mechanics whereas much of the other dlc add content having utopia should tide you over for a couple of playthroughs this was released quite a while ago and during a sale along with the base game can be quite cheap looking forward there is still more expansions and free updates so there is plenty of life left in this title overall an interesting and enjoyable experience while playing listen to a long playlist of dynatron sit back and rise to the stars
