2014 early access review this is a great survival game that has a smoothly connected world the houses look realistic tunnels in the ground actually look like tunnels there s many things to craft books to teach you more crafting recipes there s hunger stamina thirst and health you can sprint you can cook food on fires if you have cooking pots or a grill there s a fair amount of fire arms and you can even craft the bullets for them you can construct quite a fottress barricade existing structures repair damage on structures upgrade parts of your structures to withstand more damage grow food hunt and the longer you stay in one area the stronger your scent gets in that area increasing the chance of an invasion occuring there s many types of zombies most look standard but there s a few special ones and more are going to be added not only can you eventually craft standard digging tools and cutting tools you can find an auger to dig faster and a chainsaw to cut tree s down swiftly multiplayer works fine too the player sync seems to be perfect even if ping is around 100 150 levels there are many clothing pieces you can find as you scavenge head chest hands legs feet and they have armor value against attacks you can even use hides from animals you ve hunted to make leather and then leather armor with the proper knowledge they recently added the random world generation which i ve been testing it is done quite well biomes seperated by rivers if you look enough you ll find roads and there s even generated structures to be found you can also mine a tunnel down anywhere to find yourself some metal ores to make whatever tools bullet casings or bullet tips you need and coal as well as nitrate to make gunpowder you can make torches there s a few ways and you can find flashlights there isn t anything that can t be destroyed by you or the zombies everything has a different durability depending on what it is made of the options for playing either on single player or multiplayer are fairy customizable you can increase drop rates of all items durability of all blocks amount of zombies that spawn how long days last and how large of percentage of each day is night time you can also decrease all of these options as well i d strongly recommend getting this game if you like a good survival or action game with an extensive crafting system
