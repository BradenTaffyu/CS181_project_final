2017 stardew valley is one of those games that sound incredibly boring but are super enjoyable you are a farmer and your job is to get your grandfather s old farm up to snuff to do that you need loads of money which means you ll have to do loads of farming you can try out different seeds build helpful tools cook meals explore the mines hang out with the villagers go fishing or help rebuild the community center like i said it doesn t sound very interesting but once you start playing you ll understand why so many people love this game note that schedules and time management are an integral part of the game you can only do so much during any given day and your character has a stamina bar that must never run out you will be punished for fainting or falling asleep outside it s a bit of a pain at first but once you know the terrain and develop a routine it becomes second nature highly recommended because there really isn t anything like it on pc
