2018 stardew valley is a farming simulator that sort of sums it up and sort of doesn t even scratch the surface the game has cute charming visuals relaxing music and nice sound design due to the pixel graphics some animations especially interactions with npcs can look a bit off but that s not a massive issue character customization is surprisingly extensive with a choice between male or female various hairstyles a bunch of shirts and sliders to adjust hair eye and pants colour after creating your character you start off on a run down farm that your dead grandfather left you you clean it up buy seeds plant crops all to make money to improve the farm aside from farming there s fishing mining and combat you can interact with the town npcs eventually get married and have kids which are entirely useless and stop aging after reaching the toddler stage so no free labour you have five different skills as well which improve when doing the related tasks basically it is a farming sim and you can just ignore everything around that but there s a lot more to do than i first expected the game had a co op mode added a while after release it works well enough and makes the game a lot more enjoyable here s the thing when i first played stardew valley i thought it was boring and didn t bother much until the co op came out after playing a bit with friends i went back to my single player farm and just couldn t stop for a long while it does what it does pretty well and it s very relaxing it s also quite satisfying the little sounds it makes when you water your crops or harvest them seeing your money go up every day watching your farm develop and your animals grow up it somehow manages to avoid being too boring even when you do mostly the same things every day there is still a sense of progression and you can choose between different albeit limited activities whenever you get tired of what you were doing before what s honestly still tedious more than anything is the relationship system whenever you give one of the townsfolk a gift you gain points because we all know the best friendships are a result of throwing mayonnaise at someone on a daily basis if you just talk to them every day you get a much smaller amount if you ignore them however you will lose points before advancing relationships talking to the npcs is pretty boring as they mostly say the same lines over and over now these townspeople don t just sit and wait for you they wander around in town and the surrounding areas which makes it more irritating to try and find them because either you memorize their schedules or look them up on the wiki every time if you don t use a mod that shows them on the map you ll probably get frustrated on the bright side interactions at higher friendship levels are well thought out and quite adorable in some cases even with non romance npcs there are a few mods that aren t cheating but make some aspects of the game a lot less tedious i suppose i recommend the game but you might want to stay away if you have an addictive personality or get annoyed when your friends dig up the entire farm for no reason
