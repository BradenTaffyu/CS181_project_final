2019 at first i thought that they would simply bring total war warhammer 2 engine and mechanics to tw history settings but i was wrong they improved not only the engine the graphics but all the strategy and tactical mechanics aswell this game is a huge improvement over total war warhammer 2 and total war saga thrones of britannia from the romance mechanics which add bit of crusader kings 2 to the rpg like inventories to the new recruitment systems or the heroes duel system and new research tree this total war is a gem it s not a flawless gem though there are still some minor glitches we re used to see from previous games and ai problems but with some more work this might be the best total war game in years
