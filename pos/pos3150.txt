2018 product received for free i have to write a positive review for this one i v been playing video games for as long as i remember and this is one of the best games i ve ever played right now i m playing my fourth run and i can picture myself playing a couple more before i stop i describe this game as a rpg strategy game you can explore craft talk to people like a regular rpg but the combat system is purely strategic there are 6 characters with unique stories and quests plus several other custom characters that doesn t have specific interactions the range of skills and builds you can manage is huge and there is so much to explore that if you like the genre you will have lots of playthroughts and several hours of fun 11 10
