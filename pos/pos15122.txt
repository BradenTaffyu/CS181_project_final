2023 before you buy the game was made to be played co op but there is usually a 1 2 second delay between your click and the actual movement unless you are the host so this can be a big bummer for some people there is a huge amount of info dumping that is required if you re trying to help someone new or are a new player trying to learn the game trying to find a random to play with is pretty annoying at times so try to make friends and host your own worlds later again game was made for co op you can still play it solo though but sometimes it gets frustrating and things feel out of your control gameplay a majority of the game is attacking a monster running away until it attacks then you attack it again a few times different patterns different monsters so the longer you play the better you improve yet at the same time there are a few annoying things if you aren t used to the ui you are fighting the ui a majority of the time in this game because it s all about inventory management equipping armor and replacing armor swapping items or trying to eat food and heal more running away other than that seems like the game feels more like a speedrunners wet dream the more you play the faster you get the sooner you can kill bosses and progress though that being said there s a huge divide between players that rush and players that are somewhat casual we got to set up the base kind of players and even dead weight people that are mentally overloaded and just freeze up at home and eat all of your food positives plenty of depth and things to keep you busy if you want more difficulty you can fight bosses if you want less crazy fighting get a bigger group or run around gathering resources farm crops at home negatives bad ping servers for real sometimes unplayable tilting if you get hit by a monster and die to lag game seems to have a balancing issue for characters but not really you could argue wolfgang is the best character in the game but some people want more difficulty so they play weaker characters on purpose you also get outfits and skins that do absolutely nothing because armor weapons hats cover them up anyways so there s kind of a conflict there
