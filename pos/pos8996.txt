2022 i ll start with the negatives like most paradox games there s a significant hurdle to actually learning the game and part of that is because the games are quite ridiculously complex when i first bought the game i tried it found it too difficult to know what i was doing and i just let it collect dust in my library for months the full tutorial of the game doesn t actually go far enough to explain all the hidden mechanics what to do and how to actually make something successful how to build a planet all the inner politics of a species and their traits etc is left for you to figure out on your own and you won t necessarily have the time to devote to learning the game and know what is successful however one of my friends said we should play it and we played a game where he taught me the basics of the game dealing with pop ups as we play naturally you make an awful lot of mistakes and like long rts games there s a snowball effect of how strong your empire is if you fall behind you are gone for good there s no coming back and i was miles behind others by mid game a small weak race so we started again the game that followed actually told was kind of an epic story told of our galaxy and how it was developing and i l loosely tell you the story of our galaxy the game didn t feel competitive except in the fact that you re both competing against the ai and your own mistakes it felts like playing an rpg rts something very unusual as most feel competitive we started out as the initial tech alliance my friend was basically an alien empire of space fish that made friends with many species and conquered the xenophobic aliens i had turned into technological focused tree empire that was pointlessly occupied with ferrying a gas species across my vast empire at the time my species had a terrible secret that nobody knew about we were purging all other alien species from our planets turns out my friends empire was an ally with the biggest enemy of all secretly i had probably killed billions of his migrating population across our borders by mid game we had a strong federation of 3 empires the tree murdering technological powerhouse my friends diplomatic powerhouse and an ai species known as big reach who just had lots of fleets between us we had 2 thirds of the galaxy and were looking to gain control over the final third in that third was our counter federation and big players who were flitting between joining our federation or joining the counter federation also some smaller empires that were using high defensive space stations etc highest fleet strength is about 40k now average being 10k but a series of choke points make big fleets difficult to use as wars end up panning out like a big cat and mouse game i was having some issues with my economy and with some neighbours and this is probably due to my secret race purges i had issues with the space un too but i had the fleet power to prevent any unwanted wars suddenly a late game crisis an alien species more powerful than both of us combined spawns in the game hell bent on destroying everything it just deletes big reach rip reach he has like 2 planets on the borders of my friends empire now my friends fleets aren t strong enough to deal with most of the enemy fleets whilst i ve got a lot of high level technologies and possibly the technology to counter i don t have the economy or the amount of fleets at this time i m in the process of developing my first carrier strike fleet worth about 60k in fighting power the unbidden as the crisis is known biggest fleet was 170k but they have lots of 60 90k fleets end up taking about a third of the game and it looks like it s going to be a difficult battle to survive the galaxy the other alien species are all struggling to win fights against them the unbidden have reached my friends and my empire in what i would consider safe territory through a black hole the attack force was just a recon force and we were able to push them out after some combined fleet action my strike fleet proving semi effective my friend has now taken his fleets and after i reinforced our federation fleet with new technologies that too to defend his borders with the unbidden knocking on the gates with 3 60 90k fleets meanwhile i m looking at a developing crisis as the bottom 3rd of the galaxy is turning unbidden and multiple fronts are soon to open up on my boarders with large fleet battles i realise i need to increase the ability of my fleet to move around the big empire and develop defences long enough to delay the enemy advance in time for me to destroy his fleets and then be able to counter attack successfully part of my empire is an issue as it had taken it from the ai recently there s a significant lack of infrastructure and defensive fleets area has a lot of pirates and is more or less the wild west of my empire it s turned into a very interesting game as our snowball effect of wining the galaxy has been completely side stepped by this new species it ll be interesting to know if our empires are strong enough to defend from this catastrophe one thing is for sure we re in for a long war and it s impossible to say if we will survive overall the game would get a recommend as it can lead to the story telling of your own species and it s quite polished there s few other games like that especially in rts i find them all feeling very competitive whereas this feels more of an rpg the downside is the mechanics aren t explained to you and its quite difficult to know what will be successful as the mechanics are often complex and unexplained here is an example complexity of the game when it comes to military fleet design start with building a ship design 1 3 categories of weapons missiles kinetic bullets energy lasers hidden stats are dps and actual damage and range with 6 different technology upgrades 2 3 categories of defence hull hp armour anti kinetic energy anti lasers 6 technological upgrades 3 tracking aim 4 evasiveness combat speed determined by size and assisted by thrusters also different sized weapons fit onto different ships altering range rate of fire and damage 6 drone abilities carriers hangars strike craft 7 point defence flak guns or missile interceptors 8 overall fleet speed detection range 9 utilities10 combat designated ai does the ship think itself as an artillery role or an interceptor role changes behaviour and how it prioritises enemy ships 11 special weapons all of this interlinks in the hidden statsso that s a lot of stats you re starting fleet should aim to be like 20 ships all small aircraft 1 size approx 1 2kk in strength will you use a combination or a hard focused fleet is questions you will have to ask an all missile fleet with defensive armour could be highly effective against the right enemy however a laser fleet that engages ships at mid range and relies on dps and evasiveness with integrated specialised ships focused on intercepting missiles would be a hard counter when it get to bigger fleets there s probably about 7 different sized ships all completely interchangeable it becomes very hard to know what is the optimum fleet design with how many point defence systems how many missiles how much armour what combination of small to large ships etc so it s very complex if you decide that example of complexity is too much for you then fair enough planet management etc is similar there is an automatic feature for the game to run your planets and auto build your ships but i don t think the ai builds them competitively for you to make your own decision on how your empire plays and if its useful if you choose to get it and have the time to devote to learning the game good luck look forward to hearing your own stories of your galactic empire
