2017 early access review don t listen to any stupid critisim people give this game for relatively minor flaws whilst also boasting 500 hours if any game can give you 500 hours while also retaining a 25 price while also consistently going on sale for much cheaper you ve got a hell of a deal at full price you re essentially paying 1 for 20 hours of entertainment it absolutely boggles my mind that people can still send in a negative review i ve played triple a games that have failed to keep my attention for more than thirty most of the negative reviews are also incredibly dumb complaining that you can cheese the ai well if you hate cheesing the ai then don t cheese the ai
