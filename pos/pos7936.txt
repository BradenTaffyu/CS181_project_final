2023 early access review let s start by saying this is a review made by a very critic invididual who doesn t like motorsport games but i find beamng drive to be a truly captivating game that seamlessly blends cutting edge simulation capabilities with thrilling racing experiences one of it s best features lies in its remarkable physics engine the game boasts an unrivaled level of realism when it comes to vehicle dynamics making every movement and interaction feel remarkably lifelike from the moment you take the wheel you ll be enthralled by the intricacies of how vehicles respond to different terrains forces and collisions the attention to detail is simply awe inspiring as the game simulates everything from suspension systems and tire grip to body deformation and intricate mechanical damage this unparalleled level of realism brings a sense of authenticity that technology enthusiasts like myself can truly appreciate futher than this it s not only a simulation heaven it excels as a racing game all the vehicle dynamics and physics make up for the ultimate racing sim it s lacking behind on graphics and multiplayer capabilities but it s nothing that just a couple of mods provided mostly by the brilliant in game repository and some work by the in game map editor doesn t fix just f11 and make the game look just like you want it to helped by mods like re shade you can achieve lifelike situations mixed with the semi official multiplayer mod which makes up for the loneliness you can experience in the game when you re not using ai you can play it in personal custom servers with your friends or join a random server with certain themes or styles truly pick and choose what suits you best truly the best of it s kind
