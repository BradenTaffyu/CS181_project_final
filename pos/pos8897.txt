2016 on my very first playthrough of stellaris i came accross a peculiar little planetoid called sol iii upon this planet there were ape like creatures that walked upright talked a funny speech and had a strange fascination for my space vessels of which they dedicated many generations creating structures to praise my people and fixate their obsessions upon they called us gods curious about them i had my people construct observatories around the craggy blue rock sending me data of their advancements through the ages i debated uplifting those who proved worthy to bare the name of my glorious galactic empire to the universal stage only months before my hardwork bore fruition i was struck by great grief as a miasmic hue of orange and red scorched the land of my favourite ball of star stuff those who called themselves humanity only moments away from reaching galactic sentience had annhilated all below in a pointless bout of mutually assured destruction leaving but ruins and hardy insects to adorn the planet 10 10 for extra realism bonus
