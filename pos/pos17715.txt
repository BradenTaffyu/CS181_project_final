2016 great game for warhammer fans some admittedly bad decisions regarding the policy on dlc wood elves dlc is a great addition although arguably should have been a double bill dlc with the beastmen and blood dlc crazy to pay for that really gameplay wise i ve only enjoyed it playing as empire and wood elves
