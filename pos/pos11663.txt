2017 early access review i was truthfully a little sceptical about the asking price for this game but this game is excellent i play co op with my brother on a private server and we play for hours on end pros it doesn t feel like early access the game feels largely complete but there could be improvements crafting and gathering is a very fun aspect and also important to survival death isn t just a number there s a lot to lose from dying which encourages safer play something that makes the game more realistic and more enjoyable zombies are a real threat at night time and seem to just sneak up on you there is very little vision you can obtain forches etc but i like that this encourages me to stay indoors and safe levelling up earns skill points to increase various things fun co operative playcons the ai seems a little sloppy the graphics and animations feel like early 2000 s while better animations and models would be nice the game is fine as is currently you can t craft everything you see in the game which is a little frustrating the game lacks any kind of tutorial so your first few hours will be largely confusing this can be offset by just reading a steam guidei know there appear to be as many cons as there are pros but the cons are all negligible even for the asking price of 25 this game is truly worth it if you re into zombie survival games
