2015 as an engineer who was quite into astronomy as a kid i love this game and it probably couldn t have been any other way i mean it is about actual space travel how awesome is that i ll recommend it but there is one thing i can not stress enough it is not for everybody there are basically two ways to play that game either you build crazy rockets in sandbox mode and you see if your random construction somehow achieves orbit or you actually try to become a good in game rocket scientist and launch a planned payload to a specific destination in the solar system and to become such a rocket scientist you will either need college level math and physics as well as a huge excel spreadsheetto read and follow tutorials and have a huge patience with trial and errorand that s not exactly the conception of fun or a game to many people just to give an idea of why you need the school stuff this game expects you to know what newtons are and no those are not clones of a guy who took an apple on the head xd it expects you to count speeds in m s rather than km h just as a scientist does you must also understand the concept of relative vector speed in a 3d environment and many other things the game features tutorials fortunately but they only give the basics and you ll still have to learn most of the game by yourself and even though the game simplifies a few aspects from reality like for instance oxygen and astronaut s mental state management on what it actually simulates it is ruthless no fuel left after a 3 hour mission for you in the game years have passed you miss your entry into the gravity field of a planet you didn t launch your interplanetary mission on a correct date well enjoy your newborn space debris no way out of that except loading a past save and this feature is not available on the hardest difficulty by the way you might say if you run out of fuel it s because you messed up and you re bad so it s normal to be punished true but this is why you pretty much need the math and the scientific expertise to actually calculate if you have enough fuel before the mission while taking into account a margin of error as well because your manual piloting manoeuvers will never be perfect if you re fine with it following a tutorial will allow you to build the spaceship suited to your mission and not worry about that but i also believe it is kinda missing the point of the game however this scientific grounding and this high difficulty also come with a good side which is when your plan unfolds as planned and you actually succeed my god is it satisfying i usually don t take screenshots of my games but here when i actually managed my first moon landing i just took so many because for once a game had made me feel proud yes proud and i have to say it s the first time it has happened at least to such a degree the kerbal space programl wiki is very well made can help a lot by providing you with already simplified mathematic formulas preventing you from having to demonstrate those yourself it could help people less familiar with math and physics to achieve more with the game and actually feel proud as well the game also features lots of mods and some are actually all about helping you to do all this calculus it can replace the custom spreadsheet for those who do not wish to make one if you don t look at any wiki and don t use any mods then the challenge is phenomenal even for an actual scientist as the game throws you out there with minimal data you might actually like a science and math challenge if you think you do then buy this game you won t regret it if science math and ruthless difficulty are not truly your thing there is the option of playing this game as a lego game where you build crazy stuff and see if they work you could actually learn a lot about science and astronomy while you do that so it might be worth it i know i wouldn t enjoy playing randomly like that and i can t recommend it but who knows maybe you don t mind just be aware of one thing unless you do some science and math or have it done for you but is that the point you ll never land that miniature base on the distant moon of the planet jool but hey maybe you are actually totally fine with that
