2015 early access review disclaimer i got a steam key from a developer but these opinions are my own this is a classic rogue like in mechanics but innovative in design it s tough unforgiving but there s a lot of depth that will keep you coming back for more and don t let the early access banner fool you this game has been in development for a long time and is totally playable with tens of hours of gameplay thanks to the in depth character building systems and epic quest arc the time played on steam for me pales to the amount of time i ve spent playing the old ascii graphics version from years ago you have the choice of playing a mutant or a true man true men have a better time early on but mutant play is where the game really shines there are a load of different mutations that can completely change how you approach the game want to fly over your enemies setting them on fire want to spawn multiple copies of yourself and shoot the crap out of something with mind lasers want to play a characterr with four arms and legs each arm wielding a different weapon want to play a human beetle with horns and a carapace you can do all this and more the world is rich and interesting too you have an open world that you re free to explore as you wish if you can survive and there are distinct cultures and lore attached to the different places you ll travel to the lore is so unique the world being set in a post apocalyptic age with the remnants of so many societies all layered on top of each other it s a far cry from the generic mediaeval fantasy setting you usually get with rogue likes if you ve never played a traditional rogue like the game might seem daunting at first i know i butted my head against it for quite a wehile before i managed to get anywhere but if you keep at it you ll find yourself rewarded with a very unique gaming experience
