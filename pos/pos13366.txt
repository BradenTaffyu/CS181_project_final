2015 this game is awesome seriously it s really really awesome and it teaches you physics so you pass your exams win win i feel like listing the pros and cons because that s what everyone else does and it gives you a better idea of the game pros physics explosive stuff explodes stuff that looks like a plane flies mostly spaceships fly like spaceships stuff that looks like a rover will flip over visuals the graphics are not as good as some games but they are definitely good enough i particularly like all the small details like the way the rapier engine puffs before going out or the cockpit details or the little ridges on the engines or the way the landing gear closes up career mode feels like you re really running a space agency and you really feel worried when you crash a rocket into a building and don t have enough money to rebuild it sandbox mode it s also nice to be able to say stuff it i can t afford this nor can i wait long enough to invent really powerful rocket engines give me everything for free the way spacecraft just feel like they work the difference between the different engine sizes the weight distribution problems the new aerodynamics model everything theoretically works my spaceships don t actually work they explode the difficulty this game is hard very hard but only if you make it so if you stick to low altitude flights and don t try to go to jool straight away this game is very possible to play and slowly very slowly you ll get better and be able to get to jool small green beings kerbals themselves are very cute i want one anyone know where to buy a kerbal plushy mods when 1 0 was released i deleted all my mods and started afresh so i don t know if they still work but in beta i was greatly enhancing my experience with mods like bdarmoury b9 aerospace kw rocketry chatterer a completely useless but nonetheless fantastic mod and infernal robotics performance this game doesn t need a supercomputer to run i can run it fine on a six year old macbook pro no problems i do have the occasional lagspike when a lot is happening at once and the framerate tops out at around 35 fps on a good day but it certainly ain t unplayable cons difficulty yeah i know that was a pro as well but as i said earlier some things are very hard like getting to jool lack of an autopilot the game could do with someone who could fly because for a long time you won t be that someone the load times this game has a lot to load in and it takes a long time lack of stuff this game has a lot of stuff but could do with more problems with adding stuff to wings elevons landing gear and engines are really hard to fix on properly lack of smaller pre built wings so in conclusion this game awesome really really awesome totally fantastic i love it thanks for reading edit i need to update a review of a game i nominated for the steam awards to get the badge so i will say this i have nominated this game for the i thought this game was cool before it won an award award
