2017 so total war warhammer dream come true not quite the epic level fantasy version of this game that have existed in my head since i was aware that total war and warhammer were both a thing will never not be fantasy oh well it would likely be crap anyway this comes very close though and without any blinding bias because warhammer fan i can say this is the best total war game to this date even with it s down sides the essence and feel of warhammer is fully realized here for good and ill the good about the game is it s solid game play and mechanics a true to lore warhammer fantasy skin over it the game is true to established canon and reflects this in game play graphics character interactions and so on if you are a warhammer fan you will find much here that amuses and entertains you for instance different factions work very differently and in ways completely true to their lore and established views of the world there are settlement based factions and a few horde based ones these play very differently and make for unique game play experiences various events happen in the world and to factions for good and ill different factions have different goals and ways to achieve them this makes for the most unique game play selection in any total war game to date every previous game focused on different eras of real world history making for variations on the same difference between rome and sparta flavor game mechanics are effectively identical difference between the dwarves and the beastmen everything dwarves are a slow but steady faction of grudge bearing cavalry lacking settlement based people who live in mountain holds and have restrictions on what they can and can t directly settle they are quality over quantity with troops on the expensive side but can pay for them with funds they generate from their various buildings beastmen are a swift but mostly expendable horde force with unprecedented mobility who don t settle down anywhere they never build anything and are required to raid and pillage to fund everything their various armies are their settlements and they can only upgrade these in the encampment stance beastmen camps are hidden from view helping you run and hide other faction s camping stances are visible beastmen have an easier time ambushing enemy armies because their ambush stance is mobile losing a whole army equals losing all settlement upgrades in it losing all armies equals defeat agents makes a return in the form of champions the spin on these is that in an effort to reflect the epic effects of powerful characters in warhammer these are not just spies assassins etc they are fully able combatants spell casters even on the tactical map able to assist you with actions on the strategic level for instance a warrior priest of sigmar can aid the empire either on the strategic map by inspiring the populace of your provinces or in battles as a one man regiment as a powerful and inspirational warrior that crushes the skulls of the undead beastmen and chaos heretics alike with a sigmar blessed warhammer aiding your state troopers in holding the line against humanity s many ancient enemies if your champion dies in the battle he s either wounded or dead for good alternatively he fails an assassination attempt on the strategic map against that annoying chaos champion spreading corruption and disorder through your lands and get s a hero s funeral champions are very powerful but costly assets that can truly turn the tide of battles or wars sadly the game is not without it s flaws the bad about this game are two things that has everything to do with game mechanivs and developer decisions first of all the dlc whoring returns as in rome ii and a lesser extent shogun ii assets in the game are locked behind pay walls want to play beastmen or wood elves freakin chaos warriors want blood effects in a warhammer fantasy game pay up the redeeming thing about this is that many of the recent dlc s are freelc s with many characters and even factions being released for free this is a massive step in the right direction and i hope it s a trend to increase the value and thus appeal of tw games in future secondly the difficulty anomaly that was present in rome ii returns easy and normal difficulty is too easy unless you are inept or have personal issues with rts games you will be dominant in relatively little time and as such the game is very likely a boring experience inside of 50 turns hard difficulty and up are effectively required to be properly challenged but from hard difficulty and up the absurdity of the game s balancing system comes into full swing the ai has infinite money this leads to their champions always doing things that cost money effectively power leveling them whenever able to become very potent dangers very fast your own champion actions against the enemy will usually cost you money money you don t always have making decisions about what to do something to brood about when the economy is tight the ai can always make armies they recruit faster than you can hope to do and in larger bulk even from provinces that don t have the buildings for the units they get on the flip side the system to help you guide your ai military allies around to help you against common enemies is a novel idea that works often but not always ai allies are as a rule unreliable they can do anything from nothing when you ask them or they can do it but take forever to do so or they go do so and achieve the goal you set you can never know so the only use ai allies have is to present armies you don t pay for that can maybe help you and planning around this fact becomes tedious very often the ai knows exactly how far you can move at all times and it don t always bother to do basic things to assists it s economy you often move to attack enemy armies only to stop just short the ai will avoid you if it s calculated your odds to be good this is tactically wise ofc but it leads to wild goose chases where you are always just shy of the range needed to catch up until the enemy gains the upper hand and double teams you and often defeats you this can get extremely frustrating very fast horde armies chaos for instance tend to run around and avoid you until they find a soft small settlement to pillage and raze to the ground ruining your economy and avoiding your armies at the same time on the other hand if you play a horde faction like beastmen and have to live off raiding targets minor settlements are usually easy pray however even over a hundred turns later if you come back the ai may not have bothered re building the settlement and even if they have it often has not been upgraded because the ai don t need the money or tech most of the time so you get next to nothing from raiding it just when you are desperate for loot and are suffering high attrition these are just a few examples of how game mechanics around the ai can be extremely vexing and a detriment to an otherwise brilliant game having said that the difficulty is a very great challenge that though it s of the unfair one rule for me and another for thee variety and not organic will annoy or invigorate you depending on what you can tolerate in conclusion total war warhammer is despite some sour notes a good rts game where you either overcome and defeat your enemies with clever strategy careful empire management and brilliant battlefield tactics or watch as the horrors of the old world slowly grind you down as your enemies attack from all sides until inevitably your empire collapses and your people drown in blood and the cruel laughter of dark gods i would recommend this game to all total war fans and warhammer fans alike it s a varied and entertaining total war game and a very faithful representation of the grim darkness of warhammer fantasy
