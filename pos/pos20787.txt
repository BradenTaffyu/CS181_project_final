2023 magic both beautiful and powerful binds together our long history that common bond we share is the legacy of hogwarts introductionhogwarts legacy is a third person action adventure game with some minor rpg and exploration folded into the mix set in the wizarding world universe this game finally lets you explore the castle of hogwarts and the surrounding area with near limitless freedom but did this game capture the magic of the harry potter books and movies let s find out below positives negatives hogwarts and the region have been masterfully recreated from the books and movies the combat is fun with a small arsenal of spells to utilise and combine for new effects hogwarts legacy promotes exploration and adventure you never know what you will find if you get off the beaten track and this is more manageable when you discover the ability to fly the game is visually stunning with a similarly impressive audio catalogue the story is underwhelming and a little boring the world is enormous but it s mostly filled with empty objectives there is also no actual day night cycle and nothing drastically changes between the periods you can join any of the four houses but they minorly affect your main story and offer little otherwise no quidditch seriously house points exist in the game in a canonical definition but never come into play despite being firm benchmarks for morality in the series and even in the game hogwarts legacy has no morality scale storyhogwarts legacy takes place in the 1800s a long while before the events of harry potter you play as a self named and created character arriving at hogwarts for his first year starting in the 5th year of school almost immediately upon setting off for your year of school the flying carriage you are riding is involved in an incident where the villain ranrok is after something in your possession this unravels into a scramble for answers and unlocks your powers as quickly as possible to help your new friends and hogwarts survive this growing threat with the help of your mentor professor fig and some of the other professors at the school providing you with special assignments to hone your considerable talents your powers grow significantly and impressively quickly as well as your understanding of your place in this story for the most part the story is actually well written and provides a lot of nostalgia for fans of the ww series but this is ultimately undone by the lack of fluidity flow and at times rushed plot points that litter the entire game you finally feel invested in a storyline blazed through in a single mission and forgotten pretty sad as this story could have been expanded and would have been sensational gameplay analysisit s a kind of magic hogwarts legacy has quite a considerable repertoire of spells you can unlock and use throughout the story and exploration some spells are best utilised for puzzles and activities and others are more combat proficient spells also fall into colour categories which help differentiate them for their use as well as their purpose in combat purple shields can only be damaged by purple or force spells yellow shields can only be broken by yellow or control spells and so on falling into one of the categories control force damage essential utility and unforgivable unforgivable curses are broken as they can break any shield colour and dominate combat quite easily adopting the dark arts a screenshot of hogwarts legacy by preator a world of exploration exploration plays a large part in the game even though you won t need to or get much time to explore until you re finished with the rather lengthy tutorial the best items can only be located by exploring dark caves and dungeons i have to admit however while exploring was fun and fascinating in the first part of the game it became more tedious in the latter and i tended to avoid it entirely flying but no reason to flying i absolutely adore flying around on the broom or on the back of a creature and experiencing the world from way above it there is just something absolutely captivating about it but hogwarts legacy also doesn t have quidditch in it removing the main reason people would want to fly around with fast travel available that is lore friendly there is already a quick means of travelling the world they just removed a reason to get good at flying lots of tidbits this is the part where i m going to cover a lot of little annoyances and missing content that bothered me during the game morality there is none you have the ability to cast both light and dark magic but nobody really cares about it there is no downside to killing people outright with avada kedavra just as there s no reason to avoid it day night cycle time does continue to tick as you play the game and day and night do come to pass but these events don t mean anything either when you wake up in your dorm there is nobody still in their beds and you are all alone the school empties out for a few hours but nobody is roaming the halls looking for students houses and house points joining one of the four houses gryffindor slytherin hufflepuff and ravenclaw should mean something but really they are just a mild aesthetic kick and have no real purpose you don t gain points for your house by being a good student or doing complex challenges and you will win the house cup regardless of your effort audio and visualthis title is beautiful landscapes will capture your breath and the amount of detail put into the world s design and development is astounding probably one of the most impressive graphical experiences available today particle effects from spells and the overall ambience are above the standard the perfect ending a screenshot of hogwarts legacy by preator the audio falls into a very similar basket the ambience of waves crashing against rocks trees rustling in the wind and birds chirping as they fly by is brilliantly captivating while the soundtrack captures nostalgia and wonderment that the movies did so perfectlypc performance and specificationsrunning the game on high and set to 2560 x 1440 resolution i never saw the game drop below 60 fps ultra rtx did cause the game to chug quite viciously however but was fine as soon as i turned it down to high i also didn t experience any significant bugs or issues whilst playing the game which is impressive

this game the overall experience wasn t bad at all was it worth the current price no not really was it fun yeah it was and i thoroughly enjoyed it for what it was if you re a fan of the franchise give this game a shot but i would suggest waiting for a decent sale as i don t think there s enough here to warrant the price to my friends and allies along the way a screenshot of hogwarts legacy by preator if you want to capture a little magic and hogwarts legacy didn t quite do it for you head on over to hell purgatory and paradise to enter a real world of magical fantasy
