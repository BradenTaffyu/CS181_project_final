2017 i bought this game a looooonngg time ago when you could only play alone or split screen but now that the game has the option of playing online i definitely recommend getting this game and playing it with your friends if you don t mind playing with random people or by yourself i guess that s okay too if you don t mind being lonely like i do lol plus working with strangers is always an adventure anyway this game is all about physics puzzles and the labor of manually climbing there are currently 9 levels to get through you will struggle and you will stress but it s still fun for some reason there is also the option of character customization which is great especially when you play online and look at other people s characters i personally enjoy playing this game but not on a daily basis it sure does kill the time though
