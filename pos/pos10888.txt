2021 tldr if you love grand strategy logistics and encircling maneuvers as well as a gradual buildup to an epic albeit slow war then this is the best wwii strategy game you can buy however this is a game of strategy not tactics so keep that in mind actual review hearts of iron 4 is an amazing world war 2 grand strategy game however it s definitely not for everyone there s a distinct lack of action in the early game as you slowly build up your forces and industrial capability furthermore you kind of have to set your own goals for the game whether that is allying with one of the three major factions before the outbreak of war or just conquering your neighbors and avoiding tangling with the big dogs pros if you love logistics supply troop configurations and large scale movement of divisions then you will have a blast playing this game you can design division templates however you wish and there are glorious loads of numbers and interesting statistics to mess with the scale of the game is very epic and you definitely feel like the master of millions of troops slowly pushing long lines of combat the interface albeit a bit clunky in some areas is efficient and streamlined for the most part you can do some absolutely amazing encircling maneuvers and other big strategies want to hold chokepoints you can do it want to launch surprise naval landings in the enemy s backyard yep that too the soundtrack is about as good as you can get for a world war 2 game neutral points the game is probably amazing if you play cooperatively or competitively with friends i wouldn t know as all my friends were not big fans of this and won t play with me any more see con 1 there s not much you can do for small scale tactics or individual battles this is a game about broad strokes of army movements and strategies not minute details of individual battles less tactics more strategy cons there s a distinct lack of action early on in the game and the game does feel a bit dry for people who are used to more intense action and combat this means it won t appeal to everyone and especially not to people who don t enjoy logistics and strategy over tactics and action the joy of the war in the game is seeing amazing strategies come to fruition or fail miserably and frankly that s just not enough for some people such as my friends further elaborating on that point the combat is very dry it s basically watching numbers fight each other you need a good imagination to really enjoy it there are long dry stretches of the game where not a lot happens this can be alleviated by speeding up the game but just be prepared for that you won t be getting constant dopamine hits from this one you can technically choose to play any nation in the world at that time but obviously there is a strong bias towards the big players of world war 2 if you play any country outside of the axis allies or comintern you will find yourself at a distinct disadvantage that only the greatest level of skill and experience with the game can overcome this can diminish the fun for many people who might want to conquer the world as the mighty and tiny nation of bhutan it s not impossible it s just very very difficult a few cosmetic and small issues that can be fixed with mods division icons etc so basically if you are a patient left brained person who enjoys logistics and grand army strategies and maneuvers then you might enjoy this game but if you want intense action and amazing combat as well as a constant stream of stimulation then this is probably not the game for you p s the dlc are a bit overpriced but not necessary so i really don t mind it you might though
