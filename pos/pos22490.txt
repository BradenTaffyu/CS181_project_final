2016 not having any of the crashing issues reported by others performance is fine with 60 fps even in the places people reported slow downs noticed the player count for this game was up to 120k so i m not surprised a small minority are having issues as it s the nature of pc gaming no game is released perfect a lot of people seem to be complaining about performance issues that are either using low end hardware or laptops because they are able to run dark souls ii at silky smooth frame rates something to remember about this is dark souls ii was built for and designed around the limitations of the hardware inside the ps3 and xbox360 dark souls iii was designed from the ground up to run on the current generation consoles the ps4 and xboxone these consoles while still being under powered compared to a modest gaming desktop are still substantially more powerful than their predecessors and benefit from being static hardware making it easier to optimize for but even so bloodborne and dark souls iii both run at 30fps with drops down into the 20 s on these consoles so it shouldn t come as a shock to people that they can t run dark souls iii at 60fps in max settings like they could in dark souls ii with the same hardware these games are a generation apart in terms of graphical power requirements dark souls iii uses much more complicated geometry better lighting effects higher texture resolution higher shadow resolution improved enemy ai and more great graphics and art design attention to detail is as good as ever and really helps to captivate and immerse you into the gameplay mobs are also very detailed and feel like they belong in their respective area some of the best boss designs fights of the series amazing soundtrack boss music is epic rewarding gameplay tougher and smarter mobs seemingly infinite replayability from the sheer amount of equipment and build variety the game offers co op gameplay and pvp with many covenants designed around it possibility of 6 players total in online play network lag and online hit detection needs some work game kicks to the main menu if the online connection is lost regardless of what you re doing poise system could use some rebalancing as it s almost irrelevant in it s current form no steam cloud support no current known anti cheat in placeoverall i see this as a great addition to the souls series and an excellent game in general highly recommendededit also something i would just like to put to rest is the illogical argument people put forward about this game being like bloodborne as a bad thing first of all sony asked from software for a new game as they needed an exclusive ip for their console the ps4 and thus bloodborne was born kek so it really isn t suprising that bloodborne shared a lot of simmilarities with the souls series considering it was made by the same developers and directed by hidetaka miyazaki it s a shame that bloodborne is exclusive to the ps4 but it s still an excellent game from the guys at from software so saying this game sucks it s too much like bloodborne is a completely illogical thing to say because both games are great and if both games are great saying one is bad because it s too much like the other is an absolute nonsensical argument
