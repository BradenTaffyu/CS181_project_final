2020 as a newcomer to dark souls the first 10 hours can be pretty intimidating it s a lot of blundering around not knowing how all the numbers mechanics function and ofc straight up struggling with the game s punishing difficulty starting around the first half of the mid game is when things start to change the flow of the game starts to make coherent sense and it s at this point that ds3 reels you into absolute addiction the process of developing an understanding over the unspoken rules of a formal waltz between player and enemy is what makes these games special every victory must be earned that s not to say that every trash mob will force you to use all your brainpower but the fact that literally every enemy is potentially lethal will force you to respect their moveset and play around it until it becomes second nature the game s learning curve absence of difficulty settings sliders and lack of any way to cheese cheat around it forces you to play in a way that most games didn t raise you to behave you don t get to march forth with superior numbers and all the odds stacked in your favour that birthright is given to the boss enemies instead button mashing hack n slash tactics are guaranteed failure you are 10x weaker than they are by design to survive on the opposite end of the court for a change you have to become the most annoying and conniving little flea that nicks and nibbles at the boss hp while refusing to die by all means possible it s great exercise for a part of the brain that never gets any
