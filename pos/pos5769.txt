2023 bannerlord feels like one of em classic pc games back in the day i grew up in the 1990s so graphics and animations were mostly clunky and characters were blocky bannerlord feels like i m going back in time when i m running through the map town or raiding a bandit camp it just has a feeling of nostalgia and i m not sure why it could be the soundtrack or perhaps it s just me who knows but once i get into a siege or full scale battle this is where bannerlord shines i ve been playing ck3 for a bit now and i wished ck3 had some kind of mechanic like bannerlord in battles besides two people dueling it out and watching numbers decline bannerlord has a lot to cover but the screenshots are self explanatory diplomacy and npc interaction are a bit wonky i only played the demo of the first m b so i can t compare this to the first title at all but m b makes me forget that i m playing on a flatscreen not a crt i haven t modded the game yet but mods make a difference
