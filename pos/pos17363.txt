2020 this was the first game of the total war series that i played i was immediately hooked by the immersive story and the detailed campaign and battle strategy i have since played other games in the total war franchise but this remains my favorite i am a longtime fan of the civilization games but after playing three kingdoms when i go back to civilization it feels very high level and lacking in depth if you want a game that lets you run an empire act as a battlefield general and engage in diplomacy all while learning about a period of chinese history that i knew little about you will love three kingdoms
