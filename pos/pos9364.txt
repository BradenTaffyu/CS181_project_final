2020 after 400 hours in the game its time for a short review this racing simulator is a must have for everybody who enjoys racing on the pc i call it the swiss army knife of racing sims this sim together with racedepartment com will allow you to race almost anything on almost any track you can think of the modding community is still very active and amazing pair this sim with crewchief and content manager throw in simhub for an extra dashboard or transducer and you will have a great time also please give the creators of these great tools additions a few bucks for their troubles next use content manager to download the shaders patch and bring the sim into 2020 looking pretty close to some modern sims load up this sim with the bmw e30 dtm spec on mugello and race that against 20x 100 ai for 12 laps with a good pedal set and ffb wheel and if you can honest tell me that didn t tickle your racing fancy i would be amazed
