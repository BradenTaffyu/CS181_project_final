2020 early access review my all time favourite game it s brutal at times but really rewarding too i just finished my build after 3 hours only to accidentally shift two gears at 100 km h it blew all my bearings and one of my pistions shot out and punched a hole in my oil pan some time later it was back better than ever a better tunned engine with a new carb thrown in and new racing parts was such a thrill to finally get it running smoothly and go on to win the rally would reccomend 10 10
