2018 i m going to start my review by saying that i ve had this game during beta and it has come a long way there are many great things about this game but as with most games out there there are also bad things starting with the good the actual cleaning of houses it works nicely and after getting some perks you will see all the dirt is so it s quicker to clean the painting feature is nice and allows you to paint in strips and the games graphics look beautiful overall the demolition is also good it s not as good as the trailer shows but it is fun to break walls when needed now for the bad things there are not many quick jobs and they can be completed within a few hours this can be a deal breaker for some as after that it s just buying and flipping houses there isn t a large variety of houses to flip the game has around 20 houses for you to buy and sell some have nuclear bunkers but most of them are just the same style house and roughly the same shapes and sizes you can t make the yard better there is no lawn mowing no outdoor gardening all you can do is change the panels outside but only on a single storey there is no way to panel a second story currently there is also a huge lack of furniture in the shop and a lot of it is dated there are also no kitchen wall cabinetsno modding support currently if the devs were to add modding support for people to make custom houses and furniture items it would make the game much better as people could be more creative bugs and i m not talking about the cockroaches im talking about game bugs one that i ve noticed is that the more lights you have on the less frames you will get i ve only noticed this on the highest graphic setting but it s still a bug i still recommend the game but just know this is a new game and it s bound to have issues the devs are working on it still and it has a lot of potential thank you for taking the time to read my review please let me know if it was helpful or not
