buggy yeah still worth playing absolutely especially once we get the dlc and other companions along with some healthy patching big update just came out and i m probably about to dive in for a second full playthrough don t let the rage reviews dissuade you if you re into 40k and have like me waited for something like this for most of your life if you re not that into 40k and you just like rpgs maybe wait just a bit longer and keep checking back to see how much is fixed up personally 10 10 would have abelard announce my genocidal actions again
