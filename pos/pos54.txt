2018 i was never interested in farming games i ve never played a harvest moon game or an animal crossing game and never had any interest in them the closest thing to a farming game i ve ever played was minecraft i definitely would have never tried stardew valley if i wasn t an achievement hunter and it didn t have achievements but now i see what all the hype was about stardew valley is a game that is very easy to lose oneself into there are many elements of the game that feel intimately relatable to real life especially the game s premise you re stuck at a soul crushing corporate office job when your grandfather dies leaving you an envelope telling you to open it only when you ve reached your absolute limit and need something new after a particularly bad day at work you finally decide to open the envelope and find a deed to your grandfather s farm on a far off island so you take the plunge and decide to move there it is a very strong analogy to the game itself where you the player are seeking escapism from your daily life and decide to take the plunge into this game not knowing what else to expect in stardew valley you will find your new home upon a sizable but absolutely trashed plot of land as the days go by you can clean up the land and discover hundreds of ways to make a profit with what you ve been given from buying seeds and planting crops to raising animals to fishing by means of a surprisingly pleasant and addictive quicktime event to foraging for wild food and even to exploring a few combat centric zelda style dungeons but you re not making money for its own sake there are dozens of mysterious secrets scattered about the land each with significant and game changing rewards at the end and you need to raise the money and resources to investigate them all the game experience is going to be totally different for everybody depending on what game elements you are inspired to pursue first although you ll assuredly be looking at a wiki in due time it is deeply satisfying to go in blind and piece things together yourself for as long as you can years consist of four months each month being 28 day season some gameplay mechanics change with the seasons particularly that certain crops only grow in certain seasons and almost no crops grow in winter so you ll have to carefully consider what seeds to plant and when each day lasts about five minutes and you ve got to make sure you re back in your house by 2am or else you ll pass out and lose some money the biggest way the game hooks you is the fact that your progress is only saved at the start of a day so if you re eager to wake up in the morning and harvest your crops it won t mean anything unless you play the whole day through a vicious cycle i clocked 120 hours of this game in the first 2 weeks of playing that s how bad it is another one of the game s strengths is the cozy little community you live beside with a population of about 25 people the game does a wonderful job of making each character feel like their own entity with their own daily routines and backstories and motivations you ll really get to know and love them you can give gifts to characters to increase friendship level with them unlocking character development cutscenes and important rewards you can even date some of them you can have 6 boyfriends and 6 girlfriends at once if you want no joke relationships are gender indiscriminate and then marry the character of your choice the social aspect is sometimes a bit too real you ll feel the pain of rejection all too often but that makes the successful relationships all the more heartwarming as for complaints surprisingly the game has some strange and baffling bugs most of which are visual like ice skating horses but some which affect gameplay and a few known save corruption bugs i also felt consistently uncomfortable with the controls if you re using the mouse your cursor needs to always be in proximity of your character or else you ll only aim at the tile in front of you making it very easy to abruptly turn the wrong direction while working and if you accidentally click the wrong tile your character will turn to face it changing the default direction you aim compounding the problem it can be infuriating especially if it causes you to accidentally destroy crops also i don t like how you can only talk to npcs if you have a tool selected and how you ll use a consumable item at the same time as opening a door if you have one selected the controls could definitely use some additional polish then there are the inventory controls if you click on an inventory item you pick it up and you can drop it in a different inventory slot if you click on an inventory item with a storage box open you will immediately transfer the item into or out of the box thus it is impossible to organize the inventory with a storage box open if you click on an inventory item while in a shop you immediately sell the item with no confirmation i can t tell you the amount of times i purchased 200 seeds then immediately sold them again just because i tried to pick them up and put them in a different slot also i can t help but feel the game should have even more content than it already does perhaps more dungeons a bigger map and the ability to run more than one farm but as of this writing the game is still in active development including a co op multiplayer patch in the works and a lively modding community i give this game an 8 10 a wonderful example of what all those crappy farmville mobile games would be like if they were actually balanced around gameplay and not milking the player with microtansactions and daily login bonuses despite some stupidly distracting bugs and annoying controls it s some simply wonderful escapism and made me finally see the appeal in a farming game it does get stale in time but not before offering a huge amount of joy for achievement hunting it ll easily take about 200 hours especially blind but if you re like me you ll have it over with in a month or two a huge thumbs up
