2013 the most comprehensive military sim out there setting you loose on a massive island with all of the weapons vehicles and scenarios you could possibly wish for the game itself has remained almost unchanged since the original operation flashpoint released over 10 years ago however of all the iterations arma 3 is the one that has improved things the most these aren t big changes but merely small gameplay tweaks that make it feel more polished and smooth graphically it s convincing it isn t always beautiful but it gets the atmosphere of a real place just right and the large view distances are key to making it feel alive you can tell that the developers did their homework when researching the island that this game is based on yup it is a real place if you don t know anything about this game the best word to sum it up with would be realistic you are a single soldier in a large real time conflict you can die from a single bullet or stray shell and alone you have limited influence over how the battle will go expect to be crawling through muddy fields or cowardly hiding behind cover as bullets whiz overhead don t expect to behave like rambo and to survive i wouldn t consider this game complete just yet for months they have been rolling out updates and patches and at the time of writing the main campaign is only 1 3 released that being said it s the community that really supports this game mods like dayz show how flexible and open ended the game can be really arma 3 can be seen as offering an island and great multiplayer support letting the community come up with the best content personally i haven t spent much time in the large scale multiplayer side of things i prefer playing missions with a friend and those experiences have been enjoyable and memorable expect a single objective to take a while and for it to get rather frustrating as you die through seemingly no fault of your own i ve also spent a lot of time simply exploring the large island yup on my own with no npcs or other players i love the sights and sounds i love exploring over the next mountain or lounging about on a beach soaking up the digital rays i don t expect other people to find that fun and neither does the game the fantastic mission editor simply opens up countless opportunities for you and i chose one of the most dull and mundane simply to see how much enjoyment i could extract from it the community is what makes this product what it is they re serious but loyal and will likely be playing this game for years to come you ll make good friends if you behave in a sensible and team worthy fashion and thanks to the steam workshop support there are thousands of mods and maps to download to boost the number of scenarios the game has to offer buying this game is an investment the developers and community have pledged their loyalty to build it into a must have title though it could take several years to reach that stage don t expect gameplay that s easy to jump in to nor should you expect a fun standalone experience but this game is no cod by default it s not a mainstream game but the possibilities it offers you are almost endless
