2022 euro truck simulator 2 ets2 is a great game that s been consistently updated for a decade over which scs greatly improved the quality of their works in fact so much so that the map has unfortunately become inconsistent with some countries looking really immersive and some looking like a port from an early 2000 s game with regards to the latter it s primarily poland and the united kingdom those two are in the base game and haven t been touched since release in 2012 and are in need of a major overhaul while czech republic slovakia and hungary which were added in the first map expansion need a solid update with this in mind i would recommend folks try out american truck simulator ats that was released in 2016 and already has had its base map overhauled to match the quality of ats s dlc s this way you ll have a much more enjoyable and consistent experience compared to ets2 quality roller coaster
