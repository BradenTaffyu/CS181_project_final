relic i m so sorry i take back every mean thing i ever said about you homeworld 3 opened my eyes and i am ready to give you another chance just please don t break my heart like blackbird did as for company of heroes 3 i have thousands of hours in company of heroes 2 so i was very disappointed with the launch and first year of 3 to put it mildly it might have had good direction but just absolutely lacked content and frankly the graphics turned me off 2 had such a gritty realism to the fantasy that 3 looks like a cartoon compared with updates and very visible development 3 has turned into something not bad i d say it s good not amazing but good there s a lot of content they haven t tapped into probably because low sales and sega meddling and the insane backlash 2 got for their portrayal of russia and how russia is doing right now in general it s kind of a mess but for what 3 is it s pretty good grab it on sale refund it if it s not your cup o tea and spark up lads we captured it
