2023 this is the best dwarf fortress inspired game around hands down taking the core gameplay that was so compelling from df and make it much more accessible and aesthetically appealing the design here is so well tuned that there is always a new problem building up with needs solving to keep your colony operating but the pacing is just spot on such that you aren t overwhelmed at least after your first couple of attempts at a colony highly recommended i d say that expansion is unnecessary until you ve already put 100 hours in the base game it adds more stuff but there is already a lot of stuff in the base game to keep you occupied i ve got minor quibbles with the fidelity of the simulation for example gasses don t follow the ideal gas law pv nrt but overall i consider oxygen not included to be a masterpiece
