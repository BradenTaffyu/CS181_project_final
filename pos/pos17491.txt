2017 they say war never changes but that universal truth does not apply to total war the series has the well known core gameplay of a campaign map and isometric army clashes this has changed relatively little over the years but it has evolved considerably i found the series in the medieval times and remained a dedicated fan up to shogun 2 with attila and rome 2 i felt the long standing flaws franchise fatigue and general dlc policy had finally ended the war for me sometimes it is good to be wrong the matrimony of the two titans in the game title is a blessed one indeed on the surface things are the same as before you still recruit a general and a stack of 20 units for him and build up your cities to climb the tech tree and pay for the proceedings the surface is where all old familiarity ends however all the core systems have been changed but not for the sake of changing as often happens in old succesful series take agents for example in empire you would stack them in universities and forget them there now you can build them for campaign map support or helping your lord in combat and give them followers and magic items familiar from the table top this familiar rpg system feels so fresh here i hope total war will never let go of it the spirit of carefully weighed innovation is present in all things your provinces are made up of a capital citadel and 1 3 settlements and building them into a web of benefits is challenging rewarding and above all fun with total war warhammer you get to feel like a true head of state making plans for a payoff as in nowhere else with many other total wars empire in particular the ai had great difficulties in building intelligent armies and leading them into battle no more the great powers can put up a good fight on normal and become true headaches on very hard and legendary the battles with piling corpses look fantastic as usual but you can feel how the change from history to fantasy has liberated creative assembly s collective imaginations the addition of flying units and sorcerers feels new but organic like long awaited additions warhammer fantasy also has such a deep fount of lore and history to draw from and ca has truly embraced the creation all the little details feel tasteful and correct completely in place the factions above all are what makes tw w the diamond it is all of them play unique and feel balanced even better than this the quest systems legendar lords and general feuds mean great opportunity for emergent storytelling in my empire game volkmar the grim was tasked with defending the northern coast from norsca raiders in his first encounter with throgg the troll king volkmar was bested and wounded his army destroyed but he staged a comeback beating back throgg and wulfrik again and again until victory was secure the game did not have a feud system between volkmar and the norsca it simply emerged in my head and made the troll burning feel like happiness the tradition of bugs has ended as well and the wait between turns is remarkably brief considering how good the game looks the lightness feels truly respectable the dlc policy has often been criticized and for good reason a fan could pay the retail price again if he wants to try all the factions and this is not respectable on the other hand ca has released great free dlcs too and paid ones are worth getting but minding your budget is a must other than that the perfectly captured warhammer spirit seamless technical execution aerodynamic total war gaming mechanics and vivid presentation all make total war warhammer an instant classic one no strategy lover should do without
