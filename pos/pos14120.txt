2018 early access review a fantastic game par for the course for klei they put out significant content updates every 6 weeks they are a great example of how early access should be done i do wish they could put out more content each update but i ve had a great time replaying the game with each new update to explore the new gameplay options there aren t too many games where having a science education is rewarded by helping to solve engineering puzzles but they ve done it i love it but i do wish they would just complete it one of these days i am looking forward to having an end goal to achieve in order to have a sense of completion for now it is just your own sense of accomplishment in building a self sustaining base without any resource limitations or cascade failures
