2018 though the game was definitely bare in its initial release the rise and fall expansion makes civilization vi one of the greatest in the series as a longtime civilization player roughly 11 years now i judge these games pretty harshly i was releuctant at first to accept the new city building feature of the game but as my 225 hours of gameplay will tell you i quickly fell in love as perhaps the biggest change to the game it has added a new dimension to civilization changing it just enough to keep it interesting but not so much that the game is unrecognizable glares accusingly at civilization beyond earth the game has been great for a civilization veteran like me as well as my rookie friends i anxiously await the next expansion
