2019 early access review sitting there in the quiet car race countdown coming to 10s ignition on starter the engine roars up formation starts rolling out of the last corner towards the line your crewchief on the radio tells you green flag go and from there on forget everything floor the pedal and fight for thousands of a second this game is a serious simulation be sure of this when you think of getting into it when you enter a corner you need to think about what each of your wheels is doing how the loads are distributed what each square of rubber can give you but still the entry is quite easy in my opinion there are three setups for each track and car combination a safe setup which you can use to get aquainted with the car a wet setup for rainy days and an agressive setup the latter being the one for me to focus on it s a good base which will work even if you might optimize some bits here and there after a few laps when i got there hunting the green spot of the delta timer in hotlaps qualification runs or races time just began to fly by right now a week before scheduled 1 0 release i really enjoy it functions are still limited but the overall is impressive a short breakdown graphics given the right hardware it can look really good taa shows some ghosting in replays but it looks like this is hard to avoid with the unreal engine hardware is quite important driving at 4k and 70 scale my 1060 6gb is at the limit it works fine for me but it won t put out a lot more than 60 fps on high settings controls i have only tested it with my g25 and for a short run with a fanatec wheel during the spa event last year feedback is convincing for me and provides the information i need ai it might be that you need to do a restart every now and than but close racing can feel really good it s important to set the strength correct i set it so that i can qualify mid field and it s possible for me to gain about 1 3 positions with hard racing and not overdo it on the aggressiveness atmosphere game changer in my opinion the sounds are one of the games highlights every rattle shake pump curb marbles wheelslip etc comes to the ears naturally running down the straight at n rburgring where i ve been myself quite a few times looks as close as i ve never seen it in a game mp it s been a huge point of discussion over the last days but for me the current system with weights works quite well after a short period of getting used to it for me this is enough for server selection during a session my experience regarding ping has been quite ok even though once i had a collision which a buddy of mine whom i raced with didn t notice also i get a short hiccup every now and than i guess it occurs when a car model needs to be loaded for a car that wasn t used in the session before to make it short if you are interested in a serious simulation of an interesting gt3 series i can only advise you to go for it
