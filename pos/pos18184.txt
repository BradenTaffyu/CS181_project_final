2022 inscryption is a great game i could talk about the 4 acts and how while the act before the finale drags a bit the finale makes it all up i could talk about the honestly engaging gameplay i could talk about the interesting characters the game introduces to you i could even talk about the arg and how after your first playthrough you invariably missed something interesting i could even talk about the mod that has easily added 30 hours to my playtime and i m not done with it but honestly i think the demo does good enough to introduce you to the gameplay and general feel of the game play the demo if the prospect of more intrigues you and you like really narratively interesting games this is a great one and if you complete the game and want more there is always kaycee s mod i cannot suggest this game enough to those who have not tried it and trust me going in blind helps immensely after you beat the game you can fixate on the game s mountain of lore and secrets then don t spoil your first playthrough
