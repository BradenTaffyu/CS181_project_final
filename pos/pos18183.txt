it took me a long time to write this review wanting to include all aspects of a game with so many faces i also wanted to complete all the achievements which i did after about 90 hours of free play completing the main story three times exact time depends on the person and their individual speed of play you start playing inscryption as a card game combined with the theme of an escape room your goal is to solve all of the puzzles battle with the mysterious being on the other side of the table and win apart from your opponent you face the questionable morals of the rules of the game itself the game you must play to get away from the stranger s cabin although this may be a subjective opinion i believe that the card part of the gameplay is varied enough that the player does not get bored and has fun giving their cards different sigils or coming up with tactics speaking of which kaycee mod is a nice addition for people who just like me particularly liked the game mechanics as the story progresses at a steady pace inscryption keeps surprising you until it violently breaks through the fourth wall and again and again while you still have many questions and their number is growing the place you are in is slowly starting to feel more familiar to you the player i won t talk about the visuals in the non spoiler part of my review for a reason but i will mention the music the soundtrack fits perfectly into the disturbing atmosphere of the game fully exploiting the potential of background sound effects it s amazingly climatic and startling slowly begins to combine various themes which however connects very well to the whole the first track you hear is i believe the most complex one well planned and well thought out and you will learn its full meaning only after finishing the game and the most fun you get from inscryption is when you play blindly knowing as little as possible about it if you re a new player still slowly uncovering the complex story of inscryption stop reading right here the next section may contain mild spoilers anyone who has played mullins previous games will understand that the main plot still revolves around the same matter and everything happening in inscryption goes beyond normal understanding it dances around meta themes slips through tiny lines of enigmatic dialogue and breaks the fourth wall it s an extremely satisfying experience rewarding your patience and time spent building the deck and solving the puzzles the inscryption arg was also neatly constructed and i enjoyed reading through what had already been solved by others it s not only about the brilliant story itself but the characters and each of them is somehow flawed yet in the end you can find yourself care about them even if a side character has only a few lines of dialogue they are so easily remembered and characteristic the artstyle is simple yet spine chilling in the later stages of the game the graphics become more retro which fits so well into the overall story also can we talk about how cool the physics of the little bone tokens are designs of the main characters are so weirdly creative and unsettling in their bizarre way closing statements i can t go too far in my thoughts on inscryption not too far not too soon i don t want to take away from new players the experience of exploring everything on their own at the same time i think most can be said about the plot itself which is something i tried to avoid wanting to focus on many aspects of this game i hope that many people enjoyed this game as much as i did and are equally looking forward to the next games from the same publisher
