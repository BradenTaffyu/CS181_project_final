2018 product received for free early access review so what is 7 days to die to put it in a box its a grownups minecraft however the base building survival and exploration are certainly the focus for both thats where the similarities end where one has you lost in a magical land playing as an unfathomably strong willed and strong in general 16 bit man while the other locks you into a gritty post apocalyptic scenario so im no artist but let me paint as best a picture as possible with the story provided thus far its post ww3 nuclear devastation you are one of the very few currently locked in a small slice of land inside the ficticious navezgane nav is gain county arizona the county of navezgane is surrounded by a dense area of radiation that threatens your well being preventing safe rescue or escape by foot you play as insert survivor story and your entire goal is to survive in this bleak situation as best as possible you will find supplies forage hunt smelt cook and build in order to do this but don t think you are alone there are others traders reclusive enclaves other survivors and in the future depending on when this is read bandits and if the threat of armed strangers starvation or the environment itself wasn t bad enough your most worrying dilemma comes as the tides of flesh that is the infected the zeds in this game are your main stay danger strong superb sense of hearing and smell nightvision and speaking of the dark at night even fast quickly making the hunter the hunted and with a fair few abnormal zeds to throw at you they are not lacking in the threatening department finally its name sake every 7 days a sizable horde bares its fangs and comes for you on the 7th night these feral undead come from beyond the radiation zone bringing with them a fair few special types and much stronger senses all with the single unified goal of bringing an end to you and your base so now for the sum up tally and closing notes 7 days is an intense resource intensive sandbox survival where its only as easy or as difficult as the player s are cunning and resourceful chalked full of challenges and goals to keep you entertained for hours ratings 1 5 survival 4 5 my only snag is the start if your just getting into it or are playing on a higher difficulty is preetty rough so be warned otherwise the looting and crafting more than makes up for the rough start building 5 even with having this on both the xbox and the computer with countless hours of enjoyment on both i am still finding and seeing new and creative ways to go about surviving zombies 3 5 the big snag with the zeds are other than the rarer zombies or the 7 day hordes once you have a well leveld and geared survivor they can loose a certain ammount of their lethality but on the other hand it is kinda the point am i right overall 4 as of a16 4 the game is great fun but with a few minor snags i can honestly say that this is worth every penny i spent on it i would recommend picking it up on a sale just because it is still being polished and with the voted on broadened update calender they will be few and far between but each one should be something to behold i hope this review helps anyone wanting an honest opinion of a weekend warrior
