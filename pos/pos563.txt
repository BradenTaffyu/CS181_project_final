2021 had this game sitting in my steam library for god knows how long i regret not playing it sooner its like crack once you know what you re doing you wont put it down the music in the game is incredible and for a project made by a single yes a single developer you will be really shocked by how much there is to do in this game concerned ape i want to say sorry for not playing this sooner its an incredibly well made game and i hope in the future you charge people for extra content as you have earned the right too yes folks he releases completely free updates in a game wheres theres enough content for around 80 hours gameplay id guess but that turns to 100 s if you want to take your time and build and try out everything and not rush my partner got me playing this because of her nintendo switch which led to me buying 2 more copies for the ipad so my daughters could play give the game a try and it might just surprise you a game made with a lot of love and a friendly community what more could you ask for
