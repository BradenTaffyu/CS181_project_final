2018 early access review although the game has its issues i ve had a lot of fun playing it pve with friends it s not a 23 game wait for the sales or get it from somewhere else than steam pros base building is fun and minecrafty you also can t just build out stupidly without support or it ll collapse exploration just my opinion but when you re new to the game try to play as long as possible without opening a full map from like wiki or somewhere else explore it yourself or with friends of course you might think the game would crash a lot more but it has done that only once in my 45 hours of gameplay i d consider that a minor plus dcons zombies sneak behind your back and make no audio cues most of the times sometimes you re unable to interact with chests and other stuff have to restart 5 years in early access the dayz story it s never coming out of it riding a mini bike makes me almost have a headache for how laggy it is half the time it runs on way lower frames than it should dropping to 30 fps during bloodmoon for example which it shouldn t considering how terrible the graphics are i7 7700k gtx 1070 btw next to impossible to get all of the achievements they re very uncreative
