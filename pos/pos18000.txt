2016 here s why 99 of negative reviews are invalid check the date the review was posted it was likely posted when the game was still going through patching hell i ve heard that the game use to be broken that the patches ruined more than they helped that the campaign diplomacy was broken that the campaign itself was broken etc did ca rush the game probably but this isn t about how angry we are this is about the game itself and the game is amazing no game i ve ever played has come close to this the mix of turn based strategy and real time battles is so entertaining i d even say it s better than shogun 2 total war which is the highest rated total war game the only downside of rome 2 is that there is a steep learning curve they didn t do a great job of organizing all of the information and making it all intuitive to learn the campaign is closer to being shotgunned in the face with 500 stats and facts from all of your provinces politics armies and more but once you learn how to play the game is so deep and incredible and if your pc can run it watching battles close up is like watching a movie the seiges are beautiful with the full sized walls seige equipment destructible barricades gore if you buy the 2 dlc and massive hordes of armies and the mods omg the mods they can make the ai easy or hard or ridiculous they unlock every faction in the game minus the dlc ones which means you get about 50 free factions to play there are unit packs with entirely new units stats and even overhauls for the campaign and battles there are even mods that shuffle the map around so that rome can start where egypt is or sparta where the barbarians are there are mods that change how the morale system works how fast the battles come to a close and what types of flanking strategy are the most effective i literally have to force myself to stop playing sometimes this is one of those games where you could be playing for an hour only to realize it s actually been 5
