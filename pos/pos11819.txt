2014 early access review absolutely beautiful game challanging fun and three times better with friends the recent updates add lots of fun content like character customization and there s a dev blog for reading up on what s new honestly haven t played this game enough and i m sure when it gets out of early access it will be just as popular as other indie crafting games like terraria recently they have made some small changes such as only one time of meat that are not super impactful but can be a little annoying they ve added quality to items that you found and skills that are badass and tied to the world so you never feel overpowered the structual integrety aspects of the game add a level of challange to building and they make it more fun to construct large fancy buildings the best part is after alpha 14 they will have dedicated save protection so no more world restarts their game isn t perfect but it s in alpha and it s damn good
