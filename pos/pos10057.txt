2016 early access review started a colony with a guy named frank had him for a long time and somehow went completely unscathed through countless battles i thought to myself wow this guy is superman next fight loses both of his arms somehow he is still able to do research for me so i decide to keep him around after about a year in game i give him 2 bionic arms a while later there is a massive raid that kills one of his best friends and his wife completely depressed he continually goes berserk and keeps putting my other colonists in the hospital those bionic arms helped him with that i end up having to euthanize him as one of my doctors kneels by his bed after his latest berserk rampage that needed to be stopped with a shotgun to his face they have a farewell chat and then the doctor ends his life i now have a shrine built to him in the center of my colony he will always be remembered on a more technical note the storytelling ai is a genius feature that i have never seen in another game you really get the impression while playing this game that there is a story that the ai is taking you through it controls the stream of events your colony experiences to create a certain experience for you i don t know exactly what is happening behind the scenes but it really does feel that it is doing much more then simply sending you random events depending on the size of your colony if you have any interest in colony town simulation games then this is a must buy
