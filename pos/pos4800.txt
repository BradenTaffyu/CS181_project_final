2020 product received for free ticked free cause it was a gift from the best mate if you are new to the fallout universe this one is pretty noob friendly and if you are a fan of the fu then you gonna love it doesn t matter that you are hardcore old system of gameplay and leveling up you gonna love it period the devs really wanted to add something for everyone went all over the place tbh in one hand i m pleased in the other felt like there is too much this game is not for people who don t like exploring every single place check under every rock abuse all the perks and stuff that the game offers etc positives visually it is a huge improvement compared to the versions before the new engine is superior plus there is a free dlc of 4k textures you can download to get even better graphics beware you ll need a ssd cause it loads tons of data then and 6 core cpu is better just for the loading to unpack it faster story is fallout s typical f ed unique story it is good in it s weird way but i loved the twists added on the non main storylines the extra information you get around being part of the fallout universe well you know it you gonna get lots of easter eggs in quests in the surroundings etc map is huge and i mean much bigger then the previous installment of fallout new vegas tons of places to explore lots of unique locations with their own stories the new leveling up is awesome in my opinion it gives you complete freedom in a sense that theoretically it doesn t matter how you start you can always get all the stats all the perks cause there is no level cap well there is but you d have to be insane to get to that level this way you don t have to restart the whole game if you screwed something up but you still have to start with wise picks early on especially on higher difficulties lots of items weapons armors cloths healing items etc i kinda love that they added a unique item modifier for legendary drops where some items are named and prefixed but the rest is randomly dropped from legendary enemies this is one of the new features item farming weapon and armor modifications is upped to a whole new level which is good i love the new way of wearing armor parts compared to the old style finally junk has a purpose power armor is redesigned so it has parts instead of the full body one piece it has the power exoskeleton has limited usage in a sense you need fusion cores to run it but there are plenty in the commonwealth so you can run with it nonstop during the vanilla gameplay i had no usage of the power armor gave me no reason to use it but later i did start using for the lols and it has some fun features and playstyle base building this is a new feature and i loved it basically throughout the commonwealth there are settlements that you can clear and ally with and build bases create beds chairs tables turrets farms for food item productions etc then you just connect them with supply lines and you have your own small army and all items at disposal keep in mind you ll need to defend these or retake them again lots of unique companions that will give different results based on what you are doing and for whom to the point that you ll get shot by your allies cause of them d four main factions almost the same recipe as the fnw but here you have one extra that will love you no matter what s to the hit you do basically a mexican standoff down the lines as you ll be forced to choose join me brother for the brotherhood if you are fan of w40k you ll be at home i definitely suggest getting the dlcs or the game of the year edition the 4 expansions add a lot to the game far harbour expands the game by adding new story new factions new weapons apparel etc plus it is integrated with the main game as in some quest will lead you there and some story fragments here and there are connected the mechanist adds a 5th faction to the main game killer robots everywhere besides the usual adds now you can create silly robots at your base wink wink vault 88 is just a funny addition but this one adds lots of stuff to build compared to the others and finally the nuka world is very unique basically a mini fallout that is connected to the main story but find out d when it comes to the difficulty you can feel the difference based on what setting you are playing on as i said before it is noob friendly plus if you can t shoot there is always vats to lend a hand i really enjoyed what they did with the survival mode it is a whole different challenge compared to the previous one in fnw and it changes the gameplay style way of thinking approaching etc totally feels like you are playing something else so once completed you can challenge yourself to a whole new adventure almost all the locations repopulate both with enemies and loot it takes time depending on what difficulty you are playing on so you ll get the constant fighting going on some are permanently cleared as they are related to the quest or the story tutorial where you learn what is what steam achievements replayability well you can be all you can be with the new leveling up system but the way you wanna start and approach can be different each time negatives well the first one is that you need to limit the frames to 60 as the game goes into turbo mode if you can render more all the animations are f ed up you can t perform lockpicks etc this isn t game breaking plenty of ways to do the limit since it is bethesda you ll get some crashes here and there in my whole hours only 4 times 3 were failed to initiate the game and insta closing the app and one was after doing several save points and load ins and the typical clip ins through walls and armor nothing terrible some quests have occasional bugs quest failing before hand being stuck at one point and unable to proceed soft lock etc again nothing game breaking encountered only two one on a time limit which wasn t specified so i had to use the unlock command to get the comic and one was an elevator infinite loop which was an easy fix load previous save if you do decide to get the mechanist dlc and build codsworth into a monster he becomes annoying during speeches as he constantly moves and can move you out of the conversation easily fixed by telling him to not move before starting conversations even thou there are a lot of weapons there could have been more feels like there was space to get more variants same goes for the armor cloths and power armor cause of the new way of playing the game with many repetitive quests so that there is always something to be done and since there is no level cap you need extra quests to get to that level faster well it is nice but after a while becomes annoying that you just stop paying attention to this companion ai is terrible if you wanna play stealth they will give up your position nonstop they are great for frontal assault even thou you ll probably spend more time healing them ps not every companion has this issues as some are designed for this type of gameplay but you don t want them cause of the perk etcverdict 9 10recommendedyou won t be disappointed with this one it is a well all rounded game with some great moments and some nothing special ones but lots of fun and the urge to continue pursuing for more and more originally posted by sole survivor war never changes
