2019 chaaarge i remember i became a warhammer fan long time ago after playing a playstation game warhammer dark omen it was with that funny russian voiceover the same voicover which played in videotapes in post soviet countries those who are from these countries will understand ever since i wanted warhammer to become bigger with huge armies and good graphics warhammer total war 2 is basically a total war game in a fantasy world there are lots of similarities battles work very similarly cities and everything else also is very similar but because it s a fantasy game units are very different between factions heroes also have skills and can cast magic your heroes can fight enemy battalions alone and they make a huge change compared to other total war games they can use spells which heal your units or obliterates enemy units everything combined gives more tactical choices in battles every faction is played differently so when you replay the game with another faction it could still feel fresh there s a huge map where you re surrounded by friendly factions enemies and neutral factions you can make alliances to ease your struggle but ai is not very good whenever i think that ally will hold the enemies on the west part for example they always lose enemies are always stronger than friendly factions i hate that i want my allies to be strong i want to coordinate attacks now neutral or friendly factions only become completely friendly when they re near extinction when i offer them help they refuse until they re left with only one city and an average army i m not even talking about friendly factions but even not so friendly faction should agree to cooperate to defeat the threat which threatens to eradicate us both it s hard to reach an agreement with ai factions it requires a lot of time and work to make other faction trust you but when it comes to war against you ai can easily attack you together with their allies because they don t have any restrictions in diplomacy for ai any faction is friendly if they want to in other words diplomacy could use some work it often feels useless you re on your own most of the time another thing i don t like about ai is cheating developers are too lazy to create a smart ai so they just make them cheat ai isn t affected by economy as much as you are your economy is very weak even on lowest difficulty it s very hard to become powerful and ai just have infinite amount of money and anything else ai is constantly harassing you from all sides even if they have only few cities you always need to have couple of full stacks to defend your major cities and you run out of money enemy nope they send strong army lose and after couple of turns they attack again friendly ai will never help you they re always weak and just sit in the only city they own and do nothing only hostile ai s and friendly ones that are far away from you are developing and constantly doing something nevertheless the game is still very enjoyable you just need to accept that ai is cheating there are some good mods on the workshop which could solve many problems restrict ai and make you more powerful exploring the map and doing quests is really fun you need to adapt whenever you fight different factions and battles are amazing huge armies colliding look so good there s a lot of possibilities on the battlefield use magic ambush harass play defensively or attack with all the power it s rare that i like when there s a bunch of dlc s but this is an exception the game has dlc and there are new dlc s coming in constantly but what i like about them is that dlc from the previous game works on newer game you don t need to re buy them two games kind of blend together creating a better experience besides it s a strategy game dlc s add a lot of playtime so paying 10 for a dlc which will give you 50 hours or more gameplay is worth it i wish more games would work like this it s a stunning game graphically when you fight with huge armies it looks so amazing units are highly detailed you can zoom in into middle of the battle and enjoy the slaughtering environments also look great pretty high res textures everywhere my eyes can t really get enough of this game every time it s a joy to watch and for screenshot lovers there s a key which hides the hud performance on the other hand is far from perfect framerate drops hard even on the world map so far i ve experienced a drop to 15 20fps which is bad even for a non action game the mouse and map movements feel sluggish and it annoys me to my surprise framerate in battles is better i never had problems while in battle yeah it s low but 30 50fps is plenty for strategy game it s a decent strategy game far from perfect but still must own for strategy fans there s simply no competition it has a lot of negatives but still is an enjoyable game which offers hundreds of hours of gameplay prosgreat graphicsplenty of choice how to play the gamelots of
