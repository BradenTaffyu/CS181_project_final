this game s launch was a disaster they probably knew the game wasn t ready but they didn t care this game received valid criticism for launching the way it did people made fun of it i made fun of it but something happened the game got better i picked it up and played it for over 700 hours i never thought i d play fallout 76 of all games this much but i did the game has it s issues but it s come a long way since launch it pulled a smaller no man s sky redemption arc and it s really fun there are limitations like inventory size which is not something new older fallout games had them too and the scrapbox size which kinda sucks the point being if you want to have unlimited space you need to buy the fallout 1st subscription which i did for quite some time gameplay wise it s fun it plays like fallout 4 but with something extra it plays like a single player game where you can meet other people it s similar to gta online in that regard you can turn off the pvp and if you re new you probably should despite this game s welcoming and friendly community you ll always find your regular griefers and soyboys there can be no online community without them you have loads of builds to make tons of events all around the map some smaller ones where you can solo some require a few people and usually people show up to do them so you won t really be alone there are some more difficult ones where you really need people like the scorchbeast queen event but people will always show up for that one most of the time anyway and you also have dungeons but they re called daily ops in 76 and they re fun and fast the battlepass system is free for everyone you can buy levels with their premium currency but seasons are usually about 3 months and you ll finish them by playing casually so there s really no need to waste your atoms on that the people that have subscriptions will get some exp boosts and a few extra goodies but not something that seems unfair what i loved most about this game is all the cool stuff to collect and build your base with or c a m p i ve seen some really cool camps on the map some people are so talented and good at base building some look like actual houses there was even a spooky house i found once really cool you can experiment with different weapon builds i tried a few myself there is obviously a meta and that s okay you really don t have to bother with it but that s up to each and every person the game is fun it s in a really good state and despite the fact that i m no longer playing it that doesn t mean i don t think about hoping in and doing some daily ops and some events around the map if you re a fallout fan and played other fallout games you should give this game a chance it s fairly often on sale you won t regret it i know i didn t
