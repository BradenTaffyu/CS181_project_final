2016 early access review so i ve never written a review before but i love this game so here it goes slime rancher is basically a game where you can capture these creatures called slimes and farm them and make money off of their plorts they poop out after you feed them i ve had this game for a couple days and i ve only played it 9 hours but i cannot get enough of this cool game the adorable and fun style of this game is what first attracted me to the game the slimes are all clever and so cute too while the gameplay is fun and will keep you busy for awhile the game is still pretty short you can t really finish the game but i ve done quite a bit in my hours of playing but seeing that this is more of an earlier development and while exploring the game you can see sections that aren t finished yet there might be more someday i hope to see more of this game because it s simple and entertaining and i just love this game hope this review helps
