one of my favorites stardew valley how do i sum up one of my favorite games of all time one of the first co ops i played with my girlfriend now wife and one that gave us so many good memories that its theme played as our wedding song the story is simple to get away from the hustle and bustle of life in the big city you move to your late grandfather s farm in pelican town stardew valley however after many years with no one there the farm is in disrepair and it s your job to rebuild it into a homestead your old grandpa would be proud of at first glance stardew valley looks like the quintessential farming sim with the story and mechanics modeled after the legendary harvest moon but it is so much more aside from tending to crops and animals you can forage fish mine fight monsters explore and interact with the citizens of pelican town eventually you can visit and explore several exotic locations outside pelican town each with unique puzzles secrets and npcs it s truly crazy just how much there is to do in this game and the best part is you can do any of these things in any order you want or none at all ultimately it s up to you to decide what you want to do and how you want the game to progress the game manages to strike that perfect balance of giving you just enough structure so you re not running around like a headless chicken but are also not being hand held the entire time the presentation is quite frankly delightful the pixel graphics character portraits and soundtrack all work together to build a supremely cozy and relaxing vibe the writing is surprisingly deep for this type of game touching on some pretty dark themes without coming off as tasteless of course not everything is perfect the constant lack of energy in the early stages before you have a few tool upgrades under your belt can be pretty frustrating the hard cap where your character passes out at 2am feels like your mom calling you in because it s past your bedtime and for veteran players like me who are returning after a major update to check out all the new stuff it can be a bit of a slog to go through the base game content again in a new playthrough but all of these are minor gripes especially when you consider that almost everything was made by one person what eric barone did here truly boggles the mind the real magic of stardew valley is that at least for me every time i start another playthrough it feels like coming home and i can think of no higher praise to give
