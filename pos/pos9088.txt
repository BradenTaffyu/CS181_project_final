2019 base game review yes the base game alone is well worth purchasing and playing i have experienced much enjoyment with single player gaming i like the micro managing or at least the perception of it that i can look down to the individual population level and confirm what their stats are what faction they support how happy they are how productive how adapted to the planet they re currently on etc the combat plays out better than paradox s europa games because there is the sense of action with the ships flying and visual attrition noticed and you can click retreat if you must or press the attack onward the economic system in itself is a game within the game and some may get lost in that while attempting to be completely peaceful and simply work tech your way to the top and yes some aspects and technicalities in the game still need some improvement but paradox is the ever coding force that pays for it with many dlc releases i know there are debates about paradox s strategy with dlcs but for now i like the continual work toward improving a game rather than putting it for sale and never touching it again and that takes some funding to perpetuate i bought on sale and worth waiting for one
