me writing this review for stardew valley feels pretty redundant as the game is already very well known and has overwhelmingly positive reviews but this game is genuinely great and worth picking up both for playing solo but also for playing together in any of your preferred co op ways you re 100 going to get your money s worth with this game it s a very nice and relaxing experience it s such a chill game yeah it can be pretty grindy especially very grindy if you wish to go for full achievement game completion but you don t have to focus purely on the grind you can also talk to the villagers if that s more your type of thing you can choose to focus on decorating your farm instead of grinding too for example or collecting animals dmost awesome of it all this game has been made by just 1 person definitely worth giving it a try
