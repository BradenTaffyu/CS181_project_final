2014 i m a truck driver in real life this is the best truck simulator i ve seen now if the developers could add some bridges and other obstacles too low or narrow for the trucks to pass narrower twisty and bumpy roads with heavy climbs and slippery surfaces snowchains risk of flat tires destinations which are extremely hard to locate deliveries fitted with the wrong address more paperwork dirt and carwash and the risk of delivering the wrong goods or wrong amount at the wrong place this would be an even better simulation of a trucker s everyday life but seriously this is the truck driving simulator if you ever wanted to see what it feels like driving a truck around this is probably as close as you can get without actually doing it however a major difference between this game and driving a truck around in real life is the level of comfort and relaxation driving a truck in real life will make you tense whereas this game is weirdly relaxing the sim is good looking and well made i never regret for a second spending a few bucks on this game
