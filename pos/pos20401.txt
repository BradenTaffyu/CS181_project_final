2022 early access review been playing this since beta back in may if you are into card games definitely check this out gameplay is fast and quite fun deckbuilding is fun but also not so convoluted you need entire spreadsheets monetization is fair imo some cosmetics are more expensive than others but they are just cosmetics so and the battle passes have been worth 10 a month def recommend this one
