2022 if you kept up with yugioh after all these years you will find this to be a great game if you re looking for an alternative to hs this isn t it you will find people doing 50 card combos on you during turn 1 spending 5 minutes setting up their board the timer seems to never run out either it s kind of meaningless i feel the solo part of the game is nice and teaches you some combos and decks you receive a lot of the pay currency doing the solo stuff which is nice as well all in all the game is nice but quite hard to get into the competitive side 6 10
