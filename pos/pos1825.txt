2021 i just love it tl dr the difficulty is nice the combat the movement is crazy and feels soooo good i have never enjoyed a game that much in terms of fluid really feeling liquid movement everything can be canceled or enhanced depending on the way you play it there is no sole solution to any boss or problem no specific mechanic but skill the story is awesome long version you need some time to get into the movesets that is certain every weapon behaves different depending on where you wield it heavy or light attack as in main and offhand and thus there are several combos to them you get no real hint about this but you will figure this out fast the movement is where this game gets to it it feels fluid intuitive and has literally no restrictions you can dodge anything have time slowing framedodges nice animations countermoves and such it really is lovely designed you can play a total of 3 different characters depending on story progress if you finish the game a new path will open and you can replay the story again from a different angle but not only this you also get to a point beyond the first playthrough this game has more than one ending and you should alteast play 3 endings a b c normally also d which can be quickly archieved after the first and second dont worry the characters have deep development and a very nice background for what they are doing main reasons for it is the story the gameplay itself is really good in my opinion but not the main point of this game you should get a hang on the get go while playing another big thing the combo gameplay is near infinite the better you play the more chances you get to do so it feels so rewarding the graphics well they are old automata is not your new 2021 aaa title but they are fine if you consider how old this game basically is there is a mod called far fix automata resolutions which helps i never used mods in my life also installed it graphics get a little better without any fps drops lag or bugs into it also directors confirmed there will be a patch for a graphics overhaul upcoming soon summer 2021 to date that will most likely make it look better try and enjoy and more over glory to mankind
