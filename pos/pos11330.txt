early access review this is a perfect example of that type of game that you play once with your friends every 6 12 months for a week or two religiously for 10 years straight all nighters showing up to work class sleep deprived all because it is ridiculously fun and you and all your friends do not want to stop freshened with new game changing updates every now and then you always have something to come back to there is an undoubted jankiness to the game to me it just adds to some of the charm the gameplay makes you forget about the dated graphics but the fun pimps have done several graphical improvements with more on the way while the focus remains on keeping the gameplay great 7 days to die is simply a very fun game and 10000 worth the purchase if you haven t tried it already
