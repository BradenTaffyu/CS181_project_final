2017 ac ffb vr amazing racing experience i don t play online but have very much enjoyed career mode the challenges and competing against hot lap times dlc may seem pricey at first but really aren t if you play this as a simulator where you can spend 20 hours trying to get to know a specific car or track it s about racing and driving not car collecting no unlocks possibly too dry of an experience for some but great with the right setup for those who enjoy driving happy racing
