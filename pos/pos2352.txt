2020 i played the game at launch didnt enjoy it for a myriad of reasons i heard it was coming to steam with the wastelanders update figured i d install it as a meme and talk about it on stream about how bad it still was was very surprised the wastelanders update is seriously fun and turns the game into what we expect from a fallout game npc interaction storyline choices special stat checks combat alot of easter eggs alot of exploration and all of that combined together into an online environment with other people if you re looking to play this game alone or in a group this game caters to both audiences whether you want a full immersive experience or perhaps you choose to play with friends and stomp the wastelands lootin and shootin this game caters to all there are still some issues within the game however which i feel should not really have been the route taken namely the limited stash and the introduction of the unlimited resource bin via the fallout 1st subscription service i feel like it would be a lot more fair and most likely more lucrative for the masses for the unlimited resource bin was a 1 time purchase and instead have some other feature for fallout 1st regardless i 100 recommend checking out fallout 76 you d be pleasantly surprised
