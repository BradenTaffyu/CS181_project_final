about graphics aren t realistic but you ll enjoy it you ll enjoy every single view like sunset and morning view you ll fall love with the sea about in case there s no voice activity so thats hard to tell about sound but the natural sound is great it will randomly play you some music which are great you ll enjoy your time in raft all other sounds like walking weapons sea wave animals etc are great maybe they will add some new music in future or a radio where you can listen to music about so many people doesn t know this game has a story which is not the best but you ll enjoy it very much it s about finding some people they released chapter one where you have to go in 3 different location a lot of traveling and so many task you ll also need some items you have to fight some animals they are planing to release their chapter 2 in summer end i m waiting for it 3 about not the best controlling but you ll get used to it about single player and multiplayer are same but multiplayer are easy where you can do some stuff easily your buddy will always got you back i played raft multiplayer with my two young brother and one elder brother i enjoyed every single second we laughed so much playing it i don t know them in real life but in game i cared for them i cooked for them we hunt together we fished together we traveled together and we build our own base together that s where you ll get the most fun about this is where i don t like this game much it has bad optimization where my pc can run other high graphics game like gta v in 50 fps but this game runs on 30fps in very low setting with low resolutions i know i have a potato pc but still this game need some optimization but i don t blame it cause it s still early access maybe they will fix some problems and optimize this game the best part is this game is still in early access and not yet released fully they will add some more stuff that will make this game more than awesome 3
