2020 excellent game that improves upon civilization 5 in several ways yet misses some opportunities the ui and overworld are more vibrantly detailed whereas the leader animations are accompanied by a lackluster backdrop compared to detailed scenery in civilization v the science tree culture tree and civic cards are a vast improvement upon the previous installment and allow more flexibility for players to accompany the more volatile environmental changes tile placement vastly surpasses the previous installment the only drawback to the improvements of making tile placement more consequential is the lack of opportunity to build tall this could easily be resolved by allowing additional layers of tiles over a city when certain conditions techs or cultural tenants are met though i do like that expansion is actually encouraged in civilization vi which makes for a more enjoyable experience where conversely building tall was more encouraged and expanding was penalized the music has been completely overhauled from previous installment the music sets the world stage that better engages the player as they take one more turn aside from the lack of ability to build tall the only other issue this museum theming mechanic other than that and the background of the civilization leader animations all other aspects are vastly improved upgrade to civ vi if you haven t had the change to play or give it another chance if you could not get over some of the major changes to play style favoring expansionism over building tall
