2023 i played fallout 4 after recently replaying new vegas and it made me feel the same way i felt when i replayed skyrim after playing morrowind everything looks and feels so much better yet the shallowness of the whole experience leaves this game as just a good game when it easily could ve been a masterpiece they do a very poor job of making you care for the characters factions or their ideals and the simplification of the most integral part of fallout games the dialogue doesn t help with that either bethesda should ve just given the engine to obsidian like they did with new vegas and let them show bethesda how to make a good game out of it sadly they insist on running the fallout name to the ground like they will also do with the elder scrolls
