2021 early access review i ve owned project zomboid for a long time since well before the steam days and i ve played a lot of different versions one thing that is hard to overlook is just how much the game has changed over the years going from a sprite based arcadey isometric demo with minimal base building elements to a meticulously simulated survival rpg the developers at the indie stone seem more willing than most to scrap old ideas and add content to the game which is now about ten years old continuing to refine it while working toward an ambitious end creating the ultimate zombie survival rpg in a lot of ways zomboid succeeds the mechanics of the game are where the meat is as it is not really a story game at least not in its current state here you have weather and skin temperature systems character fitness injuries and healing car mechanics farming and foraging crafting fire spread etc then there s the main danger zombies and zombie hordes which migrate around the map depending on your actions and sometimes at the hands of a rather cruel ai director which can be disabled in sandbox mode if one so chooses various weapons can be found and crafted to help you clear them out from areas of the map but because of how zombies spawn and migrate also among the settings which can be changed this is mostly a temporary fix to a persistent threat it s good fun one criticism i might offer is that i m not a fan of the way the game is balanced because the slow stupid zombies wouldn t be much of a threat on their own the game has ways of forcing you into dangerous situations things like aggressive hunger and thirst a boredom mechanic that requires you to step outside chances to trip while vaulting objects or receive gashes while parting trees depressed mood from eating stale fruit etc this certainly prevents the game from becoming too easy but on the other hand adds what i view as a lot of irritating burdens that detract from the fantasy of being a rough and tough survivor instead making your character seem excessively needy clumsy and incompetent this can be tweaked to some extent in sandbox mode though much of it seems largely unavoidable though it reduces the challenge considerably increasing the day length to two hours improves the pace of the game greatly in my experience at least in single player mode and since one bite is all it takes there will always be danger all in all project zomboid is an exciting game that s steadily evolving as it continues to get player feedback fixes and updates new content to add variety to the core loop modding and map editing tools i can see this game really living up to its ambition of being the ultimate zombie survival rpg in its current state it can be a blast if you can put up with some occasional frustration it s well worth the price considering the hours of content that s already here
