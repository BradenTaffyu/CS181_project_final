2020 early access review if you re even remotely interested in caves of qud based on its appearance but don t think that you can handle the supposed difficulty don t worry about it and pick it up the game gives you options to play with saves or to simply be immortal and experience the world so there is no barrier to seeing everything the game has to offer although the dying is fun that s a feature that everyone embarking on a project of this nature should include just for accessibility purposes so bravo to the point though this game is so much more than most roguelikes ever even aspire to be much less achieve much has been said in other reviews about the procgen history the potential for this game to tell you a story that is fascinating silly grim or a combination of all three or of the excellent replayability the music the list goes on i m going to sort of skip over that because i d just be repeating what s been already said likely better the truth about caves of qud is that it offers a chance to experience a world that is totally original and unexpected yet poignantly familiar it s the fate of a world whose so called great civilizations have long since collapsed whose technology is so foreign that the most mundane object appears as mythical it s a world that can be unflinchingly brutal but in its moments of reprieve feels more tender and personable than our own a world where the oddest creatures even a mushroom can lift its lid up towards you share in a drink of water and gossip with you where the outside world and the even larger one underneath is hell yet the sleepy town of joppa and its kind inhabitants remain an ever present reminder that life finds a way and in a way the life of those villagers pale in comparison to our own as a part of a world where the western spirit rages against nature and civilization rushes towards its logical endpoint of total ecological destruction caves of qud is a comforting reminder that in the end all of the misery and death and destruction may amount to nothing but vague stories and the occasional inscrutable artifact a box of crayons here a lawn chair there in an otherwise totally unrecognizable but reborn world i m terrible at caves of qud i could be pretty good at it but i m too impatient i ve never made it out of bethesda susa alive i haven t explored half of the territory on the world map much less delved deep into the terrifying underground that has not been a barrier to my enjoyment at all though this game is probably the most unique game in my entire library and it s definitely the most special roguelike i have ever played and i ve played so many if anything i ve said is resonated at all you owe it to yourself to give it a try
