2020 product received for free sweetheart is my wife now that its been a few days i can give a more in depth review art 10 10 everything is completely hand drawn and animated with a few frames toting unique portraits for each emotion for characters and for bosses enemies alike the colors and sprite work can pull you into the dream like state of the world music 10 10with over 150 tracks there is sure to be a song that you can t help but bop to my favorite being an optional side boss you can fight past day 2 combat 7 10the combat gets really deep further into the game when you finally have access to multiple mood changers stat changers and damage skills one of my favorite end game combos i managed to deal 6 5k damage in a single hit however at the start of the game there s a lot of info dumped on you with very little in the ways of telling you how to utilize it it introduces emotions on enemies but doesn t really give you any skills at the time to take advantage of the emotion system moving attacks are essential for beating the end game in minimal turns just remember hash happy angry sad happy if you find yourself struggling combat can go pretty slow too with the animations and dialogue but the art and music help make it not as painful sometimes exploration 8 10map layouts are fairly straight forward and linear but there are multiple points where they tuck away a hidden path that you have to bash your head into the wall to hope to find and even a hidden path that you can t find without pressing z with no indication there could be a path there story 10 10 the startup is slow you re being told a lot of info while gaining barely any knowledge at all it can be frustrating and confusing but as you persist things will begin to unfold and whether you like it or not they ll keep unfolding as you play i don t want to go too in depth on describing the story because its the whole reason to really dig into this game but if its any consolation it ended up tugging my heartstrings a lot and i even cried at the end if you re exploring everything interreacting with objects talking to everyone this game will probably take you a good 30 hours on your first playthrough sweetheart 10 10 ohohohohohoho
