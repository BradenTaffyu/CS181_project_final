2023 my friend and have been playing for 20 hours in co op mode and the most terrifying fight we have yet encountered is not the worm servants of the void or the numerous bandits and sundry critters wandering the lands between towns it wasn t even the religious fanatics that want to suck our souls out no the most terrifying fight was a dog we found it in a graveyard and it threatened to kill us foolish pup we have slain powerful wizards and enormous worms what could you do well it killed our tank in 1 round and then summoned an army of undead to wipe the rest of us out a necromancer dog not a necromancer that became a dog a necromancer dog 10 10
