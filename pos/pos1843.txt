2017 stick with this game the first hour can be a bit trying and almost caused me to stop playing no save states deaths caused by lack of control precision however once you get past the hour opening stage the game opens up to be one of the best rpg experiences i ve played in some time the story unfolds gradually in the 30 40 hours required to fully finish the game and is beautiful as it is haunting i am so glad i stuck with it at the point of writing play this game in windowed mode with any 3rd party windowed full frame application like embiggen for windows fullscreen can give terrible control lag etc expect patches
