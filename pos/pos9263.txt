2020 it s an okay x4 game but pretty boring and slow paced compared to some other space x4 games the game starts out well and expanding your empire and getting knowledge about ancient alien civs is fun but not much is happening after that basically if you do decent with researching tech and keeping up a decent military fleet the ai civs don t do anything the ai will interact with text dialogs and be hostile they even make claims on your territory but they don t actually invade or attack at all in the vanilla base game the base game is content rich enough for a playthrough but looking at the amount of dlc s i feel like i am missing out on more game depth and more gameplay variation looking at the dlc prices i am not very eager to buy them instead i think i will just go play galactic civilizations again after i am done with the playthrough in this game edit this game is unplayable on large maps the performance late game is just shockingly bad the game runs in slow motion and it almost impossible to finish the game
