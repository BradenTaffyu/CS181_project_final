2016 it is hard to tell that this game is in early access because there is already so much content and it is so much fun the firefly aesthetic is simply brilliant the music is cool and the game play is so addictive as i play the game i frequently find that i have difficulty in finding a good point to stop playing i m always thinking to myself just one more day after 100 hours i still feel like i am learning the game and haven t experienced everything just to remind you this game is supposed to be early access and in alpha rimworld has various ways to customise the difficulty which i really appreciate so you can set the level of challenge that suits you by adjusting the ai storyteller personalities and the difficulty setting you can take your pick from relaxing base building game to super hard permadeath experience and indeed anything in between it is worth noting that the game is absolutely ruthless in higher difficulties so if you are looking for a challenge then you will find it here the major strength of rimworld is that it creates awesome stories and addictive game play that will keep you coming back for more and more i can t recommend it enough
