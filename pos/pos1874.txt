2021 one of the best single player story mmos out there fyi this is a review from a mostly solo player viewpoint i ve been playing this game very on and off since day 1 so i ve seen how it s changed and progressed over the years unlike other mmos this one has only gotten better with age there is literally hundreds of hours of single player story content with solo dungeons and raids for you to do in case you re like me and enjoy playing solo if you re like me and stopped playing wow bc of various reasons i can recommend this game very much combat is your standard tab target mmo but there is an emphasis on player control by that i mean you can have a handful of companions that join you and be your tank dps or heals you also can heal yourself at any time which makes solo content fun i m still shocked at how all the non force classes play so well and fit into this sw story so well i personally like the smuggler and bounty hunter classes the most you get your own ship base and crew that you can deck out how you like the story is the best part of this game you have 8 classes 4 republic 4 empire and all have their own 20 to 30 hour story depending on how much side content you do choices matter and can affect the game in smaller ways the game makes you feel like you re the champion of each class you start small then get bigger and bigger in the story if you re wanting kotor 3 then this is what you need to play the story is a sequel to kotor 2 loosely so you ll see certain characters reappearing or being mentioned the game is f2p but you re very limited with what you can do if you don t pay others have said this but it s best to sub for just 1 month and then you get put on a preferred status even if you aren t paying anymore so you still have access to certain features that f2p never subbed can t use the cartel market is their cash shop but there s no p2w features it s almost all cosmetics mounts boosters but all of these can be still purchased in the in game trade market for high prices but it s up to you the game is also new player friendly with giving you a lot of early tutorials and goodies to show off what you can do right now and at higher levels over all i think in 2021 swtor is up there with ff14 in terms of single player content i don t do any pvp or hardcore raiding so i can t comment on that part if you re jonesing for kotor 3 realistically you re never going to get it but this game is about as close to it as we ll ever see just do like me and play it solo and just pretend the other players aren t there
