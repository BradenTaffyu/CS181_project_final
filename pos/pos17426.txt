2021 i d say this is the best total war game to date yet for a more historical title im not into the fantasy option they give you but records mode handles that important positive changes diplomacy system is amazing ca outdid themselves this time for once the ai diplomacy algorithm is fined tuned instead of just rejecting my trade agreement just cause battle ai is semi competent knows to hold a battle line and flank properly understands how to use unit abilities properly choice between romance version and records with romance being a more warhammer experience but records being a tradition tw experience reform tech tree system a refreshing change you get a new tech reform every 5 turns general units have 5 different types meant for different roles commander vanguard strategist champion and sentinel each role is specific some more combat oriented than others each role has a main stat the five stats are expertise resolve cunning instinct and authority every general has all 5 stats but usually specializing in two stats each stat gives bonuses to your general s combat abilities as well as army buffs every unit has a role some units are anti armor some cavalry are specifically anti cav units thus don t place a importance on unit tier so much as utilityimportant negative changes battle ai s siege attacking is horrible besides rudimentary flanking maneuvers ai throws its units into the meat grinder other than loose formation and wedge formation the ai doesn t use infantry formationsarmy formations and flaming arrows should ve been a tech reform not something based off a general s cunning stat playing romance version slightly more difficult and confusing as i cannot judge how handily i will beat someone in a duel even though it says their strength compared to mine is negligible seriously how did they beat me if their strength is negligible to mine score 8 10great game my favorite so far beside some weird design decisions and slight ai incompentencies this is must have in the tw series
