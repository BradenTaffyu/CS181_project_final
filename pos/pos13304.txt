2015 in my steam library there are about a half dozen games that are in a special category called all time greats civ iv is there skyrim is in there ksp is in there note my play time does not include the 50 100 hours i put in before the game was ever on steam simply one of the best products in the last decade ksp is not your typical game it s a software toy you tinker you experiment you adjust you tweak and you have a grand time doing it ksp is not a game that is going to hold your hand and help you build a super deluxe space rocket that can go to the mun or eve with ease if it did that ksp would not be any fun besides if someone wants that buzz aldrin s space race is available for sale on steam instead you get better at the game you develop an understanding of newtonian physics more than you ever thought you would you build massive rockets and undertake interesting expeditions you ll grin the first time you get a rocket into orbit you ll pump your fist when you land on the mun for the first time and you ll continue having fun what are you waiting for go buy it
