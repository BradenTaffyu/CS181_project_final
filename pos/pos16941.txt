2021 this game is great and it s great playing it in multiplayer mode with my girlfriend i heavily recommend it it s funny silly engaging and it s pure strategy its model of mutation may not be realistic but its model of transmission sure is and the game s creator has been called in to speak at the cdc about how it functions as a rudimentary educational tool the gameplay is fun on its own but it s so interesting to conceptualize what you re doing to the world give it a play
