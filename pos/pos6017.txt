product received for free i picked this game up for free in a christmas sale and it s aight the biggest problem with it is that if you want all the dlc it s gonna run you a total of 1200 and rising because new dlc are constantly coming out and usually they re either 10 for stuff in build mode or upwards of 30 40 for content packs with new jobs building locations etc if you want my advice download mods off of nexus instead of dlc they re free and give you individual stuff rather than whole packs of dlc be warned though a lot of the mods on nexus are 18 so if you don t wanna see that stuff then probably don t visit the website overall if you re the kind of person to be patient and you don t want to play with every dlc a game has then yeah the sims 4 is a great game wait for dlc to go on sale sometimes for free and download them then however if you want to play a game with everything it has to offer then this one isn t a keeper as downloading all the dlc would take days let alone the 1200 price tag
