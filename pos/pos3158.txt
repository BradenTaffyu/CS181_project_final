2017 divinity original sin 2 improves on almost everything gameplay wise from the first game no longer do you have to deal with unfair elemental damage and debuffs that one shot you instead there s a new armour system that blocks this kind of damage more reliably both physical and magical this new system makes it so you manipulate the battlefield to your advantage more so than just spamming out cc spells on the enemies combat is a lot smoother as they are both extremely aggressive but at the same time tactical as you aim your attacks with the new armour system you will rely more on throwables and the environment to lower the opponents armour so that you can start controlling them with stuns or burning them a new addition are dialogue checks which are similar to the checks present in old isometric fallout games where your statistics determine your ability to have a successful persuasion chance be careful who you use to talk to certain npcs as now the checks are decided by your main stats and not only your persuasion stat now the game is out of early access i really have to commend larian for creating a fantastic game they changed a few of the early fights so that they aren t too broken but at the same time switching it up enough to still make it challengeing the new additions of polymorph skills and generous placement of source as well as tons of crafting recipes really shows larian s commitment to making an amazing game never before have i marveled at the magnificence and brilliance of an rpg as much as divinity original sin 2 the freedom progression story and overall game mechanics makes this one of the best games i ve ever played
