2016 early access review i ve played this game for some time and i have to tell you you get what you paid for the game is not some epitome of well madeness but it will keep you entertained for a while pros not too easy neither too hard to progress in the beggining it s easy to get started but the starting stuff is not all that useful big maps and a decent excuse for their limits i only found a limit that you could walk past but then you d die with radiation nice control crafting zombies are slow enough so that you can hit them and retreat before they hit you the game marks the place you last died on the map so that you can get your items back additionally if you die it s not difficult at all to get new basic tools clothes weapons should you die too far from the respawn when you crouch you can see wether you have been detected or not by zombies the game is very realistic almost anything can be used as a weapon there are daily can be changed airdrops with useful stuff the game really puts you in control of the stuff you need to be in control while not letting you change at all the things you shouldn t have the ability to cons maybe this was my pc the game is visually monochromatic and you will get bored after a while the single player mode gets tiring after a while zombies are really strong and will break even forged steel in one night making it very hard to properly build your base and be safe zombies are also tough so hitting them on the head with an arrow does not kill them there are very few weapons in game but it s still early access some items are very fragile a wooden club the basic blunt weapon will break after 20 hits or so the temperature seems a little over the top to me if you wear too much on a hot area or too little on a cold area you get penalties neutral creative mode access to all items can make the game a little too easy but it s fun to test and you can disable it if you like there s the option to loose your whole backpack or just your toolbelt upon death this is not your usual hack n slash game and if you don t time aim your attacks you will get hit by zombies they have put some real effort on the realism part to the point where carrying raw meat attracts zombies some tips try and find one of those old decrepit houses to make your base it s easier to fix them than to create one from the ground also when you do find one make sure you build a second floor that can only be accessed via ladders this will protect you even if zombies break through your walls as the vast majority of zombies cannot climb ladders avoid going out at night until you have a mining helmet a nightvision goggle or a gun with a flashlight because the torch is really weak as a weapon and you won t see a thing without a source of light gather as much wood as you can during the day and make spikes around your base this will cripple most zombies making it easier for you to kill them make sure to get a lot of iron can be mined from rocks too as you will need it to make your walls be even worth something if there s ever a horde chasing you don t forget to hunt animals the give you animal hide animal fat meat and bones and all four are very useful search everything and anything that is searchable if you kill a zombie loot the body and the destroy it to get the bones waste is not something that this game forgives remeber to leave stuff at your base before venturing off scavenging your inventory is limited and you will run out of space quickly even you don t have anything on your backpack upon leaving your base always carry a source of light with you sometimes there s not ime to make it home and you definitely don t want to get caught outside without light also try and fortify a house that s close to the white river trader if you re playing online that s where most of the player on player transactions will occur too since it s the first place where you can find a machine to put things for sale try and get a lot of wood and make several 50 clubs this will level up your ability to craft weapons and let you make a better bow arrows work too but they are slower for this purpose edit aparently alpha 16 changed the level up system a bit so your first items are better than before but it takes longer fo you to level up edit it s been a while since i ve played college really sucked my life for a while but the game eventually gets really repetitive i wish they d add a story or at least some npcs where you can trade stuff you can feel really lonely if you play single and to me it doesn t make any sense that in a map this big there are no other people alive ever but maybe it s just that i haven t found them yet edit 2 ok so i downloaded it again and it actually has traders now score for the devs it still feels sort of lonely to play solo unlike other games in the zombie genre but it s definitely much more playable now that traders exist edit 3 new update removed the items that smell feature which i had listed as neutral i personally enjoyed that feature but many people liked the fact that it was removed and i can definitely understand why still not many weapons ingame but it s slowly becoming nicer and nicer to play edit 4 it s been 7 years and they re still giving us updates this is like the best support i ve ever seen for a game that has no microtransactions whatsoever
