2020 early access review the developement is slow as hell but this game is a true work of passion one of the best survival game of the generation sadly because of it s snail paced developpement it will probably never receive the glory it deserves it offers no solid ground for a player base to maintain itself my fun in this game is dependant on the update schedule of two modders who also have a job on their own it kinda sucks knowing that after 3 years owning this game vanilla still feels incomplete shootout to the makers of superb survivors and hydrocraft though i understand that reworking the engine entirely is an huge undertaking but we ve been waiting for a stable beta build for nearly 2 years the concept is visionary when you think that they started all this in 2012 even before that survival game fad that is now looooooong gone all in all if you re looking to play a highly polished and realistic zombie survival game this is for you if you wan t to play it in multiplayer wait for the release of build 41 that we ve all been waiting for the past 2 years and if you re reading this after october 2021 and there is still no trace of npcs don t even bother update i ve made a comeback after multiplayer build 41 and i ve fallen into the pz pit again even though there s no npcs in view as of now the update is sufficient to make some old and new players to come back i can say it has regain most of it s appeal as i m exploring the multiplayer side as a 2 0 kind of thing the community is simply awesome at least on the server i m playing on contrary to mainstream survival games like rust people are not total selfish makes it fun to actually unwind on the game not having to log in 2 times a day just to see if i ve been griefed on a pve server update 2 with the hints we ve received recently it seems that npcs might be coming up for build 42 we don t know how long it will take until this future build release and frankly i don t really care anymore as i ve lost interest in the game for the moment it s still a game i comeback to every once in a while but i know that if build 42 realeases with npcs i might get addicted again and double my playtime
