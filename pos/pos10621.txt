2020 i will be writing a detailed review my subjective opinion of the game and what you should expect keep in mind i am 13 years old i got this game in august and it is an amazing game for me totally worth 40 bucks it is a very very complicated game and not suggested for everybody although it is very fun you can play the game from any angle use commands and enhance your experience and utilize the assistance of mods to not just experience ww2 but other historical events or to just enhance gameplay in general you are in control of pretty much every aspect and the mechanics are hard to master but easy to learn absolutely great game as you go along towards mastery you will gain a lot of fun out of the game start your own empire if you wish reform a historical empire or go a completely new path such as britain being fascist and teaming with hitler you d think a 13 year old would have immense trouble learning the game i love history and this game was relatively easy to learn to learn the game you should watch youtube tutorials on various aspects this game isn t for everybody and i highly reccomend watching gameplay videos to see if the game interests you enough to buy it my rating is its an amazing game and lots of fun for me i d suggest this game for others for sure although it isn t for everybody another thing is i literally begged my parents for the game convinced them and then was able to tell them every single bit about ww1 hahaha
