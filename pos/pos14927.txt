2021 early access review so i got notified that this game is on sale right now from my wish list i forgot about it for a long ass time but looked up some videos and remembered it slightly thought i d give it a shot since i had the money and it looked like my kinda game and i was not disappointed disclaimer it s pretty intensive so you ll want at least a decent pc but the game itself auto turns on vsync since they say it s best for performance and i mean yeah tl dr it s a fun as all hell destruction sandbox where about 70 of the terrain e g cars boats buildings trains and cranes can be destroyed and ripped apart with the multitude of weapons you can get from the base game to simple modding with the steam workshop now for the non lazy onto why you should sell your kidneyit is the funnest game i ve played in a good while the entire game is a physics sim where you own a demolition business all of the cars boats and are able to be destroyed and so is a lot of the terrain every building can also be destroyed you get loads of tools from rocket launchers to a blowtorch to a sledgehammer plus it also has a steam workshop with anything from a portal gun to a lightsaber to a mini gun to a nuke launcher to an air strike and even a jet pack there s a campaign where you can follow the amusing ass story from deadly robots where you escape a secret robotics testing bunker to racing to destroying buildings to theft all with loads of interesting challenges for you to find your way around like the aforementioned guard robots to alarms on items you need to steal to fire alarms which require you to not let fires out of control or you ll be caught if all that for the price of 14 right now on sale can t convince you then i don t know what will
