2021 i am the opposite of a truck driver i can barely park my prius straight before i enter my office in the morning but thanks to this immersive little diddy i can experience the open road in a huge ass big rig i still can t park but accidentally backing into cars is actually kinda fun in a huge mack truck who knew the little details of the game those little details that may not be necessary on a developer like ea s money grubbing watch are apparent here those little details are the secret code for immersion this game is a labor of love for the devs that is apparent now i m gonna stop writing this review and go take out some stop signs
