2021 okay lets get the most important thing said first i really like this game but despite that i will try to write as unbiased and honest review of the game that i can first off i have to say that the game very much looks amazing and the apex avalanche open world engine does really perform with those beautiful scenic views glancing the landscape off of an high mountain the animals for the most part behave quite well and most times realistically so in the game the animals have different levels which determine the scoring of the animal i will explain the scoring a bit later and also if the animal is very high level their ai will be smarter and it will be able to sense you more easily and be more evasive which i really like because when you see your fist level 9 legendary animal they will be more difficult to take down so yes the game has a scoring system where when you shoot the animal it will have a trophy rating which determines the rating of the animal and the ratings are none bronze silver gold and diamond so basically the rating is decided with different factors like the level of the animal if you shot it with the right caliber and if you shot it into a vital body part so basically the higher the animals rating is the rarer it is and this leads me to a part of the community that i don t personally enjoy on my personal experience much of the community does farming to get the higher rated animals especially the diamonds now i don t despise these people but to me it really ruins the game and the feel in it now i know some people will be saying that it is a hunting game so of course you want to get the highest scoring animal possible but to me it will always be so much better to stumble on the diamond animals while just wandering the wilds and just fast traveling and killing other animals to get the diamond rare fur ones one thing i need to talk about are the dlc s the game has many dlc s ranging from the big reserves to the gun packs to atv s but the main thing is that you can play multiplayer on any of the reserves although some of the maps don t have that much players and also the atv s if the person running the multiplayer session has them and has allowed them in the server but you can t use all the guns if you don t own the dlc s which they came in my main point being that if you don t mind playing with other people who most of the time don t care about you really shouldn t buy the reserves because the only thing you are missing then are the stories which can be played in singleplayer but lets be real we really are not playing the game for story missions and they are not that super great either the maps cost the most money so your e just better off putting your money into the guns or not putting your money in at all one last thing i have to tell about are the bugs they used to be really common and pretty bad sometimes but nowdays the situation has gotten much better and the devs seem to care about the game and also they do many livestreams and updates on their youtube channel all in all the game is on my opinion great it looks amazing the kills feel rewarding and the different animals are really cool so if you are looking for a semi realistic hunting game that has good graphics and systems i would recommend this game
