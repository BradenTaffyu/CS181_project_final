2022 i think the game is okay it s tcg ocg yugioh with lots of flair and love into it but there are some downsides i feel people are missing the game is not f2p friendly give it a week and your resources will dry out pretty fast they re doing this to entice you and hook you into the game much like any gacha game really this game is not the classic anime yugioh experience where you set and end your turn it s the yugioh everyone s been playing for years and you aren t yugioh as a game has evolved incredibly and has a steep learning curve i think it s fun but it s worth pointing out game is fresh and will obviously get updates so give it time crafting system is amazing and since it s free it s worth a try
