2015 i will try my best to look at this objectively since everyone else seems to either be 0 10 is crap or 10 10 best game ever like it always is the gunplay is by far the best between the three first person shooter fallouts but that s about the only good thing i can say about it everyone already talked about how poorly the game looks the animations as well as the performance so i won t bother too much with it but i just gotta say that there are dozens of games out there that are much bigger and detailed than this one that manage to run much better on most machines hell just look at all this year s releases if you want proof this just feels like lazy optimization in the developers part the story and characters are mediocre at best with it getting worse as you progress whether you got spoiled or not it also has that god awful speech wheel that is only there because your character is now voiced and they had to limit your freedom on what you could or could not say the special system is now meaningless since upgrading it is a joke unlike literally every game before it where putting a point was a struggle and an achievement at the same time remember going to the bos base in fo1 and getting that machine to give you a point in a stat if you had the right drive for it or that hubologist in san francisco or ncr that had a chance to give you luck or decrease it depending on your luck in fo2 how about 3 and nv where you had to sacrifice a perk to get one stat point up it wasn t as bad as sacrificing a perk in the first 2 games since you got perks every 3 levels but still it was a sacrifice here its just lol put a point more on it skills are not even skills this game was just poor decisions all around also for pc this port hot garbage with the ui taken straight out of the console version don t get me wrong even in the context of a console it looks like a mess but its even worse when you have a pc that could use a more sleeker menu if you really want to play this game and like wasting money like me then wait for ui mods to fix it the main reason i gave this a 6 and not something lower is because shooting stuff and looting stuff while 60s music plays in the background is still fun but honestly there are better options for that everywhere overall the whole time i ve played this game the only thing i could think of is man i really wish i was playing 3 or nv right now
