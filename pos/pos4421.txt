2014 wonderful all be it a bit square sandbox game start your own warband in a medival world and emerge as a glorious leader lord king bandit trader you name it choose your destiny amongst 6 unique factions each of them with their own mentality and troops or assemble a mighty army from all realms be a trader or mercenary to a faction or become vassal to a king or even become a king yourself choices are nigh infinite you can replay this game an infinite amount of times with different settings and it will remain interesting and on top of that you can modify certain aspects of the game or go for one of the many mods out there ranging from all kinds epoches and additions i must admit that m b 1 fares a little better what regards the amount and quality of mods released there are some downers you will experience clipping and other graphic absurdities every now and then it is not perfect the ai is a bit dumb witted at times in terms of field movements and tactical behaviour the latter does not really exist actually it is just troops spawning running towards one another and starting to beat each other up it is up to you to be better than them there is a saying that a lot of good work is lost over the lack of a little more this is found to be true here as the grid for many diplomatic and military game options is actually present it is just not used well by the vanilla game and left for modders to patch up the modders in turn often work on their own vision of how the game should be but then lacking the manpower to achieve their conveyed goals good examples for this might be the sword of damocles series which is wonderful yet stricken with bugs on m b 1 and in a seemingly eternal unfinished we are working on it but play this in the meantime process on m b warband taleworld wanted to encourage modding for this game but failed to provide an easily accessible scripting interface for modders to work with this results in a game that is never 100 satisfying in vanilla and a bunch of mods that aim to provide that satisfaction but fail half way due to lack of manpower nevertheless i must say i enjoy this game tremendously glad i bought it m b package as it offers a completly different feel of gaming compared to most more action oriented games these days no big explosions or noisy shooting and blurred vision and other mess just a nice game with nice and sometimes funny npcs and an eye for the neat things in life as well as a semi realistic view on what life and war in medival ages might have been like 8 10
