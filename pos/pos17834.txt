as a somewhat a coh veteran i ve been playing the franchise since the first one in 2006 i can recommend this game now the first 6 months after release were tough and chaotic but now the overall state of game is fine and it s getting better and better don t believe the doomsayers and other negativity you see and hear balance has been always a problem in this game since initiation of this brand in far 2006 allies infantry blobs german indestructible tanks and etc it s just part of the game asymmetrical balance love it or hate it but that s the way it is but for real the game is in ready for launch state finally as it should have been from the start a year ago but here we are you no longer will experience the horrors of after launch numerous bugs and abilities now working properly definitely give it a try if you were sitting on a bench it s one of the kind rts and there s nothing else on the market with same combination of gameplay graphics and combat dynamics
