2023 i have a suggestion for 1 35 there was a time that christopher columbus wanted ship from ottoman emporer ii beyaz d columbus appealed to the king of portugal in 1484 and asked for a ship to reach the east by sea from the west but was refused he had done extensive research for the voyage he was planning to embark on but could not find a funder on top of that he entered the resin trading business to make a living when he could not find a ruler to finance his expedition in europe he applied to bayezid the second according to rumors he appeared in the presence of a priest accompanied by a priest and asked for ships to be placed under his command in order to discover new countries on behalf of the sultan but bayezid the second rejected the request thinking that the sailor he met was a dreamer i think paradox should add this event as a colonialist path for ottomans in 1 35
