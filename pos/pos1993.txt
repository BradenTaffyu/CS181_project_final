2021 though there is a subscription service make no mistake you don t need to subscribe to access alot of content you can easily play all classes and complete their stories without a subscription and you only need to subscribe if you really want to get into the endgame content and the newer expansions the xp throttle down after level 20 as a non subscriber makes little to no difference imo given all the free xp boosts you re given and the convenient location of side quests that are in the same area as your main quests one thing i dislike would be the amount of content cosmetics designed mostly for the force using classes jedi and sith compared to non force users you don t have to be a force based class to use them but it can feel out of place however i understand that most of the player base play as force users so it makes the most sense for them to cater to the majority the game still gets updates with a new expansion coming in december which is more support than more recent games if you don t like star wars then probably don t touch this game otherwise highly recommended tl dr play this game for the story for free especially if you like star wars or story with that mass effect conversation system 8 10
