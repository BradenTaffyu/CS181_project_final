2023 divinity original sin 2 is a truly exceptional top down rpg not just because of the impeccable quality of its content story characters quests etc but also because it really takes player driven interactivity to the next level and offers a measure of reactivity unheard of in many other examples of the genre see as much as i love the old infinity engine games and the modern rpgs which take inspiration directly from that lineage like the great pillars of eternity 2 there s one thing that s always bothered me about them they re all fairly limited in terms of how you re allowed to interact with the environment they usually offer a trinity of distinct gameplay modes dialogue combat and exploration which are all governed by fairly rigid and often limiting rulesets if the developers haven t explicitly designed a way to do whatever it is you d like to do then you probably can t do it period if you ve ever played a tabletop pen and paper rpg you know what i mean you want to cut down a tree to ford the seemingly impassable river a good game master will allow you to attempt to do that on the fly while video games can t really plan for all the myriad ways in which a player might try to get across that river enter divinity original sin 2 which seems to take inspiration as much from baldur s gate 2 as it does from ultima 7 www gog com which is famously one of the earliest games created with what warren spector and doug church called an immersive simulation mindset for divinity original sin 2 this means that you get a considerable amount of freedom through complex systems of dynamic interaction water spells will leave puddles that can then be electrified or turned into steam by applying a fire effect seemingly unreachable areas can be reached via teleportation spells if you want to pickpocket someone unnoticed just engage them in dialogue then switch to another character and sneak behind them while they re talking there s a door in the way well aside from lockpicking or using a key you can also just burn it down or break it with your weapons you can even move objects around in the game world preparing for fights by placing explosive barrels in an area or strategically placing crates to provide cover for sneaking around in fact the developers have recognized and fully embraced many instances in which you can completely break whatever progression they ve intended for an area at one point early on you have to get to the other side of a chasm which would ordinarily require you to make a detour across the entire map or you could just use a flight spell to get over there immediately the game won t mind there are several examples of scenes in which thinking outside the box and using the systems you re given can lead you to complete quests in unusual ways sometimes allowing you to uncover important late game story information quite early on and while i m not the kind of person who goes around murdering random npcs other players have quickly learned that divinity original sin 2 allows you to kill pretty much any npc in the game even story important ones without breaking the game the plot will just adapt to that character no longer being a part of it yes there are limitations to this interactivity to return to the example i ve used above you still can t just chop down a tree to ford a river divinity original sin 2 doesn t have all the systems it d need to really account for everything a player may want to do but what the game does offer is a bunch of tools and systems to achieve similar results outside the bounds of pre planned interaction prompts which is much more than many other top down rpgs have to offer this huge amount of freedom alone would be enough to turn divinity original sin 2 into an instant classic but larian studios weren t content with just creating a mechanically deep game no they also felt the need to set it in a stunningly beautiful world that adheres to many tropes of the fantasy genre while applying just a little bit of a twist to everything elves that can gain other people s memories from eating their flesh undead player characters that re healed by poison the ability to speak with animals who offer their own quests it really feels like whenever someone on the dev team had an awesome idea they just put it into the game and refined it until it worked perfectly of course if you ve ever spent time as a jetpack wearing dragon in divinity dragon commander you know that s just how larian roll so even if you re like me and you re very bored of the standard tolkien esque fantasy fare at this point this setting will throw you enough curve balls to make it feel quirky and unique whether you re a veteran of top down rpgs or a newcomer to the genre an ultra easy story mode is available btw i think divinity original sin 2 is a must play as it s not just exceptional among its peers but also improves upon the genre in amazing ways as the years since the game s release in 2017 have shown it s perhaps too much to hope that larian s approach to designing rpgs will have a huge impact on the genre as a whole but i guess that just makes this one even more special
