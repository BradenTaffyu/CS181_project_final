product received for free early access review i ve been involved with the development of this this game as a researcher and tester when i heard that a medieval city builder was coming that involved a developer who actually cared about historical accuracy i wanted in ml is a gorgeous game that depicts the middle ages on an authentic level that is rarely seen in gaming or film tv etc almost always the middle ages are dirtier grittier backwards violent etc than they ever were or they add something silly like dragons or other fantasy nonsense which is fine if you re into that sort of thing but i want real history anyway even in this early access state it s already a great game that is a lot of fun i ve put over 230 hours into it and will spend many more and although everyone keeps reminding each other that it is not a war game and battle isn t as big a part of it as some may think i also rather like the battles and think they re impressive exciting and fun but above all this is just a superb city builder that shows us a medieval life that s quite realistic and wonderful to look at but it s also just a better city builder ml has ruined so many other city builders for me that insist on still using grids straight only roads frrreeedom the game has insane graphics superb detail and as i can tell you as someone who has had a peek behind the scenes of the making of the game that has been researched researched and then researched some more if you love medieval history you ll love this game and this is just the beginning more is going to be added i was very excited when i first heard about this game and was not disappointed i love it remember it s early access and will continue to develop improve and have new stuff added to it yet it s already such fun to sink a lot of time into 10 10 would have my village burned down again ps if you think the middle ages were just filth mud backwardsness and no progress read this
