2019 it is hard to review a game like this with only a positive or negative option the game has a lot to like and a lot to dislike bare in mind i m only going to compare it to total war games released before it and ignore the disastrous launch pros graphics are good even for a 2013 game campaign map feels alive and is nice to look at and you can see the upgrades you do to your city soldier animations are very well done its fun to see your troops fight the enemy however this has a downside i will explain later game is pretty balanced no faction is completely broken for example in rome total war barbarian factions were extremely underpowered compared to the rest the family political system adds more depth to the game thankfully it was added after the disastrous launch diplomacy works fine its not great but it is far better than previous total war games unit design is well done seeing your epic spartans fight roman legionaries never gets old walled sieges are fun and could bring many epic moments cons unit cards are terrible pottery drawings are ugly to look at and i know this could have been changed since in empire divided dlc the unit cards actually look good naval battles are not worth the trouble just build a decent navy and autoresolve napoleon and shogun 2 were better agent actions are boring since there are no cutscenes this is a major issue historically important cities don t have walls for example syracuse once you control a decently sized empire instead of dealing with another rival empire equal in strength the game bogs you down with public order issues aside from that you will have an easy time steamrolling everyone this hurts the late game unit collision is bad this is due to the animations it feels like a every man for himself instead of a unit fighting another unit mod support given by ca is laughably bad they are clearly scared of mods ruining their dlc plans they could learn a thing or two from paradox in this regard i am gonna recommend this game because i bought it for 15 with greek city state dlc if i bought it full price i would give it a negative rating wait for a sale if you are interested
