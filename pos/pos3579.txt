2019 i absolutely loved this game it was nice to have a choice when battling monsters unlike so many others games this was the first game i ve seen that allows the player to have so much influence on the game while still having consequences good or bad for their actions another cool thing about this game is that any and every monster or creature you encounter in the game has a personality no matter if you interact with them once or 20 times definitely worth the money and the time
