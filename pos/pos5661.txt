2021 early access review my overall impression is possitive but that doesn t mean there are not a lot of issues with the game game is fun uniqe and has a very well built combat system those are solid wins for the game so it gets a thumbs up sadly after more than a year of early access my expectations are kinda let down needs a lot more features and a good amounth of bug fixes if you like this type of game buy it it has a lot of potential but don t expect a perfect product
