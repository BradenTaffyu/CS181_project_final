this is the best way a developer can remake an old game they hit everything on the nose with quality of life graphics new features and improving old mechanics there re already mods on the market for some classes game modes but its a certainty we will see the classics from og age of mythology this game is not only a wonder nostalgia trip it is a great rts for those who are new to the genre this changes the typical strategy up from age of empires and gives an exciting twist in the end i recommend getting the premium edition or upgrade to it asap for the rest of the original content that we had when aom vanilla was finished lots of servers for multiplayer and the game will run you through a benchmark to ensure your pc meets its standards for online play 10 10 game in my opinion the devs should be praised for knocking this remake out of the park
