2022 i ve played almost every total war title while i didn t play 3k until it was practically done with dlc patches i have come to the conclusion this is the best and most complete total war game the ui is very well thought out thematic and carefully done there isn t excessive bloat and what is there is good city manage is amazing it puts every tw title to shame and really drives home the vibrant ways to have a population thrive and create complex decisions on how you want to build building tall this is my favorite way to playdiplomacy where do i begin allies that treat you like allies you can disband armies and be safe the ai cares about allegiances and pacts amazing simply awesome 10 10 whoever coded these to not be horribly frustrating like how tw titles characters for once a character system that doesn t have tons of skill points for incremental changes or useless abilities i love romance mode and how characters need to actually like each other or you get negative penalties not horribly deep but as deep as i d want it in a total war game this isn t crusader kings and i don t want it to be the battles it unfortunate that most people are not a huge fan of china was a theme but i love the huge unit variety and the execution of the battles it runs fantastic loads quickly and it has all the trappings of a proper tw experience without being bogged down optimization i have a decent computer but i play co op a lot too this game is actually well optimized the file size of the actual game is even tiny compared to some tw titles this game clearly had a lot of love and care and i ve never experienced a crash or wonky bug conclusion for me i wish every tw title can steal gleam learn from the 3k title the settlement construction is a major selling point to me where all the usual tw titles cities are just a background element growing cities is fun managing them making tons of cash i love kong rong s start and forging real allies declaring emperor or helping someone become it s just one of my favorite games i never knew i loved i urge anyone who loves total war to try this title i too did not look at it because i wasn t thrilled about playing china as i assumed i wouldn t get any historical references or mythological it does not matter this game is insanely fun and i d rather see another 3 kingdoms title over any game and i really want medieval total war 3 believe me tldr this game is amazing and i have thousands of yours in total war both historical og steam account hacked and in total warhammer
