finally played it for the first time this year after yearning for more content in il 2 sturmovik dcs and world of warships i love simulators and war thunder fits the bill of a quasi sim really well while not a hardcore simulator war thunder grounds its battles in some real world history your tank feels heavy your plane maneuvers realistically well realistically ish and landing a perfect shot on an enemy is super satisfying war thunder is a free to play blast for casual gamers who love big explosions and thrilling vehicle combat it s easy to pick up offers tons of variety and lets you experience the thrill of historical kind of warfare from multiple perspectives just watch out the free to play grind can be a bit much at times it focuses on air and land warfare unfortunately the naval warfare aspect feels somewhat neglected with less active players wt is very enjoyable regardless of vehicle ranking early to modern less to most powerful but i would recommend purchasing a starter pack from the publisher s website directly to avoid compatibility issues the game runs very well on max details at 4k hitting triple digit fps counts on mid range gpus the choice of servers is restrictive and lack of servers in australia has a negative impact on playability i can wholeheartedly recommend it and caution you to avoid purchasing any additional content except for a starter pack until you re about 100 hours into it and know the mechanics well
