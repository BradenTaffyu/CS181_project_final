2020 great game one of my favorites pros whimsical humor silly illnesses and diseases so nothing feels too real world or serious strategy and resource management how you build and where you place things can affect how well your hospital runs staff traits that allow you to min max or train someone to be more generalized all up to you and what you want entertaining music lots of customization of decorative items lots of variety in the levels giving you different challenges like horde mode wave mode have to unlock new land by doing challenges etc so you get different styles of play so it doesn t get stale good performance no crashes or serious bugs i have notedcons ai can sometimes get a bit stuck example a patient sitting outside a treatment room forever instead of going in to get treated it d be nice to be able to favorite items you use a lot so that they re right there at the top of the list and you don t have to scroll each time you want them patient ai sometimes will not navigate to a bathroom even if one is near resulting in a mess on the floor to clean up could just be a jerk patient i suppose
