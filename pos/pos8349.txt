2020 well this is embarrassing i ve played video games for nearly 40 years now can t believe it s been that long but it happens to the best of us picked up this game and started playing it on a friday night and i kept playing it and kept playing and then the sun came up and i was like well i should just keep going here i think i need more coal and a steam coal thumper and maybe a coal mine but can i keep this generator in overdrive and ok i finally go back to sleep until the next day saturday and i just wanted to check things out again see if i really should have made that last adjustment and well i kept making adjustments until the sun came up on sunday morning i mean holy smokes is this what an addiction looks like the game is simply enthralling good luck if you get this game say goodbye to everything you love for a while
