2017 hello everyone so to start this off i love this game it is a new type of game i tried and i loved it the single player is great but don t play it all day long it might get old just play it for 1 2 hours you can also get mods like truckersfm which will make it have multiplayer that is how people rack up 100 s of hours on this game i am still playing and i just now finished exploring the cities this game is still expanding and getting better i would give this game a 8 5 and this rating could change in the future this is a indie company so don t make fun of them for going slow states are coming out twice a year now glhf don t crash into too many cars it gets costly
