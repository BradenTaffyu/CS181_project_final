this was in my opinion the last great total war it fully embraced its setting and introduced new and innovative gameplay elements while keeping true to the soul of total war many will criticize the fantastical elements of romance mode or the neglect of records mode but in my opinion records mode is a historical experience on part with legacy historical total war games and becomes an all time great with the mod trom trom is to three kingdoms what stainless steel was to medieval 2 or lme4 was to napoleon total war some of the things i love about this game 1 the retinue system the retinue system introduces a happy medium of army stacks being tied to generals to avoid stack spamming by the ai and the flexibility of having the option of breaking out sub sections of an army to accomplish side tasks 2 simple campaign mechanics like an actual population mechanic a food mechanic and an army supply mechanic makes this one of the most historically authentic campaign experiences in total war 3 the emphasis on characters brings back the old magic from medieval 2 total war but it s built in to the game 4 massive scale ultra unit scale in this game is 240 men per infantry unit that s the biggest vanilla total war unit size i ve ever seen 5 diplomacy it s extremely well done and enhances the gameplay rather than being a chore i think the main thing that western audiences won t like is the setting and the chinese names to this i really urge people to try and embrace the setting rather than being turned off by it the han dynasty was one of the greatest empires in the history of mankind and the names become way more digestible this really should have been the foundation that future total war games were built on including warhammer 3 with all of the major features that define three kingdoms but creative assembly is allergic to progress and evolved backwards instead
