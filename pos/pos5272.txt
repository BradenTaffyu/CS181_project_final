2015 this review should be spoiler free i ve done my best to be vague if i must talk about something spoiler y and in those instances ill preempt the statement with a spoiler warning please excuse my excessive use of parentheticals appositives i do love them perhaps too much my qualifications or why my opinion is worth anything i am a veteran fallout buff with well over 1000 hours combined between fallout fallout 3 and fallout nvin the first 5 days after its release i ve already acrued 65 hours of play while attending university if that helps show my dedication overall rating 9 10 good things the combat the combat in fallout 4 is a compelling mixture of modern fps cod etc and the standard fo3 nv the guns feel more realistic and weighty combat is faster paced more rewarding more difficult if played on a high difficulty and more realistic it has its problems of course but i ll elaborate on that in the bad things section power armor in fallout 4 power armor is not just strong apparel as it is in fo3 but instead a mobile tank that you live inside of major differences include limited batteries which must be replaced upon exhaustion found with similar rarity as mininukes in fo3 insane damage resistance while in the suit you are nearly untouchable unless going up a massive hoard of energy weapons or explosives and the whole system is reasonably customizable with some fun gadgets to put in the mod slots but other than that i m honestly speechless all i could say in addition to above is how amazing and fun it is to pound around in power armor and devastate everything in your path the crafting settlement system everything literally every piece of junk has a use and collecting things especially rarer items is intensely satisfying this system revitalizes the grab everything mentality that i ve held dear since my early days of gaming using the large library of placeable objects you can design whatever settlement you could ever care to inhabit additionally the varied settlement locations allow for further interesting specialization of resources design and interactions between your various settlements gives you a great sense of accomplishment as you systematically make the commonwealth safer for everyone sprinting you can sprint now in the vanilla game its awesome the voice acting the sole survivor s voice acting at least the female s is she s the only one i ve really heard extensively is phenomenal it s immersive emotional to the extreme relatable and witty the npcs npc s are reasonably diverse in appearance personality type in terms of employment faction etc and voice actors the acting itsself is also generally high quality certainly moreso than in any previous bethesda game that i ve played apart from perhaps dishonored the story quests the main story of fallout 4 is incredible it feels like the choices including which dialogue options you chose matter much more than in the previous games in the series i won t be spoiling anything here but the ending is certainly leagues above the nonsense that was fo3 s ending effortlessly dispatching the wimpy over hyped final boss chose between two lack luster final options which are supposed to drastically change the world only to wake up and have it basically affect nothing nah bro in fallout 4 its all serious meaningful contemplation of the situations you find yourself in how you should act with current events and knowledge and careful consideration of the implications your actions will have on the world oh and then things actually change think like how the outcomes of the megaton quests change things the game world the in game environment is sprawling as usual however it is vibrant and alive even moreso than fallout 3 and certainly moreso than nv with people locations random events and interesting unmarked locations strewn densely throughout the commonwealth the lore of the commonwealth is complex and superb and immensely satisfying to explore and delve into see misc section for additional elaboration bad things the hud compass indicators for enemy positions seems to be much more finicky and weak seeming to sometimes overlook enemies and or display their locations incorrectly the hud compass no longer indicates where friendly neutral characters are making searching for settlers in your towns a nightmare since they wander wherever they please there s great promise in the building system but it leaves a lot to be desired the way the floors walls and ceilings interact can lead to horrific nonsensical rage inducing inability to place objects in locations where they should be able to be placed this is best noted when dealing with fences they re nearly impossible to neatly lay out let alone place them close enough together to actually make a wall but again will easily be fixed with mods that i ve come across so far there is only one bad npc she s incredibly irritating and aggressive and she s unkillable and you cannot actually speak to her miscellaneous the following section is entirely subjective relating to the game world i wanted to elaborate about an experience i had fallout 4 does one of the coolest things i ve ever personally seen in a game like this again spoiler free there is a place that you will run into during the main quest where the game fakes you out there are areas of the map that extend far beyond the limits of the pipboy map now i actually found this area way before i was told to go there for the quest so i had no idea what i was stumbling into but wandering in this area in complete awe of the environment and the things that i discovered was one of the most exciting memorable and emotional experiences ive had while playing a game and for the record recently i ve extensively played undertale and this experience was pretty much on par with experiences in undertale i felt wonder i got the same feeling that i used to get whenever i played games as a kid rarely have i experienced such wonder complete immersion and rabid curiosity since my childhood end of gush ranting
