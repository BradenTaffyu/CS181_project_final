2019 early access review a simplified and tame like survival game that doesn t pose a challenge upon someone who is both interested and novice towards inventory like games brave the wind waves and bruce the shark other animals included by yourself or play co op with friends through private servers raft will definitely cater hours of fun for yourself and groups of friends to explore the story or even create near endless creations in creative where the only limitations is your imagination and maybe the materials provided in game those are limited too
