early access review absolutely obsessed with this game i genuinely struggle to find the words to describe the joy this game brings me maybe it s because i m a nerd who loves anything with a medieval settingmaybe it s because i ve always loved town city builders and battle strategy gamesmaybe it s because i got invested early taking part in the open beta patreon discord and twitter conversations with greg just for the chance to leave a mark on a game that got me more excited than any other game ever has but all that aside this game makes me feel how immersive rpgs make me feel it makes me care about the world and makes me feel like i m making a difference and it makes me mourn when my lumberjack from the very first settlers camp dies in defence of his home or worse guilt when he falls on campaign to win some land off another noble watching your village burn in any other similar game is annoying watching your village burn in manor lords is harrowing and tragic this game is beautiful you probably don t need me telling you that but the attention to detail and historical grounding goes a long way for people like me together with the gorgeously unique seasons and the wonder of unreal very few games if any surpass manor lords in its ability to make me stop ctrl c and appreciate the scene for a moment gameplay wise the number of resources and complexity of resource management is just right for me no anno resource chains and trade routes that take a chartered accountant to keep track of no glaring gameplay gaps where the illusion breaks nor incentive to mindlessly scale in and endless stressful loop managing my village just seems to make sense where if something goes wrong it s almost always because of something that could and should go wrong because of my mistakes or chance and when something goes right it s incredibly rewarding the music is fantasticthe battles are shockingly impressive considering they re somewhat of an afterthought in a game that s not even trying to be a total war killer the dev and producers are awesome and a welcome and vocal step in the right direction for the industry alongside larian and arrowhead the first opt in beta patch has already made dozens of improvements and fixes within a couple weeks i have no criticisms to give any issues i can think of don t carry enough weight to be worth mentioning in a review i truly love this game and want to see it continue to grow and improve with quests and intrigue diplomacy and politics new regions and cpu ai cities whatever greg has in mind for the finished product if the game so far is anything to go off of i trust it ll continue to provide me many many more hours of enjoyment thanks greg and everyone who helped bring this project to lifeyou have every reason to be proud of what you ve made
