2021 early access review i ve been sitting here for a little while trying to decide whether to recommend this game or not i know that s a strange predicament for someone with 265 hours on record at time of this review but let me explain this game is great there is a lot to it and the files can be edited to make the game align more to your taste however the ai is bad and i mean bad on campaign i ve joined an army which gathered at a village which was very close to a friendly castle which was being besieged our army was larger than the besieging force but the army leader decided to ignore that and head north to almost the other side of the map to raid a village in battle the army i was in advanced toward a battanian army which positioned itself quite cleverly at the top of a steep hill our army stopped and stood at the bottom just taking ranged attacks they finally walked half way up the hill but then turned around presented their backs to the ranged enemy and walked back down they did this about 4 times before finally charging up the hill the battle was won but there were so many avoidable casualties taken in siege the ai doesn t understand ladders when they lift the siege ladders they only use one of the two if they use them at all sometimes they just stand at the base of the ladders and do nothing the ai is slightly better with siege towers though with laddered siege towers the defenders have a habit of climbing down the ladders and literally start fighting on them until one of the attacking artillery pieces destroys its own siege tower these are just single experiences i ve had from an absolute ton of them but i will still recommend this game there is still so much on offer and it s early access so there is still time for these ai problems to be addressed
