2018 where can i even begin initially i bought this game in order to see what the noise was surrounding how great it supposedly was hearing about it from my brother and friends alike i played through the intro in goodsprings got to primm and was immediately bored out of my mind i shot one too many geckos and the game had lost me i hung it up for a while and stopped playing recently however i was reminded of it s existance through some friends on discord and decided to give it another shot just sitting through the intro video was enough to get me pumping again and so i set off into the wastes to explore all the game had to offer my first playthrough was pretty barren i don t remember if i had the dlcs at that point but i certainly hadn t touched them i adventured through the game as an independent party trying to do right and stumbling my way through most encounters in the process ending on a house victory that had me satisfied but that wasn t enough no this behemoth of a game is so great that i had to go in to have a second try to double dip in this my second run through the game was as fleshed out as it could get while siding with the ncr including all of the companion quests most side quests i can t think of any i ve missed if they even exist all of the dlc stories the faction quests and the main storyline itself folks i cannot reccomend a game any more than i want you to play this one the people at obsidian really outdid themselves lemme tell ya hilarious writing great characters abundant choices that actually have weight on the outcome of the entire mojave wasteland mass creativity in not only the weaponry and armor that can be acquired but also the locations you can find and a hell of a gigantic story under the surface of it all through terminals and dialogue options the development team really put their backbones into working on this game and it shows not only is it a great game to stand alone by itself but it integrates so well into the fallout lore and the stories of fallout 1 and 2 that you d imagine this was supposed to be the original fallout 3 instead of van buren or the official bethesda one this game is all about choices no ending is a perfect one and there are a lot of grey areas with much wiggle room for you to decide the fate of the inhabitants of the wastes whether it be good or bad and the game turns you loose to freely allow you to do what you see fit with no strings attached if you re a fan of rpg games or someone looking to taste the fallout franchise for the first time and you re willing to deal with a few bugs along the way this is the game for you you may have to put up with 15 000 repeats of johnny guitar on radio new vegas but it pales in comparison to the mileage you get out of playing this my reccomendations max out speech as soon as possible for more interesting outcomes for quests if not just to smooth talk your way out of certain situations including a rather important one near the end of the game be prepared to die a lot and that means quicksaving by hitting f4 or by manually saving far more often than the autosave feature exhaust all the dialogue you can if possible hack any terminal you can find to get all of the bits of story you can from each outpost vault and computer in the wastes mods mods mods mods there are mods that improve the quality of the game through bug fixes there are mods that improve it visually there are mods for entire new quests and factions hell there are mods to cheat altogether use mods if possible you have an advantage over console versions of the game and i highly reccomend you use it personally i went with some bug fixes and visual improvements do more than one playthrough my first run was bare bones and i left with a bad taste in my mouth as i progressed through the second time i exhausted everything i could think of and went for the best ending possible which i achieved after a long while of playing don t be afraid to venture off and do your own thing the main quest is too short if that s all you re set on doing side quests add meat to this game and dlcs add extra beef if that s what you re into old world blues is hilarious and geeky lonesome road and honest hearts are lore heavy dead money is eerie and serious but ultimately detached from most of the game save a few characters if you want the prime fallout experience with all of the modern mechanics and gameplay choose this game sure it may not be as visually pleasing as fallout 4 and it possibly may not be as much of a nostalgia bomb for you as fallout 3 was but i think this is the prime candidate for what the series should be all about
