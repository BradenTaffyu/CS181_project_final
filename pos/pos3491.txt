2019 this is possibly my favourite game ever made here is a few reasons why 2015 was one of the harder years of my life i was just coming to terms that because my family was in the airforce at the time i had to move from the one place i truly felt like i belonged the airforce base i had lived on for the past 6 years or so completely changed who i was and i found as i learned i had to leave my home once again i grew angrier and angrier with the world around me when it finally came into my last 2 or so months in the afb i began to develop severe anger problems and took it out on people who took the same anger out on people who didn t deserve it i felt like the only way i was going to get through the rest of my life was to fight my way through it i hated everything around me but still kept that somewhat positive attitude i was constantly miserable but somewhere along that path in october of 2015 i found this this game this experience it presented a new path a new way of treating life i learned that instead of looking at life as a challenge that only gave you one chance i should look at it as it is an experience when it came time to move i found it almost easier for me to socialize and talk i actually grew positive and i focused on my aspirations and talents all while sharing them within these amazing characters and ideas undertale to me is more than just a game it s always been a lesson stay determined no matter how bad it may get you can choose to make it better overall the characters are paced in a way where you feel like you get to know them and care for them learning more and more about them positive or negative almost forces the human heart to love and cherish every single npc and character you meet along the way mystery keeps you locked in and story is rich in every nook and cranny whether it be through hands or silly fonts this game can speak to pretty much everyone even the gross sadists that the world has birthed from the pits from hell my 1 1 2 complaint s i really really wish you would work your way up to the castle through the city or something what i m really saying is i just want this game to be longer and have one more area and hard mode not being complete which i cant even really complain about cause toby himself even said he might not even finish it anyways i love this game and its messages and ideas 3
