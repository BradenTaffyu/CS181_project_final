2019 early access review i feel i should update this review because beamng has made a lot of progress lately and fulfilled some of my suggestions beamng is still best and most realistic driving simulator out there and i really recommend it the game has also made a lot of progress with beammp so with that being said sticking to the type of review i d like to give an updated list of what i believe should be added to this game 1 fix the ai for traffic mode so they stop and stop lights and dont crash into eachother etc 2 fix ui in some places like mods and options not really necessary but it would be nice to have a more appealing ui 3 keep on adding content to the game old review this game is by far one of the best driving simulation games that i have ever played i love the realistic crash physics and all of the cool maps and cars there are however a few things that could be added to this game to make it even better 1 add a multiplayer mode2 add scratch marks 3 add an option to noclip around the map and choose a location to spawn at
