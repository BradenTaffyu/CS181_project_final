2022 mount blade ii bannerlord is a phenomenal game it is probably just the coolest game i have ever played the combat experiences range from fighting looters in the early game with minimal equipment to sneaking into a bandit camp with a handful of loyal troops climbing the walls during a siege and having the weight of troops pressing from both sides to leading a cavalry charge as a heavily armoured lord you can take on an active role in the fighting or scout the battlefield and order your troops from a vantage point to best take advantage of their weapon sets or gaps in the enemy lines the way in which the combat plays out is engaging and fun throughout the game and is only one element of the overall gameplay bannerlord also includes party management personal and companion levelling and ability trees a global map with settlements to trade in receive and accomplish quests in or even just walk around and enjoy the larger settlements are very varied and you can see the differences both when walking around them doing quests playing the local board game in the tavern or when assaulting them during a siege the level of detail put into all of these is just breathtaking the way the game progresses from a humble beginning and small squad of troops up to becoming a mercenary or vassal and eventually a king in your own right is well done the tasks that you undertake and the importance of difference aspects of the game scale well as you start to peel back layer after layer of intertwined content you can set up caravans to trade across the map but need to pick the right companion to lead it and make sure they won t roam into a warzone you can invest in workshops in towns but need to ensure it will be profitable and have the necessary goods flowing in from nearby villages whilst not competing too much with other workshops in the region your relations with important members of the towns and the nobility can influence the direction your game will take there are some of the usual issues with games of this type in bannerlord the game can get a bit repetitive at times and is especially dragging in the very late stages when you have effectively won but need to close out the remaining conquests the way that the ai nobles and armies act during wars is not very good and they tend to waste a lot of time and be quite exploitable that said you can always break up this content with some arena fights or bandit raids which always remain pretty enjoyable overall the level of detail put into each aspect of bannerlord is unbelievable the different elements combine together beautifully and cover all the bases for things i am looking for in games i honestly believe that everyone should try this game and that almost everyone will agree that it is a sublime experience i would rate mount blade ii bannerlord as a 9 10
