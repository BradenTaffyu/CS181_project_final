2017 p2w with ridiculous match making developers defying history and so on try to play low tiers with realism or simulation then you will have some fun w o paying anything btw you will hear a lot about russian bias etc in the community trust me the issue is not overpowered russian tanks but stupid match making e g tiger 2 against is3 and modern rocket launchers etc just like 1944
