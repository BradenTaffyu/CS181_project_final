2018 a really really good and in depth strategy game with potential for hundreds of hours of fun race customisations and modability provide a great role playing aspect for each game making multiple replays distinct and just as fun as the first game unfortunately the game suffers from some technical issues these come in the form of slow downs towards the second half of the game and more significantly desynch issues in multiplayer games making it practically impossible to play a full game with friends
