2015 early access review i ve had a positive review up for ages but looked and saw it wasn t very specific so let s clarify has been releasing free builds for at least six years and went live on steam in eh late 2015 the first thing to note about it is that unlike most roguelikes in a similar graphical style it has a thoroughly user friend interface and in fact the graphics are clear enough that even someone like me who can never bother to try could read it in ascii that s no longer necessary as the released version sports a very stylish and stylized tileset but it speaks to the deliberateness of the design that relative transparency is all over in important mechanics aren t usually obfuscated a piece of armor modifies your damage resistance and your dodge chance and if it does anything else a quick examination will tell you what it is dialogue plays out as trees rather than keyword guessing and you re given clear guidance on how to get going right out of the gate while also having several directions you can go or being free to wander on your own the game is narrative and lore is plentiful its far future apocalypse rich in a kind of charming strangeness that pulls off the trick of never winking at itself these characters genuinely do live in a weird and mostly posthuman world one of the earliest jobs you re sent on is named for canticle for liebowitz and you can definitely see that in the tone the wreckage of ancient technology s everywhere sometimes an object of worship sometimes of study sometimes of something in between but people who understand it are eccentrics you ll occasionally come across a tome that describes some menacing discovery in pure science from the distant past and implies with gloriously heady and incoherent diction just how the world was saved from that dark knowledge the world s at once ruined and lively and when you go into the jungle and the recently added ambient tracks kick in you ll realize it s filled with menace too if there s a criticism to be laid at qud s feet it s that it can be hard character build guides can go a long way to help with that the freeform system mean it s easy to build a character who s useless although there are still tons of ways to build one who s useful but ultimately until you ve spent a bit of time with the game you re still going to be stepping on plants that impale you and end a run you though was promising recycling your previous build is generally pretty easy but going through the motions of starting out can be a tiny bit annoying reassigning whatever psychic powers you chose to take to keybindings edit this is no longer necessary if you play a character with the same build twice in a row the game remembers what you bound your powers to running around town to pick up whatever randomly spawned loot you ve got this time ultimately though these are small and self afflicted tribulations and do nothing to diminish what i feel is the best roguelike around
