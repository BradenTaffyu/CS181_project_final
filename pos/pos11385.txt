2020 early access review every seventh day is a test of skill and ingenuity overview 7 days to die is a needs based survival game with a unique pve aspect that sets it apart from similar survival crafting titles every seventh day players will be forced to contend with a deadly zombie horde that grows stronger and more dangerous with every attack players must also contend with hunger thirst and various health affecting conditions such as disease and temperature extremes 7 days to die can be played with both keyboard mouse and controller gameplay progression as players kill enemies loot and craft they will gain experience and levels toward the game s perk system the perk system includes various combat skills such as perks that favour the use of certain types of firearms as well as non combat skills such as vehicle crafting and resource harvesting the varied array of options presented by the perk system is very welcome though in practice players gain too few levels to make full use of it unless they play long term on the same server crafting related perks will often take priority over convenience or combat perks especially if you re playing without friends to share the crafting responsibilities i put just over 60 hours of playtime into a fresh character prior to writing this review and playing at my own pace ultimately had most of the crafting perks i needed but only a handful of other skills crafting crafting in 7 days allows players to create personal equipment such as firearms and armour vehicles such as motorcycles and gyrocopters consumables including food and medicine and building materials to use for the construction of one s base 7 days uses a standard survival crafting system of harvesting basic materials from the world to craft as well as unlocking crafting recipes through the levelling system though some item recipes can only be obtained through looting the correct schematic from the world this system does lend significance to the enjoyable exploration and looting aspect of 7 days but also places rng walls on crafting as players are not guaranteed to find what they re looking for for the most part however looting alone is adequate to obtain decent player equipment with building materials being the more prominent use of the crafting system building 7 days uses a voxel based building system similar to minecraft and space engineers in which players use blocks to build whatever shapes they desire players are given a variety of block shapes and types to build their dwellings as well as a number of traps ranging from simple wooden spikes to spinning steel blades and turrets to defend against the zombie hordes preparation is the key to surviving the seventh night a screenshot of 7 days to die by spobbles combat players of 7 days will constantly encounter zombies and plenty of choice is provided in how one goes about dealing with this being sneaky in light armour and quietly taking out enemies at range with a bow running in with an axe yelling leeeeeroy jennnnkins or simply gunning everything down with a firearm are all viable options with their own pros and cons unfortunately gameplay itself feels quite dated the player moves fairly slowly animations are quite clunky and gunplay not so smooth i found myself getting used to it fairly quickly and it s still enjoyable though there is a significant difference in gameplay quality compared to something like ark survival evolved or any modern fps zombie a i is fairly basic but adequate they try to take the most direct route to the player even if they have to smash their way through objects to do so though will make use of open doors and ladders if possible as mentioned previously the night of every seventh in game day will feature an attack on the player by a large zombie horde on the first night the horde will consist of ordinary zombies players are used to but as time goes on more powerful zombies with unique abilities such as an acid spitter will be included to test players skill and preparation the challenge of this night of zombie terror can be avoided however for example one can simply get killed by the zombies while far from their base and just wait out the night level design the world of 7 days consists of a large map containing several distinct biomes with their own hazards ranging from cold weather to landmines players will likely spend most of their time exploring and looting the various structures placed in the world including towns comprised of domestic and commercial buildings cities featuring large apartment buildings and factories as well as isolated locations of interest such as military installations the aforementioned factories and military locations serve as examples of the game s dungeons these are typically heavily populated with enemies including some rare and dangerous special zombies and have large sprawling interiors designed to make the player slowly work their way through the area and come upon the valuable loot at the end an eerie atmosphere hints at the history of this place a screenshot of 7 days to die by spobbles i found the challenge offered by these locations very enjoyable though it is wholly unnecessary to actually do it as the sandbox nature of the game means one can simply and cheaply build or tunnel their way to the end loot without actually fighting anything interaction customisation personalization 7 days features a character creator with various cosmetic options such as skin colour body shape sliders and hair styles it must be said however that the character models look pretty bad by today s standards players can customize their character s look using various pieces of clothing and armour as well as dyes to alter item colours story the story of 7 days is sparse beyond what can be observed from the state of the game s world small references exist here and there but it s very limited technical this game was played with the following pc specs intel i5 4440 3 10 ghz16gb ddr3 ramgeforce gtx 1650 super 4gbhdd1680x1050 resolutionvisuals audio the visuals of 7 days are very dated the shading can be nice at times providing some pretty moments and the graphics aren t so bad that it bothered me but overall it s simply adequate at best occasionally one may find the game looking prettier than they expected a screenshot of 7 days to die by spobbles audio design while not stunning is adequate and has its strong points some zombie screams for example sound pretty authentic and unnerving the ambient soundtrack in the burning biome is also one i d like to call out as being very haunting and atmospheric issues the main technical issue i ve experienced while playing 7 days since its last major update is poor optimization using the specs listed above i can play far prettier games such as assassin s creed odyssey without issue but in 7 days i was forced to play with very poor quality textures as my framerate would tank catastrophically otherwise summary 7 days is a very enjoyable game for those who like building and looting the dated graphics and gameplay may be a hurdle to some though a lot of fun awaits those who can get used to it i d recommend to anyone who enjoys the genre though with warning of the dated gameplay this review comes courtesy of the r curator
