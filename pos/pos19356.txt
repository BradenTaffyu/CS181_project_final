2021 fallout new vegas is one of the better if not one of the greatest sci fi post apocalyptic rpgs ever made but this port is terrible more on that later gameplay fallout is a relatively known commodity at this stage at least the bethesda ones i fear the interplay fallout games may be losing their renown at least among the younger or non nostalgic crowd the itch for post apocalyptic isometric rpgs is getting scratched by a number of smaller indie titles such as atom underrail survivalist encased even the series that predates fallout wasteland is scratching that original itch better than fallout is that said bethesda s by way of obsidian in this specific instance interpretation of that world is most likely better known by people nowadays much like many other games that bethesda makes new vegas is an open world rpg this time set in the mojave wasteland which is comprised of parts of what used to be nevada arizona and california the premise here is that you re a courier for the mojave express and a man named benny shoots you in the intro you ve made your last delivery kid a screenshot of fallout new vegas by spacecouncil then you wake up somewhere else you ll be given a s p e c i a l aptitude character sheet test this time given to you by doc mitchell same voice actor as commander bailey in mass effect then the rest of game starts and you re off to find benny and investigate just what got you into this mess narratively it s structured similarly to fallout 4 insofar that you ll side with factions over an item and or ideologies the platinum chip in new vegas as opposed to the courser chip in fo4 what you do with this chip dictates the course of the end game otherwise the game is effectively a sandbox you ll need to explore it yourself to see everything we won t go quietly the legion can count on that a screenshot of fallout new vegas by spacecouncil in earnest there isn t a ton to say about the game especially given its pedigree i d be hard pressed to find someone unaware of this game that was not also unaware of video games in general it s an absolute classic and quite frankly i think the direction that fallout 4 took has made this game take on a more revered position in gaming history than it may have originally sat in but i guess that s just how things go sometimes here are the mods i use to make fallout new vegas operate the way it should in the first place i usually play with around 15 mods total i m not a big fan of heavily modded games these are just a few of the basic mods i use to get nv running without stutters or crashes and with some improved quality of life stuff yukichigai s unofficial patch www nexusmods com this does general fixes nvac new vegas anti crash www nexusmods com self explanatory nvtf new vegas tick fix www nexusmods com this removes the micro stutters that cause random and frequent fps drops for seemingly little to no reason new vegas 4gb www nexusmods com this makes the game aware of more memory there s one qol mod that i found invaluable onetweak www nexusmods com this allows you play fallout new vegas in borderless fullscreen mode or what is effectively that otherwise playing in fullscreen makes it soft lock should you try and alt tab out depending on your setup and configuration i personally also use a few texture upgrades and ui tweak mods that speaks more to subjective taste however i can recommend one called casm www nexusmods com this mod cycles through auto save files so you always have multiple files to re load into if something should go awry by default it ll cycle though 20 slots every 5 minutes and it uses its own save slots it doesn t overwrite quick saves or manual saves i have a problem with getting really absorbed into the game not quick saving and then something completely random happens that ends up killing me and i have to replay the last 30 minutes so this mod can save you some of that theoretical legwork there s also a version of casm that integrates the mod menu with added features but the default served me fine some of these might be redundant by the time they make their way to you but they re the ones that i use i actually just leave this game installed most of time not all of them will utilize nvse or the new vegas script extender but many of them do i m not going to write a guide on how to install that it s the same as other bethesda games just google it it s not that hard i actually didn t want to review new vegas because i knew at least half of it would end up being about mods so it goes minimal mod improvement just stability stutter removal and a few visual ones 21 9 was an ini fix a screenshot of fallout new vegas by spacecouncil the gist truth is the game was rigged from the start if you ve read this far consider following my curation station argusmy the outer worlds review
