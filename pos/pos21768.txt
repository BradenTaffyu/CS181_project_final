2016 beforehand i m running dark souls 3 on a gtx 980 an i7 4790k and 8gb of ram everything maxed at 2560x1440 solid 60fps in all areas and the game has not crashed bugged glitched trashed my frame rate cut my audio or done anything else that is being stated by some users i m not claiming that it s not happening though with that being saiddark souls 3 is probably my favorite souls so far when it comes to gameplay combat is fast not as bloodborne but just enough to make things more interesting fluid and thrilling enemies are faster more aggressive and smarter too this time you have weapon arts which are different skills and movesets for several weapons in the game that when used consume focus points yes the demon s souls mana bar is back the level design is so good this time although it s not as interconnected as dark souls 1 it s big to the point of making you feel lost i haven t completed dark souls 3 yet but thus far it has been one of the best experiences i had since the witcher 3 came out
