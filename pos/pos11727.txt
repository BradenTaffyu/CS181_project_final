2019 early access review a true masterpiece very well done in every aspect fps suvival base building rpg and tower defense all in a videogame and i m sure i m forgetting something i still need to try the multiplayer version because everytime i start a single player campain i m not able to stop you can adjudst difficulty setting and play the level that it better suit to your skills considering the huge amount of things that you can do this is really usefull for the first times you play this game i saw many critics over the a17 progression but i m not agree it made the zombie killing part more important and i like it graphic can be very cool or very potato and run with high fps on every machine what else to say don t miss this game
