2018 early access review caves of qud is weird really weird and i wouldn t have it any other way my go to character build is a 4 armed 4 legged 2 headed 2 heart monster that focuses on psychological and mental mutations there s one such ability where you can create up to like 4 6 copies of yourself what s more is that those clones can clone themselves soon you have an army of like 10 15 multi legged armed head heart beasts devastating your enemies at one time i was dual wielding two two handed electrified swords wielding them in my right two and left two hands on a different note i once slipped in a bunch of goo that resulted in a disease that rotted my tongue i spend several irl days trying to find the cure to regrow my tongue if this hasn t convinced you to buy this game i don t know what will
