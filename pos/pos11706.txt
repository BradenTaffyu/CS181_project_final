2016 early access review 7 days to die is a highly customizable zombie survival crafting game set in an apocolyptic world it is still in alpha so take this review with a grain of salt 1 graphics 8 10 stunning with the settings maxed out this game is on par with many aaa games of today the settings can be played with to suit your pc and there is a fair chance your pc will run this game it caters to both spectrums of graphical quality largely settling in the medium high range it runs at approx 20 30 fps on a laptop with intel hd 5500 graphics or 60 fps maxed with a gtx 1060 the lighting is among the best i have ever seen in gaming 2am inside your small base completely pitch black you figure out how to craft a torch you also start with one if you still have it then the area illuminates in a way realistically resembling a torch two things that could use tweaking torch lag where on particularly slow pc s using torches to light your base will half or worse your framerate and the instant change of terrain upon going from rain to snow or vise versa more noticable in snow biomes make that change more gradual 2 sounds 9 10 you will be on the edge of your chair when you hear zombies shuffling through the grass just outside your mediocre base you hastely constructed 2 hours before nightfall your finger will also be hovering over the pause button when you hear the terrifying screech from one of the things scrambling around just outside your abode you sit there silently not daring to light a torch or cook the meat that you foolishly left in your inventory the screech soon converts itself into a bang as the monsters catch onto the scent of the raw meat they are at your door you wonder how long the scrap metal laden boards of the door will hold against the ravaging beasts as one layer of material breaks away bringing you one step closer to death your attempts to repair the continuous damage are futile as you are now flanked on both sides the zombies are now breaking down your walls and your are completely helpless the hinges on your door give way and you are swarmed as if the zombies were angered bees that is the end of your story a story named 1 day to die usually this only happens maybe once some sounds however are too loud even if they are going for realism 3 gameplay 8 5 10 the menus are easily navigatable so all of your seemingly trivial supplies are easily accessed in addition to your inventory you have easy access to your character panel you can create and customize your own character in many different ways don t like your nose feel free to give yourself a nosejob you can craft armor that provides various protection against diffent types of damage be it a zombie smacking you across the face or the warm unforgiving sun of the desert there are many different biomes and you better hope you came equip with weather appropriate clothing or your goose may be cooked or frozen depending on where you are at be wary of stepping into a lake as the wetness will amplifify your loss of body heat there is armor ranging from plant fiber to a suit of iron that even zombies would have difficulty penetrating speaking of iron you can mine that in caves or your own manmade mine the mines differ greatly from the likes of minecraft and they are infinitely more realistic looking you could build your manmade mine inside your base base building is definitely one of the most innovative features of this game you place frames and can use materials you ve collected to upgrade the durablity of those blocks each upgrade has different models and you are likely to feel more safe behind a wall of scrap metal reinforced wood walls or even concrete or rubar walls but always keep in mind you are never completely safe in 7 days to die you will always have to leave your base to search for food and water and your own bases defenses may just be your demise if you manage to be successful in your adventures you will level up and earn skill points to spend that will make your continued survival just a little bit easier if you don t go wandering in the wee hours of the night without heavy artillery even with heavy artillery you might just find yourself on the correct side of the wellness bar 4 animations 8 10 this is the section that the developer could touch up a bit the deer running animation is still rather silly even after many alpha updates but the zombies animations especially running exceed expections there is even an death animation that you get to see the zombies feasting on your body cutting down trees also has a neat timber animation which is far better than the previous collapse animation overall 8 5 10 this awesome game is still in alpha even though it feels past needing that label as this game is more than complete there is tons of content to enjoy and to be terrified about if you are in the market for a survival game even if you believe zombies are cliche give this game a try be a walking cheeseburger for a hungry zombie today edit as of 11 21 18 this review may be very out of date
