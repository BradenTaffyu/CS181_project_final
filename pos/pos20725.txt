pros combat is fun graphics are amazing good explorationcons side quests are poorly written every side quest consists of npc has lost object or pet go to dungeon camp to retrieve said object pet return it to npc there isn t a single side quest that doesn t follow this formula very little enemy variation i think there are about 5 or so enemy types in the entire gamequantity over quality for exploration poisoverall 7 10 good to get on sale
