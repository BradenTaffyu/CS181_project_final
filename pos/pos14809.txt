2021 early access review when i was young i always wanted a game when you can basically destroy everything of course there were some games where you can destroy things like in gta or just cause etc but you can t destroy everything except for red faction for example but since this game is getting old i wondered if something more new existed and here it comes teardown and it became one of my favourite games the graphics the gameplay the destruction this game has it at everything of course you will need a good pc to play it without seeing a powerpoint instead of a game and in terms of graphics i saw that this game needs at least a gtx 1060 3gb vram i have a gtx 960 2gb and it runs pretty well even if i put the graphics in high with 75 render scale i m not in full 60 fps obviously but it s still very playable 40 50 fps now let s talk about the good points and the bad points and of course the game is in early access so what i said can be outdated in the future good points graphically beautiful satisfying destruction gameplay easy to understand how to use the tools price updates optimized loadings unlike sometimes gta v maps workshop pretty fun challenges if you re getting bored of the sandbox and campaign modesbad points the game becomes laggy if you destroy too much things and it s normal since the pc has to manage thousands of voxels and the game is in early access large structures will not fall until the last voxel is disconnected also normal otherwise the game would run at maximum 2 fps that s it thanks for reading my review if you have anything to say about it you can write your thoughts in the comments below stay safe and have a good day
