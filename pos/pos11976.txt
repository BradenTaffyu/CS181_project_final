early access review so as a 5k hrs ark fan i really think asa is just not worth the money yet there are not much new content compare to ase and it s going to take years until genesis will be released same old cycle that we have been gone thru when we play ase endless wait time for new maps second of all the game feels like it s poorly optimal my setup is rtx 4090 with 13900k with epic setting i only get 50 80 fps running 4k so all that unreal engine experience you will not have unless you have a high end pc otherwise the picture just even worse than ase overall it s ark you know one and only kind i still love it
