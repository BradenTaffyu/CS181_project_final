2017 i m still working my way through the introduction of the game haven t gotten past the first city but so far i m loving it i m playing on the classic difficulty and there are two difficulties higher than this one my characters are now level 7 but this is still an early review as i have yet to complete act 1 pros 1 combat is incredibly tactical there have been a couple of fights where i got my butt handed to me because i didn t think to exploit the terrain or the destructibles placed in the battlefield height matters a lot more in this game especially if you have a huntsman 2 oddly the soundscape is amazing walking through town you can hear the bustling of people walking around it sounds great when you re in a dungeon along the beach and everywhere 3 voiceovers world building and characters has been spot on so far i have found some characters to be really funny and others to be incredibly intriguing such as losche 4 the game doesn t prevent you from doing things out of order once you escape from fort joy it really opens up and allows you to wander around the map in any direction cons 1 don t get me wrong the ui is pretty well done in this game however there are some ui isms that i would like improved such as being able to send all of my wares to one character who has the highest bartering skill 2 saved game bloat bug right now there is an issue with saved games getting extremely bloated to the point where it can take a long time for my computer to upload the saved games to the cloud closing thoughts this is definitely a crpg that has had a lot of love and time put into it it will ask a lot of you time wise to get going but so far it has been a really enjoyable ride i definitely recommend it so far and i will update as i get further into the game edit updated with some more pros and cons if this review isn t helpful for you please leave a comment so that i can address them
