2023 x com style turn based strategy meets persona style relationship building along with a huge narrative and interesting characters troubleshooter is a unique game nothing quite describes it perfectly but that is the best way to put it it is a ton of fun to play with unique mechanics destructible objects terrain effects morale effects and more this game offers multiplayer which is absolutely wild i would definitely recommend this for strategy fans and rpg fans alike edited i had previously said that you needed an internet connection to play which is incorrect you can play in offline mode for a fully offline experience my issue was unrelated thanks to the devs for a quick response so no excuse not to get this game
