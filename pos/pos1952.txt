2020 i have way more hours in this then what is displayed on steam as i played the game back at the original launch and several times since then i ll say up front if you re interested in a mmo where the primary focus is group content then this probably isn t for you there is plenty of group content to play but the current end game progression does not require anyone to participate in it to get the best stuff so it s not easy to find people to run the content unless you really seek out a good guild my opinion is this game is best treated as a single player rpg which it should have been that has the option of being played in multiplayer with your friends the story content is great and better then anything bioware has put out in the ps4 xb1 era you can currently experience all of the original vanilla story and the first 2 expansions for free if you really enjoy it after that you can subscribe for a single month to permanently unlock the other expansions there are other perks to being subscribed which is why i do whenever i m in the mood to dedicate serious time to the game but if all you care about is the story then this is a really cheap investment for the amount of time you ll get out of it especially if you play through each separate class story it s ironic ea has spent so much time making terrible live service games when this and mmos in general is basically one and it s far more fun then any of the crap they ve been putting out
