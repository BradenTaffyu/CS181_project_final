2019 ok this is my very first review of a game of all the games i have on steam that i really have enjoyed playing i m not going to give detailed analization of what this tw whii game does i m just telling you i really have gotten a kick out of this game i purchased the damn thing 1 1 2019 and you can see by the hours played i ve been hooked i ve got most total war titles and after reading quite a few reviews decided to buy it my decision on purchasing a game is based on what the negative reviews say i ignore most of the positives since they rehash the same things over and over after reading most of the bad ones on this game i decided overall that they are actually pretty trivial i ll tell you what is good and cheesy though in a nutshell the game is very detailed campaign wise i ve played both and it got me pretty well involved with the main character i picked lots of factions pretty decent diplomacy can manually fight or auto it if you want more detail read the other reviews is all i can say the cheesy crap though is offering free stuff only to find out to get them to activate you need warhammer itself hey i can afford it i think i spent about 90 00 to get what i have so far the problem is don t offer something for free when it s not come on how stupid do you as a gaming company think we are when we see it s free and it really isn t hell i m 68 years old not some naive preteen begging his parents to get the other lords or missions to make the dlcs run no wonder youtubers are up in arms over what game companies are doing today if you are offering something free on the dlc for this game then damnit make sure it runs on this game not having to find out i need to buy another game and dlc s just to get the freeby stuff to run well this is my review i kept it mostly clean because of the kids otherwise there would have been a lot more swear words here for you people who ve read this take it for what it s worth still this is a pretty damn addicting game it s now 1 38 a m in the morning and i think i ve played this for 8 straight hours yesterday i went to bed at 3 30 a m thank god i m retired happy new year all
