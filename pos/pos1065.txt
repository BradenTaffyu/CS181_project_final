2014 early access review you should play this game it s definitely not resident evil and that is a good thing seriously you even have a demo available play it why is this man who has only a few hours invested in the game ordering you around well even though my hour count states that i ve just bought my game that is not exactly true i played this game a lot a while back when it was still on desura and i think i really can give you guys an objective opinion here the fact that the game is flawed is true yet i always thought this is the game that zombie fans deserved it s not some cheerful sit with your friends and giggle while blowing zombie heads off game like left 4 dead series were i mean i like l4d but it never got right what i really wanted off an zombie game it s also not wannabe scary and atmospheric horror game like resident evil that s in the end just funny especially with the addition of co op in re5 which has broken every last bit of atmosphere that resident evil 1 and 2 had seriously if you haven t play the old resident evils they are good this game can be easily compared to dayz to some degree in the aspect that both of them make you feel like a masochist and that both of them consist of learning by trial and error by fire the games differ in the fact that dayz is action filled and most of your playthroughs are ended by an infamous axe guy that doesn t want to cooperate and zombies even with their fixed and upgraded ai s feel more like an annoyance then a threat while in project zomboid many times i died just because some zombie slowly shambled 30 meters behind me and i forgot to dispatch it before it came to my house it broke my window and in the middle of the night hell broke loose this game is a game where every one of your playthroughs will learn you a new thing where you will evolve from a guy that runs around with a butter knife and tries to kill as much zombies as possible before dying a slow and painful death to a guy that silently scavenges whole blocks of buildings and knows how not to take unnecessary risks if you take into consideration the fact that this game now also has multiplayer so if you feel like shooting some zombies with your friends that is just one more reason to try this game out also keep in mind that multiplayer is also in its early stages but for me it worked like a charm the cons are that the control system is kinda weird to get used to and that the game doesn t really instruct you that much about all the dangers of the world and believe me they are many many times you will find yourself dying of just one lucky bite or of the cold that you ignored for too long there are many many little things that make this game a true zombie apocalypse simulator not just another action game that includes zombies but also i have to mention a really friendly and awesome community over at game forums that will answer most of your questions and help you in any way possible tl dr version the game has a steep learning curve and is really not your everyday zombie game if you are on the other hand looking for a closest thing to an zombie apocalypse simulator you have to at least download the demo and try the game it s a wonderful game with many details that make it really atmospheric and easy to immerse yourself into edited 21 06 2014 yay they added multiplayer
