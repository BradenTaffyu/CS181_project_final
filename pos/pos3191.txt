2023 most fans of rpgs and especially ttrpgs are going to have a good time in this game the world is full of choices and paths the characters are dynamic and alive the music the art the combat everything in this game is top notch i do recommend playing one of the provided characters instead of making your own because the main character backstories are interjected into the story of the game quite well i m excited to see what baldur s gate 3 will be like on full release because larian made a beautiful game here
