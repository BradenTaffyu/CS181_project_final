2023 i don t know what kind of adhd i have that makes this game as grossly satisfying as it is but i legitimately played 60 hours of it within the first week of having it and i can t find it in myself to regret it due to the unreasonable amount of peace it brought me anyway if you at least somewhat enjoy watching someone else play it or the demo give it a try it might be a great for your overstimulated brain too
