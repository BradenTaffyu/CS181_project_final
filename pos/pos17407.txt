2019 if you are listening to the community i hope you will take this feedback of your fan who bought all of your games except warhammer2 seriously before your 20th anniversary 1 rome total war the first total war game i played and one of my favourites it had excellent campaign battles strong side characters overall you were getting passionate about your characters generals they lived long and you were trying to make them better and better character traits ancillaries were meaningful and easily readable like cavalry general it did make sense for example to have mostly cavalry in your army to obtain such a trait which makes you even more stronger with cavalry heroic battles provided strong generals you were feeling greatly rewarded about winning a battle that was impossible to win by getting several starred general senate elections was fun players were passionate about getting your characters elected onto senate in three kingdoms you are getting passionate about your characters you work on upgrading those but the random traits are not as good and are not readable schools were educating your generals you were moving all your young generals to a city with a good school and letting them stay there for several years and only then giving some soldiers to them in kingdoms i don t feel the bonus of building educational buildings walls could have been constructed in any city wonders provided good bonuses having ability to recruit superb spartan units only in spartha and syracuse cities you could build many cities with really good income there was a great sense of culture for every nation you could have recruited as many spies as you wanted and send them wherever you wanted bridges narrow passes you could have stayed your armies on such locations to defend your critical areas and prevent enemy armies from entering your country horse archers pikes legionaries cataphracts chariots there was a lot of unique units and every faction was different from another bad diplomacy was very bad it was a total war with everyone the more bigger and bigger you were becoming the less interesting it was to play in three kingdoms it is different from just being able to survive in the beginning up to three kingdoms stage where you understand the other factions are already too big and it is going to be very hard and very long to defeat them this makes you more careful and you just try to make your economy stonger before going onto war with them fighting battles was great although units were moving very fast your entire army could have routed in few seconds combining all your cavalry into one big chunk was better as if units were not hindering each other this was different in rome 2 where if you charge with one of your cavalry units your second cavalry unit would have been hindered by your first unit and will not have much impact this is done more or less good in three kingdoms except that the speed of units is way too slow i like the rome 2 units speed most 2 total war medieval iistrong side campaign characters overall you were getting passionate about upgrading your princesses merchants priests getting guilds in your cities you couldn t make your cities as wealthy as you could in rome total war but having merchants and controlling resources of other factions seizing other merchants was making game very interesting there was a great sense of culture for every nation in three kingdoms except certain units the rest looks all the same and boring at lest cities in provinces with wonders could have had different look pope faction was another thing bringing a unique taste to this game pope had a great impact on all factions and could have immediately make all other factions go to war on you as a leader you were trying to maintain good relations with pope crusades was another thing making this game very interesting it could have helped you to recruit huge armies travel long areas not spend money on those armies and fight other cultures there is no any such sense in three kingdoms mongol invasions timurids invasions were devastating by that time you would have grown larger and this was making a good challenge even for large and strong countries you had to really prepare large amount of strong armies to be able to hold on such feeling of large invasions exists only in attila this game has 3 398 active players count even though it was released in 2006 bad diplomacy was still bad your allies could betray you no matter how good relationships you had with them although overall the diplomacy was bad but still you could have formed diplomatic marriages to improve the relationship 3 without going to much into details for every rest of the games empire brought first naval battles shogun 2 was overall a much better version of empire and napoleon rome2 having better graphics and diplomacy than rome1 defensive alliances factions finally not betraying each others not able to sell regions though but the rest is much much worse than rome1 a turn based game with every possible upgrades or technology research giving only negligible increments characters dying too soon before you could upgrade them much you don t even desire to click on next turn button as you know you are not going to get too much bonus bugs in battle mechanics where entire charging unit with many soldiers abrupt stops with just a single solder hitting them things got fixed only in empiredivided dlc but not on the main campaign but still i like the battles in this game very much and about 6000 the rest of the active players of this game in warhammer finally long living characters returned back the game engine and mechanics all look good in this game it is just that i don t like such fantacy genre much thrones of britannia i liked this game because it was historic and it had a sense of quests like in warhammer brings new taste to total war games regretfully there was not much cavalry in this game overall it is hard to differentiate units from above in battle map except for their banners the same is in three kingdoms where all units look absolutely same from above this makes battles very awful in rome 2 for example you could easily distinguish pikes archers cavalry horse archers maybe the issue is in camera height finally three kingdoms diplomacy got greatly improved in this game giving things that were not existing in old versions of the game like instigating proxy wars selling food ancillaries coalitions alliances across multiple factions good side is there are unique characters luckily long living you get a unique sense of your faction growing bigger and bigger it is interesting challenge to assigning characters to court assigning administrators to reduce corruption to make sure you get most bonus and ensure they are all in harmony but there is no pleasant feeling of side quests like things existing in older games senate elections pope merchants or trying to survive invasions there is nothing significant in destroying yellow turban rebellion or capturing the the emperor there is finally a sense of military supplies which wasn t even existing in any of older games but to me there are still things that could be improved in military supplies concept for example in romance of three kingdoms sima yi and sleeping dragon were fighting over a single city which was critical in transporting the supplies bonuses provided by upgrading buildings seems to be not significant enough you get just 100 every time after upgrading the mine but spending much more money for every upgrade playing with sun jian you expand and capture more and more of the han territory but i didn t felt of becoming very reach you don t get much trade income from controlling many ports
