2016 another update so i finished my campaign everything about this game felt much smoother than previous civ games considering this is just the base game and firaxis likes to release lots of content by the way using units is way more interesting now you can deploy airplanes you don t have to keep them stationed as in the previous civ games where they had to be in a base this is probably my favorite feature lolupdate at first i was worried about the districts limiting my playstyle freedom however it s quite the opposite it actually feels like your empire is growing i used to hate in civ 5 how all you could do was build and improvement and then just pile a bunch of random buildings for queue in your cities now you actually have to make your empire grow love this new feature i have to say it now everyone was skeptical about this game because of civilization beyond earth but this game is perfect firaxis did an amazing job graphics are beautiful combat is fun building the empire is so much more detailed this game is perfect also japan super aggressive lmao
