2019 i ve been a bloons fan since i was very young not just tower defense but the original bloons where you d angle your dart throw to pop the most balloons bloons tower defense has always been fun to me as well each version taking a massive leap forward in terms of complexity and visual audio presentation this is no exception as btd6 looks and sounds great one of my few complaints about btd5 was the music was incredibly repetitive though that didn t sway my addiction whatsoever btd6 has no such ailment the music changes with practically every stage not only is there an audio upgrade but even more impressively this game completely re designs the graphics giving a nice crisp cell shaded 3 d look with moving models the models look alive twitching and scratching as they sit there idle the ninja monkey spinning his shuriken in his hand and much more i primarily buy the btd series on the phone since they are some of the best games on mobile but since 5 and 6 both have pc ports that support cross platform saving i ve decided to start buying them on pc as well they make a great distraction during boring college class lectures as they just require the touchpad on a laptop and don t require much hardware power now i considered not purchasing the pc version of btd6 at first i already had the game on my phone and i love it on that platform but i saw the reviews were mixed as of 2 19 19 on pc i wondered why i read many complaints about controls microtransactions and crashing well i m a few hours into the game and i have experienced no crashes the controls are fluid enough just as btd5 was you can easily tap and hold to navigate menus click and drag for tower placement there are hotkeys that are easy to remap and use in game as for the microtransactions i initially thought 18 was a little high for double cash and wished that double money could be purchased with monkey money on pc just like btd5 however it became clear to me why it makes sense for them to still charge 18 for double cash on pc firstly the game is only a few usd more than the mobile price it s not a drastic difference and shouldn t be one worth complaining about it would be incredibly unfair to mobile users who is ninja kiwi s primary target audience as mobile gaming is incredibly profitable from a business standpoint if pc users could simply buy the double cash with in game currency while only paying a few dollars more for their copy of the game as for the argument towards keeping the mobile and pc versions separate i personally enjoy being able to play halfway through an impoppable game on my pc then save quit then restore my profile onto my phone later continuing that game i didn t finish i love the cross platform on this and am glad the versions are combined i also am super happy that whatever microtransactions you purchase on either platform will show up on any linked platform so for instance if i bought double cash on my phone it would be there on my pc copy as well working just fine this is fantastic of ninja kiwi to do this and i wish more companies would overall more than worth the money fantastic game with hours of entertainment value feels like a new and improved bloons experience looks great runs smooth controls fine and barely cost more than a ticket to the movies anyone looking for a tower defense game look no further
