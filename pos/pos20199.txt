2023 praise the omnissiah tricks use the bing gpt cogitator to generate the character picture you would like to use put the files in the wine proton folder create the character to reflect your generated picture technology pretty much solid the fsr support and control of monitor refresh with a bunch of pretty normal expected settings it isn t anything innovative but doesn t disappoint either i can t speak for the ai of the enemies but it seems alright so far the game is running surprisingly smooth although my gpu does get a kick sitting at 75 80c it does look good nothing to complain about gameplay bugs so far nothing worrying the game runs incredibly well on proton it s basically an out of the box title on linux you click and it just works spoken in todd s voice absolutely no setup was required in my case even the multi monitor support on wayland has no issues the game detect the monitor position and runs in windowed mode with 0 problems everything s responsive snappy i was surprised because even titles ran natively on windows often have problems with responsiveness genre oh here we go so basically i believe that the majority of games in wh40k universe or even just wh as released in the last few years so not the original titles like the dawn of war for example are just bad quite terrible and for many reasons mechanicus was perhaps an exception but it still lacked the lore aspect and the writing was just lacking it was reduced to gibberish computer noises and fighting the heresy while the adeptus mechanicus basically evolved as an isolated tech dependent human subrace living on mars and hoarding on technology so not exactly just hating xenos this game however does the lore a favour a good one for the first time in a long while everything is presented as it should have always been at least it seems this way currently you get tech priests doing the tech priest stuff so mostly the very complicated maintenance but also performing the sacred rites you get the smugglers servitors normal human commanders but also the genetically mutated warp navigators you get the sacred relics from the emperor omnissiah and you deal with the dark gods and the influence of the warp this is exactly the core of wh40k it s not just about religious fanatics but also about the general bunch of humans in the broad sense that represent entirely different traits and philosophies making up the imperium of man which just happened to be united by the emperor to put it in contrast space marines are quite literally the special forces of the emperor they are not the entirety of the lore and the wh 40k universe playing this game you finally get to experience everything else the warp deviance the love for toasters the space ship isolation i haven t played for too long but the writing seems to be very solid and represent the ideas very well the dialogue system and ability to get different pieces of lore depending on your character also adds on top of it the rogue trader idea just slaps you are stuck on a spaceship with a mad captain who was given a sacred document that entitles them to basically do whatever the heck they want as long it happens in the outer space of the imperium lmao ps i am not heavily into wh wh40k lore but these are the essentials i would say value for a game that was released just recently i find the pricing to be very good it s below the aaa titles not many aaa titles nowadays are anything more than overpriced garbage i would say it s a very fair price because titles like this one take a lot of hard work so far the universe seems to replicate even the minute details of wh40k seems enjoyable
