what a hard stressful and frustrating game recommended on a more serious note i originally thought this was a city builder but it felt more like a resource management puzzle game you have to gather coal wood steel and food in order to make sure that your population stays warm and fed this might sound easy but before you know it everyone is suddenly starving or ill or both and if they get too angry or lose all hope then they ll be coming for your neck meaning game over the reason it feels like a puzzle game is that each scenario starts out being very challenging for the first couple of days weeks but once you crack the code and get off to a decent start the game pretty much plays itself my only complaint is that in the game it is possible to send out scout expeditions to look for resources or survivors however some of the locations that you come across have a 50 50 chance to either give you some much needed resources or kill your scouts meaning you also lose all the resources they were carrying you can of course choose to ignore those locations but on the hardest difficulty they re very much needed and unless you re willing to risk losing the game on the spot there s really only one solution save scumming other than that i definitely recommend frostpunk as long as you re not looking for a calm and relaxing game
