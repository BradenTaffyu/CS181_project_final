2017 700 hoursthis game is fantastic for new dark souls players it is more forgiving but still has the full spirit of a dark souls game if you quit you will find yourself coming back to it the pvp really different from the other 2 games but its action packed and full of life especially when invading post pontiff 3v3 all day long if you are somewhat interested in a decently hard game you should pick this up and play
