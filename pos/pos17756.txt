2023 an overall excellent game and worthy historical entry to the total war franchise much of its reception is clouded by ongoing gripes with pricing less popular setting community feedback drama with the developer and their other games which are to varying degrees justified but in most cases largely irrelevant to the game itself understand that this is not medieval 3 warhammer 4 nor three kingdoms 2 nor even a troy dlc purge such expectations from your mind and recognise that what is left is a competent egypt themed strategy game with significant improvements to both the battle and campaign layers of prior tw games mixed with 3k style character driven diplomacy tempered with development changes that actually listened to community feedback unit banners switchable unit cards tradeable settlements formation controls modular difficulty settings etc do not get this game if you would prefer a medieval different setting ancient egypt is already relatively niche and this game focuses on the rise of the even more obscure 20th dynasty of egypt its just not gonna be everyone s cup of tea you didn t like troy the base multi resource system strategic layer and battle engine are ultimately still based on troy s even with improvements so if those didn t jive for you then they probably won t now you want an egyptian mythology game no dwarfs crocodile men serpopards sutekh animals medjed shooting death lasers from his eyes godly avatars or other fantastical elements here i m afraid contrary to what the avatar of the gods cosmetic dlc may suggest you like cavalry hate infantry or chariots this is the bronze age bud saddles and stirrups are but a twinkle in an assyrian cavalryman s eye and we re mere decades out from the biggest chariot battle in human history you want a total near east bronze age game no assyria mitanni babylon media elam etc sadly this is very much focused on the nile and levant while it is likely that one or more of these will show up in dlc i think it s prudent to review what s in the game right now rather than what might show up in the futuredo get this game if you like egyptian history duh while some liberties are ofc taken due to the paucity of historical records for many people and places of the time the game s setting is well researched and it shows in the attention to detail in the game s audiovisuals and ui you wish troy was more realistic while troy did eventually get a historical mode like 3k pharaoh was built with it in mind from day 1 so expect a comparatively more grounded take on interpersonal conflict and the bronze age collapse you like character driven politics by far the best feature of 3 kingdoms there are similar court and diplomatic systems here with some omissions notably dynastic stuff since the timeframe is much shorter on the off chance you re still here reading instead of either buying the game or playing something else here are some notable changes from most prior tw games new degradable armour system for more drawn out protracted fights cycling units for fatigue is more important harsher weather and terrain effects location of battles waiting for favourable weather and selective use of fire is now more important court intrigue and character driven diplomacy over key offices and resources similar but not identical to 3 kingdoms or what rome 2 had promised prior to launch unit stances that offer more control over formation behaviour i e pushing line infantry in an attempt to make a breakthrough in enemy ranks or withdrawing the centre to force a cannae style envelopment seasons are back but they re based on ancient egyptian seasons 2 turns per seasons 3 seasons per year and revolve around the ebb and flow of the nile which impacts your agricultural yields combat terrain and politics major changes in court occur per year my primary gripes with the game are largely for price particularly for the special editions that have sizable markup for minor aesthetic differences and nebulous promises for future dlc and for some ui elements for example unit icons on military production buildings show the general weapon type sword spear chariot of the unit but not a unit card that shows what exactly that unit is like in previous tw games the addition of a separate column in the diplomacy menu for mutual pacts non aggression military access alliances etc is also very easy to miss and i ve accidentally declined many favourable overtures from the ai because i thought they were extorting me for resources with nothing in return that besides i m very pleased that i have encountered 0 bugs at all over the course of my first campaign which is not something i have experienced in any other tw game i have played since medieval 1 so that s worth noting all in all i think that while this game s setting will appeal moreso to a smaller niche target audience than most other tw games its solid core mechanics are worth checking out for those willing to see just what a historical tw can do
