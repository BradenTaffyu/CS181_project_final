2023 early access review 135 hrs in and i m addicted i got this to do off roading and rock crawling it is and can be very realistic you will have to do some setting up to allow the vehicle to do what you want but it will this is completely open you get all cars maps settings many many mods to access you can free play as you want how you want or play the time trials and scenarios you do not have to win to move forward and get the vehicle you want it is yours day one the game is evolving and getting better over the years the vehicle physics move react and crash like real vehicles the crawling is a blast build up your vehicle and slow crawl like a real crawler take a lazy drive through the country race a million dollar car roll play with your friends with the multiplayer mod it s up to you this is how gaming should be play your way
