2019 grumpily gave in and bought it at full price due to peer pressure opened the tutorial which is really nice and well designed missing very few concepts that you more or less pick up if you play around anyway and by the time i had gone through all the tutorial had to offer i was already too attached to my little colony that i ended up spending 70 hours in a very short amount of time getting these buggers off the planet it s no dwarf fortress but it hits a sweetspot right in between df and it s own streamlined thing for an autistic 30 year old boomer like myself it s perfect and it seems whatever you might miss in vanilla mods can enhance expand or fix in my one playthrough so far i feel the event variation is a bit too small late game becomes slightly tedious as you are forced to trade travel or call or wait scavenge chance event or slowly drill finite amounts for certain resources which all usually take a lot longer than you d like i m ambivalent about the research tree on one hand it is short and to the point without anything being entirely useless and it acts as little walls from early game into midgame and onto late game however i wish there were more little steps in the tree but in the end it works as it should but outside of those three points there s really nothing to complain about the game offers a wealth of options and a wealth of ways to play it that i have yet to try and am looking forward to give a whirl i appreciate the sort of optional win condition while leaving all the rest up to ones own creativity and story weaving with some cheeky pushes from whichever narrator you pick which is also a very interesting and nice concept and touch 10 10 would have my blind pacifist cannibal doctor amputate my favourite colonist s healthy leg because of a misclick again
