2021 early access review the masochist in me says 10 10 it can be an absolute to play it can be tedious and it can be frustrating especially for people who are new to building cars from scratch or car stuff in general but holy after sinking a lot of time into that piece of crap sutsuma you start off with and hearing it finally start up for the first time gives a dopamine rush equivalent to cocaine man i swear and then you take her for the first test run and it runs like trash you are driving a literal garbage heap building the speed up for your first gear takes ages acceleration is horrible your top speed is akin to a tortoise well what do you do now ya take it apart replace old parts run jobs to pay for those expensive new parts you got piss on your floor drink while driving your uncles van swear at your screen while you struggle to get hay bales onto your damned tractor and maybe even die in a horrible accident probably related to drinking while driving in your uncles van and the entire time while you struggle faced getting all of your parts you need and taking care of yourself you just keep on letting yourself know you got the damn thing running you can do it again this time better and eventually you get the engine all rebuilt with fancy new parts starting it up for the first time only takes a few seconds as opposed to the battery draining first time you tune that god awful chirping and clicking noise out of your car you raise your afr and now your car runs like a dream or so you think until you run the rally and realise you are still a lil fish in the great big ocean and you repeat you rebuild you come back better and drunker this is indeed a very fun game but also a very annoying one my verdict if you like having your balls stomped on you ll probably like this game and if you re an obsessed car guy probably but mostly the former
