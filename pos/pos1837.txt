2017 hmm well again people don t look through the forums or information in the game before they start to complain i ve seen threads where people can t see that the game asks you to start before editing some settings for me the game runs really well on all high except v sync set to off at the beginning you are faced with a side scroller top down combat scenario which i didn t think would be in the game but it was actually really good and it encouraged me to become interested in the story the only thing i d say is that the game runs at 60fps throughout the fight scenes but goes back down to 30fps in the cut scenes but for me i don t mind my system isn t the best either amd 290 fx 8350 16gb ram i will edit this review as i play more but i wanted to post something as the complaints aren t all justified xbe warned there isn t any auto save feature haha i made that mistake i was 30mins in and totally forgot edit this game is so good it s just relentless with the difficulty i really enjoy this game you are really on edge and you can t wait to get stuck in goty
