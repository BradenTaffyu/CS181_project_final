2021 so let me preface this review with the fact that i definitely hate square enix as both a publisher and a developer they botched the pc release of this game i know it we all know it the replicant pc release is not great either square enix is a garbage publisher they botched the avengers and allowed outriders to launch with abhorrent game breaking bugs like people s inventories being deleted after 90 hours and still have not replaced or fixed many people s accounts to this day buying one of their games at full price or as a pre order is a disservice to the industry as a whole and yes i include all final fantasy games including and especially the final fantasy 7 remake which i consider to be the greatest scam ever pulled on 30 40y o nostalgic gamers imagine if they sold each disk of the game individually across multiple generations of console back in the 90s i digress why do i give this game a thumbs up it s simple we need more games like this there are some solid mods that fix most of the issues in the game reshade will add a little life to the colour if you need as well it s all worth the effort i assure you we need more games like this this game is nothing short of a self indulgent romp through a creative mind with unhinged ambition that pays off in a way that really only compares to the oldschool ps2 kojima days this is like playing zone of the enders or metal gear solid for the first time it s hard to describe what exactly the game is and it would ruin the first time experience to spoil too much of it in a review it has a play style that is constantly throwing you across new dimensions and never lets up i guess it s a hack n slash but it s so insanely much more than that the combat is slick and rewarding it crosses genres frequently and continually keeps you on your toes the story is best described as androids exploring both eastern and western humanist philosophy while battling literal symbols of nihilistic industrialism this game is without a doubt a masterpiece it s a flawed masterpiece to be sure but its rewards far outweigh the costs especially if you consider yourself a gaming enthusiast you owe it to yourself to play this game again f ck square enix but this game transcends the garbage publisher who released it you won t regret the bit of extra effort it takes to make this game run smoothly
