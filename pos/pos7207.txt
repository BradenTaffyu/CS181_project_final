2020 irl truck drivers if you re looking to do as i and enjoy just driving and none of the actual real world american trucking problems this is your game no pesky hos or dot to worry about if you turn off fines skip scale houses and get loaded unloaded in under an hour every time loads always pay absurdly high rates unlike being an o o nowadays but there are economy mods that greatly increase difficulty if that s what you re looking for it s got some weirdness sprinkled here and there the kw w900 models are incomplete missing the 86 sleeper and lack any flat top models the peterbilt 579 can t get cab mounted stacks even though that has been a factory irl option since forever no freightliner trucks at all despite them being on of the largest manufactures of american rigs the driver menu and managing things in general is a pain once you have more than 10 drivers doing big fleet changes are a complete hassle own able trailers leave some things to be desired flatbed is not very interesting and a little odd buying the 4 axle 53ft flatbed should allow for much heavier freight than that and should pay more no reason to buy a curtain sider when a dryvan in game does the same job curtain irl can still do a majority of regular flatbed loads that is an odd thing to gloss over and not update not many cargoes on flatbeds anyways you ll probably end up hauling the same 4 things somehow my advice use mod trailers and cargo rework mods or just stick to power only loads that s far more interesting hazmat reefer loads are big loads but do yourself a favor and use an economy mod doing one cross country load for 230k is horribly unbalanced and a few other things you may not even notice but they are pretty obvious to irl truckers if you where to rate the game based on its own content i d give it a 7 10 the foundation is there for a definitive trucking sim for the us just needs some polishing and refining to take it to the next step however the devs did a great job of making the game so amazingly moddable adding and searching for mods is a breeze trucks trailers skins cargoes traffic economy mods there are plenty add some very high quality mods from the great community and the game becomes a much better experience i highly recommend economy mods in short if you re a sim fan or an irl trucker just looking to have a bit of fun you will not be disappointed
