2022 early access review as somebody in his mid thirties who s quite fond of roguelikes i can t help but to write a review about this game for both those who are experienced in the genre and those who aren t first off to all experienced players if you re looking for a classic rogue style experienced about linear dungeon crawling then look elsewhere and avoid getting mad about things you don t like because this game will not give you that caves of qud is a hybrid between the classic angband formula and the more recent sandboxy simulationist style of roguelike think of it like adom s and unreal world s baby if that sounds good to you then go ahead and enjoy it if you expect the more classic endurance gauntlet of the rogue nethack kind of formula you won t find anything like it in this game or rather you will but enforcing that way of playing through the game is fully up to you as a player which is either bad or good depending on who you ask to the older and more savvy rpg player qud might very well interest you if you re a fan of old tsr games gamma world specifically as this game is largely based on 1e gamma world and its ruleset with some generous tweaks and a lot of added novelties when it comes to its setting and creatures but the core game is really just gamma world this makes it already interesting as gamma world based videogames are pretty much nonexistent now as much as i would recommend this game to anybody who s truly interested not just in roguelikes but in the rpg medium as a whole it would be dishonest to say that there s no issues with this game both general issues and personal ones as much as i love it and have plenty of praise for it i also have plenty of criticism some of which i believe would be relevant to both the average player and the more seasoned one alas there s not enough space in here to properly talk about it in details so a short summary will have to make do the good really charming interface for the genre s standard even if you don t like the faux crt filter the game has a distinctive visual style worth praising exceedingly rich in content you ll waste hours and hours of your life exploring the massive world of qud and all its nooks and crannies outstanding modding community which brings truly marvelous additions to an already good base i d say something like hearthpyre is more or less mandatory to fully enjoy qud very immediate and freeform progression compared to more traditional roguelikes there s a large amount of ways to progress through the game and immerse yourself into the world as a character this is not something i can say for a lot of roguelikes which are more concerned about the number crunching rather than the roleplayingthe bad the trumpets in the salt dunes too many easy exploitable mechanics for progression book selling eaters nectar abuse mind control etc somewhat ruin the experience moon stairs update fixed this so early game progression can t be effortlessly cheesed good job alphabeard several mechanical layers like pv dv are questionable in both execution and overall design validity and lead to many issues in both the early and late stages of the game though to be fair the developers did kinda work to fix this in the later years the problems are fundamentally never going away though more hardcore players will notice the design issues very rapidly the trumpets in the salt dunes the lore in the game is largely nonsense and the game books being ai generated nonsense doesn t help really not a strong point of the game despite what some people might tell you there s still memory leaks problems on long runs and you will have long runs similar issues to dwarf fortress though again this issue has become less frequent through the game s development it s still there though and it s only fair to mention itthe ugly the discord community is something to be avoided i m not somebody who dwells on or cares about internet drama but as much as i deeply appreciate the game i cannot bring myself to overlook the awful and beyond hypocritical behaviour of the people behind it unfortunately it is very much a byproduct of the american culture of identity and needless debate and outrage but despite this i still advise to be civil and separate the art from the artist so to speak there s a fundamental disconnection in terms of game design theory and actual intentions that i fear partly stems from the aforementioned unsavory problems and i m not referring to the usual why can t we play as templars deal more about the needlessly linear main quest progression in a game that is all about being open to explore being forced to go through the barathrumite s questline is something exceedingly obtuse pax klank s quest is some of the most horrid quest i ve ever had the displeasure of playing through makes adom s cat king look like the mona lisa of roguelike quests fully paid roguelike this is largely a minor personal issue most people around won t really care about this but as an old timer roguelikes had a certain unspoken code of honor regarding being freeware i won t make grand moral judgments on this but i would be lying if i said that it didn t kinda rub me in a wrong way still paid for it tho the trumpets in the salt dunesto conclude caves of qud is very much a labour of love despite all its issues personal preferences trumpets in the salt dunes and forced internet drama i still can t deny its value as one of the very best of the young generation of roguelikes i wouldn t have wasted hundreds of hours of my time on it if that weren t the case it is not for everyone especially not for the more needy roguelike players who come from the nethack school of hard as balls crawling but it s a rough gem that is slowly but surely getting polished into something truly brilliant despite some of its shortcomings i implore you to avoid falling into the rabbit hole of pseudopolitical hooliganism and internet gossip whether you care or not about the developers political ideas has little to do with the game for any person with a sound mind not to mention you don t have to interact with them at any time it might sound like a lofty comparison but caravaggio s work is not lessened by his despicable behaviour and deeds as a person and i hope we ll never fall so low as to honestly think like that and miss out on good stuff that can bring many hours of fun
