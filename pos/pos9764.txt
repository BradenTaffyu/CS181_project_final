2023 i finally get it i understand how people can pour 1 000 hours into this game after watching one of my best shooters comfort a man who lost his son fall in love with him then defend the camp from a cougar that threatened our horses after watching the same pawn get a blood infection and nearly die because of the stomach wound from the cougar attack after seeing her successfully defend the camp while having malaria shooting the invaders in the head cleanly before trundling herself back to bed and watching her run into a lake because lightning burned her while she was putting out a fire on our camp s batteries and seeing her come back stronger fitter and load up to go on an exploitative trip with her husband only to trigger one of our camp s traps and nearly become decapitated i finally see how people can pour thousands of hours into this game and can safely say i m likely to be one of them i wouldn t be surprised if i end up the same way
