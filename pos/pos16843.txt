2019 house flipper is a great relaxing little game where you purchase homes fix them up clean the junk out of them and sell to the highest bidder there are multiple buyers who represent groups of people and what they re looking for in a new home meet their needs and sell to them to earn your steam achievements the devs seem to constantly be working on updates garden flipper dlc came around it seems due to the request of players so feedback is heard and acted on the only negative i have at this time is that options for design are limited for example there is only 1 shower you can use a couple couches etc but i expect more options in the future great game good for all ages 4 5 until there are more design purchase options in game
