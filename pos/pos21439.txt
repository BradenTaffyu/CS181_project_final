2023 quickfire reviewevery now and then i come back to scratch the itch that i have to pick a car and drive around either to race or to hear the roar of an engine forza horizon 5 was my most recent pick and the tl dr version of it mindblowing fun all around run it with logitech g920 driving force wheel pedals shifter or better and you re set for the full experience some minor gripes i had would include the player interface and maybe some character customization options but these aren t game changers and simply would be a plus to see improved upon in future titles conclusionfinal verdict atruth be told i think forza horizon 5 does almost everything right in terms of the content gameplay and replay value they only improved further on the fh4 format you all know how it is these days if it ain t broke don t fix it
