2017 whenever i feel bored or sad i just hit up ets2 get a job with like 2000km distance tune to 80 s hotmix radio or put on some superior eurobeat and play for the rest of the afternoon never expected it to be so enjoyable to be honest but it s great at taking stuff off my mind it s also very comfy to drive on a rainy night with nobody else on the road and just cruising with high beams also the multiplayer s pretty good though it nearly killed my save so i m taking a break from it
