2023 this game stands on a mighty pedestal above everything else with a half ironic simulator title released in the past two decades powerwash simulator is not a sim and it knows that every object you clean is just a texture layered on another texture and different nozzles guns remove that texture more efficiently than others you re waving a photoshop delete tool around for twenty hours the beauty of pws comes from the writing this isn t one of the dozens of shovelware polish sim games pumped out every quarter the writing isn t edgy for the sake of being edgy to give streamers something to react to during the first two hours story and charming character work doesn t magically stop happening after the two hour steam refund window is up if anything the breadcrumbs of story in pws snowball into a big goofy overarching story about wacky occurrences in this small metro area that all coincidentally require the services of a professional power washer if you ve read this far please take it from me power through the tree house level keep in mind that hitting the c button to detatch your cursor and allow you to move the washer around the screen is a crucial tool ignore the stats on the washers they re all direct upgrades
