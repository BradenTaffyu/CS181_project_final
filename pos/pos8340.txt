2019 this game is amazing so far i ve played two scenarios one on normal and one on hard several times and a bit of endless mode and it just keeps being excitingly stressful visuals are very good and it s as if it sucks all the heat out of the house while playing the whole atmosphere screams desperation it s really tense it s also one of those just five more minutes games that deprives you of your time to rest or sleep
