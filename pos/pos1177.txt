2020 early access review i ve always been interested in survival games and project zomboid has caught my eye from the beginning when i first played it i admired the potential and now i think i can finally say that this game is entirely playable i recently sunk several dozen in hours into a single player run that spanned about 7 different survivors including a master carpenter who built a beautiful walled safehouse in rosewood and then sadly perished attempting to retrieve the keys to the dash his predecessor had left parked out front however the final perfectly zomboid flavored cherry on top came many hours later i was playing as my best and most successful survivor with everything from carpentry to foraging at a 5 6 plus a solid several months under my belt i was producing five times the amount of food that i needed from my farming foraging and trapping and after about 3 months had over a years supply of fresh and frozen produce not counting my stock of dry or canned goods i felt pretty much invincible no need to stray far from my well fortified base and plenty of time and food to finish reading all those skill books i headed to bed one simple night after watering my crops made myself some potato stir fry and lay down to sleep rather abruptly i was awakened to the stove that i had left on exploding and wiping out my entire supply of food and water before i could react the fire had spread to my bookshelves destroying my hard sought skill books i managed to grab an extinguisher that i kept near the door but never expecting to actually use it the damn thing only had enough juice to put out the living room as i ran back and forth from my rain collectors in a panic with only a water bottle to douse the flames i watched helplessly as the fire consumed my armory with dozens of rifles and pistols along with crates of ammo that i had yet to fire a single round of tragically my brave survivor perished from severe burns while ironically trying to stop the fire spreading to the water barrels themselves 10 10 cannot recommend burning alive after surviving the apocalypse enough
