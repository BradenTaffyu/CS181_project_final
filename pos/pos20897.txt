2020 john lennon once said life is what happens to you while you re busy making other plans story max caulfield a photography student who comes back to the fictional arcadia bay after five years for the country s top photography program during a gun incident in her school max finds out she s gifted with time rewind one thing leads to another to reunite her with chloe her best friend before leaving arcadia bay as they start a journey to find a mysteriously vanished friend life is strange lis feels strangely accurate yet bitter and similar to some of our school life dramas the way it tackles themes of teenage youth though not always entirely convincing demonstrates a teenager s life through their eyes in a magnificent manner it makes you ponder how harsh twisted and dark a teen s world could get the first episodes start very calming and colorful til it grows on you then turns intensely darker devilish and desperate while max realizes every single decision she makes leads to a butterfly effect www americanscientist org only causing more confusion and destruction every time she rewinds the story has its flaws largely related to time travel plot holes if you re zooming too much on it however it s still a striking experience most importantly the main idea is friendship and of course the sci fi stuff is just there to make it more interesting max is shy carefree of drama but passionate and optimistic her opposite pole chloe is sassy rebel edgy but still energetic despite what she s been through although some side characters are stereotypical definitely not horrendous but also not quite enjoyable original and well written however it depends on how you re looking at it every stereotype should presumably represent a type of teenager at school so that you can have all uncomfortable topics such as bullying suicide etc and high school clich s in one game also some characters are more complex the first impression can be deceiving except for a couple of novels that were turned into films i have barely sat through any long reads in my 23 years of life but max s diary made me eagerly read all of its 73 pages in one sitting she passionately describes the events of her everyday life in her sketch and doodle decorated diary as you progress through the episodes also she writes on how she feels about different characters in her diary instead of having a typical formally written character entry log which is a nice touch lis is about making difficult choices handed to you on a silver plate pun intended a screenshot of life is strange by amirite gameplay unlike some of the telltale games lis narrative cutscenes exploration and puzzles are well mixed with adequate space between them which puts lis ahead of the pack each episode consists of two parts free exploration where you can walk around chat with lots of characters and interact with many objects mostly not bounded by a time limit puzzles and key conversations relies on an error and trial you have to watch it happen observe your surroundings learn the facts and then rewind to undo your mistakes like many other stroy rich choices matter titles your actions won t truly affect and alter the course of the story things take place regardless of your decisions but still for each one of the choices something good in the short term could turn out worse later or vice versa for example something insignificant but rather nice you said to a character at the beginning of the game might prove helpful in changing the said person s fate at the end of the next episode and lead to extra scenes later on it s mostly just details that make the fictitious world of lis deeper and replayable to make a connection with your personality and your type of protagonist not about things with essential consequences there are places where max can sit down in a looping cutscene she shares her insights about recent events these moments are ever so relaxing with the help of calming music that you easily get lost into and wish they d never end in fact they don t unless a key is pressed since max is all about her instant camera collectibles in lis are presented as photo ops some being straightforward shots while some others require a notch of interactivity with the objects each episode lasts about 2 3 hours the story can last up to 20 hours if you re taking time interacting with and reading everything life is strange a screenshot of life is strange by amirite graphics considering lis revolves around an art school it was the right choice bringing in hand painted art and visuals the arcadia bay the beach the school the junkyard and all the other locations have a melancholic peerless autumnal atmosphere that suits the game s dreamy and unique painted visuals also it s balanced with a realistic design to be in tune with its dark plot well lis is not a aaa title and it s developed with a low budget therefore big technical issues are expected textures are often not detailed enough along with shadows looking pixelated and jagged in some cases additionally lip syncs are terribly out of place and immersion killer characters during gameplay conversations look emotionless and robotic except for the cutscenes sounds although the licensed tracks may come from not so known artists i can certainly say it is some god tier indie folk never have i heard a soundtrack that works so perfectly hand in hand with a game s narrative not many games could accomplish the genuine charm of a gentle acoustic guitar playing under a graphical sunset in the fall voice acting on the other hand is a job well done but doesn t live up to the greatness of ost some of the important characters including max and chloe have been voiced impeccably you can feel the joy in their voice when the characters are happy despite the poor facial animations or you can clearly tell they had a lump in their throat and wanted to sob when dubbing some of the dramatic moments in the game several side characters are somewhat excluded from this fact and it seems they re trying too hard to read the lines with faked emotions i guess lis could bring anybody s inner photographer out a screenshot of life

conversations in episode 5 she has no lip sync at all conclusionlife is strange is one of those happens once in a lifetime gaming experiences while not without flaws it tells a believable story teen drama wise that keeps the player engaged until the end it has hand drawn art and texts all around the game that distinguishably differs lis from other games of the genre this experience is so unique
