2021 if you decide to get this game make sure you have a goal if you find yourself running out of things to do or you have finished your goal the game will stagnate in an instant this game is solo friendly but without a great motivator the gameplay will quickly just devolve into mindless farming and trying to maximize your own personal performance for endgame content which is not as hard as you would expect the endgame revolves around constant daily and weekly grinding for minimal rewards and the only benefit is personal fulfillment it is fun but make sure you have good company and goals
