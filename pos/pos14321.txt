2023 early access review actual playing hours about 240 it s the kind of game i will leave open until i come back from whatever this is my favourite game of the last 10 years every time i come back to it i get addicted again for several weeks during which when i m free and not in the game i m thinking about it or reading its reddit space anything i say about dsp will not make it justice but it s about time i post a review so here goes nothing i love cities skylines oxygen not included and sim games in general and i love sci fi so this was a predictable match still this game unexpectedly offered me what no man s sky could not the feeling of grandeur of massive space exploration of getting lost in space to slowly build your way up to conquering it and moving in it as if your home is everywhere the landscapes are awe inspiring both the natural and the ones built by you with amazing graphics but that s not the game s core its core is automation and the freedom on the speed to approach it is fantastic some people start automating everything away crunching numbers and even making spreadsheets to find the most efficient factory blueprint some others like me were doing some things manually up to the point of getting tired and automating some of it slowly but surely building our way to massive factories that nonetheless work like a charm except now that i expanded my processor factory suddenly i m not producing enough silicon dsp doesn t push you out of your comfort zone until you want but you have to in order to advance and it rewards you with that pride that only us creators know well making your factory work is quite easy making it beautiful or bigger or efficient in space or energy or resources or whatever you want that is up to you and the 3d of it all just tops it off you will feel all your other sims maps too flat after this you know you are in a sphere and you want to this is by no means what you d expect from an early access i have been playing this treat for a year and a half and it keeps getting better i would absolutely recommend this beast 10 10 as it is now even without the upcoming optional combat update with the update though i m afraid i will need higher numbers to rate it and holidays
