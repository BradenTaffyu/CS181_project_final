2017 i dont see why people hate this so much fantasy what s reason to be hated though you got spell air units and monster etc do you think these will come to a historical one too much dlc it look terrible when you see how many dlc out there but every one of those give you a whole new experience each race has their own unique system if i remember correctly the past games had only different faction traits no the base game give you 4 races with 1 free dlc though i enjoyed playing rome medieval2 shogun2 rome2 and attila but when i played this i cant come back at all
