2021 early access review would i recommend buying this in ea yes and here s why i have lost a week to this game so i think it is safe to say that i d recommend it whilst it is ea and there are some minor issues the game feels and plays amazingly for an ea the reviews saying it is factorio and satisfactory s love child are a little superficial but also valid yes they all share elements i e they are factory building games but to equate them is like saying all fps or rpg games are the same or similar this game has elements of factorio it has elements of satisfactory but it also has elements of stranded deep in so far as you hop from location to location collecting resources but unlike all of them it has no enemies to fight the only thing i can pick and it is being really nit picky i admit is that the broken english in the tutorials descriptions and instructions can be a little confusing at times in places it feels like the game is running direct through google translator don t get me wrong it is done well considering english is not their first language and it is obvious they have put serious effort into it but at this stage it is lacking i hope they source a translator to fix up the grammatical errors in game other than my grammar nazism i can t fault it much it is ea after all the early game can be a little grindy at times but like factorio once you realise that everything everything can be automated the rest just falls into place and lets you focus on exploration and expansion bigger is better in this game so never think you have overdone it with something you ll want to get off world asap and start setting the foundations for massive resource projects as the resources on your home world will deplete quickly then again in this game like with stranded deep s island hopping any planet can be your home world also you can make more than one dyson sphere which leads to the late game the late game at this stage drags out as the cost of research and new tech increases whilst you can speed them up by increasing production the construction of the dyson sphere itself drags on and seems to be overly expensive considering other production and especially because you have to research the same tech 4 times to complete it hopefully as the devs improve the game things will balance out a bit more but as i said in the beginning i would recommend this game at this price as an ea absolutely it feels a lot more polished than most other ea games
