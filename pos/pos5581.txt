2020 early access review it s almost harvesting season tl dr it tends to crash the balance is broken and many systems are being worked on and implemented but these issues that every early access game under the sun has pales in comparison to the sheer scope depth scale and fun of the most ambitious medieval sandbox game to release in the past decade warband cranked to 11 not without it s problems crashes and broken balance as an early access game but even with bannerlord mod bombed i experience significantly less crashes and issues as of 1 2 0 personally get the community patch with vortex mod manager or install manually simple and easy installation that will make your gameplay significantly more stable taleworlds even borrowed some of the most popular mods made for warband and incorporated them straight into vanilla bannerlord infantry bouncing off shield walls archers blotting out the sun with volleys of arrows cavalry charging with spears couched headlong into the breach and trebuchets reducing castle walls to rubble all of which in real time with hundreds of units on screen at one time every unit is a single entity that responds to reacts to and fights another unit or you lines will break from morale depletion attrition will occur if your or other lords morale is not managed stratagems from any of your favorite sword and shield rts s will translate seamlessly to the battlefield in bannerlord it is quite simply an rts with your own boots on the ground if you wish there is also auto resolve player combat is not only refreshing but frankly fun as hell every aspect of combat has been improved upon from warband from graphic fidelity to combat mechanics to animations although not hyper realistic sword fighting and weaponplay is addictive you will find yourself chasing looters for days just to s stomp them for the fun of fighting and the plunder highly highly recommend xorberax s cut through everyone mod cleaving a handful of units with a broadsword on horseback is not only more realistic but makes you feel truly as powerful as you probably should be late game the ui is being worked on but there are glaring improvements in all aspects of menu navigation from warband cities castles and fiefs now have a stylized and more aesthetically pleasing menu card and notables have portraits at the top of the menu which allow you to teleport straight to them to eliminate manhunting important people to talk to troop recruitment is also much more visual and allows you to select specific units how many units you are buying displays your current party size and lets you know when you are over your limit fully dynamic world economy with shifting supply and demand that responds directly to not only your trade but the ai s as well becoming a medieval capitalist has never been more engaging and rewarding flooding a city or region with a certain good will affect it s demand supply lines can be cut if peasants are intercepted while dropping goods off in cities caravans can be plundered en route to their destination yes even your own and sieges can block cities from receiving goods all of which potentially affecting your workshop caravan and city revenue keeping the scope of the world economy in mind the game world itself is absolutely f ing massive there is a ridiculous amount of cities fiefs and castles to visit plunder or do trade with all of which operated under the guiding hand of their respective owners kingdoms span for miles upon miles maintaining their borders while wrestling for control with each other there are plenty of kingdoms all of which moving gold and waging war dynamically with each other constantly and within these kingdoms smaller bands of warriors reside small fiefless clans wander their territories and can be fought or brought into your eventual kingdom even still bandits and looters scurry from treeline to treeline and along the foothills of mountains to stash their plunder at their raidable hideouts peasants and caravans make haste for their destinations to keep the gears of the economy grinding the game world feels alive and organic at all times a mark plenty of games miss maintaining relationships within the realms is important because as is clear from the above you will be the smallest fish in the pond for a good length of time there is a much heavier emphasis on relationships now much more than warband some people won t even talk to you or will not allow you to accept quests if you are not on good terms with them the amount of troops you can recruit from notables is also affected by relationships and they will even deny you troops if you are not on good standings fief and city management is much more hands on as there is plenty to build and improve within them the management is accompanied by ui elements that help you visualize what you are building and will allow you to mouse over them to reveal what exactly each building does siege oriented buildings add depth to castle and city defense allowing you higher garrisons more militia and increased siege build speed solid usage based skill system think skyrim that builds organically through gameplay relevant to applicable skills ride your horse to level up your riding skill etc no dumping points into skills after reaching another level just so you can eventually play how you want type of progression you are not dovahkiin or some imperative prophet to the balance of the universe you start exactly as any lowly sword for hire would in the medieval period with a few weapons relevant to your character s starting skills horse the clothes on your back a small coin purse and no clout whatsoever people will only know your name once you begin making ripples within the realms of the world or once you begin collecting battle scars lords will politely state they have no idea who the f you are if they have never heard of you although official tools unfortunately have not been released to the public just yet the extensive modding support stitched into the game offers far more than warband could taleworlds really listened as the game was built from the ground up to be modded to high hell planned mods in development range from got mods to lotr mods warhammer 40k fantasy mods please and thank you a lot of the true potential for this game lies in the modding support and community the game is already great out of the box bannerlord is constantly being rebalanced as taleworlds continues development but at the current state of the game i would highly recommend balance tweak mods as the game in vanilla is still incredibly grindy even with the latest rebalances plus as the vanilla game balance is found and saves tend to be unstable sometimes it s a lot more feasible to build quick with the mods learn the mechanics of the game and to start anew once you have a different or refined playstyle in mind everything in the game is value based which insures you are on the same playing field as other lords within the game for the most part for instance with modding you cannot mod one aspect of the game simply for your own benefit if you raise the general income of cities with tweaks ai will reap the benefits just as you will this game is early access and many of the systems within the game are planned to be even more fleshed out more systems are planned to be added into vanilla entirely there truly is no comparison within the medieval sandbox genre the size scale fun factor and sheer addictiveness of this game dwarfs any other title within the genre this game is one of the few true sandbox experiences on the steam store and should not be overlooked merely because of the early access label
