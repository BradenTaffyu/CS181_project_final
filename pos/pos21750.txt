2020 art design had to stop playing to appreciate it incredibly polished good enough to play through has some flaws hurts to look at pixelated eye torture fun factor maximum replay value hours of fun has good pacing didn t catch my attention lost the will to play sleep simulator audio music beautiful beyond words has many good moments sounds as good as it plays not very moving bad tracks sounds crazy bus pc requirements it runs doom potato quality average laptop average desktop pc gaming rig intel supercomputer difficulty skill ceiling insert game relaxing with few challenges steady learning curve easy to pick up hard to master requires hours of repetition learning the cockpit of an apache helicopter grind i already have the best gear fast and easy progression balanced between effort and reward takes some time to shine feels like work my weekend for a horse story my emotions very well written has good elements story elements aren t necessary jumping the shark cringeworthy average play time very little short average long very long no real end game bugs no disruptions bugs add to the experience minor disruptive bugs stopped the game a little crashes sometimes p l e a s e k il l me overall summary the third game in a series that has become the benchmark by which difficult games are measured dark souls 3 takes no prisoners and demands your attention and prowess to overcome obstacles as you trudge through it s melancholy setting desperately working towards extending the dying breath of the world or snuffing the flame forever the story does not take a larger presence beyond the start of the game but rather slowly feeds you information through the environment items you acquire and characters you meet through your journey i ve found that this organic method of player involved lore building is the best way to present apocalyptic settings where the ashes of a once mighty empire are all that remain the combat strikes a great balance in that it is fast paced and varied enough to allow for multiple avenues of counter play there will be the occasional death trap or room full of enemies but with enough practice and repetition these hurdles can be leaped over with ease each difficult fight in the game can easily be won by figuring out an enemy s attack patterns or weakness the same concept also applies to the pvp which has so much depth to it that it is still played to this day compared to the pvp in the previous two titles this one stands out as being the most polished souls experience for pvp i do highly recommend this game as it has a massive amount of replay value and is one masterpiece that i often times see myself revisiting to claim souls in pvp or re learn each memorable boss fight
