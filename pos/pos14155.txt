2018 early access review i barely wirte a review but all i have to say you like management you like building and surviving you like creating system that holds you forever so you can dig the entire comet and make a spaceship whit a rocket inside that spaceship omg just buy it already sale or not the game is great and the updates are so constant you get so much new content so quick a lot of devs out there must be jealous
