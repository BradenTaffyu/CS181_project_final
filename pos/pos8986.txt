2016 first a basic tl dr good game but has flaws ok let me start by saying i really like this game which actually makes it all the more painful that its flaws are so pronounced and lets be honest been around for ages since i bought the game actually the biggest issue i have is sector ai you cannot get around using them if you want to expand they absolutely hate using their own resource stockpile i have my oldest sector with 200k energy and minerals last i checked that was probably 50 years ingame ago yet they love taking my resources off me to destroy the planets in their control you will lose planets you give them from rebelling first thing you will know about it is when you see the map as they regularly starve your population or overfeed them don t be suprised if one planet has 40 food and another has 12 food the ai just loves doing that war demands are pathetic and too limited want to take out another empire thats big well it will take countless wars doesnt matter if you get them to cede planets or liberate them more on that later because when you get you 2 5 worlds on average you cannot attack them again for another 10 in game years so better hope they dont have 50 100 worlds else well enjoy the long war liberation yeah it can be viable if you pause the game the second you win the war to make them a vassal or the likes because if you don t well the ai will snatch them back up instantly ground combat is beyond boring seriously you put ships in orbit pop their shields land your troops can do it before but will take more troops watch the health go down on both sides whoever runs out of troops first wins btw did i meantion the troops are simply an icon with a health bar that circles it yeah very engaging ground battles a feature very easy to over look is the troop attachments to install them you need to land them planet side click on the troop click the attachment click on the next repeat for each one its fine early game where you might have 20 50 troops but late game where you can litterally have 400 troops its well not really worth it no bulk upgrades like on ships atleast not what i can find it took me long enough to find out where the attachments were space battles well atleast you can min max customise your fleet to a kind of limited extent to counter your latest enemy but you cant specifically target any of their ships so better hope the ai gods favour you and actually focus on the big hitters instead of the bombers coming at you the in game event spam and pop ups feels like your surfing the net in the 90s or early 2000s in a middle of a big space war and need to retreat well better hope a basically full screen pop up doesnt come along and make you lose that fleet single player its fine it pauses the game multiplayer you don t have that option sure you can turn it off but that turns off everything no filtering is available got vassalised or have an overlord well you better fight your way out because their base acceptance will forever be in the negatives no matter how much they love you sure you can say what player would release another player if they were getting a portion of your income but it kind of breaks the game if your not allowed to break off from them when they now trust you completely again federations where to start they seem great but honestly they just hurt you costing you 2 influence more on that later a month to have one along with the hit to your fleet capacity just hurts you if you invite any npcs into the federation they will eventually get control of the federation fleet and you better hope your not at war because they waste it they will either keep it in one of their systems not doing a thing randomly follow one of your smaller fleets around or simply suicide it against a fleet costing you warscore so the only viable way is to only invite actual players and let the npcs do their own thing influence by far the most important resource you get in the game really anything worth doing in the game costs influence suppressing factions forming a federation colonising planets building and maintaining frontier outposts hiring leaders upgrading your plantary capitals a few buildings and spaceport attachments need them forming defensive pacts editcs the list goes on so much uses it but you get so little from actually playing the game early game its fine you will usually sit at the low cap of 1000 but late game well you might need to wait months to hire a leader or worse yet all those planets you just acquired leech your influence so much to suppress you now have 0 so no more admirals or scientists the ui is very lacking you want to build ships in one of your sectors shipyards well you have a couple of choices but the easiest i found is press m to go to the big map find the world click on the system to zoom into system view click on the planet click spaceport build ships so you need 5 steps just to get to build a ship there desperately needs to be an option to have your sectors spread the building across all their planets especially when you consider late game your sectors may have hundreds of planets in them your core worlds will range from 5 20 so those extra spaceports are very useful to build a fleet fast in a large battle its the same for your core worlds really lets say you have 5 planets you have to click on the planet name spaceport build go to next planet and repeat over and over to get ships out fast making it remarkably tedious to build ships if it had core worlds spaceport and spread the load it would make it alot less micro and click intensive finally the ships you have corvettes destroyers cruisers and battleships they are customisable but not alot 1 3 sections no massive titans or dreadnoughts or even capital ships unless you use mods for a massive space 4x game having only 4 buildable spaceship types is rather dismal mind you there are other ships in the game fallen awakened empires extrademensional visitors the scourge all have unique and powerful ships even the pirates have unique ships there are many other things i have issues with in this game and writing this review i honestly asked myself numerous times why i even play the game the list of things i like are so much smaller than the list of things i want to see fixed though i still play and the reason why i think is though the game is flawed might even go as far as to say it should be classed as a beta release still its an entertaining game to play with friends it could be deeper it definately needs polish and mods really do fix alot of that automated explore mod is one that should be in the game from the start not a research a space faring race doesnt know how to let a scientist you know those smart people that have more than 2 braincells explore how they see fit i do recommend the game i even bought the dlc for it well one of them the others are in my eyes a joke for their price soundtrack should be free in my eyes a novel should be around 1 and another race which is just art and what do you know a mod can do that too for free i would recommend buying it and playing it if your unsure about the game wait for it to drop in price and have a sale you shouldn t regret it
