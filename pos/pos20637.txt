2022 a fantastic action adventure game with great narrative art direction beauty and chaos instead of being a story solely about the trials kratos faces this one has its quiet moments kratos s backstory makes him almost the original sad murder dad of games and while his previous adventures were sort of peak degeneration x in their tone in this god of war it foregrounds him being a father his relationship with atreus his struggle to know what being a good dad might mean and to express love in a way his son understands is the heart of the game the unreal setting for it disappears behind the amazing performances of the voice actors just being a man and a boy who don t understand each other but want to it starts from things like kratos hesitating to show his son affection to atreus struggling with the sheer amount of violence that s required of him to atreus commenting on events expressing admiration for a particularly good shot or defeating an enemy as the game goes on he ask for advices or disagree with kratos more openly seek approval or gently make fun of his old dad in return kratos gives approval begins to respect atreus s skills and smiles they meet each other somewhere in the middle balancing pragmatism and empathy in the end of it all this game is a story about family you see their relationship everywhere in the game in the architecture of ruined temples in the side quests you re given in every single supporting character who seems to be paired up with a family member somehow a mirror of kratos son it affects in the narrative how you fight how you explore how you interact with other characters they re themes that have been dealt with in games before but the subtlety with which god of war expresses them is incredibly well written for a series that began on playstation 2 with kratos fighting a hydra on roaring seas as a ship crumbles around them it s fitting that now almost two decades later the most important moments of god of war are no longer found in the magnificent boss battles and set pieces but simply from the conversation between a father and his son a dialog while they are sailing slowly toward their goal it s an example that a game doesn t necessarily need a complex synopsis but an execution well done the combat is also extremely fun a complete overhaul and revitalization from it s previous games unlike anything that s come before god of war on pc is also the definitive way to play it s more than worth going back to play even if you played it previously on console it excells as an excellent port god of war never looked better bringing into sharp relief an art style that s colourful brutal and incredibly inventive with practically faultless performance even on a machine that isn t at the absolute bleeding edge of pc technology if you are into story driven games you shouldn t miss it out an absolutely essential game
