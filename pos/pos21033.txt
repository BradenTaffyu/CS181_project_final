2018 a rollercoaster ride of colour and cuteness it looks simple enough and i thought it would keep me entertained for a couple of hours boy was i in for a shock every time i thought i d reached the limits of the map there was another slime door to open the world expanded and expanded like a slime gordo being fed its favourite food the slimes are cute and friendly mostly and you ll find at the beginning that you horde pink slimes and dote on them and talk to them and feel like the richest rancher alive every time one poops out a little pink plort i remember those days of feeling horrified if you saw a slime fall into the water and die and of apologising if you had to let some go free from your ranch but oh how things change when the newbucks greed sets in and you start breeding plorts like mad by keeping insane amounts of slimes in slave like conditions you re keeping hen hens and roostros just to breed them furiously like the pimp you are you re mercilessly throwing slimes into the water when they re no longer useful even throwing them in the incinerator without batting an eye no slime is safe or has a permanent place on your ranch you ll give any slime the boot the moment a more profitable one comes along and the slimes themselves aren t good enough for you anymore oh no they re not you insist on turning them into largos for double plort output this game will make you a monster i ve caught a hunter gordo and looked him dead in the eyes i ve created a money making farm of mosaic saber slimes living on silver parsnips to making over 20k a day i ve played catch with a briar hen chick and saved it just before it drowned in the slime sea i ve brought life to the glass desert then stripped it dry again like the power hungry god i ve become i ve drilled to the core of the earth and fallen asleep to the gentle whirr of plort collectors i ve mastered the technology of the phase slimes and created teleporters to save me walking two feet round the corner and when a pink slime ate a plort that i wanted before i could suck in into my vac gun i watched with malicious glee as a tarr slime came up and devoured that thief i could have helped but chose not to that pink slime won t steal from me again from caves to the highest peaks i ve seen and done it all and now it s up to you two doors lie in front of you reader beyond the first lies the future where you don t buy this game you ll never get a 7zee club member reward you ll never feel the thrill of having 400 gold plorts filling up your silo you ll never wrestle with a crystal boom largo or feed cuberries to cute little honey slimes you ll never stay up at night wondering if a rad slime is more rad than you after all he can do that cool glowy thing behind the second door is the path of buying this game you ll earn the title of slime rancher and consider putting it on your resume you ll sigh at the tranquility of puddle slimes and realise they can teach you so much about how to coast through life and some day maybe just maybe you ll get to hold a gilded ginger in your hands i know which door i chose and take it from an experienced slime rancher like me if you have any sense in the world you ll follow me through that second door two doors reader i ll meet you in ogden s retreat
