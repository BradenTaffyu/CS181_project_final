2016 ok so i ve just beat the dragonslayer armour and had left with 9 etsus flusks and 0 fp i reach the next bonfire which is pretty close i light the bonfire but i don t rest at it because there is a summon sign i summon this myla the thief which i though at first that it was an npc but a few seconds he she jumps around near the elevator contramption which is near the bonfire and i realize that thief is spelt wrong and that he she is a player he she collapse and then starts to go ahead in the grand archives we fight with the crystal sage and the other enemies which are new to me even the hands on the bookshelfs were weird because i didn t use the wax while we fight and advance i start to notice that myla was using only a small dagger and he she was showing me to use the hidden ladders and levers he she even showed me the part where are the gargoyles outsides we get outside of the library and he she collapse i though that it was because of the statue and that it was something about the story a few seconds later i realize that we are attacked by 2 npcs who look human 1 second later i noticed the archer too we win the fight against this trio and proceed further to the bridge with the stairs where i was close to die a few times yet we reach the end of the stairs and there is a room with a fog wall i saw a summon sign so i summoned it it was sirris of the sunless realms a true npc i go through the fog and soon they come too we fight with this boss lorian elder prince where i was trying to learn his mechanics finally we won or at least that s what i though the we won wasn t actually a win because the boss wasn t dead it was only the first phase of it we looked doomed sirris was almost dead and i had only half of hp 1 etsus flusk and 1 divine blessing but we fight and fight i get knocked a few times by the mechanics which i didn t knew yet myla was fighting with his her dagger a boss whom he know that it was my first time we tried to aggro the boss one by one he was hitting him a few times getting his aggro and then i was doing the same trying to do my best even if it looked over i fought with only 20 hp while the boss had half on the second phase in the end our struggles pay off the boss is dead we rejoice with our gestures and spamming the animation for the empty etsus flusks while i light the bonfire i realize that i had 261320 souls and later i realize that i ve just beat the last lord of cinder lothric younger prince whom he was in phase two of the boss and this my friend is the story of my co op journery in dark souls 3 with a thief whom had only a dagger a journey that i won t forget so soon edit fun fact i had my estus flask at 0 because i didn t knew that you could make later i ve found out through some wiki
