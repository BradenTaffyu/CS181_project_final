2023 i like it it plays like aoe 2 but has more unique aspects for each of the civilizations like aoe 3 a sort of combination of the two games which i think works well the campaigns are interesting enough with some historical trivia and the ai feels pretty good in singleplayer it s also pretty easy to pick up but harder to master
