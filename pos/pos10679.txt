2019 as the three year mark for this game has been met i can say this about the current state of the game is this game for everyone no not at all you have to be hardcore into rts or strategy game to have an enjoyable time the game has a learning curve that takes a while to understand but once you learn the game becomes funner and overall better the amount of features this game has is insane and the modding community make the game better on a daily basis i personally prefer the millennium dawn mod a modern day depiction of the game is the dlc worth it yes and no the dlc changes the game in many aspects mostly with focus trees which can change history my favorite is the opposition of hitler and restoring the kaiserreich if you play single player only you may need to purchase the dlc but the lads at paradox have made it where if the host of a multiplayer game has the dlc all players may access and use it for that game to me it makes covers how expensive some of the dlcs run if you have a dedicated friend group it can really make up for not everyone having the dlcwhat is the community like it is a hit or miss typically any game that is labelled meme game i stay away from but they can be fun from time to time if you are new to this game you may have a hard time getting along with the veterans but in all of the encounters that i have had the player base has been understanding and helpful in learning the core mechanics of the game but there are those people who will scream in their mics and the little kids who try to be edgy because what else are they good at but all in all pretty solid communitycan you mega campaignwe should start off as to what this is the mega campaign is going through multiple games to the next typically starting at ck2 yes you can there are online converters that help convert save files through the games and they are a boat load of funall in all i do recommend this game for anyone who is into rts or wanting to get into them get it when it goes on sale with some of the dlc if you would like
