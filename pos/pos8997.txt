2019 before i start i played it first on 2 2 patch and without dlc well it sure is a grand strategy by paradox my first game took 60 hours sixty hours of course i now know after watching a few tutorials and explanations on the internet how to cut this time down video explanations help and some might be actually needed at least this time tooltips and tutorial texts are somewhat helpful and get you started stellaris is amazing for strategy players it s a must buy from the first space race of exploring and securing nearby planets the game drifts seemlessly into colony management and becomes a micromanagement nightmare after twenty hours there are mechanics in place to ease this into a self regulating process but these mechanics i didn t find for the first 50h the love poured into this game especially shows in the anomalies and event chains which reference xcom star trek the teapot between earth and mars and what not whenever i thought i got everything i quickly remembered that other thing that i ignored for the last 10 minutes the game has everything except romance options from 4x base building fighting wars changeing space landscape terraforming civil rights research ship design criminality and unemployment sanctions diplomacy genetic race improvement and those were the systems i remembered spontaneously if i ever stay on one game only stellaris is a strong contender stellaris is madness if you are new to grand strategy games you will be completely lost making this game a rogue like it would still be an entertaining game this way and that makes it fantastic if i would want to improve the game i would double down on tutorial stuff and add another speed up arrow or 2 to the faster option absolutely worth it but stellaris has the paradox disease that means that you get reminded a lot that there are some dlcs missing if you don t buy everything race portraits that you cannot pic federation options picking the megacorporation or hivemind traits they are there but you do not get to pic them you can play against a megacorp but you won t be one i find it actually rage inducing to sink a lot of resources into building a megastructure just to learn that the last phase can only be build with a dlc that i don t have erase the whole option from my game but do not dangle the monetization in front of my face paradox that s nasty follow my curator at
