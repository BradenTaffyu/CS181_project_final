2016 early access review welcome to your new home good luck not getting killed rimworld is a colony builder survival simulation game from one man dev team ludeon studios in rimworld you re presented with a scenario and using the group of people and resources you get your aim is to survive on a randomly generated rim world there are three basic scenarios but the game has its own scenario editor as well as workshop support which helps contribute to the game s huge replay value your main goal in the game to research and build a spaceship capable of getting you off what is usually a very dangerous world one of the key parts of rimworld s gameplay is its ai storyteller feature effectively one of two difficulty levels your choice of storyteller dictates what kind of events you ll see in the game while a second traditional difficulty level decides how tough these events will be on your colony the most common events include the mad animal event an animal will become very aggressive and target your colonists a raid event where a local pirate faction will attack you as well as positive events such as cargo pod drops or escape pod drops there are also several different environmental events which add a new level of challenge to the game they range from solar flares which temporarily disable all of your colony s electronics to toxic fallouts which will cause a toxic buildup in a colonist which can be fatal if they aren t indoors you also have colonist mental break events which occur when a colonist s mood becomes very low and stays that way for a long period of time sometimes a colonist will simply lock themselves in a room but serious mental breaks can lead to going berserk in which case the colonist will become hostile your colonists can also randomly get serious diseases such as malaria or the plague as well as common illnesses which are usually caused by combat inflicted injuries depending on your storyteller and difficulty level these events can be very difficult and will often be the downfall of your colony surprisingly this isn t at all frustrating in fact what i enjoy the most about rimworld is the stories you get from your playthroughs and the most interesting stories come from the death of your colony in my second attempt at the game one of four colonists and the pet dog were killed during a pirate raid the colonist who had developed a bond with the dog became incredibly unhappy and went beserk he was equipped with a rifle and easily took out the two remaining colonists while the pirates worked on destroying my power supply when my beserk colonists finally went outside the pirates turned their attention to the poor sod they peppered him with bullets and carried him back to their base with that my colony was destroyed generally when i m utterly destroyed in a game i get frustrated and take a break from it not rimworld each time i ve lost a colony i ve restarted instantly and the reason behind this is the replay value the game has even if you re playing the same scenario the colonists you choose you have no customisation options but you can randomise to get a group of colonists you d prefer have a huge impact on how your game turns out and how you manage your colony even if you build similar structures your colonists will have varying skill levels for the different types of work in the game to some extent these are random but they re also dependent upon the colonist s background type of childhood and profession and the character s traits a doctor or vet will always have a high medical skill level while a torturer or hunter will have a good melee skill level traits often have more of an indirect impact on the colonist s ability a beautiful character will be better in social situations and a psychopath is incapable of social interaction and only cares about things that directly impact them colonist traits also influences how characters interact with each other and what consequences those interactions will have if a character with the beautiful or pretty trait attempts to romance another character it s far more likely that the character will be successful this might not seem like an important gameplay feature but interaction with other characters is one of the main happiness modifiers anything from having a nice chat to making love with another colonist gives a bonus to happiness but getting rejected or being insulted will make the colonist unhappy for quite some time there are of course plenty of other happiness modifiers taking part in social or recreational activities gives large boosts while executing an innocent prisoner or eating human flesh give massive negative modifiers the severity of the modifier dictates the length of the modifier having a rough night s sleep on lasts until the next night while getting rejected can last for an in game week there is some balancing that needs to be done for some of the modifiers the modifier for getting rejected is particularly lengthy being a colony survival sim building is obviously a very important part of the game if you re familiar with prison architect then the building mechanics will be fairly easy to grasp you ll be designing and ordering your colonists to build different structures as well as furniture for your colonists to use and enjoy as well as production items such as butcher tables cooking tables and research benches you ll also have zones at your disposal to help run your colony you can set up stockpile zones and choose what s stored in any given stockpile for storing resources growing zones to grow food and other useful crops such as a plants for herbal medicine and cotton to use in the production of clothes one of the things that rimworld is missing compared to similar games such as gnomoria is rimworld doesn t have z levels i e the ability to build up or down you re stuck on the ground floor this isn t a huge issue as the maps are very large depending on what size you pick but it s still worth mentioning tynan sylvester hasn t ruled out z levels being added in the future but it requires a lot of work and so if we do see it in rimworld it s a long way off verdict rimworld is not only an excellent highly entertaining colony sim it s also one of the most polished and content rich early access games i ve had the pleasure of playing it may seem like its priced a little high but rimworld is absolutely worth every penny
