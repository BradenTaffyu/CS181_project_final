2022 my score 9 10prologuehealth something everyone wants to keep always the best possible but unfortunately sometimes the body fails and one beautiful night for example your head turns into a bright lamp to treat this you will need the specialized care of a medical team with all the hospital equipment and that s why we came here to offer you a job opportunity as manager of our company s future hospitals accept today and help us diagnose and cure citizens across the country but be prepared because lines of patients waiting for the appointment and only the beginning of a long and crazy list of things that can and will happen after all the country is vast and you will find everything cities tropical islands snowy mountains deserts and much more each region with its own challenges and of course rules as some cities made some rather curious demands to accept our services so it s always good to be ready for really anything from people whose heads have turned into light bulbs even lightning storms that somehow manage to strike inside your hospital but don t let that get in the way of your mission to bring health to the four corners of the country pros a fun hospital simulator that perfectly fulfills the mission of being a spiritual successor of the famous theme hospital making the mission of managing a hospital something light and fun with high doses of comedy a vast repertoire of crazy and creative diseases some of them have visible signs and need very fun to see working machines while others even without visible signs have fun and funny descriptions along with each of the dlcs add even more unique diseases it s easy to lose track of time managing one hospital then the second the third and so on especially since each one has different goals and many have their own rules of operation including some rules that only exist in the dlcs it is possible for hospitals to help each other for example in the case of a new disease to return to an older one to research improvements to the machines of newer hospitals without needing all the research structure in the new one great freedom when building the rooms and decorating making the use of space very efficient i myself never had a problem with lack of space beautiful graphics it is possible to perfectly see everything that happens in the hospital because all the actions of the employees patients and machines used have well done animations and i must say that some made me laugh especially the totally safe treatments cons a few hospitals have some goals that can be a little tricky to do fortunately they are a very small number unfortunately the diseases of the dlc only appear in the hospitals of said dlc not being possible to find them in the hospitals of the main game or other dlc game mechanicsa hospital simulator where we have to assume the management role with each new hospital we start being responsible for using our initial budget to build offices examination rooms to find out what patients have and thus treat them and of course receive a small remuneration in exchange after all the hospital has to support itself it seems simple but with each new hospital the player is challenged as each one has its own goals to go from zero to the maximum score of three stars allowing you to advance to the next one throughout this trip attention will need to be paid to points such as budget queues patient and staff needs while trying to keep everyone satisfied until reaching the peak with the healing of patients a process that can be helped with the improvement of equipment and training of the staff including with some functions such as psychiatry and surgery being allowed only for trained doctors after all patients can have everything and more heads turning lamps and just the beginning be ready for eyebrows that come to life clown outbreaks patients that get pixelated like 90 s games and much more who knows what the next patient might have and they all come to your hospital looking for a cure art and soundpersonally i found the graphics produced by the two point studios team very interesting following a style to make people look more like play dough dolls matching the lighter tone of the game along with the curious and fun designs of the machines some of them have a very interesting to see operation in addition to the graphics we also have the sounds i was also very satisfied with very relaxing music and all the machines have their unique sounds when they are in operation conclusiontwo point hospital caught my attention since its first announcement and for me it is a very fun game i had already played theme hospital and i think this new one very well fulfills its idea of being a hospital simulator but with a twist lighter combining diseases imagined by the team with very dubious and crazy equipment and treatments it is not a game for those looking for realistic hospital management so much so that no disease here exists in the real world but for those looking for a relaxing fun management game capable of producing laughs with its madness and at the same time a sensation of duty accomplished by seeing patients healed i strongly recommend this game even here i am anxiously awaiting the next game of the same team about managing a university this time
