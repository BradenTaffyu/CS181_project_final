2017 a cute and relaxing first person farming and exploration gamein slime rancher you are the new owner of an abandoned farm on a planet full of slimes you capture slimes put them into corrals and build gardens or chicken coops to provide food for them when a slime eats it produces a plort which can be sold on the market from the money you earn you can improve your equipment and expand your farm in addition to farming you can also mine resources which are required to build certain equipment or decorations you have six types of farm buildings available not a lot compared to other farming simulations and a few options to upgrade most of them there are 10 different types of food 4 different types of fowl and 15 different types of slime each with their own specific abilities behavior diet and risks you can cross slimes of different types with each other creating more than 75 different combinations which inherit the features of both their parents managing your farm means deciding which and how many slime combinations to keep and how to feed them best with the limited amount of building plots you have available the plort prices on the market keep fluctuating and they will also react to the plorts you sell encouraging you to diversify your produce if you keep selling just one or two products you will saturate the market and ruin the prices the more profitable slimes are usually riskier to keep or harder to feed and you are free to decide how you balance profit ease of maintenance and the risk of causing havoc to your farm while this is all good fun it s the exploration aspect that makes the game really shine it includes 5 radically different biomes more may come later each on a fairly large and labyrinthine map many slime and food types can only be found in a single biome with the most profitable ones in the areas that are the hardest to get to since you need to find them in the wild in order to bring them to your farm you have a strong incentive to keep pushing forward which includes finding keys or solving small puzzles to unlock areas behind closed gates there are also several dozen treasure pods hidden across the maps encouraging you to explore every nook and cranny the game s visuals are colorful stylized and adorably cute even the moon sports a smiling face this combines well with the casual relaxed nature of the gameplay there are no real dangers to your farm apart from the risk of losing slime populations when too many of them mix together and create a slime eating monstrosity and even if that happens you can just catch new slimes slimes can never starve they just stop producing plorts when not fed there also isn t any real danger to yourself you may lose all your health by falling into the sea or getting bitten repeatedly by feral slimes but then you just awaken back on your farm on the next morning all in all slime rancher is a very well designed casual game that combines management aspects building and running your farm with the exploration of an alien countryside both activities provide an ample amount of rewards new equipment that can be bought or found in treasure pods and for the 100 hours that i have played this game it kept giving me the feeling that the next cool thing was just around the corner i highly recommend it to fans of farming simulations and exploration based games
