2022 amazing total war title unfortunately none of the historic titles can hope to ever come near this games it s still worth playing this game after warhammer 2 came out and 3 is about to i agree that it is quite the expensive game it does go on sale quite often don t buy any dlc until you finished a campaigning but do get all the free ones all factions and content are available with the base game they will still be there for you to interact with as another faction the dlcs don t add the factions they are still there in the world with you you can still fight them you just can t play with as them many of them are a lot more interesting to fight against then fight as but it comes down to personal preference so play a campaign and after you ve seen how the other faction work from the perspective of their friends and foes if you think it would be cool to fight as them by all means buy their specific dlc and go nuts
