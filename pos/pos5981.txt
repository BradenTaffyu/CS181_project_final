2022 the sims 4 to be honest the game is pretty good you can do a lot of things in it you can build houses make your own character even yourself but the game feels pretty empty without those dlcs and all the content for game and i just don t see the point in buying them all possibly because you re rich and don t know what to do with the money anymore the game would be much better if you didn t have to put a fortune into it there was loads of content that i just loved being able to have a kid to take to daycare and more content with pets but i just don t see the point in buying them i d rather use a way to get them all for free even though i can t play it on steam but much better than throwing money away now let s give a little review of the game graphics beautiful good decent bad don t look too long at it gameplay very good good it s just gameplay mehh watch paint dry instead audience kids teens adults grandma i don t know which old people would play pc requirements check if you can run paint potato decent fast rich difficulty just press w easy sighnificant brain usage difficult dark souls story no story average good lovely it ll replace your life game time long enough for a cup of coffee short average long to infinity and beyond price without dlc it s free worth the price wait for sale not recommended you could also just burn your money price with all content it s free worth the price wait for sale not recommended you could just buy ps5 rank 10 10 5 10 9 10 4 10 8 10 3 10 7 10 2 10 6 10 1 10it s just your decision either you buy ps5 or you buy all the content on the sims 4 for only 2 000 dollars very convenient
