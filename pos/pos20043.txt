2015 ok now that i m waiting for fallout 4 to come out i guess i m going to go back and visit the mojave for a while the counter above the block where i m writing this says i ve played for 490 9 hours i might be willing to concede that such a thing is not necessarily healthy nevertheless if you consider yourself a gamer and you haven t played this you need to snap it up and find out what you ve missed some may wail about crashes cry me a river save periodically yes you may find some graphical oddities from time to time but if you want richer stories or more authentic post apocalyptic atmosphere you re probably going to have to wait until the real thing happens on the plus side your wait might not be that long so there s that there are an endless supply of mods out there as well so even after you ve played through you can still revisit and find new things don t like the color of the post atomic sky there s a mod for that want real firearm textures they got em want to own your own casino you can fix up the one in primm if n you don t folks will be saying that clint eastwood is the biggest yella belly in the whoops wrong review what are you still reading this for step to and tell victor i said howdy
