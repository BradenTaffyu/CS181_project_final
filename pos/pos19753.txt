2014 for starters since you re probably playing on pc i strongly recommend you spend some time looking at various mods that people have made for this game and are completely free while the vanilla game experience is still good playing with even simple mods that fix bugs makes the experience so many times more enjoyable and allows you to tweak the game to your preference this game is very enjoyable and easy for me to lose myself in i can spend hours just wandering the nevada wasteland exploring new locations or cutting down enemies a number of the non playable characters have interesting and even sometimes thought provoking dialogues that makes doing quests something you actually want to do besides getting a reward of some sorts of course this game has its downsides for starters the game engine is junk the game clearly shows its age so if you re not using mods to make the game look good don t expect it to look amazing you can go in any direction you want past the opening sequence of the game and while i consider this a good thing those of you who prefer linear games will probably dislike this the game very strongly suggests the direction you should go in by following along the main questline but more experienced players will probably greatly deviate from this if you ve never played a fallout game what are you waiting for well i can understand if you re waiting for the next 5 sale i did that too for those of you already familiar with fallout the elder scrolls you ll probably enjoy this definitely a must have
