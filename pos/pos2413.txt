2020 i ve owned this game a year after the release on bethesda launcher so i didn t experience the worst of the worse bugs with the launch on steam and the wastelanders update the game run smoother a tong of bugs has been squashed and the addition of npcs made the game much more alive they have stuck with the game and didn t abandon it which is a surprise if i m going to compare this to no man s sky turnaround id say bethesda did around 60 of the way there it still missing a ton of qol improvements but since they continued to support this game i m looking forward to future patches they have also implemented the fallout 3 style of conversation instead of fo4 arrow and chance speech checks buying the subscription is not at all needed and they are merely for convenience atoms in game cosmetic currency can be earned in game through dailies weekliesi d rate this game 6 5 10 playing solo and a solid 7 5 10 if playing with friends although with the continuous events in game you ll see other people and be able to socialize with then from time to time
