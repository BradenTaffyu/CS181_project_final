2021 this is your standard tab targeting mmo if your standard tab targeting mmo had a fully voiced story including all companion quests side quests and each class had 5 romanceable companions for a total of 40 class companions before we even get to expansion companions there s a variety of ways to pay for your content all of which are less expensive than wow and most competitors i could see competitive wow players not liking this as the pvp scene and even competitive raiding scenes just aren t really what this game is about the graphics haven t aged horribly well but they re certainly not obnoxious to adjust to either controls are a tiny bit touchy in particular keyboard turning feels a little off but for a largely solo story rpg that rarely feels like a problem this game excels at being a traditional bioware rpg that happens to have all of the multiplayer features you d expect out of any mmo the story is good enough to keep you coming back for hundreds of hours i d recommend this to anyone that is looking for a good relaxing mmo i wouldn t recommend this game to competitive players
