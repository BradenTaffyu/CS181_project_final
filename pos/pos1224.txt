2017 early access review this is the best zombie survival simulator to date whether alone or in multiplayer the game never fails to maintain the fear it is unforgiving and one mistake can mean the end for a character s story the gameplay is slow pace but well thought out the mechanics take some time to understand and there is a steep learning curve however with that being said it is well worth the time invested to develop an understanding of the game for loads of survival content await there are also a ton of amazing mods on the workshop that really make this game pop it is important to understand that this is a simulator this is not similar l4d2 7dtd nation red or any other zombie game on steam this game is designed to test the player in the long run will you make it through winter will you survive your deep wound or illness will you let your guard down at the wrong time even a high leveled character can be downed to one mistake you got bit best enjoy yourself a bleach tale to go out on your own terms i can see how some people might be turned off by the idea of your character needing to spend 20 minutes ish real time to read a book for the xp boost but that comes with the level of detail implemented with this game and it just serves to add to the fear of death the last time i felt loss for a character as strong as i have felt for this game is diablo 2 our first base a screenshot of project zomboid by vash 88 between the ever increasing number of zeds the reality of what it means if the players is bitten and the changes of season the player is kept aware of the ever present danger those that get comfortable are the first to die a backpack full of ammo wont save you against a horde of 1000 strong especially when your gunshot bring all the zeds to the yard as for the learning curve be ready to play this game with the wiki up in the steam overlay otherwise you will be turned off quickly your best bet is to play with a group of friends to figure it out together and if one knows the ropes that s also nice the overall experience will simply be better with friends there are two cons to this game 1 hosting a server is not an easy thing and the game is a ram hog in the long run i actually rent a server because of this though that should speak to the caliber of this game2 it is never a good idea to be listening to music while playing this game that is how a zed sneaks up and bites you on the arm sigh this happened to me the refund system will not really work for this game and i say that because two hours is not nearly enough time to get a taste of this game vanilla this game is a diamond in the rough with a few mods and a private server with friends this is one of the best games i have ever played
