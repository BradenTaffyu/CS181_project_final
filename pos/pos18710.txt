2019 first and foremost this is the best strategy game in existence my gaming life in the genre of strategy is now seperated into two eras pre euiv and post nothing else in the genre is playable for any extended amount of time because euiv is constantly dwarfing everything else in my mind with that said euiv requires serious researh and reflection before you purchase there are essential dlcs that you will need to purchase in addition to the base game which you should not purchase for anything more than 20 to play in what amounts to a practicaly vanilla state there are essential dlcs that you will need to purchase in order to fully play certain regions and playstyles with the full depth and flavor intended the learning curve is harsh and will require hours of research on wikis and lets plays etc before you even begin to get your footing under you the updates will improve some playstyles and demolish others so you will have to roll back to earlier versions if you fall in love with a certain scenario this is also one of those games where you need to seriously consider the impact it will have on your leisure time all of it if you get hooked social life other hobbies relatonships sleep they will all be pushed far down the queue to at best a distant distant second lastly as i alluded to above the bar of excellence for a game will have been driven so high that afterwards your old reliable go tos will lose their warm nostalgia it is a real consideration to take into account if you like strategy games in general go play civ iv moo2 gc2 endless legend and the like first and enjoy them for the excellent games that they are they won t be worse after you play euiv they will essentially be gone as options weigh all that up and see if it is aceptable if you do and you get through the learnig curve you will have goten yourself into the deepest most complex most absorbing most cared after strategy game man has yet created yea it s really that fu ng good
