2017 early access review i know it s blasphemy to say it but this is easily on par already with old classics like baldur s gate i think it actually surpasses them the freedom is even better the atmosphere the character building the amazing replayability everything it s significantly better than the first which i found enjoyable but didn t fall in love with it had so much potential but never really seemed to get there this gets there right away it s that good
