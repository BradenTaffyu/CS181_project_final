2022 xbox become the master chief in halo on pcplaystation become kratos in god of war on pc frankly i was very concerned that this would be another bad port when i looked at the recommended spec sheet i believe we all don t want another launch version of horizon zero dawn now i am glad those concerns are needless the game is fantastic in almost every technical aspect consistent framerates great visuals textures exclusive nvidia features and fsr are also included from day one i don t think i need to say the rest because it has already won countless awards my rtx 2080 i7 9700k handles the game pretty well at high 1440p with consistent 75 fps no major fluctuation without dlss fsr your pc should also do fine with proper settings to fit your playstyle if you want more frame rates you can always enable dlss or fsr to do that without sacrificing too much quality the mouse and keyboard is fluid enough to play the game but i would recommend to use a gaming controller instead xbox controller should be good enough for most people as you will not get any playstation exclusive feature by using a dualsense controller a side note if you are using a playstation controller right click god of war in your steam libary and select properties then go to the controller section you can disable the steam input there to have proper layouts of the controller a pc with gtx 1060 can run more than 30 fps with all graphical settings at original level santa monica s claim of the spec can only run at 30 fps is being too modest also the port is mostly done by jetpack interactive a shout out to them here and please send your apperication to them as well so after bend studio s days gone santa monica studio s god of war 2018 is another amazing playstation hit title ported properly at launch so what s the reason not to buy if you are not very price sensitive 9 5 10 chinese translation for my chinese friends please ignore this part if you are an english reader fsr rtx 2080 9700k 2k dlss fsr 75fps bug pc fsr dlss dualsense xbox playstation steam gtx 1060 30fps jetpack interactive bend 2018 dlss reflex fsr 9 5 10
