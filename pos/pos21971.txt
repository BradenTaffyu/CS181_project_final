2017 i like the variety of weapons and armour and that the heavier weapons feel meaty when you swing them around the combat which is the real meat and potatoes of the game is great fun challenging yes but the game is designed in such a way that its almost always worth one more go you try you fail you improve slighty repeat 5 times achieve success dopamine is released you realise its 2am you feel shame
