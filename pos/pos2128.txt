2023 what is this that hath been lurking in the salty brine give me a game featuring a brooding slightly depressed angler in overalls riding a rickety boat with a cargo of oddly hexagonal spaces over the dime a dozen generic looter shooters and lifeless characters that infests the aaa games nowadays now simply put dredge is a true catch if i have ever seen it the gameplay is simple yet brilliant with gameplay surrounding a really neat selection of fishing minigames and a boat that serves as your home your hq as well as your impending doom the darkness looms however and you get to balance the fact that the more valuable fish are easier to catch during nighttime when more than just a lonely fisherman is dredging the seas the story is moody and atmospheric with just the right amount of quirky side characters to keep the mystery going the fact that the lighthouse always beacons you home from all angles of the map is just delicious on top of that you have a wide selection of weird gribblies to catch and sell to the local fishmonger in a collection minigame that can make the most jaded pokemon hunter smile with glee all in all dredge serves up the whole plate of being part fishing simulator including boat upgrades part exploring the weird islands and biomes and part interactive cosmic horror for me personally this is going to be straight up game of the year material with its perfect mixture of a soothing gameplay loop perfectly married to the slightly melancholic setting heavily seasoned with a dose of ye olde cosmic horror the art style reminds me of the best parts of darkest dungeon and i can honestly boat around the sea forever in bliss knowing that around the next reef might be the swarming school of my dreams highly recommended to those looking for a great fishing game with extra all and never trust a man with a mustache who knows what they hide behind those bushy drapes of darkness
