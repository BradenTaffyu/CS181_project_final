for those who haven t played any gundam breaker this game is more about building a gundam taking photos etc rather than just fighting the battle system is typical for a gundam game it doesn t quite reach the level of an action game but it s still fun early review it doesn t top gundam breaker 3 but maybe it s better than 2 the basic system feels like it s somewhere between gb2 and 3 i m enjoying it so far but i need to play more to get a better idea if gundam breaker 3 is a 9 10 or 9 5 10 so far 3 hours mark which is not much gundam breaker 4 is around 7 5 10 to 8 10 maybe better worse when i unlock more parts and skills pros can run on a potato graphic card mine is 1050ti left arm and right arm are separated parts you can carry two different guns and two different melee can scaling parts i tried scaling down zz gundam s backpack chef kiss camera mode is definitely the best in the series cons like many console games ported to pc they didn t think about keyboard mouse players controller is definitely better i can t spam funnel fang dragoon like i did in gb3 it is good for game balance tho the movement is meh the walking animation feels like sliding on the ground and turning left or right doesn t have a proper transition basically you re just mirroring to another direction the sniper mode i m not sure why i need a sniper mode when almost everything is auto locked
