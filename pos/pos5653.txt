2020 early access review they don t make em like this any more kids i played the first m b the month it came out in early access anyone else remember the zendar arena i was 13 years old and i can still remember the sheer sense of wonder as i stepped out into a basically empty map with only two factions and ps2 era graphics development was slow but it was well worth the wait the dev team were incredible talking one to one with their playerbase and dedicating years to a game which for all they knew might go nowhere now bannerlord has brought the series into the modern era no it isn t the finished polished product yet then again neither was m b1 or warband or really anything in the m b series so far the joy of these games is that despite feeling cobbled together and a bit makeshift they still offer 10x the depth and variety of many triple a titles well worth the wait and there will be plenty more waiting trust me and well worth supporting one of the most long term dedicated dev teams this side of dwarf fortress
