2014 early access review if you like minecraft l4d dayz this is the game for you a whole lot of crafting a whole lot of zombies and a lot of scavanging in the dark a horde of zombies will spawn they run like the wind in darkness and slowed in light the entire enviroment is destructable and the zombies will break walls and dig down to try to kill you easy mode is not hard but you can still get punished the hard mode is pretty brutal unfortunatly the price is a little steep on this game i got it on sale for 24
