2022 after 25 years microsoft did it again my friends keep asking me why even though there are so many new games coming out i keep investing time and time into this game and honestly i don t know i just know that i can t stop playing it for fans of the series it meets all the requirements one would expect from a modern version of the game and the support behind it not only from the community but from the manufacturer itself launching new civs completely free for those of us who have already bought the game at a time when they are charged for dlcs that often do not add anything new they come and kick the board again thank you age of empires for simply existing
