2023 tl dr company of heroes 3 is a solid game that s improving on a patch by patch basis but if you want it at its best wait for it s 1 year anniversary february 2024 i joined company of heroes 2 in the middle of its life cycle and managed to sink 4000 hours into it i love coh2 but i also heard it had a rough launch so when coh3 s launch came around i was worried but optimistic and willing to weather whatever storm may come it s very evident now that company of heroes 3 should not have launched in the condition that it was in it was burdened with placeholder assets bugs questionable balance and several elements people would say are subpar to the previous company of heroes game fast forward 7 months later and the game has been steadily been cleaned up for an entry in the coh series to offer 4 factions right off the bat the balance is pretty acceptable right now the bugs are few with exceptional game performance and the placeholder assets have been mostly remedied undoubtedly there s some things that coh2 still does better but the framework is really solid for coh3 and the continued updates and support consistently show good progress is coh3 better than coh2 definitively not yet i believe the coh3 that released on launch day was so unpolished that it deserved another year in the oven to really make it shine to that end i believe that by the year one mark february 2024 coh3 will be finally in the release state that it deserved to be in i d say you could wait until then to buy coh3 at its best but if you re willing to roll the dice and play a modern coh entry that isn t 10 years old then coh3 is a solid game that s improving on a patch by patch basis
