2016 don t starve together review intro don t starve together is a online game of don t starve written in lua code developed by klei entertainment as i have spent well over 580 hours playing the game hosting dedicated servers making mods playing though out early access and after release i will tell you what i think of the game that ate up most of my free time pros1 the game is stable functional and works well just like don t starve does but only online the game has a massively active fanbase and after i wanted to take a break from playing the game you have no idea how many messages i have been sent to help people on their server to help get mods working and to join people in there server the game has had some issues in early access sudden crashes and lag but now that an early access game is actually finished it works amazingly well i have had few issues running the game for 24 hours straight with as you know me running 20 40 mods with many people on a server 2 the game is modable it runs on the same code as don t starve on lua code so if you know how to read basic code and a few other things you can easily make mods for the game i have been able to make mods for don t starve and don t starve together although i only published them privately the game is very easy to mod hell even someone as at code as me can write things into the game and as a result the game has thousands of well made crappy interesting fun and awful mods you can enjoy you could even learn how to put your own filth onto the game yourself it would only take a few brain cells to edit the code in the game to make memes galore or whatever you want to add to the sea of content the don t starve together workshop has 3 the game is really fun i don t need to say that when i spent over 580 hours in the game do i well there is lots to do randomly generated worlds means endless content with mods for even more and playing different characters for even more content the combat in the game i would always say needs to be better but hey after playing it so much its obviously alright cons 1 the game made me read and write code i didn t need to and i didn t want to at first but making a dedicated server helped me be lazy so i could log out of my own game then rejoin it when i came back then i learned stuff like how to write ini files lua batch files and other codey words i can t remember that stuff isn t fun itself but it is a part of really getting into the game if you want to make a dedicated server your own mod or edit stuff 2 the game doesn t have local multiplayer its possible i even say a don t starve mod have local multiplayer so why didn t they add that into dst well i can think of why they didn t they wanted the game to have more online features game modes etc and that s fine it still sucks that i can t play this locally but the game is easy to set up so whatever warning this game is going to mess with you first you join a few games then your like oh i liked this in this game but i didn t like this in this game then you host your own games to the massive community and they will get you to change your server for better or for worse second you will then try out mods then you will want more than just one or two you will want to collect just a few of the best mods then you will have 30 80 mods you can enable or disable in your game then third you will run multiple servers of different variants of mods then you will get a really good server going with all the best mods and best players with only a few people burning everything you built to the ground then the server will get full then you will want to host a dedicated server allowing 64 players to join you but to do that then you will need to write code then you will suffer then you will have a wonderful server with as many players as you want all the mods that you want it will run fast well and you will build a awesome base with other players have lots of fun but then because pvp is off and the game is public the gosh darn trolls and griefers will join and burn everything to the gound you made you can t kick the scum fast enough and you don t just want to kick them no you want to make them suffer for burning down your base when you did so much crap to build it so then you turn pvp on and then you and your homies will fight off the trolls until one you your homies betrays you and burns down your base and kills you then you decide to host a private game with people you trust will all the settings you want you will play that for a bit but then get bored and go back to public killing all who dare mess with your base and homies warning this game will change you do i recommend you buy this game to put it bluntly yeah its alright
