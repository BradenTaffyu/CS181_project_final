2021 the game itself is pretty decent though it has several major flaws when reinforcing my armies are directly next to each other and yet on the battle map my reinforcements will often come from behind the enemies back line the battle map often does not reflect where i am positioned my army is on an open field or bridge and yet i will get forest maps in fact it seems nearly every other map is a light forest so forget bringing any anti infantry artillery skirmish mode is broken if you don t pay attention for a brief moment your skirmishers will occasionally run into or not run away from combat even with skirmish enabled archers will occasionally run straight into the enemy and ignore commands to run the other direction though there are other bugs those are major ones making it feel like any tactical movement on the world map is essentially pointless the game is fun sometimes but not worth the cost buy it on sale if you really want it
