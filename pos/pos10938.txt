2016 not recommended for hoi purists very dumbed down from hoi3 but very fun game it s true that the game has a lot of inbalances and stupid ai in it s current state among many other problems this game has been the most the most fun i ve had in a game for ages dumbed down doesn t mean worse nor easier just easier to understand i couldn t understand hoi3 anyway the game introduces new interesting features such as the political mechanics which are a lot of fun as well as other interesting parts if you like stratergy adn ww2 but hoi3 was too complex this game is for you and even if you are a hoi purist this game is still good fun looks amazing and from my experience runs pretty well most of the time excpet for when huge is going on all over the world or you re doing multiplayer online with internet overall good game great fun needs improvement beware of the oncoming dlc storm
