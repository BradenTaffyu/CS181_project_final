2015 early access review absolutely the best co op game with friends i ever played it is better than l4ds better than paydays introduced this to my girlfriend who is a non gamer and she was instantly hooked and developed a passion for webber so this is the best plot to convert target girl into gamer game this game reminds me of life and growing up when you were a baby everything is new to you you have to explore and learn about the world you are in so that you can live survive better as you play more you will learn step by step bit by bit how to survive better just like a baby growing up this game is also here to unleash all your hidden childhood mischief that you always had don t believe me just look at the number of people in the reviews killed by stealing tallbird eggs best wtf factor like to hear your friends say what the xxxx in many different musical tones pitches and styles you don t ever need to ask them anymore because this game does it automatically for you i can assure you that seeing anything that looks bigger than themselves for the first time will produced the desired effect for your entertainment
