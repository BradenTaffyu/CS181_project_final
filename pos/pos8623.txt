2017 ok i am from china but want the developer can see my evaluation i will write in english i think we only experience hunting from this game but the hunters life not only hunter they will be tired or hungry i think this game can divide into the survival mode and hunting mode someone may just like hunting and have fun can play hunting mode the other players want to experience whole hunter life can play survival mode the cooking and make clothes from animal fur may give players more sence of achievement it s a good game it s make me quiet by call of the wild
