2023 same formula graphics 10 10the best part of this review has to do with the graphics they did a really good job everything looks great again like the third game in the series but it s not optimized as well as fh4 it looks realistic and natural thanks to the beautiful mexican era arrive d driving physics 8 10honestly not my taste it s like driving as an npc in a movie they tried to mix arcade and simulation physics but it doesn t work for me car customization 7 10much better than before but still crap compared to other racing games look at the old need for speed games you can not even use a custom speedometer on your car car tuning 8 10i love the forza series tuning feature but the community made tunes are ruining everything because so many players use glitches and their fake records don t disappear from the leaderboards artificial intelligence 8 10hmm ai is much smarter than fh4 drivatars are really challenging now but what about npc s in freeroam even worse than the games of 20 years ago it gives you a soulless feeling you cannot find random events around you gameplay 10 10overall it s really good it works like every forza we ve played but compared to underrated games like test drive unlimited completely paralyzed audio 8 10ah yeah we finally saw some good improvemenst but it should be better musics and soundtracks 7 10oh nah nah nah my dream was destroyed i m out i dunno what s wrong with the self radio idea to be honest i don t really like playing songs in the background the in game radio songs are cringe it really scratches my ears system requirements 7 10you must be a member of pcmr to be able to play this game story i prefer to forget this part becausethere is no story to speak of price 8 10meh don t go for the premium version because you will skip the grind as a result you will throw the game after a month i bought it and now i regret it because the game became boring for me so go for the standard version and save some money in your pocket bugs 6 10c mon so many bugs after 2 years of updates and 3 years of development this is not acceptable because this is a simple open world racing game not an rpg game with tons of content singleplayer mode 8 10hmmm there s no reason to play single player when you have the original version of this game but if you want to relax on the weekend that s fine multiplayer mode 9 10it s still one of the best multiplayer racing games you can find in the stores there s a lot of content to enjoy in fact most players chose this game for the multiplayer part i just found one annoying thing in the game and that s when you want to play the game while using vpn you can t play online mode overviewi recommend you to buy this game but it definitely cannot entertain you for thousands of hours total score 8 0 thank you for reading my review
