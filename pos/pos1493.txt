2018 early access review review closer to the bottoma brief history of project zomboidlist of updates since release on desura in 2011 forums game was released on the gaming platform desura way back in april of 2011 with pre alpha builds aval to pre purchaser prior i think can t remember marchish they even used to have a testing team before the game ever came to steam where they wanted feedback etc and sometimes even listened i was on that team with engima before he was ever a staff member though this is jumping ahead of some other mishaps with the long history of the game first news post on their official site going into initial money problems with both paypal and google you can look that up for yourself in oct of 2011 the devs had a break in at their apartment and the laptops they were developing the game on had been stolen unfortunately the developers didn t have the foresight or experience understandable to have full back ups located elsewhere project zomboid however will come back stronger yes thanks to modders we ll get to that later this held updates back for 6 months anyway feel free to read some of those early news blogs articles when there were still npcs in the game and what the devs were focusing on etc etc this really was only a setback on whatever was created and not uploaded to the testers not really much of a setback then once apon a time there be npcsthe devs originally had npcs in the game and even had a touching tutorial story then in mid 2012 the last updates to npc arrives on july 24th and they re never heard from again well not in game at least they re talked about extensively through the years in the blogs articles the next update to the game after this isn t for another 9 months april 2013 along the way a large number of mondoids that fans are familiar with by now the original plan for npc s being re added to the game by the time rc3 was released of course this wouldn t happen as there never was an rc3 i m guessing we re still waiting on that as the versions changed from looking like this 2 9 9 17 build 25 v3 to looking like this build 26 in april of 2014 aug 2014 2015 short jaunt down modders lane or what keeps this ship afloatlet s face it this game would probably be floating face down if not for the modding community we ll look at only two here farming additions robert johnson mid 2012 project zomboid april 2013 npcsnolan ritchie this modder has about 3 pages of mods on steam and seems to be a pretty hard worker mod release oct 2016 survivors build 39 a workshop item for project zomboid by nolanritchie this mod is no longer supported or updated please use the upgraded version super survivors link here 2nd mod release march 2017 super survivors for build 40 a workshop item for project zomboid by nolanritchie important 1 super survivors mod is single player only 2 this is for build 40 only find a build 41 compatible verison here description like the project zomboid there was an npc mod being worked on and an animal companion mod by the same person back in 2015 but as has happened in the past between fans and the devs heads collided not enough characters to get into e peen fights and list out dirty laundry on the official forums and who knows what happened with the development of the mod really isn t a fair representation of all the mods that have had influences on or made the game last there s an armor mod the hydrocraft mod orgm and etc what s a review so what about the game well i bought the game back in 2011 for like 8 9 usd on desura the most impactful and it s a great one change to me since the game came out has been the vehicle update they did so well with how intricate vehicles are implemented into the game compared to everything else farming was a mod first maybe not with accuracy to weights and tire psi levels but with how it balances out the game and makes a really neat basically mini game added in maintaining the vehicles for me is a lot of fun and adds an extra goal of collecting replacement parts for later plus who doesn t like running zombies over that s unfortunately where the fun without mods ends for me i haven t played the game since 2013 fired it up for the vehicle addition and added some mods there s not really much point to playing the game past the initial challenge because there s no further challenges there s enough canned perserved food to last you a very very long time even if you set limits on yourself to add to the challenge like holding up in a room with months of food to something like staggered farming plots in a carpentry crafted stronghold it really doesn t matter sure water and electricity get cut off but you can find generators if you only use it for cooking all the gas you find up to that point will last you a pretty long time then once that runs out you still have all the other food gathering mechanics and ways to cook it basically if you ve made it a month you ve seen the whole game i m not saying to limit these options there should just be other functions for it all the game sorely needs some kind of dynamic action going on yes online elements add to this but that s not good enough to differentiate it from all other survival games it s just isometric rust dayz ark 7 days to die at that point grab stuff safe house with your friends crap combat control fight against other players although in that last case those other games do the pvp aspect better imo can t without offering solutionsi d say it needs both scripted and unscripted npc elements kill teams doing sweeps bandits raiders groups and friendly npc groups on one side then on the other an actual progression to the outbreak story with zero day and the spread barricades going up and the military losing control of some areas etc over time to prolong an eventual air strike the meta of the game radio tv or perhaps even word of mouth between survivor groups could talk about the quarantine breaking down and the infection spreading out then maybe as the months pass and the rest of the world dies the survivors would start to see other groups perhaps military personnel who ve abandoned their duties and decided to hold up some where maybe even townships forming etc at this point it would make farming and the other mechanics a little more meaningful perhaps you d have to trade items for passage to other areas or fight your way through things like that there s probably rp servers like this already i dunno obviously there s problems with this as well if the ai is all loaded in the same cell chunks i think they re still called in this it would take some serious processing power to handle it all the engine it self might not be able to handle it either way i think they devs just need to have a serious sit down and focus on what they re actually going to do with the game and then do it their focus over the years has kinda been all over the place the game was originally planned for full release a long time ago they can release an expansion later for additions continued in comments
