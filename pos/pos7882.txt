2021 early access review the game is worth the price i ve only had it for less then three days while writing this i ll list some pros and cons that i found pros will run on almost anything my specs are a ryzen 3 vega mobile 3 graphics and 10gb of ram i get about 30 40 fps on smaller maps 60 on the grid map and i ll get 30 on bigger mapsai is smart on some maps it will get stuck but bigger maps work better with them you can customise your car to have anything you want it to have want your race car to tow a camper it ll work want your 3 wheeler to go 200kmh you can do it graphics are great of course mine are set really low but they still look good cons graphics settings could be set to lowerai gets confused on smaller mapsits 100 worth it i d pay for it full price the devs have done an amazing job on this game
