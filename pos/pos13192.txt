2021 disclaimer i m an aerospace engineer this game is a lot of fun as of right now i have just created 2 space stations around kerbin and the mun and i am starting to expand the former i really enjoy being in charge of the entire mission from designing the rocket to reaching the target destination to landing back on kerbin the physics simulation is great and though time warp gets a bit wonky it generally feels pretty realistic otherwise of course with that being the case this game is really hard it does not hold your hand whatsoever it is rocket science after all i highly recommend this game to anyone who likes anything space or rocket related you can do whatever you want and it provides quite the challenge if you want to do anything more than just mess around this game is a 10 10 for me and i can t wait for ksp 2
