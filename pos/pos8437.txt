2021 extremely fun and challenging game one of the coolest town building games i ve played having to prepare the town before you get wiped by a blizzard upgrade everything with little resources and maintain civility is a hell of a game the importance to learn the strategy of the game early did not hit me til i failed like 3 times the beginning starts off pretty quickly which makes the challenge every decision makes a impact it consistently makes you think on your feet and be 3 moves ahead of yourself at all times scenarios that can end the game part way through making you adapt your playstyle not like boring idle town games picture after a rocky start you finally get everything under control then next thing you know its so cold your e destroying everything that s not a house to burn for heat 10 10
