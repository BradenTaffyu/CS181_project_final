2016 this game exceeded my expectations i ve been waiting to play this game for so long but i had recently re found it while browsing the internet trying to find games similar to the harvest moon franchise the soundtrack is awesome and will immerse you into the life of a farmer graphics are top notch for this type of genre and it reminds me of the days when i would just play friends of mineral town everywhere i went there s a quest system and it really enhances the gameplay it s never in your face and it works more as a journal to remind you to do something if you aren t doing something already the pacing of time is fantastic it gives you enough time to talk to the villagers and do some errands on the way my only complaint would probably be that running around can be a little tedious especially if you forget to store something at your house along the way but i forgive this after years of playing harvest moon overall i rate this 10 10 this is the kind of game that i ve been looking for a while if you like an awesome farming simulator with some new mechanics along the adventure i highly recommend this game for you ps this was before of my knowledge that the quest book was actually called a journal also i didn t know there was a horse
