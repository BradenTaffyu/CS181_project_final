2021 alright so i can t stand fantasy games i never tried turn based combat games either i am very easily bored by story and such like i will skip dialogue and just loot and fight okay so i didn t even wait for a sale i just said screw it and played my first save with 2 friends so 2 weeks later i had 100 hours in and on my 3rd play through as i write this review i am 150 hours in on my 4th play through yeah this game is great absolutely fabulously fantastically amazing i don t care much for lore and story so i ll just say that if you do like story and character developments and talking and quests and yeah you ll enjoy this game for that oh and you get to sorta choose like 99 of the time how you want the story to play out so you can do one play through siding with one side siding with another not caring killing everyone saving everyone you do you boo i loved freaking loved building my characters not only aesthetically by appearance but i loved building my character you wanna be a fire maniac go ahead you wanna be a wholesome pure healer go ahead you wanna be a tanky monster to fight against i love doing this go ahead you get so much freedom on how you wanna build your character it s just awesome absolutely awesome choose your race be it human elf dwarf lizard undead races of the previous ones i mentioned or if you don t wanna create your own rpg oc character you can pick from a few of the characters that have backstory set names their own personal quests etcthe game looks beautiful i rarely play top down sorta games and holy moly this game looks so pretty i personally loved playing this with friends if you enjoy playing solo you can bring npc s as part of your group so you re not a solo lone wolf and not 1v4ing the enemy npc s i will warn you the game was made with 4 players in mind it works with 2 3 4 i have played with those sets of players but if you make your main character the only player in the squad you may find things difficult so if you re a masochist hey i have a recommendation for you hehe the game allows for modding so have fun playing vanilla game 1st play and then going huh i wonder and then playthrough 2 being allllll up to youuuuu this game is great i am a cheapo and would get guilty over spending full price for games but i spent full price on this game and forgot about it within a day and was glad i bought it cos this game very good
