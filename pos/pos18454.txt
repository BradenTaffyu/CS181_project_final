2020 product received for free okay so for beginners this game is a pretty good rendition for the next installment of the beloved bloons td franchise my friend oopag actually bought this game for me for losing a game and honestly was the worst mistake he could ve made i ve been non stop hooked on this game for the past month and honestly i gotta say it was a blast seeing the reviews of others about micro transactions was honestly pretty misleading as the currency monkey money used in the game is actually not used for many things that are crucial to the game in conclusion buy this game if you want to hook yourself in to a simple and fun tower defense game
