2023 just watched the end credits roll if you re like me and found this game as a recommendation for fire emblem fans i d recommend it i won t say that it s the greatest game i ve played but sow stands solid on its own right here are some main pros and cons i took away from this game pros decent narrative though at times gets needlessly convoluted good dialogue writing much better than fire emblem engage though that isn t hard i guess some very unique and fun character designs i particularly like the sayunaari character portraits some very fun artifact item options allow for incredibly effective mechanic exploits that can turn your units into masters at their specific roles whether offense or defense etc army customization mechanics are enjoyable and can take hours of your time just on their own it s always fun to see your army grow from a ragtag assortment of conscripts to a conquering force characters are for the most part well fleshed out and likeable each one from what i saw was written well though zelos could have stood to have much much more exposure on his specific journey due to the large role he plays in the story more exposure on his journey and the gradual shaping of the motivations that led him to act the way he did would be nice otherwise i found myself enjoying the cast sybil beatrix and lysander in particular were my favorites overall a refreshing take on the turn based genre the ending clearly leaves room for a sequel and i await the next chapter of this storyline and would love to see where the crew goes next cons romance supports feel incredibly rushed fire emblem sometimes struggles with this but at the very least the fe method of support pairing usually involves at least 4 supports going from c b a and then an a or s support ranking that allows relationships whether romantic or platonic to develop with a more natural pacing sow would do well to take inspiration from this setup as the romantic and platonic pairings that they envisioned as canon feel extremely rushed and hollow since quite a handful of romantic pairings happen on the very first support with barely any prior interaction if any at all more cutscene interactions and more supports in general would make most of these pairings feel more natural and carry more weight i will say that i do enjoy how with certain pairings they had external acknowledgement of your pairings from other characters such as in the case of sybil and barnabas and the wedding arrangement which was pretty nice to see they should do something similar with other pairings and perhaps even the mc s pairings the boss fight is wayyyyyy too easy by the time you advance to that final chapter most players are likely to have a very powerful army and the boss does not seem to scale well to that i beat the boss in 2 3 turns with my 60k threat level beatrix and zelos squads but this isn t a huge issue since it can be easily fixed the unique mercenaries are needlessly expensive considering that many of them have average stats the ai of your units attacks can be very frustrating at times for example with any ranged unit the target leader command seems to result in only a marginal emphasis on targeting the leader the bigger frustration for me was when my units would overkill a single enemy unit with all of their attacks consuming a turn and wasting potential damage on other enemies the ai should be tuned to ignore enemies that have already been dealt enough damage to be killed off rather than having your whole unit target the same 1 archer for a million damage while the units behind it escape notice the option to sell class change materials such as horses iron or gems should be implemented towards the latter half of the game you ll likely unlock a tech tree option that causes the refund of dozens of class upgrade materials retroactively specifically iron and obsidian at this point you ve usually settled on your squads and class options so having 60 iron and 40 obsidian sitting there when you could be buying mercs or rare artifacts instead would be nice a few missed opportunities for some new unique additions to the cast and more interaction in my opinion such as general ragavi or a certain brooding ninja assassin some character endings left something to be desired for me this was mainly with zelos as although the mc s whereabouts were examined no such insight was given to the dark knight i have never taken this much time to type out a review i am overall quite satisfied with the game and more importantly i see it as a very promising start to what is hopefully a long and successful series that constantly improves itself with each iteration i only put more writing in the con section to see improvements made as i really wouldn t care enough to provide feedback if i didn t see a lot of potential in sow fans of similar games would do well to check this one out and support the creators
