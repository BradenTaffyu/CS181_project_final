2017 over 40 hours on record still plenty of things to do that s a good start for a review so first of all you need a pretty powerful machine to have this monster of a game run without crashes i m using an i7 7700 with a geforce 1060 and 16 gb of ram game crashed only once since i got it which was after 6 hours of play and on patch 1 1 so a long time ago the 2 reserves are amazingly detailed and with patch 1 3 4 and 5 the hunting part became more accessible this feels great and immersive and i have friends getting new computer equipment just to play this finding the outposts is one part of the game which will get you on the road for quite some time outposts are still unfortunately the only way to fast travel so to complete your missions you will need them just finding one might get you more than 15 minutes especially without using cheat maps and going by all the lookout stations the game the animal tracking dead rabbits to follow when going after coyotes since 1 5 yeeah the shooting rifles and bows it s all good could use more animals to shoot ducks geese meh even fishing could be cool in there enoy this version as much as possible because i don t think the console version coming up has any chances to deliver a good and solid 8 out of 10
