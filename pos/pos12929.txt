2019 very good game also would you be able to add nature controls because using high energy vessel explosives in the air shoot lightning but it has limits maybe add a button to strike lightning a button to make a small lightning storm a button to make a tornado an earthquake button flood button tsunami button a meteor button and a volcano button which would just spew fire out of the ground this could really improve people playground because when ever people play games having control of the elements makes the game much more fun if you can put them in a nature tab also try to add buildings in their own section of the spawn menu which can be damaged to give people more stuff to destroy add the ability to amplify generators or add an industrial generator finally add a heat ray which acts like the laser but you can change the color of the laser and all living matter except androids get vaporized into ash while androids explode also add the ability to change the color of the laser all in all very fun game if you take my suggestions people might like this game a lot more
