2020 the monkey knowledge powers and heroes really streamline the game and the new graphics make it a clear improvement to btd5 while some monkeys i enjoyed using aren t in the game at the moment the new pathways for all the monkeys make interesting choices and varied gameplay combined with the new chimps mode my only real critique are some of the latest maps have been a little frustrating and not as fun to play on as btd5 and early btd6 maps but the consistency of balance changes new maps new heroes towers make the game a constantly evolving experience usually for the better 8 9 10
