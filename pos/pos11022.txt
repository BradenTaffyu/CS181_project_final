it has its problems that i hope the devs sort out but i ve generally enjoyed it during my nearly 90 hours of playing a big issue i have right now is that cims seem to always prefer cars over public transport and cause massive traffic jams despite good connections being available to them for cheap and sometimes even free it s way too car centric to create more european style cities or to generally make cities with more pedestrian public transport centered infrastructure i have hope for this game
