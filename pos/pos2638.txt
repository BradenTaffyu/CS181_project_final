2023 there are good gachas out there limbus company is a good game jokes aside and in short i like it i especially like in that order story gameplay graphics i don t like bugs except gregor 140 hours and counting story the story is amazing it uses lore from their previous games and sets a great story in it note that i speak of four first chapters which are out at the moment i want to note specifically each character their interaction with each other and the world around them and last but not least the writing style each chapter is better than the last a very gripping and thoughtful story visuals it looks marvelous once again the artstyle is similar to previous titles i like it at the very least you can t deny it has style gameplay gameplay is enjoyable management part tends to be the focus of gacha games limbus is aggressively generous if you spend as much time here as in any other game of the same genre you won t know what to do with all the resources this can potentially be the case for lunacy that s the resource you spend on characters in a gacha spending money on this game feels akin to charity the intersting part of gameplay is actually fighting you prepare by forming a team where ideally everyone is synergize with one another the story is about your team the gameplay is about your team peak then it s time for combat it s stylish and that s consistent and applies to all fights there is an interesting thing about difficulty actually chores like daily and weekly fights are easy and can be done with your eyes closed there is a button that you press two times and win a fight that was a problem apparently so they added a button to press one time and skip the fight then it s hard in some story moments and in special challenges that s where you need to prepare for it and then actually think your moves through engaging gameplay is really not something i say often about these games my point is it knows where it to challenge you and where it would be a bother downsides as ecstatic as i am reality is no game is ideal the only real downside with this game for me are bugs it has a lot of bugs they usually get fixed so then it doesn t until next update it s a testing thing i guess honestly other parts are too good for me to care all in all good game would recommend to my friends family enemies and random strangers
