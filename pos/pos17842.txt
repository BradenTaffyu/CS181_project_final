let s be honest the launch of this game was disappointing having been a part of the co dev team i was surprised at how the launch product looked compared to what we thought it was going to be but since then the devs have worked really hard to listen to the community and create the game we ve all been waiting for there was a lot of negativity around the break from sega but at this moment in time i believe that relic is truly on the right track with coh3 all matches in coh3 are fun the optimisation is better than it s ever been and the variety of units maps battlegroups which have been added to the game in recent months are starting to bring the game up to the high standards that coh1 and coh2 brought to the rts scene the game is receiving new features and updates regularly as well as balance changes which keep the game fresh for me of course i m sad that the game doesn t have a functioning observer mode yet which would allow the tournament community to thrive more than it currently can that aside i ve waited a year for the right moment to say that coh3 is a great game and worthy of it s place in the franchise
