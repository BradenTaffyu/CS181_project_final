2021 early access review i ve tried out a decent few factory games before and none of them have come even remotely close to catching my interest as much as dyson sphere program factorio for example is a pretty clever game and i don t mean to knock it but i quickly lost interest because it didn t really feel as though there was anything cool to work towards as in it felt like the purpose of the factory was just the factory itself there may have been some hazy end goal but there was nothing in between to spark my awe just endless automation dyson sphere program takes the creative problem solving logistics planning aspects of the factory game genre and just in my humble opinion sparks it to its fullest potential almost there is always room for improvement but we ll get there in this game you aren t just automating things to be as efficient and organized and convenient as possible you re still doing plenty of that of course but along the way you also get to build incredible sci fi devices launching thousands of solar sails to orbit around your nearest star to gather energy for you upgrading your mech to travel between solar systems at warp speed building vast networks of automated drones to deliver resources between planets for you it s not solely about the planning there are also actual moments of cathartic exciting payoff that come to you frequently by just being an immensely cool game on a conceptual level if you are new to the genre i am relatively new considering i gave up on others before overcoming their main hurdles this game will be challenging to approach i distinctly remember a point about six or so hours in where i almost gave up and quit because i felt like there was just too much stuff to figure out at once and i didn t know my next step and i just had no idea where to go next but i stuck it out and just started researching the coolest looking thing and the next day a weekend ten hours went by of me playing and hardly noticing so basically what you should take from this is that you should go into this game with the determination to overcome a steep learning curve or just recognize that it s probably not your cup of tea now the negatives i personally find space travel annoying and stressful being trapped in space drifting into an infinite void with no hope in sight scares me on a deep psychological level so when i have to travel between planets with nothing but a finite tank of fuel and the possibility that i might accidentally miss my target and be slingshotted around its orbit into vast darkness the rational part of my brain tells me i can just load a save but the ape part of my brain is annoyed that my management game is now a horror game i d like a technology in the research tree that can shuttle the player automatically between planets mostly for my own sanity the second thing is mostly a early access type thing that i m sure will be improved on in the future i want more endgame tech to exist like the ability to destroy entire planets to gain all their resources in one fell swoop or create wormholes for instant teleportation between points in space or create entire planet sized space stations yeah 2 3 of those suggestions is just describing the death star deal with it things like that which actually require access to the immense energy of a dyson sphere will add a ton more spice to the game which of course already has plenty but there can never be too much the final thing is actually something that is not in the game yet but will be please don t add combat i know i m probably in the minority here but the game is complex enough without that on top of it maybe as like a rare event in specific locations it would be fine but for it to be a constant nuisance that threatens to destroy parts of one s factory at any moment is just too annoying to even think about all in all game looks visually incredible haven t noticed a single substantial bug very complex and interesting to play if the idea of creating vast automatic factories that can create anything you want on a whim and can span multiple planets with the goal of turning entire stars into your own personal generator intrigues you i highly recommend giving this a try
