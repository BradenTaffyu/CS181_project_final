cities skylines 2 is a game that is frustrating to play but every time i start it up i end up sinking hours into it yes its buggy and co should have put more development time into it however im sure the release date was set by paradox to fatten those end of the year reports but its got great bones and is only getting better with time i cant wait to see where this game is next year and with more mod support if you aren t a huge city building fan wait for some more updates before jumping in
