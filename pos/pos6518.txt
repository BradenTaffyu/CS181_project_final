2021 what s the appeal of euro truck simulator 2 honestly i can t explain maybe it is the tranquil nature of the game you drive around deliver freight you drive around more freight no enemies to shoot nothing to fight it s just driving through europe visiting the cities looking at the landscapes even if you had seen all the countries yourself there s something about watching them in a game like for example i was in luxor and then serious sam came out out and it started there with the tempel of hatchepsut and the feeling off i ve been there was around the game only has a very rundimentary management sim you can buy garages trucks and hire drivers who do the trucking and make you money which enables you to get better and better trucks tralers and equipment while you also truck around i guess what makes the game fun is the slow paces driving gameplay along with the radio system you can listen to radio from all around the world if you update the list and thus go to belgium and listen to belgian radio or go to the uk get freaked out because they drive on the wrong side and you surely crash but bbc radio at least keeps you entertained while you crash the truck and up the cargo i started out with a controller and it was ok it was llke a slow paced racing game then i bought a steering wheel thrustmaster tmx pro and that was a whole different dimension force feedback and a wheel adds so much to this it s like a total different game the tmx by now also got expanded with th th8a shifter because the f1 style gear switches aren t fun driving a truck around europe with various laws regulations and speed limits is fun while visiting the landmarks the missions also range from small cargo to vehicles to oversized massive machines that slow you down the game also gives you the option to customize your truck wheels interios and thanks to the workshop you get a ton of items additionally you can turn your truck in a massive kindergarten or just add a coffe mug everything is allowed the dlc seem plenty but the only requirements are the land expansions those are massive and add several countries per pack the other dlcs aren t mandatory but more cosmetical for your truck a lot of the fun also comes from the workshop wether it s new vehicles for the traffic new truck skins better graphics or weather effects the graphics are ok the sound is good you definitely want to add radio stations because they work great personally i really drive with nights with alice cooper or antenne rock another important mod is promods it adds more cities more of everything in any case if you don t want constant action this is a great game my definitive reccommendation is a steering wheel the game is lame with keyboard mouse not satisfying with a controller but get a good wheel and pedals with force feedback that s really mandatory and it s just so much fun to drive around
