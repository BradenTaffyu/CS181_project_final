2023 limbus company truly is a unique experience and a breath of fresh air among recent games and i ll try to convey what makes it so good i ll start with the negatives to get them out of the way when first starting the game the tutorial is very confusing this coupled with the bad optimization on mobile made my game crash when i tried to resume my play it made me start from the beginning wanting to skip the scene i had already seen i pressed skip which made me skip the whole tutorial leaving me on the main screen searching for a good 30 minutes how to proceed forward so i can totally see how it deterred newcomers from the franchise while the optimization is a bit better since launch it s still not perfect with big improvements planned for later this year i advise sticking to pc for the time being onto the positives first is the art direction each character has a distinct design that suits their personality and their literature counterpart from their demeanor accessories habits as well as ids and egos background arts limbus also dodges the common gacha flaw that other games have the in game sprites look good each character and their alter ego have unique animations that actually look good instead of just looking good in their splash art jpg which leads to my next point how does limbus fare as a gacha limbus could be described as a fair gacha the pull system goes as follows you have 12 base characters every pull is a copy of these 12 or a sr 00 or ssr 000 alter ego of them for each individual pull you get a 12 8 chance to get any sr 2 9 for a ssr and a 1 3 chance to get an ego a super attack your character can use these are removed from the gacha pool once you get them every copy of a character you already have gives you shards of this character that you can use to claim another alter ego of this same character in the dispenser the devs also recently added a hard pity system where you can claim a banner character after 200 pulls on the same banner which is good for whales but most people won t need it i can t speak for others but imo lc does very well to avoid fomo every banner is eventually available in the dispenser at the price of shards and these shards are infinitely farmable the devs give so much away for free that as a f2p player except for seasonal battle pass i have every characters and egos and have enough shards stored for the next 2 banners tldr limbus company is a non predatory gacha game some describe it more as a live service game i do still recommend to stay away from it if you have a gambling addiction now onto the best part and what project moon the developers are renowned for the storytelling the city is a dystopian future you are not a good person your sinners are not good people hell they try to kill each other every time you look away but damn they are just too wacky and endearing to not get attached to them every cutscene is worth viewing and listening to as each voice actor portray their character perfectly the game knows very well when it should be funny and when it should be serious and it makes you go through so many different emotions that you will laugh and you might even cry by the end of canto 4 now this is not unique to this game as the previous 2 did as well but it is full of literature history religion and philosophy reference while the two previous games referenced jewish mysticism this one has each character referencing the main character of a classic literature book from different continents and ages while the main character and the general storyline are loosely based on dante s inferno this is sure to please players that are well read or those that like to make the extra effort of going through analysis and summary videos to get an even fuller picture conclusion while the barrier for entry is a little steeper than the other games in the genre limbus company will make your stay worthwhile rewarding you with an amazing story produced by a studio that will keep trying their hardest to give you a satisfying gameplay loop because compared to a lot of producers in the current industry project moon actually does care
