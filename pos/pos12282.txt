2020 gmod has been waiting a long long time for me to give my thoughts about it what is my opinion exactly i love it i haven t really played it as much as i used to but i want to get back into it the amount of games that are on it with the variety of actual things to do in the sandbox mode when i tell you that i ve been playing gmod for years i m talking about starting my journey with this game around 5ish years ago over that time i ve been an admin on a ton of servers within different gamemodes and it really gives you a different perspective i always thought the sandbox edition of the game wasn t really going to be that fun it s up to your mind though on how you can make it fun whether that s spawning a car with boosters and flying around the map or torturing npcs i have to say though that the multiplayer sandbox is better than doing it by yourself it kind of gives you the opportunity to build together instead of yourself 100 the best gamemodes are darkrp murder trouble in terrorist town jailbreak and potentially prop hunt i feel that prop hunt can get old after a while potentially the same with ttt but it is fun for a while i mean i have almost clocked in a phat 1000 hours on this game after all i constantly have memories running a darkrp base with my brother and raiding for those beautiful beautiful money printers going on murder and screaming for the sheriff to finally shoot whoever was chosen to destroy all of us sometimes i have to admit i d just hop on to random servers just to troll with the server and chuck a couch prop at some unknowingly suspect garry s mod has a special place in my heart
