2013 this game has bugs and it does have features that weren t the smartest move since shogun 2 however the game has a fun factor that trumps all of its downfalls ca implemented certain features in this total war game that will make it harder to play older tw games and they did in fact put in more beneficial and simpler features than poorly implemented ones the game suffers from ai problems and other misc bugs and i feel it s not nearly as polished as shogun 2 one of the most polished tw games after expansions patching imo but it has a way better campaign factions unit rosters building culture rosters and other features that make it a lot more fun than shogun 2 i wrote a positive review about shogun 2 before claiming it to be the best tw game released ever and while that s true for the most polished and bug free total war ever i feel that rome 2 will become the better game if it continue to be patched positively so in summary i feel shogun 2 is the better polished and bug free game rome 2 is the more fun game and better campaign with more interesting units it just needs help to improve and polish it
