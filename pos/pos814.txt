2017 in the 90s i spent countless hours playing harvest moon on my game boy and super nintendo now i am 25 and i have to say it s like no time has passed at all when i play this game all that harvest moon experience did not really help me out in my daily life but it certainly has helped me log 81 hours in stardew valley in less than a month there are still so many mysteries and unexpected layers to this game that for 9 00 during the steam sale i am blown away this game really is a love letter written to harvest moon despite the guinea pig drama thank you to the individual who created this masterpiece
