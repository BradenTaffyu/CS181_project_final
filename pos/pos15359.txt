2017 this is truly the best game i ve played on steam so far because of it s massive selection of items to craft things to do and tactics to choose from the fact that you can stray from the meta and still do amazingly well is perfect as i like doing things my way the steam workshop is so easy to use on this game you literally subscribe to a steam user and you will recieve the mod you desire unfortunatly with such an easy to use system in place a lot of people including myself download mods willy nilly up to a point where the don t starve experience fades away overtime with mods that make it easier to survive the game it s hardly still a challenge and ironicly i never die of starvation usually it s the dark shadow creatures or random bees that start nipping away at my health overall this game is amazing and on a scale of 1 10 id give this an 11 if i could unlike most games you can play this over and over without getting sick of it starting out new is always fun even if you already did it 100 times
