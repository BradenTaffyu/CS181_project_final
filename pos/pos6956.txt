2019 early access review i m currently 19 hours of game play in and its been a great time all the while sorry for the long review i have a hard time getting a point across in few words i originally got the game when it first released simply because it was a survival game with a premise i hadn t seen before and back then i played it for 20 minutes and then un installed at the time it was really buggy but i am glad that i came back to it to see that a lot of what i had issues with are either completely gone or mitigated to a point that i don t notice them overall the gameplay is great with it being challenging enough to keep me interested while still rewarding me for my efforts you progress slowly at first but after reaching your first couple islands the speed ramps up quite a bit making the pace acceptable though it does slow down a bit shortly after but it sets the pace making land fall at each new island gives you a pretty big break which personally made me really excited each time i spotted a new place to check out i could sit down and play for 5 hours a time which is amazing as most games these days cant manage my attention for more than an hour or two at a time that being said there are quite a few things that could be fixed such as materials as a whole getting even the most basic of materials is a massive undertaking taking up a lot of your time while you can use nets that automatically pick up materials it feels like the spawn rate of some of the most important stuff is far too low because of this progression at the very beginning is practically a snails crawl though it does pick up later stack limit is far too low considering the tiny inventory space you are given and with only one way to expand inventory which isnt possible until late game or you are lucky i found my raft over run with storage boxes building is another thing i would love to see get a bit more of an overhaul there just aren t enough options in the building process in my opinion with one corner piece not working at all and at their bid for more realism in the game certain building physics leave ugly and hilarious results there are very few furniture and decoration options thirst and hunger even in normal mode go down really fast barely a minute had passed and i went from full to only a quarter of either bar i spent more time struggling for food and water than anything else even in late game and the shark the damn shark his attack frequency on the raft itself is insane maybe a little more than a minute between attacks fighting it off is pointless i found it easier to just let it eat the one piece and replace it even when fighting it off you only get a minute of breathing room before he is back beating the shark back will be your main focus for the grand majority of the game leaving very little time for anything else especially early game its almost too frantic you can lure the shark away with bait which thankfully is extremely easy to make but that doesnt last very long either so when you go diving around islands for materials which is the only way to get certain ones you have maybe a minute to gather then get back fighting it off underwater is possible but its difficult and it only goes away for a brief amount of time i know the shark is really the only threat but making the raft usable at all takes so much time and effort that its ridiculous the early to mid game is frantic that until you get certain materials you wont be progressing at all oh and for some reason he can attack the very middle of the raft even though he is only supposed to be able to go for the outer layer bastard ate my melons that way overhaul building by adding more options and making it just slightly less realistic and adding a few more decor options a bit more of a item progression example wood bronze iron steel since there is really only 1 upgrade of most things making your progression leap ahead tweak the decline of starvation and thirst slightly and tweak the shark especially the attack and respawn frequency make bait last longer or make it to wear you can ward him off a bit better in the late game the things that bothered me were all little things that honestly didn t take away much and can be managed even the damn shark if you are careful about time and material management it can be frustrating and is often insultingly unfair this is somewhat rare but once you get the hang of it gets a bit easier i can see quite a few people getting so irked by these they drop the game for a while like i did that being said 8 10 game would play a lot more of if they keep updating with more things to do if you made it this far into my long winded and opinionated review than you are my favorite kind of person
