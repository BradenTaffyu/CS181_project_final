2019 i originally played dark souls 3 for around 100 hours on the ps4 to get straight to the point it was one of the best gaming experiences i ve ever had having recently got a pc replaying the game has reminded me why its a hauntingly beautiful journey through a terrifying land as the tag line states you will die again and again however the game encourages and rewards your resilience if you embrace its harsh lessons every death every encounter becomes a learning experience the next time you rise from the ashes you will be stronger smarter braver its not difficult purely to frustrate the player or to be edgy its difficult to provide that sense of hard fought victory a feeling i ve rarely encountered in any other game series despite its harsh world there are genuine moments of beauty and wonder a dark dungeon giving way to a breathtaking shimmering city scape compelling but cryptic tales of friendship loss and betrayal punctuate the otherwise stern and cold world combat seems simple at first but hides great depth especially if you are interested in pvp there is amazing weapon variety and many diverse and bad ass looking armour sets to discover coop and invasions are great fun and still seem fairly active despite the games age who doesnt enjoy some jolly cooperation o some folks will be happy to help you out with that boss your stuck on others will try to murder you and take your tongue as a trophy but hey thats humanity right its dark soul on the down side not a lot for me sometimes connection can be a problem more so than on the ps4 it seems i sometimes connect with laggy hosts sometimes there are hackers too i would recommend backing up your save regularly if playing on pc and looking to play online hopefully some one found this helpful peace
