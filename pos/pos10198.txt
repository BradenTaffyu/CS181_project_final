2017 early access review about rimworldrimworld is a self proclaimed a sci fi colony sim driven by an intelligent ai storyteller it is a god game in which you take care of a group of colonists give them orders and ensure their well being throughout the game the storyteller will trigger random events some good some bad to keep you on your toes the gameplaysimilar to other god games rimworld is a rather indirect experience most of the time you will plan strategies issue orders and check up on everyone to see if they have any needs progress manifests through a larger base more technologies and better weaponry depending on your scenario you will begin with bow and arrow or simple bolt action rifles and end up with power armor and rocket launchers the goalin the default setting the goal is for you to repair a spaceship found somewhere on the planet repair it and flee said planet to be honest this goal is more of a pro forma goal as i personally believe the goal is just to build a base and enjoy yourself the aithe description of the game mentions an intelligent ai storyteller what this means is you can choose between three different storytellers as of version a17 these storytellers have varying personalities which events trigger how often the classical storyteller is designed to provide a steadily increasing challenge the relaxed storyteller is aimed to provide a more laid back experience my personal favourite while random storyteller is you guessed it more random in addition to choosing which storyteller you like you can also set a difficulty which affects how much of a curveball they are going to throw you if you re unlucky one of your colonists might have a heart attack while a generator explodes igniting your warehouse in which you store your highly volatile chemical fuel all while a group of heavily armed raiders land in rocket pods and promptly begin murdering everyone in sight but hey at least sometimes a squirrel tames itself beginner friendlinessi personally did not have a problem with understanding the game s core mechanics the in game tutorial does a great job at explaining the gameplay basics and the controls and after an hour or two of playing around you ll get the hang of it i should mention that the game does have a very active subreddit r rimworld and a somewhat extensive wiki which are great sources for additional knowledge all in all i consider this game to be easy to pick up if you do not go overboard in the beginning and settle in the middle of an ice desert on extreme difficulty on your first run modseven though the game is in early access the game has excellent modding support after several hours of playthrough i did install a few mods which just extended the game in a way i enjoyed it one mod for instance allowed me to create prosthetics myself in the vanilla game anything more complex than a peg leg needs to be purchased from exotic goods vendors if they have them available another allowed me to set up a temporary camp instead of a permanent settlement which i enjoyed will i have fun with this game if you can have fun with a game that does not provide explosions and action 100 of the time then you can have fun with rimworld the game is easy to pick up yet has a surprizing amount of depth and complexity once you get into it that you can easily sink whole days into it i mean in which other game do you hear questions like is it feasable to create an organ farm or should i sell my slaves directly or how can i stop my drug addicted cook from killing his wife
