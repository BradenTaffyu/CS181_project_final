2016 it s been said that everything is better when space is involved whether it be godzilla dragonball or in this case strategy games while there are probably exceptions to that stellaris is not one of them this europa universalis civilization game in space is pretty neat dif you have played paradox strategy games before then you have a pretty good idea what you are in for lots of detail variety and complexity in order to make a game with enormous depth and replayability this time around however there might be even more of it since you are no longer confined to the realms of history for there are aliens quite alot of them too in fact there s basically a limitless number of potential species at play here between the pre created ones the random generator and my personal favorite your own imagination as you are able to create and customize your own empires to play as oh and there is a unit editor too that you get to play with with lots of custom modules you unlock via research in the game i m a bit of a sucker for customization so having that stuff was already a major plus for me it s one of the reasons i liked sid meier s alpha centauri so much i played with the unit editor in that to an insane degree and the one in stellaris is about equal if not better but since this is a paradox game there is also a mountain of policy stuff and edicts you can enact that further improve the customization what kind of space empire do you want to play do you want to be the huggly democracy who loves aliens and being nice to people how about a psychopathic empire that enslaves purges xenos and nukes planets for fun or perhaps a science driven nation that has few scruples and is not above screwing with underdeveloped civilizations you can do all of that and more and naturally you can change your style throughout the game as well if you want to the technology stuff is pretty interesting too with everything you research adding new buildings modules to attach to ships or more options to help your space empire run better you are free to choose what to research which further adds to the freedom of choice this game has by allowing you to pursue what you desire while there are some pathways in the sense that you will need to research basic laser guns before you can move on to more advanced ones for the most part you are free to pursue whatever tech you wish also when you fight people you can use your science ships to scan the debris of your enemies in order to gain further scientific knowledge that you might have yet to unlock so even if you aren t a science god you can always just murder people and steal their research instead xdbut be careful because while this game starts out essentially as europa civilization in space there are some added twists that can shake up your game and have severe consequences i m talking about two things fallen empires and crisis events fallen empires are as the name implies ancient space empires that have declined and retreated to closed off enclaves where they sit and watch the galaxy as the new civilizations grow and fight it out sometimes they might decide to wake up and try to regain their former glory at the expense of everyone else piss them off and they will unleash some serious power but if you can beat them their gigantic tech advantage can become yours as well once you have salvaged the remains of their mighty fleets and one way to piss them off is to meddle in dangerous research projects that these ancient empires in their arrogance and experience probably know won t lead to anything good go too far and you might provoke one of the game s three end game crisis events that unleash a deadly foe that has the potential to take over the entire galaxy if you are not careful go ahead and research sentient ai tech create synthetics that are superior to organics in just about every way have them fight your battles and work your mines and then don t be surprised if those ai s decide one day that killing you and all other organics would be fun or create jump drives that open holes in space to allow fast travel only to have something crawl out of those holes that is quite hungry lastly there s the good old tyranid zerg style bug invasion though i have yet to actually experience that one because unlike those other two there is no technology to research in order to trigger their arrival and it s the last achievement i need too i could keep going on and on about this gamey but i have to stop at some point and that may as well be now besides all you need to know is whether or not this game is a yummy strategy title that is fun to play and play alot of and the answer to that is simple and very uncomplicated yes nom nom space game d
