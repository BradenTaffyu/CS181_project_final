2016 edit still love this game but serious paradox shame on you your dlc practices were bad enough on things like euiv and hearts of iron iv but really raising your prices on your old games kindly go to the corner until you thought about what you ve done stellaris is probably the easiest to play by the normal standards of paradox interactive s grand strategy games certainly it isn t as overwhelming as the victoria series or the eu series i admit i was more than a little frustrated to hear the annouancement of a space 4x game since we re not exactlty short of them right now and that i was hoping to see victoria iii also stellaris didn t feel like it was complete when it was released things like choosing wargoals or diplomacy was clearly not in a finished state at the beginning though recent patches have fix a lot of that still stellaris is far from a bad game much like the city building game cities skylines it feels like paradox is drawing a lot of influence and even bits of the ui from other games for stellaris some of it looks a little like civilization own 4x sci fi game but stellaris has enough of its own identity you really get the feel of taking a small single planet and forging an empire that spans hundreds of worlds which is possible if you have a computer to support the largest maps i really like how there aren t set empires but rather a pool of traits appearances and abilities that can appear so you never know what nation you will face will it be a bunch of peace loving terrifying looking space spiders or will you fight religious xenophobic adorable space foxes you can of course customize your own empire from choosing your species to government and even what its call the ship prefexes the title of your leaders you can be a kind leader who leads a democratic peace loving pacifists who grant robots and aliens equal rights and hopefully not have a neighbor who stomps a mudhole in you or you can be space hitler because it isn t a real paradox stragety game if you don t have those kind of choices stellaris is a pretty good game that will probably be the easiest for new players unfamiliar with paradox s stragety games to cut their teeth on and will have enough depth to keep veterans satisfied though in that case you may want to explore some of the mods i feel comfortable recommending it but as always you should look up let s plays to see the gameplay yourself and determine if this is a game you would enjoy make sure it is version 1 2 or newer because the 1 0 and pre launch builds were patched a lot
