2023 finally getting around to writing a review for this gem from the perspective of a 5bc player one of the best games out there pinnacle of it s genre incredibly tight and fluid controls combined with the absolute plethora of weapons and skills allow for all manner of playstyles from long distance ranged gameplay to becoming a tornado of death blitzing everything in your path if you have the skill for it however if you like to adopt that sort of playstyle as i love to do i think the fast paced action you can have in this game is almost unmatched you can never get too comfortable because one slip up where you get lazy and you can easily lose 75 of your hp and suddenly you don t feel so invincible anymore if you aren t already dead but it is not unfair if you lose health it s on you massive amount of content and many amazing dlcs that are all worth it the devs are awesome still continuing to deliver great updates and patches brilliant sound design weapon and skill variety environment design and even humour has only gotten better and better with time do yourself a favour and pick it up can t recommend it enough flippin excellent
