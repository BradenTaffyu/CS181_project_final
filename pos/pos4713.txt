2023 backlog my nemesisi initially began playing fallout 4 back in 2019 4 years after its release but it ended up on my backlog for an additional 4 years not sure what happened as i invested more than 20 hours into it and i loved every minute of it in any case i m glad i finally managed to complete it this year with over 130 hours spent with the base game and its story oriented dlc far harbor the storythe start of the game is just superb this time we start in the present and witness the nuclear blast itself from a safe distance of course then we end up in a vault which will be our safe haven for many years to come but not in a way you d think as we are put into stasis we witness not only the murder of our wife but the kidnapping of our son the objective is clear as we set out into the commonwealth after waking up locating our only next of kin once and for all the graphicsthis is a sequel released many years after its predecessor so as one could expect the graphics look much better but where fallout 4 really shines is the colour palette itself for me number 3 looked way too simplistic or dull if i may number 4 finally shows us how an post apocalyptic world can look like v a t s and weapon customisationthe targeting system was already great back then so this is something one can only enjoy here when it comes to combat as for weapons there are tons of objects materials we can find that we can use for weapon customisation at benches some make the damage done greater but in certain cases we can change how the gun itself operates do you prefer a rapid firing laser weapon instead of shooting one destructive beam off you go then it s also fun modifying the many melee weapons available post apocalyptic simsan interesting part of the game that was a bit of a hit and miss for me factions return and the first group you meet are the minutemen you also go back to the starting position where you used to live pre war to build your own settlement most of the objects you find can be scrapped for materials and even unnecessary parts of buildings can be immediately scrapped on the spot then you start putting down structures a radio beacon will be important to attract fellow survivors and even pieces of furniture inside houses or in the open as the people arrive you can assign them to help defend your settlement or start working on the fields yes you can have your own crops this is an exciting part of the game but it can quickly become tedious i wish scrapped materials were universally available across the many benches but this is not the case preston from minutemen will regularly tell you what new group of people require your assistance and by completing these quests we ll get access to new posts and consequently their benches then from time to time we have to defend these outposts not that anything bad happens if we fail such a quest these quests are mainly good for exploration purposes so i decided to focus on the story and move on instead factions and companionsonce again we have the opportunity to join various factions this affects the ending and we have several we can get i liked how the story wasn t black and white while the brotherhood of steel wanted to look good there were many aspects of their approach i didn t like the game gives you the option to meet the minutemen first that represent the sort of neutral option here s an important piece of information as it is not obvious you can join multiple factions later quests for the others will still be available if you have reached the point of no return the game will notify you anyway don t be hesitant when the option to join is offered as for companions we have many who comment on the actions we do or the decisions we make during a dialogue this affinity meter can increase to a point where romance options open up and we can receive a special perk from our companion when maxed out i can t really comment any further as i preferred dogmeat from start to finish your character is actually considered travelling alone this way so additional perks are available making you stronger it s a wasteland and it s the end of the world already i need no human beings just a trustworthy pet as my only loyal friend whose animations are superb what else the game has tons of places to explore you even find points of interest outside the boundaries of the map mutants ghouls and deathclaws return and we now have a lot of androids synths as enemies animal parts can be cooked which is a must for additional effects and radiation elimination there are many recipes not just for cooking but also for making our own chemicals i loved this game after a while i felt weaker but with additional perks around level 25 30 you can become pretty strong so much so that almost nothing will pose a challenge it should also be noted that there isn t really a cap level so feel free to pick any perk you like fallout 4 is still a fresh experience for me i loved the exploration part and i preferred ditching any companion for dogmeat it was just us out in the wasteland exploring long hidden vaults and completing multiple missions for any allies we could get to know i tried only a couple of radio stations to listen to and only for a short period of time not even songs could save me from the preferred loneliness thus i recommend you the same loneliness in the wasteland of commonwealth edit nominated for labour of love 2023
