2023 the hunter call of the wild has to be one of the best hunting games out there i ve spent many hours playing this game alone and with friends it is incredible i need to play it more the animals behave well and are realistic as far as a game can make them so many funny things happen in this game especially with friends sometimes glitches happen but they often are comical rarely game breaking there are a wide variety of weapons too it s not overly challenging yet not too easy it s just an excellent game for pros and beginners alike
