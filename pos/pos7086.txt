2019 i can t review ats without comparing it to ets2 ats is in many ways similar to ets2 both are truck simulators that do good job in representing the countries they are based in with great truck models nice environments with recognisable locations on the map and a fun gameplay loop but ats is more advanced than ets2 in a lot of ways ats has more features overall and while some of them will get backported to ets2 over time ats seems to be where scs is trying out new ideas first the games settings also make them feel quite different unlike europe where cities are densely packed difficult to navigate and the only roads that aren t between dense urban areas are the winding mountain roads of the alps and italy in ats you drive in the usa the country where cars are kings roads are wide and you can spend in game hours on lonely roads going through deserts or forests without even a gas station to break up the monotony in ets2 you constantly have to be aware of turns and unexpected road diversions but in ats you can easily drive in a straight line for hours on end the great scenery makes this work though in 100 hours ats has never gotten boring for me if you just want to get any one truck sim game i d recommend ets2 as it is the older game and has more content and as a european it is the more recognisable for me but if you are an american or already own ets2 and want something new and exciting you really can t go wrong with ats
