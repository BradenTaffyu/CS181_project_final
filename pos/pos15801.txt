2021 early access review i really like this game very satisfying the only grievance i have with this game is that it seems things are considered clean when you reach a certain percentage that s fine for most thing but my inner perfectionist feels a bit cheated when it comes to big objects like walls and floors like i m getting punished for being thorough i ve cleaned almost the entire wall floor and there s only one big patch of dirt left in the middle i start on it but then the wall is considered clean enough and the big patch of dirt just disappears xd and i m sitting there like but i wasn t done d but yeah that s probably just me so if no one else complains about it just forget it hehe x
