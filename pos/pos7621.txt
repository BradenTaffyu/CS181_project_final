2023 two point campus is a management simulator where the player must build universities to train students in a range of subjects this is the follow up to two point hospital and campus includes many of the same gameplay features so if you ve played hospital campus will feel familiar gameplay train chefs knights clowns wizards spies sports stars and more using various course specific teaching rooms as well as the lecture theatre library and private tuition room look after student and staff basic needs with a dormitory toilets showers staff room student lounge student union vending machines and food kiosks some courses are dangerous so you ll need a medical office to treat student injuries and you ll need a counsellor to improve student happiness to prevent them from dropping out entertain students with arcade machines various social clubs film nights and live music gigs train staff with new and improved skills and research upgrades for equipment to improve student grades rival schools will send their students to damage your equipment so you ll need janitors trained in security to shoot them with water pistols campus equivalent of hospital s ghosts campus is easier and less stressful than two point hospital the main reason for this is because of how the game is divided into academic years at the start of each year you ll select which courses to run and the game will tell you exactly how many students you ll receive and how many teachers and rooms you ll need you won t get taken by surprise by a sudden increase in demand that you re not prepared to handle which frequently happened in hospital with the main infrastructure in place at the start of the academic year during the year you ll mostly just have to deal with minor requests from students such as buying equipment they need to complete assignments setting up new entertainment options or adding decorative items finances are quite easy to manage too you ll probably need loans to buy everything when first starting each university but the default tuition fees are so high that by year 3 i was usually making plenty of profit to pay back those loans and fund further expansion there are 12 maps which focus on a different main subject and you can earn up to a 3 star rating on each by achieving specific objectives some objectives relate to students passing courses with high grades others focus on student staff happiness entertainment hunger etc the most tedious objectives will be familiar to hospital players relating to attractiveness rating which forces you to literally cover the walls with paintings and posters floors with rugs and spam trees all over the outside area which in my opinion actually makes the campus look ugly but it gets the objective ticked off you ll only receive students for alternate subjects if you choose to add them so you can make each university feel unique which helps to reduce the game s repetitiveness this was my biggest complaint about hospital every map was basically the same because over time you d gradually receive patients for every illness so you d end up having to build every treatment room on every map however one thing that is extremely repetitive is campus radio dj dialogue especially if you want to 3 star each map you will hear the same stories and bad jokes over and over and over again technical it took me 68 hours to complete all maps with a 3 star rating the longer i played some maps my framerate started to dip into the 40 s and even occasionally the 30 s changing graphics settings didn t have any impact at all i even tried putting everything to minimum it just seems that the more students and staff you ve got the performance will eventually decline usually at that point i d already built most of what i needed and i d just be waiting for the more grindy 3 star requirements to complete and i don t think framerate is as important here as it would be for a fast paced action game but it still didn t feel good to look at i didn t experience any crashes or major gameplay bugs but i did see a few visual bugs on multiple occasions on different maps the bands i d booked for student union gigs would get stuck at the side of the stage no music would play the students would all stand still instead of dancing but they d all still get the happiness bonus for attending a live gig i saw multiple cheeseball matches where all players stood still for the whole match nobody took any shots but at the end i d still receive a message telling me if i won or lost and the final score i frequently saw doors to various rooms get stuck in a half open position with people clipping through until eventually it would resume opening and closing properly recommendationtwo point campus is a good game which fans of two point hospital or other management games will probably enjoy i think campus is better than hospital because its feels less repetitive and stressful
