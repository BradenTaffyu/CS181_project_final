2016 i will be the first to admit that when i saw this game floating around steam a week or two before its release i was kind of skeptic about it the art and pixel style threw me for a loop and while i loved harvest moon style games and rune factory 4 i wasn t too sure about spending money on this game i ve been burned before and i was wary of trying it it was about i think a day of or after the release and i noticed it had a small sale and i figured well i just got paid and it might be a good distraction until i find another game to play so uhm you might have noticed i have 71 hours of playtime so i figured i d better write my thoughts on why i love this game music 10 10everyone knows that what helps make a game great is the music it has i was immediatly sucked in by the music it reminded me so much of the harvest moon games i played that had such amazing music if there was a soundtrack available maybe there is i would be willing to drop money on it controls 7 10the controls of the game are not the worse i ve encountered but i feel it could be improved a bit honestly if i hadn t found the control options this would have had a 5 10 review instead the show tool hit location was not automatically selected so it led to some frustrating moments just trying to till the ground the combat was a bit frustrating since you had to turn your character in order to swing the sword in the exact direction it has to go in but after some practice i ve ironed out the kinks storyline 12 10oh my god guys this this right here helps make the game for me its honestly what i have been sorely missing in other farming games like harvest moon its not just till the land plant the seeds make the cash no this is much more then that i would love to go into detail but i don t want to give anything away to people who want to come in blind characters 10 10 these loveable characters have their own flushed out hopes fears and dreams they have their strengths their weaknesses and their own personality not one character is the same their life experiences make them what they are and their background helped shaped them but at the same time they grow they adapt they change the more you interact with them the more impact you have on their lives its amazing character customization 10 10what many harvest moon games lacked until recently was being able to customize your farmer however stardew has by far the best i have seen around 30 different hair styles over 100 different shirts to chose from skin color eye color and hair color you want to make yourself look like the hulk get your green on and hulk up for some farming want to be a vampire a demon you can be anything i would add more but honestly i am a little under the weather as i m writing this and i m rapidly running out of energy so a last few tid bits for you guys and gals considering this game this game does not end in an xx amount of years you can keep playing for as long as you want it doesn t matter what gender you are you can romance any of the 10 available are you a gal that likes other gals yep you can woo date and marry them are you a dude that wants to smooch woo and marry other dudes you can do that too guess what else you can do if you re unable to have kids the traditional way you can adopt you can have a family or if you don t want a kid you don t have to have one at least i m pretty sure you don t have to all in all 9 10 game that i plan on playing for a very long time
