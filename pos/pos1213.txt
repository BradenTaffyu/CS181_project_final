2022 early access review project zomboid is to me the only true zombie sandbox game out there is the first 20 hours u figuring out how to live more than 2 days yes but there are plenty of videos guides and mods as well as the sandbox settings themselves that u can tweak to give yourself a unique experience that makes it more fun for you the active modding community and the game still being developed just means the game will only keep evolving if you like zombie survival and haven t given zomboid a try don t keep waiting just try it already
