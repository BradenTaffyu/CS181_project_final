2014 early access review you can spend hours and hours on this game this is a really fun game and its not at all rocket science but it does require a bit of learning took me ane entire day to learn how to land on the mun then next thing you know i was learning how to leave our solar system with some mods added and some more work i was able to build monstrous space ship in career mode my advice is to invest in science and launch to space far looking forward to more update in this game need more aesthetic overhaul to the planet and moar planets if you do want to play this game and you re really bad theres a mod called mechjeb it will play the game for you if you re lazy it ll do it for you too the game is playable by anyone even if you don t understand basic rocket science though the elites will frown on you don t let that put you down build your own rockets build space planes rovers check base on planets check refueling station check diverting asteroids check great gameplay rocket simulation fun hours and hours of fun you can build space stations big rockets fuel stations even lunar stations hell you can even build a rover and space shuttle its not rocket science build rockets your way amazing mods going on for this game a bit steep learning curve takes time to understand at least a day and more learning to grasp the concept you ll be educated well this is a negative if you hate learning need more aesthetic overhaul mods help but the game needs that itself need more planets than just ours space is big and it should be bigger
