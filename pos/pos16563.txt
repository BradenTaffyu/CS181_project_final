2019 early access review this game is probably the most realistic car building game i ve played i do a lot of work on cars irl and this is the closest thing to how it is irl it s a very fun and enjoyable game to learn how to build and maintain a car i would highly recommend for anyone who has any interest in cars vehicle mechanics
