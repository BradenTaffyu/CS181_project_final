2022 i m not a big sw fan but this game is okay it would be more enjoyable for the sw fans out there the good part of the game is the main story you get also it s good that you can chose to be light dark side and jedi sith being independent of each other yes there can be ds jedi ls sith but just having the option to be sith will probably please most the bad part of the game is that they heavily restrict f2p players and even preferred accounts to an extent preferred having spent irl money or former subscriber you even get items from the main quest that you can t even use open as f2p really wtf overall i would say the f2p model is just an attempt to covert users to their subscription model regardless i still recommend this game solely on the fact that the game is still being carried by the die hard sw fans who have not yet attempted to play another mmo and it also helps that the gameplay doesn t totally suck
