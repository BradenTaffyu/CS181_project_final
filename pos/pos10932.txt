2016 i loved hoi iii with mods and i still do i wouldn t quite compare hoi iv to hoi iii though it s much easier to get into for newer players imo they ve also made offensives much simpler for better or worse depending on who you ask as the ai controls your troops during the attack you can still micro though if you like also hoi iv was built to support mods from day one of development my only complaint is the ai could use some work and the devs have said they will be working on tweaking it of course there will be more content in the upcoming dlcs as well all in all this is an outstanding game with zero bugs in 25 hours of playing i wasn t let down mostly because they were very open with their world war wednesday live streams so i got exactly what i was promised 9 10
