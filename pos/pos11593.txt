2020 early access review my boyfriend and i went into this game not expecting much but it was surprisingly quite fun the exploration and looting is a little repetitive but it works pretty well with the destructible environments having skill trees perks and a somewhat tiered crafting system gives a nice sense of progression as well i absolutely love the base building and coming up with defences against zombie hordes while i love the base building we have had some weird structural issues with the building system that has caused the last two of our painstakingly crafted home bases to randomly collapse into rubble and with no auto saves available it can be a huge put off after investing so much time and effort into a crucial part of the game overall it s still in alpha so i can see the potential and look forward to future updates
