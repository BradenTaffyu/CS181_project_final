2021 early access review so my review for caves of qud after having played it for a whole while seeing it transform quite drastically from multiple updates over the years and checking out the different kinds of versions i feel able to drop an informed review disclaimer this review is quite lengthy hit the char cap and you ll be forced to read through the walls of text to get the points i ll be trying to make but to give an early decision here is the tl dr up front an easy thumbs up for anyone who enjoys a hybrid roguelike with fixed topography but randomized tiles within and an actual story to follow where discovery is the name of the game if you however want an experience that stays true to the original dungeon crawlers that follow the same vein as rogue you might want to pass this instead of just giving out smalltime list of pros and cons i will briefly tackle different aspects of the game and shed my lights on them both good or bad with that let s talk story it s quite interesting indeed you are in a post post apocalyptic setting with civilizations having rebuild and using left behind technology of a highly intelligent precursor civilization to adapt to the scarcity of drinkable water either being a true kin or one of the mutated you try to just survive in this hostile environment all the while getting embroiled into a conflict that is far bigger than one might expect on the outset while not new as a concept the presentation and the way it is being sold to you really hammers in the fact that you yourself know next to nothing in regards to this hostile world which just gives you this sense of discovery even on multiple runs which you will be guaranteed to do due to the difficulty of the game but we ll talk about that soon for now let us talk gameplay and mechanics qud plays out like many classical roguelikes you start out by creating a character and get flat out bombarded with a whole lot of different choices play as true kin or a mutated where do you put your stats what race specific benefits do you want what do most of those options do you ll most likely be overwhelmed pretty quickly and that i feel is intentional you are suspected to not make it past certain areas on your first couple tries simply because the game is challenging not unfairly difficult but a challenge for the most part while it will make several bad first impressions this way it s a perfect teacher in showing you that you are at least at the start nothing special and just as likely to die than anything else so the playing field is level while this makes for a great challenge once you overcome this starting barrier a less steep entry level might be more suited to attract players other than that it just plays like any other classic roguelike rpg you fight level up do quests sell loot and try to survive without getting instakilled by something you d expect not to only to be wronged again interesting mechanics do crop up here already though as mentioned already water is scarce so not only do you need it to keep yourself alive and kicking but it is also the main currency besides trading valuables it is a fresh spin and keeps you on your toes thinking on the value of everything you find however you are barely knowledgeable and have to either indenfity many advanced items yourself or ask someone proficient enough to do this for you this ranges from something as simple as modified gear to firearms up to various energy cells and finally some high tech gadgets and weapons not only does it tie in exceptionally well into the whole discovery aspect it also can turn the tide of a hard run to come across an exceptionally powerful item early on how you build your character also changes the gameplay drastically while nothing stops you from being a regenerating steamroller with multiple arms to chop off limbs left right and center you could also just build yourself around companions or mental mutations which basically equate to space magic or ignore this altogether become a true kin and fill yourself with as many augments as you can get your hands on and can pay access to to wipe the floor with them non purists by ways of gun fu the amount of customization in both playstyle and character variety is just bonkers really it is highly conducive to player replayability and keeps you occupied for several hundred hours depending on how much tolerance you have for having to deal with the same fixed structures over and over again as mentioned already this game has a fixed topography and story meaning you will do the main questline along the way in which the locations themselves do not really change only what random items you find in them as well as the surrounding tiles and while the developers added randomized starting points it does nothing to change up more than the first two quests that you will do as you ll be on the critical path again anyways shortly if your tolerance for repeating starts is higher than average you ll have a great time testing out all the things you can do but now to something elsenamely to visuals and soundscape it s a blast true to many roguelikes the game is tilebased and that means the graphics are going to be archaic at best as any ascii game it has next to no graphics to speak off except for the standard tileset that the game is defaulting to which is exceptionally intricate and detailed while still being easily readable many areas also come with a specific background soundtrack that absolutely nails the supposed tone an area sets out for itself ranging anywhere from tribal or somber music to harsh industrial machine background noise that truly hammers in that you are in for a bad time just to name a few however the game also has a bunch of issues the biggest two imo i want to tackle for once there are the technical limitations of the underlying engine unity with how much there is going on at all times there being temperature and dispersion simulations kicking off to adequadly make gases and temperature flow into adjacant tiles the game will quickly turn into a recourse hog that has to warn you about its ram usage and advise you to save after a certain amount of playtime to not lose data due to crashing there s only so much one can do to fix something like it but it s an immersion killer nontheless the other problem however is one caused by the developers themselves even with good intentions and that is the issue of balancing the game has so many moving parts that balancing a game as vast as this is next to impossible while in itself not a problem the game also has a whole sleuth of intended mechanics that can be easily exploited to allow you to break the game and become a nigh unkillable god sometimes even by accident the issue that starts to crop up here is that the changes to balancing in order to at least migitate gamebreaking have bled into the game so harshly that the esper playstyle is affected by default and you are forced to gimp yourself or hybridize to avoid an unfair death i m talking about the psychic glimmer mechanic built around mental mutations you will amass glimmer for each rank of a mental mutation you own counting your ego mod and once you reach certain thresholds other espers and even otherworldly creatures will flow into the world and be on the hunt for you the problem here is that they scale a good chunk better than a player that is not outright looking to break the game meaning the more powerful you become by playing the quicker you ll fall to your doom and there s moments with very little wiggle room to get out of a tight spot yet you are supposed to become stronger regardless to take on the more difficult parts of the game and to just survive some of the harsh fights the game intends you to take a less player dictating approach would suit more here that sums up what i have to say here can still recommend regardless
