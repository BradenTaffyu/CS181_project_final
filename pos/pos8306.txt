i thought this was going to be a depressing hard choices simulator which kept me away for a long time when i finally gave it a shot i was surprised at how much it s about endurance hope and human ingenuity it s definitely not easy but you can not just survive but thrive it s kind of a shame that once you thrive the game basically plays itself but you can consider that a reward can you imagine living in a society where people are willing to work together to do what is necessary to survive a world threatening climate disaster
