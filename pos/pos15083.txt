2014 early access review don t starve together is the multiplayer version of klei entertainment s survival game don t starve dst adds an increasing level of difficulty due to the rebalancing of the game playing the game solo is not recomended due to enemies having an increased amount of health the rebalancing in the game is fair as long as you have friends to help you out dst is still in beta so not everything has been added to the game yet but klei is hard at work adding more and more to the game if you like don t starve you re going to love don t starve together and i highly recommend trying it out for yourself
