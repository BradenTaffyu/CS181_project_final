2019 i have less than zero interest in card games and don t really care much for rougelikes but slay the spire is incredibly good and fun everything just works visuals are nice animations are quick but have some weight to them music is solid and the gameplay is great consider buying this even if you don t care much for the type of game it is because it s that fun to play my only complaint is that i run into some fairly regular visual flickering which seems to be a problem a number of others have as well it s kind of annoying but not a dealbreaker by any means
