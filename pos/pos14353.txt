2021 early access review dyson space program is a factorio like game with a unique sci fi theme and related mechanics that i appriciated greatly pros basic mechanics similar to factorio building on spherical planets give the factory a cool new twist travelling to new planets and galaxies taming the sun is as grandiose as it can be and its even cooler when you see it being built gradually in front of you convinient blueprints to prevent grindcons the game does a poor job of keeping the player engaged dyson sphere is cool but you really need shorter term goals for the player to try to get to bad communication the game does actually have some cool things to offer as short term goals but the communication is done terribly in some cases i have only realized i got something useful after already investing the time in researching it for example i expected to boost my engine to travel between planets and unlocked ftl no hostiles nobody expect automation game to become an fps but this is useful tool to provide variey to the gameplay lack of options the factory logic is very straight forward and i rarely felt like there are multipile solutions to my problem questionable balancing mostly regarding power consumption i usually felt like many of the methods i could have used are useless most of the problems can be solved by the game official release and i am writing the review under the assumption that they will be addressed edit i want to expand a bit on the last point since it really bugs me with the after game your whole goal in the game is build a dyson sphere which is a real achievement but also feels completely underwhelming satisfactory for comparison was great at power management somehow your factory scaled great with the power consumption in my run i got coal just as my biofuel became unsustainable got fuel when coal was about the fail and when my first nuclear power plant started running i felt greater than during any stage a the dyson sphere construction power at dssp doesn t feel good first there isn t much to do with it if i had enough power to start building a dyson sphere why would i need more power the power builds up too gradually to be exciting when i build an outpost which is most of the late game solar panels not sails these are never useful seem to do just fine dyson sphere does let you gather anti matter but it s just one more material you need for research you can also use it to build anti matter rods but why would i need to do that on scale the game would benefit a lot from changing how it deals with power 1 dyson sphere production should not grow linearly it makes total engineering sense but zero gameplay sense it s boring and makes the ds useless 2 there needs to be real gameplay incentive to get dyson sphere power and completing it for example what if the miners would become x1 2 more efficient if you give them x50 more power what if you could convert energy to raw materials power up a stargate for easier traversal and transport or add a cannon to dyson sphere to prevent future alien invasions 3 i fully get the rationale behind solar sails it s a great idea to let the player have a taste of the dyson sphere before the end game in fact i wish it was broken down to more parts but the current scheme doesn t work mainly because the early taste only lets the player know that the dyson sphere is useless just like the sails
