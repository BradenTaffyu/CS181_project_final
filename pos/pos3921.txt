2021 i ve seen this game described as a cross between x com and persona and i think that if anything understates the reach the actual gameplay is basically x com with anime characters or comic book superheroes which is pretty f ing great in and of itself if all the game was was that with a relatively small progression mechanic that would be enough to give it a thumbs up from me which man imagine a version of this with avengers or x men but there s sooo much more than that from customizing each of your characters with their own skills which you learn from defeating bad guys giving you one more reason to go back and replay grind missions to customizeable and craftable equipment not 100 my thing but there s so much of it out there that you can also do a lot here and even persona style synergies you can develop between your teammates when they go on missions enough your characters tend to have a particular direction albus is going to be your tank ann macy is your support healer but there s so much ground to change around the characters play that in the long run at least you re never really locked into any one particular role for a character my big initial complaint in fact was that with these games i ll often start out play through say 10 15 hours then when i m at a point where i understand the mechanics well enough i go back and restart this game at least for me needed that because again there s so so much to do although i ll add that the game doesn t punish you for making bad choices while you re learning it when i did that here the first time the game became waaaay too easy on the replay hard mode helped out a ton i ll go ahead and say that this is the best way to play as it really begins to feel like you re in command of a small team of superheroes beating back a city full of criminals and the latest challenge mode has caused me to actually lose and restart missions i m not going to call myself the king of these kinds of games or anything but i ve not yet reached a point to where stuff s too easy at all the story is well your general animoo story if that s not your thing i understand although even then imo the gameplay more than makes up for any eye rolling you might find yourself doing in high plot moments i d kind of love to see a game like this featuring actual adults which again avengers x men but honestly that s a pretty minor quibble
