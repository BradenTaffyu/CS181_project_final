2020 i am fast becoming addicted to this game i have a midrange pc and yet it runs smoothly with great visuals i am very impatient but do not mind the long stretches of time between action also have really gotten into the storyline of the yukon map each map has it s own story and all are ok but that is my favorite so far will recommend that you go ahead and buy the atv and weapons pack dlc they are helping me as a noob gain experience points cash and locations
