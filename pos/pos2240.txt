2021 introfallout 76 in its current state as of 2 12 21 is a fun enjoying hell at sometimes immersive that any fan of fo 4 or even nv and 3 should at some point get their hands on and give it a try if you are going to look up reviews of this game please make sure they are of the updated version of the game and not a review like internet historian s video which to be honest is a great video check him out if you haven t from when the game came out at launch the good qualities of 761 the map the map of fallout 76 is by far my favorite map of any fallout game to date i never was a big fan of the map or color pallets of any previous fallout games seeing as they take place quite a time after the bombs dropped but seeing west virginia only 20 or so years after the initial fallout led to a great choice in map design layout coloring scenery and building structures tod howard was not kidding when he talked about the map being 4 times the size of fallout 4 it truly feels like it 2 the environment the way that fo76 tackles the in game world of apalachia is in my humble opinion better than 4 and on par with nv you could walk from one side of the map to the other and never feel like its empty or lifeless there is always something cool to see or look at places you could explore that you didn t know existed until your second or third play through of the game there is so much to do explore look at while it is not 16 times the detail it defiantly had care in its construction to make you never feel alone in the wasteland of appalachia 3 the soundtrack the fallout franchise has never really been known for a good or outstanding soundtrack mainly because it relies on radio stations to convey the sounds and feelings of the fallout universe with that being said if you just want to not listen to apalachia radio or the classical station the games soundtrack does deserve praise as it is a very warming soundtrack with the most subtle undertones of somberness and loneliness and is a completely viable option if you don t wish to listen to the radio 4 v a t s i am going to keep this short and sweet i prefer the v a t s system in 76 a lot more than in 3 nv and 4 i never was a fan of the completely stopping time to use v a t s like in 3 and nv it was improved with the mechanic of slowing down time to use v a t s but still felt like it was taking me out of the game a little bit because i don t know if it got fixed or not there is a mechanic that is in 4 that gives you major damage resistance when in v a t s if v a t s is going to be just aim assist or aimbot i prefer it the 76 way of it being like activation soldier 76 s visor from overwatch it makes the game play feel more fluid and dynamic when you don t stop time or slow it down the downsides of fallout 761 the graphics the big joke of fallout 76 is were going to have 16 times the detail and while the game doesn t look bad the graphics of 76 are a let down and it is not made better by the fact that it is an online game so no mod support to make the game look like it was supposed to to make it look 16 times better than 4 i expected watered down graphics for an mmo game the scale of 76 but no putting it lightly they did not deliver 2 system requirements optimization the game recommends a gtx 970 and a ryzen 5 1500x i am running a ryzen 7 3700x with a gtx 1080 game is on a ssd and have plenty of ram i still will drop below 60 fps in places like the cranberry bog even on lower settings the game is not well optimized for this big of a map and scale of the game i truly do hope that they work on optimization 3 bugs the devs of this game have done their damnedest to try to patch and fix as many bugs or glitches as they can but even now almost a year after the game was released on steam the game still has issues texture glitches colliding textures textures not rendering really bad ghoul ai at whitesprings crashes server crashes hackers legacy weapons being absolutely busted power armor not rendering making you look like a mutant special ed death claw etc etc however as i said before devs have been working hard to try their best to fix all the bugs and they are seemingly fewer and fewer bugs with every update and is in the right direction 4 combat pvp the pve combat is not bad at all not in the slightest the two big problems with pve combat is first and foremost level scaling they added an update a few months back that added the level scaling mechanic and it has made a good few builds that were considered the meta almost useless i e bloodied builds or mutant builds while it seems not a bad thing because imagine being level 200 going back to places that are meant for lower levels sounds good on paper but in truth it hurt the game more than it helped the second issue is not as major but more disappointing is that the pve combat is just the same as every other fallout game nothing new asides from the new v a t s mechanic which as i said i liked but combat can seem tedious at times because you have gone through the combat over fallout 3 nv and 4 pvp combat is a complete joke legacy energy weapons are a unbalanced overpowered hot mess say that one of your settlements are being taken over by a rival player you gear up and get ready to fight well too damn bad they have a laser pistol with the legendary effect of exploding rounds now boom you are dead your settlement is taken over and all your gear that you dropped is now gone it isn t even a couple of players that have these its a major majority of pvp players who just go around with these busted legacy weapons sometimes not all the times initiating pvp situations that the opponent has no chance of winning the neutral opinions1 atoms the review of fallout 76 that angry joe did showed the system of atoms in the game as their in game currency that you buy with real money and spend on cosmetic items on paper it seems like just another micro transaction in a game but the thing that joe did not point out is that you can just earn atoms in game by doing achievements and just playing the game you do not have to buy atoms just play the game look at achievements and you can make literal thousands of atoms that way without spending a dime 2 the story the overall story of fallout 76 is not a bad story but on the other hand it is not a good story either the game s biggest story strengths comes in the side quests like in fallout 4 they really shine and you feel immersed while playing all of these ongoing quests and story lines as i said main quest 7 10 not bad not great but a fun adventure that you can have tens maybe even hundreds of hours just roaming the world and doing all these side quests and side stories the ugly side of fallout 76the biggest issue that i have with fallout 76 is how bethesda handled the game like i said go check out internet historians the fall of 76 video he goes into much greater detail on all the controversies surrounding bethesda and fallout 76 however it can not be understated that bethesda for many fans non fans and gamers alike have felt cheated betrayed and majorly disappointed with this game at launch bethesda has been found out as a very scummy company with horrible practices with eso fo76 doom eternal they have screwed their fans over multiple times now and fallout 76 seems to have been the beginning of the end for bethesda unless they pick themselves up and get back on track it is majorly disappointing with the direction bethesda went with the release of fallout76 in conclusioni love fallout 76 in the game s current state it is an enjoyable fun experience that can be enjoyed by any fan of the fallout series there is something for everyone in this game there are still issues but this game is not the catastrophy it was at launch thanks
