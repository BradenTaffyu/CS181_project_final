2014 early access review project zomboid field rating review graphics 7 5 zomboid chose an art style and stuck with it and it worked out great animations are fitting and satisfying though there are still several glitches i have no doubt they will be worked out and fixed gameplay 8 5 a uniquely fun twist on the giant list of zombie games project zomboid actually brings back the feeling of surviving the zombie outbreak not just simply gunning your way through it has a classic rpg skill picker with several crafting elements brutally merciless zomboid doesn t want you to live to see the next morning with a unique take on your characters field of view and los zomboid challenges you to stay alert and aware of everything going on around you there are still several kinks they need to work out for combat and some actions and it take a long long time to level up your skills but the updates steadily roll in and it gets better with each update story n a not much of a story currently in the game though there is one in the works multiplayer 10 an absolute blast with your friends gather as many as you want host your own server or join an online one and figure out how to survive together or watch as your ragtag group crumbles into some twisted walking dead equivalant society work together to build a fort and prepare to live as long as you can set out on expeditions into town to gather supplies and watch in horror as your friend is mauled to death and there s nothing you can do but run replayability 10 you can keep coming back to zomboid for more and more currently the end game is a bit easy but they are still pushing out plenty of updates for the game and are working on making it even more difficult an absolute blast to play over and over with your friends overall 9 10 the most refreshing take on zombies you will have yet so many zombie games anymore are simply shooters and the survival element is lost however in zomboid every movement and every moment count didn t check that dark corner before you rummaged through the house that zombie just jumped you and bit you and now you might turn do you tell your group or press on and hope it blows over made the mistake of running to fast the zombies have heard you and the horde is coming it s not a matter of if you ll die simply a matter of when how quickly that happens is entirely up to you a must buy for zombie survival fanatics if you liked this review feel free to check out my curator page the tipsteryou are also welcome to join our group and play discuss games together here the tipster
