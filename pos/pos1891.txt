word of warcraft which i will further explain in this guide rotationsenemies follow specific patterns that constantly repeat themselves thus making combat boring moreover the recycling process is very time consuming as a result if you have not hit the enemy fast before another player then who knows how long you have to be waiting for him to respawn scalingdue to stats buffs etc there are specific classes inferior to others nowadays for example competitive players tend to abuse the operative class since it has a lot of damage build potential as a result to climb the leaderboard you need to dedicate your focus on 1 playstyle which removes in a certain way the freedom of choice ui systemlast but not least the ui is garbage so do change it if you want to bring havoc in pvp i encourage you

armors and other factors although it does have some shortcomings in some areas overall it is still enjoyable game modess w t o r offers tons of solo content but it is considered supreme due to its group play there are flashpoints raids conquests pve as well as warzones pvp that can be completed either alone or with a group of friends the game is very grind demanding especially during the late phase i recommend you join a guild this way not only do you get special benefits such as exp boosts etc but you also meet new people everything is more fun with friends after all create your champion community created artwork for steam artwork by majordomo the lack of restrictions is a unique perk that s w t o r provides any way you choose can be used to develop your character for example depending on your choices you can either create a lawful good a neutral good scalingthis topic is very complicated and can get a bit overwhelming in the beginning your character can upgrade his stats only by equipment there are also the stimpacks that provide temporary buffs or healing effects looking for equipment is meaningless in the beginning it will play a major role only during the endgame phase as you are getting introduced to the set bonuses till you get there wear whatever has the better stats lootset bonus pieces to drop from level 75 content and gearboxes earned through many different ways including flashpoints operations pvp level 75 dailies weeklies heroics story chapters crafting and conquest each set is most commonly dropped through a certain type of content for example some sets are exclusively found through crafting or from the new dxun operation i won t get into further detail here since matters get confusing visit the link swtorista com and read the guides at your own pace visuals the scenes are very beautiful from the snowy mountains of hoth to the sandy peeks of tatooine there is so much attention to detail that can be noticed on each planet just look at the temples in korriban and tell me if this does not give you the chills the graphics are decent but they need to be polished the style is pleasing and the character models are not that bad thanks to the game being almost 10 years old the system requirements are very undemanding however to be sure check for yourself here audio the music is the soul and core of the game each soundtrack fits perfectly with the scenery giving you the much needed star wars vibe my heart is pumping every time the duel of the fates by the beloved john williams plays in the background as i slaughter my enemies without music star wars lacks meaning and the same applies to this game side notes i encourage you to subscribe at least 1 month to the game cancel it 1 or 2 days before the deadline if you choose to as its benefits are very deserving compared to f2p players those who subscribed at least once can enjoy all the new story contents such as k o t f e and other dlcs as well as many other privileges 1 000 000 credits cap etc forever check upon those benefits on the game s website or read swtorisa s guide swtorista com concerning this matter verdict s w t o r was and continues to be among my favourite games even though the gameplay is not at its peak performance it can be overwhelmed by its amazingly well written story it s a game for all kinds of players both competitive and story junkies i have so many memories from s w t o r alone that it s a shame not to be shared by others
