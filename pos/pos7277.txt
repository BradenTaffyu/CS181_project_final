2020 this game may or may not have taken over my life i have never really gotten into any of the driving sims but this one is addictive you start off with nothing driving a truck for other companies as a scrub then you level up getting better jobs and eventually buy your own truck after that you can upgrade your base buy more trucks employ drivers who also level up to drive those trucks and make more money finally you buy more bases more trucks more drivers to take over the shipping world i have 28 hours in right now and currently have one base with two other drivers progression is rewarding and moves at a nice pace the other drivers make me some money but are not overpowered you can buy several different trailers including extras for your team to open up more jobs overall the game seems well balanced the driving part of the game feels correct to someone with little experience driving bigrigs if you go too fast around a curve you can roll your truck there are sliders for stability and many other settings that you can use to adjust difficulty but i have not played around with them much i bought the package that is on sale and quickly bought the other states as they are cheap right now the game could be played without the dlc but it is satisfying driving 1 600 mile routes the game is paced at 1 20 scale i believe so even the longer distances move at a good pace you can accept long or short missions and the game gives you the expected time of the delivery so you can judge how long it will take in real world time to complete 20 hours in game 1 hour in real life if you need to do something in real life you can save your game at any time and resume the mission later overall this is one of the best games i have played in awhile in a world full of games that want you to spend 23 hours a day with microtransactions this game is a refresher to the days of old yes it has dlc and yes some of it is fluff paint jobs but even with the base game or one of the cheaper bundles ats can be an enjoyable experience that you can sink hours into without feeling like it is a job
