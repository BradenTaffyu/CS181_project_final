2020 this game is just amazing hands down you should stop reading this and buy it right now if you haven t i d write a huge long review but i think others have covered all the pros and the very very few cons well this game is a steal for the price you re looking at dozens if not hundreds of hours of content to explore the replayability factor is extremely high with all the build diversity as well as all of the origin characters quests and stories to explore i m not usually the type to be into slower paced strategy games i m more of an fps run n gun type game player but the mechanics and strategy imployed in dos2 got me hooked from the start after over 200 hours of playing the base game i started experimenting with different mods being a steam game downloading and installing mods is as simple as pressing 1 button and selecting it from a menu in game there are some really great mod authors in the dos2 community who have basically come up with new and exciting ways to add additional content in the game as well as some massive mods that completely rework this game so it feels like an entirely different game mechanically yet it still has that dos2 charming and witty writing and superb voice acting on that note the voice acting is just amazing and really pulls you into the stories of the characters and makes them feel more like real people with distinct personalities rather than a scripted npc the graphics are also great it runs smooth as can be the actual fights and tactical strategy is the best part for me though i ve never played a turn based game before but i loved having to strategize and prepare for each fight i ve only really played on tactician though after classic seemed too easy by the time i finished act1 so lower difficulties you might be able to run in and do whatever unprepared but tactician definitely requires planning and strategy i also enjoyed how your decisions had consequences to the actual story a lot of games feel like even if there are different options in dialogue they all sort of lead to the same place the way you choose to interact with npcs in the game as well as your own party can greatly affect the way your run will unfold overall it s an amazing game one of my favourites of all time 10 10 for me if you don t buy this then you re missing out big time
