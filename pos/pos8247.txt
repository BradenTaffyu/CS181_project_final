2023 well i like the yugioh games since i was kid i played almost every one in the franchise the thing that bother me about this one is the new summoning mechanics i know most of ppl gonna disagree but atealst there is a few of them out there agree the game has died when i summon a monster in attack position and i end my turn they really should make a mode for classic yougioh player im not saying xyz synchro link or even pendelum ruined the game but they are overpowered and the game has 0 balance when it comes to this btw dont start your saying im noob or my deck is weak but the turth playing with all of this in same mode is killing the joy
