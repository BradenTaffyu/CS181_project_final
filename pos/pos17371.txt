2020 i ll cut it short so i won t waste your time cons feels very repetitive some dlc definitely should be free early game is extremely tedious and boring compared to other total war games lack of troop varieties made the game more boring will probably spends more time delegating battles since it really do get repetitive and tedious pros good representation of ancient chinese history my wish since 11 years of age very fun when chasing for emperor ship in base game items for generals wet dream for 3 kingdoms and dynasty warriors fans
