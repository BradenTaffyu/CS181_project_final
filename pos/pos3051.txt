2019 tldr divinity original sin ii dos2 is in my opinion quite possibly the best rpg of the last decade i would highly recommend the game genre turn based isometric rpg w choice impacting storylinesgameplay you play as a party of between 1 4 hero characters or create one of your own but would not recommend doing so on a first playthrough and engage in turn based combat speed based not strictly alternating between you enemy your dialogue choices dramatically change the game and can potentially cut off content that will be unseeable for the rest of a playthrough thus encouraging multiple playthroughs to see everything being offered the game s limit is your imagination if you can think it you can probably do through the game s mechanics teleport the enemy to a hazardous location pickpocket an npc s gear while another party member is talking to them place oil barrels around an enemy before a battle and light them up prior to an encounter etc in general there is no one singular way to solve a quest it is up to you how you want to do things graphics beautiful art graphics wonderfully textured definitive edition upgraded visuals from original the water in particular looks amazing i experienced no significant framerate drops that would negatively impact my experience story the world of rivellon is falling apart due to invasions from creatures called the voidwoken the gods have left and have fallen victim to the voidwoken as well you embark on an epic journey as godwoken or individuals with the potential to ascend from mortality to become gods in order to save the world from the voidwoken attacks on the world will your companions allow you to ascend or will they decide that they want it for themselves your choices in the story will decide everyone s fates strengths 99 9 of the game is voice acted and voice acted incredibly well shoutout to sir lora the squirrel s va there are branching stories multiple paths available for nearly everything e g pacifist vs kill everything allows for creativity in gameplay you re only limited by your imagination for how to tackle a situation each hero character has a different origin story and thus has different interactions with both the rest of the hero characters and other npc s in the game having certain party members is advantageous in specific situations for specific desired outcomes co op available custom tabletop game mode akin to d d available highly replayable to view content that you miss based on decision you make that drastically change story great workshop mods available allowing for even more replayability difficulties are great to test your skills e g tactician honour mode 1 save hardest difficulty 1 life weaknesses if i had to name one weakness there are some very minimal situations where you can wipe your party accidentally and that may ruin an entire playthrough if you happen to be on tactician honour mode numeric score if you care 10 10incredible game easy recommend for rpg fans checkbox reviews are lazy copy paste bullsh t ascii art reviews tell you nothing let s be honest i only wrote this review for awards is a waste of everyone s time if you are interested in genuine detailed game reviews feel free to check out my others here or don t i don t tell you what to do
