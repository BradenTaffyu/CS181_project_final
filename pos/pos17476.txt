2017 i consider myself to be a total war veteran since i virtualy started playing total war games since i was a child my first was medieval total war as the years passed and the total war franchise expanded change was inevitable and the franchise itself evolved total war warhammer is the 10th game of the total war series it is the first total war game that completely gets rid of the historical theme of previous total war tittles and i like it although i did previously disagree with the whole change of theme i have got used to it and learned to enjoy it as i said change is inevitable you can t expect the total war series to be the same for ever and this is a prime example of ca and sega trying new things i am aware that the main issue with this game is the fact that it is plagued by dlcs and in order to unlock the full experience you must at least spend another 50 euro however this strategy has been implemented by sega since correct me if im wrong total war shogun 2 but i didn t see nearly not as many negative reviews as warhammer the game itself is fun the factions have their own flavour and their won unique playstyle siege battles are mediocre in order to actually fight a siege battle you must assault a major settlement yes i am aware that mods can fix that but i am reviewing this game as it is right now the time that it takes to complete a battle can vary but it is surely more slow paced than total war rome 2 the legendary lords heroes giants flying units and unique units are all a new addition to the series and i have to say that i am quite impressed all in all total war warhammer is a fine game which is worth picking up it may have some techincal flaws but lets face it any game which is released by ca will always have some sort of technical flaws it is a fun game and it is a very solid foundation for the development of future total war games due to the fact that it broke the franchises record for sales please dont judge the game based on its dlc policy it isn t that much of a big deal and it is certainly not the first time that something like this has occured i can assure you that it most deffinetly wont be the last i hope this review was helpful and please don t hesitate to correct me or disagree with me or post your opinion about this game in the comments
