2015 i ve never played any of the fallout games before this so take that into consideration when reading this review at first there was a lot to take in i mean this game can be very complex to the new fallout player however as you progress further into the game you can t help but become engrossed in the story the environment and dare i say it the super mutants and their intelligence there were moments where i was on a looting mission trying to get as much aluminum as possible and i just stopped there for a moment and though to myself damn this is pretty immersive i felt as if i was a wastelander trying to survive if this is your first fallout game there may be moments in the beginning where you almost regret purchasing the game but if you stick with it you will end up loving the experience i can totally see why fallout fans are so hardcore and loyal now bethesda you added one more
