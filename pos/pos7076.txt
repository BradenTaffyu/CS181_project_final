2016 all of my reviews are based around my personnal opinion they re not swayed by a majority of people liking or disliking it better than euro truck simulator worse than euro truck simulator 2 tl dr american truck simulator is more of a re skin of ets2 but with added detail people who ve played ets2 will pretty much recognise what they re doing and where to find things due to the game being made using the same engine if you re new to the truck simulator franchise however you ll find that this game is actually quite fun the environments are beautiful the cities are very big and there s a huge variety of roads such as ones that are long and narrow and ones that are more difficult to navigate if you ve played ets2 i d say wait till this game is on sale if you re a newcomer well worth your money note all of my reviews are laid out in a particular format that fits the game about american truck simulator ats is a spin off to the popular game euro truck simulator 2 ets2 just like the title says you ll be driving around two of america s states california and nevada in a truck since ats was made using the same engine as ets2 there are a lot of similarities most notabley the ui just like it s previous games in ats you start a company in which you make deliveries for other people to earn money the more money you get the more you can upgrade your warehouse and get drivers to work for you that s basically it gameplay again gameplay for this game is a lot like ets2 if you ve played ets2 then this game shouldn t be difficult for you at all if you haven t played ets2 it s not hard to get into basics there are differnet modes for controls some which are more difficult than others just like ets2 there are radio stations where you can listen to music you can customize your truck by adding different paint jobs there are different camera views to view your truck from different angles and have the basis of any other vehicle such as headlights indicators windscreen wipers and a horn but as i mentioned before there is added detail to ats one thing for example is police cars police cars pretty much act as moving speed cameras if you break the speed limit and or do something that s illegal they ll fine you plus turn on their sirens and just sit there watching you cities and towns are much bigger than the ones in ets2 there is now an actual good reason to travel through cities and admire the views the map in this game is pretty disappointing i ve already discovered at least 80 of it yes i know they re adding a free dlc soon that adds arizona but right now the map is small design graphics i would say there is a slight better quality when it comes to graphics design that ets2 ats isn t a hard game to run when it comes to graphics just like it s predecessor there are plenty of graphics options i can easily run ultra graphics so i m assuming it isn t that hard one of the main things the developers were working on this game was design the game has much more detail than ets2 there is much more of a variety of different roads cities and towns are much larger and are more detailed and there are some really beautiful views sometimes at night times you can see shooting stars and in day time you can easily see planes and jets flying around also i swear i saw a ufo in nevada ui user interface like i said before the ui of this game is pretty much identical to ets2 s pretty much nothing has changed which in most ways is a good thing if you ve played ets2 then you won t have any trouble on getting to understand where everything is as for newcomers just like in the previous games there are tutorials that tell you where everything is so i doubt there will be a time where you struggle pros beautiful environment so much detail very relaxing it s pretty much what you want in a truck game much bigger towns and cities cons such a small map very similar to ets2 some background terrain looks very bland final recommendation more of a reskin than a unique game people who ve played ets2 before would probably find this a bit disappointing but from my experience i ve enjoyed playing this there is much more added detail and many beautiful places to explore even if it s a small map just like it s predecessor it s a relaxing experience thats what s important to me it isn t perfect and it s definitely not better than ets2 but it is worth your money final verdict 7 5 10 youtube video american truck simulator gamescom 2015 trailer views 1 154 906 experience the most legendary american trucks and deliver various cargoes across the united states american truck simulator takes you on a journey through the breathtaking landscapes and widely if you liked this review be sure to give it a like i m still learning also be sure to follow my curator page here for reading
