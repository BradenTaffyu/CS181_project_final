2016 early access review i have always loved this game and its contunual updates i love to see that this has finally made it to steam if you are on the fence about it watch some game reviews this game starts off very basic it may look simple but it is extremely complex that being said it is on a learning curve that you will pick up swiftly the different biomes provide different challenges so this game is never static it has a little bit of everything that you need in a basebuilding game farming combat management the goal is to survive on a planet build your spaceship again and gtfo can you survive
