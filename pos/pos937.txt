2016 i grew up with the original harvest moon for snes pretty much played every single one after to this day i would go back and play the gba version for a few hours every year if only to remember good times i have to say that i really did not know about this game until today when it was released i saw a lot of chatter about how it was like harvest moon and that if you enjoyed that than this would be up your ally within the first 10 minutes i seriously wanted to cry from nostalgia this game is everything i could ever want the developer did an amazing job any fan of old school nes games will love this game the art the music the sound effects the dialogue i mean this is a masterpiece i m a few hours in and i don t want to stop i want to quit my job regress 20 years and be a kid again the thing is the story is not a kid s story it deals with adult stuff like the loss of community the sisyphean struggle that is our society and more i don t want to spoil anything so i ll leave it at that my friend told me the story about how harvest moon inspired him to start his own garden when he was a kid that lasted like 6 hours of work and he abandoned it with stardew i m afraid i might spend a few years trying to start a farm it has quite the impact the rpg elements of harvest moon have been expanded there is combat crafting homebuilding relationships it s got it all for 15 i feel like i am robbing this guy it could be 40 and i d tell you that you were crazy for sleeping on it if you are on the fence just pull the trigger because honestly a game like this is once in a few years
