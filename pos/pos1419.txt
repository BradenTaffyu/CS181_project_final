2020 early access review i don t know why i never decided to buy this game yeah sure the graphics aren t witcher 3 status and the game sure isn t a fps however what it lacks in visuals it highly makes up for with the raw game play this title you will easily find yourself sinking hours and hours into without even noticing with an undoubtedly un matched crafting system and general building system base building alone can take you months to fulfill or a couple of days want a fortress it s gonna take some time want a cozy little cottage by the river and live off the land it s more easily obtainable and don t get me started into the car mechanics they really out did themselves there you will need to monitor the status of your vehicle or vehicles if you want to survive properly with essentially every mechanic operating function on the car it can be a bit mind boggling at how you re going to go at maintaining a vehicle especially when parts and tools are pretty rare however once obtaining a vehicle it can be much nicer cruising the roads rather than walking as pz s map is astonishingly huge and seemingly endless though it does have a border keep in mind if you do decide to fix up a vehicle or hotwire one etc the dead can easily hear you driving down the road so think twice about trying to bust into a car especially if it still has an alarm system looting in pz has it s own atmosphere and feeling to it once you learn the map layout a bit better or even loot a map of the surrounding area you can begin land marking your way around towns and scavenging a bit better all areas have different types of loot and with higher tiered loot comes higher risk keep that in mind before you try going into a military installment with little first aid equipment or even low protection you may be wondering why there are so many clothing types within the game pz utilizes a unique and down right complex infection system if you are to take a nasty fall and you end up cutting yourself your wound can become infected if you do not seek proper medical supplies or monitor your bandaging a simple dirty bandage can be all that stands between you and a slowly agonizing death going off of infection pz also has a transmission system transmission of what you ask if you are bitten by a zombie you can basically just accept the fact that you are going to die it may be a week it may be two weeks but once you are bitten you will most certainly not survive this is why clothing coverage and type are an absolute must and even with good coverage you can still suffer a bite along with bites scratches are second to fatal but they are not a guaranteed death sentence you can survive scratches but if a bite is inflicted you might as well find out what the bleach in the next house over tastes like cause your story is finished project zomboid is also very good about atmospheric changes how do i mean this the longer you end up surviving the more the world around you will change your first couple days or even your first month can be easier depending on when the water and electricity become non existent yes the power gets turned off and yes the showers and sinks will no longer be usable once the water is shut off you will however be able to use a sink or tub etc atleast one more time before completely using their resources which can be useful especially if you re low on water or need to give your face a good scrub also water is always available via rain collection or even streams just make sure to boil it as for electricity you can find generators within pz s world and can use them to your advantage by providing power for your base be warned though generators make noise they also consume fuel and need repairs after a good while of run time going off the atmospheric changes pz features an overgrowth system that once you make it past a certain amount of days i believe base game settings is 100 days the grass and such will overgrow it is part of an erosion system this also helps fires spread so go easy on the molotovs with you continuing your seemingly endless endeavor if you are one of the few who makes it long enough you will also be accompanied by the weather cycle changing months seasons yes it snows in this game and yes the temperatures can get into the single digits i wish you all luck on your journey s within the perilous world of pz and if you re new here the community welcomes you tldr 10 10 the goat zombie survival game out there game is even worth the full price i highly highly recommend this title to anyone looking for a damn good zombie game make sure to run on the newest patch iwbums iwillbackupmysave you will not be disappointed
