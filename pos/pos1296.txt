2022 early access review if you don t like simulation games you won t like this game so reviews from people who don t like simulation games are beyond worthless one of the first things the game tells you is that you will die it is not lying you will die you are a stupid panicky animal trying to survive a threat you do not understand you can t open a can without a can opener you can t fire a gun without individually loading each shot into the magazine and then loading the magazine into the gun and finally racking it before unloading a pistol into a group of zombies and missing every shot these are not criticisms 99 of people reading this review will have never shot a pistol in real life and have no understanding of how bad they are at aiming a gun with zero training or guidance this game probably isn t for you but if it is join us in the apocalypse we have enough mods and servers for everybody if you re willing to learn how to play a game without crying about how unfair it is then zomboid will let you have as much fun as you want for as long as you want
