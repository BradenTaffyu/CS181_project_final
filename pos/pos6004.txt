2020 here s what happens if you are transferring from origin to steam you need to buy and reinstall the base game again on steam but not the dlcs seasons spa bowling etc all save files and household will still appear as they were in your game when you go to play it steam will launch origin where you will find a new game in your library called the sims 4 but this one has the steam logo on it because your dlc was purchased on your origin account it will show as already purchased for this new game as well but you will need to reinstall it on the new game which takes forever saying all that is it worth it personally the reason i got it was because for the life of me i could not figure out how to switch languages and as i love the sims i wanted to use it in another language i m trying to learn steam was able to let me do that finally and extremely easily so far i m really enjoying it and learning a lot also i like the steam interface and the befits of being able to connect with friends on steam while gaming and i m expecting easy mod downloads with workshop plus for future dlc the sales definitely come to mind i got the base game while it was on sale and i think for me personally it was worth it but just so you know this is what transfer will be like might not be worth it for everyone but anyways sim on everyone xd
