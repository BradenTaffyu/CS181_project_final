2015 truly an amazing game i d go as far to say as this is a must have for all gamers yes there are a few flaws but you quickly ignore them as the game itself continues to get better and more enjoyable as the hours go by days later and you are sucked into the world wondering if there will ever be an end to things to do places to explore quests to do things to build stuff to find things to craft it s a relentless barage of content that is absolutely amazing for a video game it really does put other 60 games to shame i d even go as far as to say that in many ways fallout 4 is as good if not better than skyrim in some ways which is quite a statement considering that i feel like skyrim is probably the best rpg ever created now all that being said the biggest downside is that there are currently some technical hiccups that may ruin your experience if you have a low end pc or run into a glitch of sorts but nothing too big to be concerned about overall 10 10worth every penny and then some after 50 hours i feel like i should be paying betheseda more hahajust remember the game does get better the further you go so don t listen to people who are too quick to judge side note for a slightly better experience be sure to press and then type fov 90 90 in the console if playing on a widescreen monitor
