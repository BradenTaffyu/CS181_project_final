2021 been playing on a non steam account since 2011 this game has plenty of flaws and balance issues however once you learn to live with them there is nothing quite like it in terms of long term replay ability if you want to progress more quickly be prepared to throw some money towards a premium account and maybe a premium tank or two the game is far more playable free to play than it was years ago the grinds are accelerated with blueprints and crew books wargaming s monetisation is aimed at credit production instead of gold these days i m not sure if that s a good or bad thing recent changes to high explosive and artillery have been hugely beneficial for randoms it s still far from perfect but if you re looking for a casual arcade style tank shooter or even a more competitive one this will probably tick the boxes disclaimer learning curve is steep and it will take thousands of games to get comfortable with all the maps mechanics and different tanks in the game be prepared to suck for a while but there are plenty of content creators streamers youtubers who can help to learn the stuff that wargaming doesn t teach
