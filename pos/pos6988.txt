2023 great relaxing and fun game really nice simple graphics a bit cartoonish but in a good way sound effects and music are really nice the sound of the ocean the waves and the music are very relaxing the gameplay is very challenging at the start like every game of this genre you are fighting hunger thirst and above all the f ing shark that if you re not careful will eat your raft and you once you secure food and drinkable water production and protect yourself and the raft against the shark you can begin to explore the different story islands and unlocking blueprints to progress from this point on it gets easier the story is not that good or interesting just an excuse to visit the different story islands and get the blueprints but it s ok not the point of the game the enemies are varied some are more challenging to fight than others particularly the shark and stone bird if you don t like the challenge there is a peaceful mode that allows you to explore without worrying about enemies there is also a creative mode that allows you to build without having to gather materials or worry about surviving just build the raft of your dreams in short great and relaxing game great addition to the survival crafting game collection 100 recommended
