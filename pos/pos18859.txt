2022 it s amazing how bethesda still hasn t been able to top this game it is by far the best fallout game in the franchise fallout 3 was good and fallout 4 brought some interesting ideas to table but still they can t compete with this cowboy ass game everything about it is just chef s kiss incredible the characters settings dlc factions all of it is crafted and combined together so well it s hard to believe obsidian did all this is only 18 months i ve put hundreds of hours into this game without mods and that alone should tell you how replayable and fun this game truly is i d go into more detail but i d be here forever and i m sure someone else has got me covered there this is one of my all time favorite games
