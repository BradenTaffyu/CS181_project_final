i liked this game quite a bit my opinion of it evolved over my 66 hours of playtime at first it was interesting but then i felt like the combat was a bit clunky and not so fun but once i allowed myself to start to upgrade my character duh it unlocked the gameplay dramatically i wouldn t say it was an amazing unmissable game but the story was engaging and the voice acting was pretty good english and the gameplay became fairly enjoyable for me once i allowed myself to power up i did have to use a mod to adjust mouse movement controls naiom because it was apparently not a great console port although i ended up using a controller eventually for most of the hacking as it was just better for that part i also used the special k mod from the start which is apparently highly recommended i also updated the cutsecenes to 1440p nexus mods as the native ones are pretty rough looking compared to the gameplay graphics at 1440p at least for achievement hunters there are really no technically missable achievements as everything that is not story based can be bought with in game money after the 3rd route of the game though as i played through this game i realized it deserved better than that from me so i did it all the official way
