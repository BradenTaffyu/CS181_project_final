2019 i have hundreds of hours clocked in this game 400 to be precise and i find it endearing highly engaging and extremely satisfying being a busy human i find the short run turned based nature of the game to be a very convenient fit into my busy schedule the relic card build on the fly nature of the game keeps the experience fresh and flexible cannot recommend it enough
