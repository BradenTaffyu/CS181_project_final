2020 product received for free it s ok grinds are too long way too long i have war thunder since i don t know 2014 or so edit i just recently installed it via steam that s why i don t have much hours on record here check me ingame duk49th if you want to see my stats etc also i start it often without steam this may have an effect as well i actually have around 300 hours on record as per ingame stats edit 2 i am at rank 7 for one tank tech tree german tanks i have some other tech trees started but nowhere am i at 10 7 yet i often do not use premium time or use gold this is a huge factor other than that it is a bit better than world of tanks as you have more influence on the battles also it is in some way more realistic i play only realistic battles ground forces rb gf and sometimes air battles rb ab also sometimes i play simulator battles sb gf if you don t fear long grinds i can suggest it
