2022 pretty solid with all the expansions while not as good as civ 5 it does add some improvements i do like how buildings are broken up into district tiles and builders are consumable which makes you think more about how you are going to use them as opposed to putting them on auto pilot like in previous games the fact that you can t construct roads beyond making trade routes and the fact that they will often times choose sea routes over land when you want to build roads between cities is a pain in the future it would be nice to see if they can flesh out districts and potentially allow for districts to produce units buildings separately from your city center overall i recommend this game as long as you get the expansions and am interested in what they do in the next mainline civ game
