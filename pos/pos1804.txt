2017 what the hell do i write here i can say hell right it won t get filtered because this was a hell of a game nier automata is at heart a combo brawler and sometimes bullet hell shooter with a sometimes shifting perspective rpg advancement elements and a mid sized open world divided into a few core areas it s usually 3d but at times shifts to 2d either side scrolling or top down shooter brawler sometimes it s a twin stick shooter or a fixed shooter in short n a is generally what it wants or needs to be at any given time but always maintains the same essential controls so changes in gameplay are rarely jarring what s almost impossible to communicate in a review even if i were to spoil it is the polish and wit it contains and the way it often surprises and mixes up its elements in new ways to stay fresh at heart this is a lite platinum brawler for those already familiar mix up light and heavy attacks into combos dodge attacks with a relatively generous window but you also have a long range gun that can be used simultaneously activating everything on offer often requires a creative grip on the controller at times that i found engaging but could be annoyance for some playing on normal isn t particularly hard with multiple and liberal possible ways to regain health at no point does the game openly grade you this is clearly a platinum game intended for everybody upgrades are plentiful but limited by the amount you can equip at any given time there are a lot of ways to adjust the combat to your comfort level from difficulty settings to upgrades that might cover your weaknesses the story follows a number of androids sent to reclaim the earth from an alien robotic invasion but overcomes typical japanese storytelling tropes while some of its key points like the sometimes fetishistic clothing and prelidiction for white hair definitely marks its point of origin it s not a tale that focuses on style over substance it deals with philosophical and emotional subjects with a mature voice neither providing easy answers or avoiding hard questions it s hard to explain without spoiling it but this features one of the best moral dilemmas in gaming by the end at the same time it also manages to be funny and cute and just human in ways that games rarely are it s not to say there aren t flaws and cracks though most of the side quests are typical a to b fights sorts familiar to most people who have picked up a controller the fighting remains engaging and it s never that far to get from point to point but some do point you back and forth tiresomely others however ended up being a matter of just discovering i already had the crafting item to finish the quest and then just turning it in instantly there s one hot cold quest that s a black mark and sometimes quests can get locked out by the story mode however by the end you ll get the ability to replay much of the game and take the opportunity to explore anything you ve missed don t approach ending e the last of the five main endings without having finished everything you want to in the game however it s a point of no return another issue was performance n a isn t the best optimized game and put surprising tax on my system msaa you may as well turn down or off and even with mods to improve performance freezes were not uncommon in my playthrough sometimes to an infuriating extent hopefully future fixes will patch this issue but it s a testament to its engagement that i kept playing through a sometimes miserable issue though it occasionally ended a play session for me emotionally this is now in my top 5 games of all time with an emotional impact and quirkiness that i ve gotten from games like silent hill 2 or metal gear solid 3 it s hard to describe why but if you re down for the gameplay as described you should absolutely dig into this game don t even worry about waiting for a major sale i took a shot on this mostly blind and have no regrets it was more than worth it played through on normal difficulty and completed all five main endings along with a little more than half dozen of the side joke endings with most completion categories over 90 it even has me dusting off my 360 to try out the original nier i have to see where this all started a hell of a game
