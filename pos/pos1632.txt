2021 i thought i d clear up a few things for those who wonder what to expect from this game there are two worries that i often see brought up which i also shared this is a silly h s game with hot anime girls in skimpy lolita outfits well yes and then the game stabs you in the back and twists the knife a couple of times don t let the game fool you it s not so much the plot but the overall themes and some great character moments hidden behind 2b s outfit that are worth experiencing even the stupid pods have more character development than big budget aaa protagoonists you have to play the game 5 times to see the true ending this is simply false while the second playthrough overlaps a lot with the first it s kept fresh with new gameplay mechanics and quests the main quest is also way shorter and offers an interesting new perspective what happens after the second playthrough is more like a 20 expansion built into the game i highly recommend continuing after you ve seen ending a which is roughly 1 3 of the game and go all the way through to ending e expect a total playtime of 50 60 hours my main issue is the poor balancing mostly due to the leveling system when you are underleveled bosses turn into bullet sponges and later you will probably be overleveled which trivializes combat normal difficulty is too easy hard is too punishing at the beginning until you get decent plug in chips to boost defense then it gets too easy again thanks to the perfect dodge move which has no cooldown and can be spammed endlessly to dodge everything combat is fun and stylish anyway with lots of customization options n a has some really interesting twists that i haven t seen in games before the soundtrack is also great and it leaves a lasting impression out of 10
