2021 one thing i never realized until i finished the game is that you shouldn t rush it i got everything done 8 years in game found all the secrets got 100 completionist on the tracker found all the secret cutscenes collected every hats accessories rings and weapons that are available in the game and have completed all endgame content but when the credit starts rolling all i feel is emptiness and a void that i can no longer fill up this is a wonderful game that s just so inviting and calming to play whether it is by myself or with a friend and now it is all over if you have got the time to spare take my advice and enjoy the slow ride don t rush it and try to get everything with a guide early on because all there is at the end is the credits
