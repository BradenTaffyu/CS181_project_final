2019 with hundreds of hours in this amazing game i am able to say that this is literally one of the best easygoing and fun games that i have ever played easily in my top 10 games of all time whether you are trying to speedrun optimize what crops to plant on what day to get the most money catch every fish date everyone in town at the same time or just play for fun this game has it all you may think it is just a farming simulator but there is so much more than just that each character is perfectly designed and you actually start to feel for each one of the characters after you get to know them the early game does a great job at showing you what you need to do and where you should go without feeling like you are being walked through the game the mid game gives you a taste of how much power and progression you will have at the end of the game and lets you use all of the skills that you have honed through the early game to achieve your goals and the end game lets you look back and see how much you have completed on your farm tl dr this game is amazing 10 10 15 is a steal
