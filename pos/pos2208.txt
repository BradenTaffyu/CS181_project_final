2021 this game has completely blindsided my expectations and i m almost embarrassed to say i m having fun the game has clearly come a long way from the controversy that consumed it at launch it now has npc quest lines and a plethora of events to keep you occupied with more being added every major update if you liked fallout 4 then you ll like fallout 76 in its current state
