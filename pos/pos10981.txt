this review does compare cities skylines ii with cities skylinesgameplay experiencethe overall gameplay experience is quite average and good the controls are easy to use and the difficulty is well balanced the game does keep me interested and exited but it s not at the same level as the first game everything you do in this game does feel quite meaningful but the rewards for progress and milestones feels a bit less satisfying compared to the first game presentation immersionjust like the first game there is no story but again why not make one yourself still the game has a world that feel very immersive but not as much as the previous game even though the graphics looks better overall there are some parts of the details that is missing out if you ve played the first game you would expect more details to the game sounds and music is still very engaging and the hud is still as user friendly as the first game and even better design technical aspectsthe game s mechanics is moderately designed some parts of the game feel more like just a downgrade compared to the first one and speaking of content there is more less than the first one than you would expect i m not going to slaughter the developers here but it is a release with a limited to moderate content the ai does work well and are good still there are a few tweaks and adjustments that could make them perfect the settings are flexible but still there is room for better adjustment on the graphics settings to make the game run even better some of the settings feels like it doesn t do anything to performance only just reducing quality of the game i ve experienced bugs since the game was released some of the issues seems to be easy to fix and haven t been for months some other glitches make the game unplayable especially the money bug this could either increase the money gained or suddenly plunge the money to hundreds of millions in minus some of these issues could have been fixed by now final considerationsgenerally i feel satisfied with the game and it s fun to play with i haven t encountered any micro transactions or in game purchases the replay value of the game is high because you can play in various ways but the edits and customization throughout the game lacks more compared to what you could do in the first game i do not think that the game provides the sufficient value for its price the content per this day is more less of what you could expect for its price and development time i would recommend this game to others but maybe not for a full price summary cities skylines cities skylines ii gameplay experience 23 25 21 25 presentation immersion 19 25 21 25 design technical aspects 20 25 17 25 final considerations 24 25 20 25 total score 86 100 79 100 average 79 100performance or gameplay meets the passing mark but remains average there are areas that could be improved to enhance the gaming experience cautiously recommended
