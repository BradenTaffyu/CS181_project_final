2016 not for everyone the learning curve looks a bit like mount everest especially with the dlc dlc you need to access all the depth of the game art of war common sense wealth of nations and the cossacks add a few more nice but optional features and it can wait until you re tested the waters and seen if you like the game everything else you can ignore until you re hooked then it becomes like crack and you ll want everything give it a try if you re into strategy it s worth it
