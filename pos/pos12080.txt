2023 i was told i race slighly above the d class and i m trying my best to get out of it but sh ts hard when you manage to be in a race with idiots that block wreck you for no reasonin just 1 week i spent 60 on this game just so i have to buy next track for 16 so i can t race my 2 cars i bought anymoreit s fun to race but you can t reject the fact that this game is expensive if you want to move up you have to pay a lot every week for a new track edit 90 spent on iracing in one month this game is wild man
