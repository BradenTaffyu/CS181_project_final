2020 so a lot of people say this is the best total war game i mean it s good but not the best i m sorry but shogun ii and it s exp fall of the samurai are far superior obviously graphically this game is better and diplomacy in this game is drastically superior i can easily say diplomacy in this game is the best it s ever been in total war rare was the time where i felt the ai was acting unfairly in regards to diplomatic proposals one of the highlights of this game is the romance mode it s great to follow these epic heroes and watch them fight it out it would have been incredible if shogun ii had that at the same time these heroes are way too ludicrously powerful i managed to beat entire armies with just my one hero attacking them i know there is another mode to basically nerf heroes but still i would have preferred more of a middle ground it s also annoying because some heroes are clearly far superior to others any support heroes are just going to get steamrolled here i think my biggest complaint about this game is i just found the battles to be a slog far more so then in warhammer total war or shogun ii archers do very little damage and the range feels so close that infantry will just overrun them easily if you have skirmish mode turned on so you have to rely on infantry but you can t really use calvary to combat infantry because both kind of suck at fighting each other a good spear wall in this game isn t going to really do much against a calvary charge so instead the calvary and melee unit will just kind of slowly stab at each other doing little damage and it s just exhausting and boring they should have kept similar counters from shogun ii where if calvary charge into a spear wall your entire calvary is wiped out and have infantry other than spearmen do high damage to all other ground units including heroes meanwhile one hero unit just cuts into all these units like a knife through butter it s just ridiculous kind of in connection with the battle system the map i just find to be not very tactical the map is basically wide open everyone can attack you from every single direction there are no real choke points to hold on the map i mean i get it it s modeled off of china but i still feel they could have used mountains forests and rivers to create better choke points to make the tactical map more interesting defending from every direction is just exhausting you can t even ally with enough people to protect your borders as that s still too much area to defend i also really appreciated in warhammer their seemed to be far fewer cities than in other total war games and instead you were attack key resources areas maybe it s just my imagination but it feels like three kingdoms has far more cities than these key resource areas this especially became exhausting when i had to make the slow steady push to win the game just one siege after another of heavily defended cities ugh it just was not fun again though this game is gorgeous the map looks beautiful diplomacy is fantastic i love the hero upgrade system romance mode is incredible this is in my opinion the 2nd best total war game ever made right behind shogun ii fall of the samurai even if you skipped warhammer you should come back to total war for this game i felt it was far superior to warhammer worth any price
