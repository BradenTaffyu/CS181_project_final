2018 if you have read the other reviews you will see that there isn t great amounts of replay value i for one agree to an extent if you play the game the same way every time there s none you might get slightly different results etc etc however in all you ll probably find that a method that works best for you and you ll do it everytimecurrently i m going for 100 of achievements and am doing each play through diffrently for example i got all advanced structures and 15 automotrons in 1 run with 100 hope and 0 discontent i had over a months supply of coal and food as well as i was also going for the central heating achievement so no steam hubs i play the game differently every time and yes i ve won every time and i m a practicalist so whatever is best for the time is what i do i haven t put kids to work since my first run as i always have too many workers and would rather they were used to heal people or speed up research i would like to see an endless mode or a randomly generated mode where there are different encounters whilst scouting new locations and more as i always get all locations as well as other things such as an expanded law and tech tree for example if you take the order tree to have sky wardens which watch over the city instead of just guard towers and also something to kick me in the gut and go you not once have i felt bad for doing something i left a load of kids to die because they were just going to be a burden and i didn t really care at no point did something go you know what you need something to stop yourself like people leaving the city when you as i say leave kids to die the resource managment side i find is too easy the only run i felt like i struggled with was my first and i still got through so if a dev reads this as i have been enjoying this game and have wanted it since day one please consider an endless mode or more randomness for a game based on morality and survival being able to get things down to a science like knowing how many survivors you ll get on what day if you send scouts out at this time shouldn t happen you should be hoping and wondering if you ll see survivors at this next location and if not whether signing that child work law is a good idea
