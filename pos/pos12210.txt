2022 being a single parent to my daughter who is now 17 has been difficult for the past two years whether it s supporting my daughter s cello lessons or catching up with her usage of the xbox game pass i ve tried finding ways to connect with her through hobbies most natural for her age has been a tough journey for she is always out with friends now or watching disney in her room i let her customize my steam profile for me i asked for a goofy theme and got something else instead but as long as it makes her happy so am i and bought her garry s mod to see if i could perhaps play alongside her i recall all sorts of fun modes such as prop hunt back in my college days groups of friends and online folks playing in between study sessions the highlights of those memories those bits of enthusiasm now i can share them with my sarah for the first time in the past five years i was able to teach her a thing or two about a game come to think of it this is the happiest i have ever seen her while being player 2 for a change after spending countless hours playing this in the past now i can make it easier for sarah while she takes her steam deck whenever we go out camping at our local lake if her mother hadn t passed away due to c 19 i know she would be here with us proud to see our beloved daughter spend some time as an extroverted adolescent now sarah s all into crazy mods and physics videos thank you for bringing new geeky moments for me to share with my little girl
