2018 i will try to keep this review short and sweet generally speaking i am not a fan of turn based games i prefer real time rpg combat found in games like skryim fallout and witcher 3 the goat with that being said even with it not being my favorite combat method this game is incredible the story and choice making you can make is very similar to fallout new vegas where each dialogue matters and has an impact in terms of replayability you can choose across multiple origin characters who all have deep back stories and the ability for you to influence the future on a very large scheme if you like rpgs where you get to make choices this ranks up in the top 3 for me which are fallout new vegas witcher 3 and divinity original sin 2 if you ve taken the time to read this entire review take the plunge and invest the time in this game because it is insanely good
