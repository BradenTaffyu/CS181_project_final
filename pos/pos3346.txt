2016 best rpg since witcher 3 for me and one of the best coop games i have ever played very very addicting game with perhaps the best turn based combat of all time in a roleplaying game might not have the quality of writing witcher 3 has but the combat is a million times better some of the most strategic combat around its a thinking mans rpg divinity original sin 1 was good but divinity original sin 2 is one of the best rpg s of not only this year or of this generation but of all time the writing is a huge improvement the voice acting is brilliant and the strategic combat is even better than before the game is a blast solo or with a friend tons of customization and many ways to go about doing missions so many cool skills to play with it is amazing i have not been this addicted to a modern roleplaying game since fallout new vegas or the witcher 3 sure i loved divinity original sin 1 dragon age origins pillars of eternity etc but these are on another level for me personally every aspect shines in this game and my biggest complaints are improved this go around larian deserves a ton of respect and love for making such a great epic roleplaying game this game has a ton of replay value and will played for many more hours for me games of this quality don t come out that often go support larian and buy this wonderful game get ready for some wonderful adventures hands down goty for me in 2017 i enjoyed alot of games this year but nothing game close to the total package divinity original sin 2 offers if you enjoyed divinity original sin 1 pick this up asap if you didn t like original sin 1 there is still a good chance you will fall in love with the sequel as everything is improved well done larian well done over 170 hours later what a game not only one of the best rpgs of modern times but also ever just a real joy to play and you can tell the developers put a ton of effort into this game other rpg devs take notes the game has the best turnbased combat much improved writing wonderful world design tons of fun quests it is very challenging dark souls who and gorgeous art design while it is great when playing solo this game has some of the best coop with a friend or a few that i have ever witnessed not just in rpgs but any genre grab a friend and get ready for a really amazing ride this is a perfect example for how to turn a good game s sequel into a much improved in nearly every aspect masterpiece the definitve edition has come out and it is fantastic what a wonderful job larian does at giving us a free enhanced edition a year later last years goty just got better somehow i can t wait to see what larian does next they have been on fire lately
