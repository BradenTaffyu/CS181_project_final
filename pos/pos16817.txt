2018 i do love this game i would like it if we could have an inventory there are some items when we go into a house that are not in the store i d like to keep the items but i also want to clear the room fully to clean and paint just personal preference so i d like if i could put things in inventory it would be nice if i could even keep some items and use them in different houses also i ve almost run out of houses i know i can start another game i can go through my emails and redo homes but i would love to have more houses to purchase one other thing i ve found how i can do a checker pattern with the floor tile i d love if there was an option to turn off the long panel option for tiles so that i could also use a checker pattern with wall tiles and honestly more patterns for tiles would be great too and maybe more paneling and wallpaper
