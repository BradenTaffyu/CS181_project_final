2017 back when i played the original nier game on my ps3 i became obsessed with yoko taro s work after managing to complete the game with all it s endings i went back and played drakengard 1 2 not really a yoko taro game and drakengard 3 and even though these all were great games the same issue was present in each of the games the gameplay the lack of budget nier was an improvement over the first 2 drakengard games the game came from one of the multiple endings drakengard had a joke ending even nier became a full fledged action rpg in the process it had decent graphics and the gameplay was somewhat enjoyable the story i will probably never forget it still other that from the captivating story and characters the low budget had evidently affected the game even so it was just that good so good that it became one of my favorite games of all time drakengard 3 also had some amazing ideas built in but sadly the technical state of the game made it very difficult to play due to staggerinly low framerates most of the time still again i loved the story the characters and the setting see yoko taro is a genius a genius at telling stories he tells stories in ways other directors would be scared of even touching on he breaks taboos in unique ways while managing to stay humble and loyal to his own work when nier automata was announced my heart skipped a beat and when it was confirmed that platinum games were the ones in charge of the action direction i knew that at last we were in presence of a masterpiece in the making i wasn t wrong after playing around 68 hours and achieved and explored everything the game has to offer nier automata has become one of my favorite games of all time definitely my favorite modern game of all time this time around its not just the god tier level story that makes this game legendary but it s fluid and stylish yet simple combat and overall action rpg gameplay why do i say that yoko taro is a genius storyteller one would have to play nier automata multiple times to come to that realization the game doesn t end in just one playthrough it builds up for the next one and each time one finishes a playthrough the game gets even better and better pushing the player to keep up unraveling what is in store next at the end of it all you end up immersed and extremely touched with the outcomes of the story this is true in all of yoko taro s games specially in automata while the characters are built on popular japanese stereotypes the story is just so immersive that these cliches go on overlooked and even manage to make us get in touch with the characters feelings in such ways that no other videogame has achieved up to now alongside yoko taro okabe keiichi has been working with him on the soundtracks from the original nier onwards nier soundtrack is probably my favorite videogame soundtrack of all time i stand corrected now it was okabe has gone way beyond excellence with nier automata s soundtrack and has composed another masterpiece that fits the overall quality of this game platinum also did an excellent job like they did with metal gear rising in managing the pacing of the action with the bgms it all feels natural connected the music in this game definitely plays a huge part on what the game expresses and in how does it do it basically one can play nier automata without playing the original nier game the intel data you find during the characters journey helps the player grasp the situation and the state of this post apocalyptic world the best outcome though is to have played the original nier as there are very special surprises here for followers of the franchise that are greatly appreciated and add even more to the game as for the port goes i cannot call it a bad port because the ps4 and ps4 pro versions of the game also were launched presenting issues luckily for the pc community there is a mod that vastly improves performance with just a minimal hit in graphical quality and fixes some other issues like full screen support for some users and framerate smoothing the game has some other technical issues like stuttering 30 fps capped pre rendered cutscenes that is a fact nothing that makes it unplayable or subtracts from the experience though honestly i m just happy that yoko taro finally was able to give us a true aaa game that can actually appeal to the masses while remaining true with his genius storytelling this isn t the best platinum games action title around in terms of gameplay that is true there are games like bayonetta and metal gear rising around that completely nail down action gameplay aspects and depend on them but this game has some refined action that complements one of the best stories ever told in a game i cannot recommend this game is enough it is one of the best examples of why are videogames considered art this is one of those media products that couldn t have turned anything else than a videogame nier automata is the pinnacle of yoko taro s work resulting in one of the best gaming experiences of all time
