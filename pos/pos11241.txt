early access review big surprise in 2024 a very simple supermarket simulator order supply and hire staff to chill out medial tasks can be very relaxing that is this game there is no secret behind it yet it s a pretty big hit it fills a weird demand for a chill experience the game is updated regularly since it has smashed the developer s expectations but it s still early access so for a fuller experience i recommend to wait a bit because at this moment the game is lacking past the beginning you have to manually stock your supply room and this task gets rather ridiculous when sales flourish 81 100more reviews at omnivore gamer games that are easy to control for handicapped gamers
