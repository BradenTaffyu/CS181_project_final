2020 early access review survived for an in game two weeks or so with a friend a scratch got infected and i took care of it pretty well but one fateful night while making pasta and after eating said pasta i had forgotten to actually disinfect it we decided to sleep for the night and because need sleep was off we accidentally slept for a full 24 hours a whole day went by without tending to the scratch i turned and my friend put me down worth the 10 hours we put into that character just for that moment edit after sinking another like 100 hours into this game i can assure you that the whole goal of dying makes every moment important and losing a character with 30 hours of survival time actually hurts i now have to find him and put him down and that hurts too rip lord fartquad
