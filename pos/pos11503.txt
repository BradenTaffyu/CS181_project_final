2015 early access review 7 days to diethe fun pimps somehow founded a company with that name and gave us a really fun survival sandbox game that is pretty surprising considering what they are trying to do and what they have actually done probably the best pve survival game i have ever played with the looting random gen building and zombie hordes being some highlights i always want it to be harder and better because these guys are really on to something they somehow combined elements of fallout with minecraft with zombies if you haven t seen the game recently give it a look now because it is starting to take some serious form
