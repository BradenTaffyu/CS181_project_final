2014 early access review when i looked at ac i was unsure if it would be for me i liked the idea of a racing sim but i came from the f1 201x gt5 6 games on the ps3 so was unsure if it would be too technical for my liking and frankly too hard well i m so glad i bought it i initially got the technology preview for buying netkar pro for a few quid but the early access was far more fun than i thought it would be the game has constantly been developed by kunos with regular updates every 2 weeks and now multiplayer is out it s made it even better i started with a dfgt but purchased the t500rs and th8 shifter just for ac it was a good investment in my eyes as it brings the cars to life the lotus 49 around monza 66 is my favourite and it s such a beast to handle but great fun in trying handling this blows any console game out of the water i bought race 07 and that doesn t come close to ac i haven t been able to try pcars the ffb is superb and i can only hope they continue to improve this if you have cold tires with a heavy fuel load you really notice the difference in turn 1 compared to low fuel warm tire runs sound this could be better and will be ac recently mentioned they will use a new audio method for a better experience it s still pretty good as it is i can t complain as i still think it s good cars whilst there are a lot less cars to other games out there it takes so much time to get really good with the cars i just don t care there are some car s i ve hardly driven as other cars get me hooked tracks the bumps in the tracks are something else you play f1 and it feels like you are driving on a perfectly smooth track you go around the nurburgring on ac and you have to work for a decent time and learn where some bumps are to avoid or use for better traction multiplayer there are tonnes of servers up it s easy to host a private lobby but you do need to be comfortable playing with config files as there is no gui yet in the game most tracks allow 20 cars lag isn t too bad either i regularly play against someone in new zealand when our server is in the uk it s not perfect but it s raceable and far better than other games i ve played online on the down side the options are pretty limited as mp is in the alpha phase what else is in the game ai racestime challenge where you have to reach a checkpoint within a time period hotlapdrag race ai only atm race weekendsspecial eventsdrifting i ve not done this as i m turd at it mods there are loads of mods out there already hotlap leaderboards car skins tyres wear temp mods nicer gui s and tracks whilst they aren t as good as the offical tracks it makes the future very bright for ac like any mp game it s better if you have a good community to race with i do www acracers com frankly this is my favourite game period i enjoy other genres but this game keeps me coming back for more
