2016 early access review i m not one to write reviews for games especially games that are in early access so i ll classify rimworld as a lifestyle instead of a game i was an original kickstarter backer and have played this game almost daily for the last 3 years with an estimated 1000 hours of playtime before the game was avaible on steam so yes i ll recommend this game and give it a positive review the best way that i can describe rimworld is the aesthetics of prison architect mixed with elements of dwarf fortress set in a firefly styled universe in it s heart it s a colony simulation game where you take control of colonists who are on a planet away from civilization you make the decisions to equip shelter feed and protect your colony from the environmental dangers and enemy factions sure the game is still in early access alpha 14 at the time of posting but there are a ton of replayability and mechanics to learn as well as different difficulties and multiple ai types to guide your gameplay the game is relatively bug free and nicely balanced in the vanilla game the modding community is healthy and a lot of really solid mods have been released and updated with that said the game may be a little daunting for new players there are a lot of elements and core mechanics to the game that take some time to learn my suggestion to this is to play the game on a reduced difficulty and learn from your mistakes when your colony dies restart a new map and learn from your mistakes losing is fun all in all it s worth the 30 even if 30 is expensive for an indie game i mean you can cure asthma by replacing a colonist s lungs as i said before i did purchase the game through kickstarter but the developer added me to the game as a character so i didn t technically get this game for free but i did a bit of a bonus youtube video views 0
