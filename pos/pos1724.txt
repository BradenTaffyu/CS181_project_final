2018 do you think games are silly little things well i ve fallen in love with this silly little thing this video game that shattered my expectations for storytelling and gameplay it s a roller coaster ride of action comedy tragedy love and sometimes just pure silliness i haven t experienced anything quite like it the graphics may not be the prettiest but it s still great by today s standards the combat is top notch this is platinum games after all and everything is just animated beautifully the soundtrack is absolutely godlike and is used to maximum effect throughout the game during sombre moments or action packed gameplay the soundtrack will fit perfectly and keep you going i have nothing but love for the story and the characters in it it s of the few games i decided to 100 not because of achievement hunting but purely because i wanted to know more about the world this game is set in sure the game has some issues with it s graphics on older hardware and some boring side quests but the pros far outweigh the cons it certainly deserves the attention and sales it received and i look forward to yoko taro s next game i m actually reluctant to uninstall the game because i ll miss it so much highly highly recommended
