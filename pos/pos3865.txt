2022 holy crap what can i say this is a hard recommend it is a good game and its only flaw is that some of the items descriptions has some small translation flaws that become unnoticeable over time it s pretty much manwha korean xcom with more forgiving death mechanics no permadeath and fights where you are battling dozens of enemies while exploring a cyberpunk sprawl every character you control is named and has their own classes and prestige classes there s an almost final fantasy tactics side powers d d 3 5 feat chain system except you don t have to buy your feats a wedding ring and can retrain at any time which allows you to do ridiculous passive power combos that let you feel incredibly powerful but the enemies all work under the same mechanics you do and have their own builds it s like someone grabbed a really really good korean cell phone game the overly complex ones with all the gacha and then got rid of all the gachado you like xcom get thisdo you like weeb stuff get thisdo you like final fantasy tactics get thisdo you like a subtly anti establishment plotline that slowly unfurls over time and shows the struggles of law enforcement within a deeply corrupt political system that encourages the sort of dangerous carelssness that puts common people at risk get this
