2018 early access review i ve had this game for awhile and i keep forgetting to review it so to start its about zombies and on the 7th day all hell breaks loose you build craft make weapons hunt and go scavanging there is ample opportunity to level up and make these amazing structures most of all your job protecting against zombies makes the fear of losing all of your hard work worthy to protect it i love zombie survival games and this is possibly my favorite one as you can see by the hours i ve amassed this is entertaining and doesn t get reptitive or boring players are probably better off either buying the two pack and getting their friends to play on a server or joining a server online i m usually a cheapskate and don t like paying full price but i would definetly pay full price for this game the developers are very much active and while it is still in alpha stage they are constantly adding new features fixing bugs and making the game continually fun
