2021 early access review i would first recommend this game to the players who are more open world medieval combat oriented games like mordhau kingdom come deliverance chivalry etc are the reasons i fall into this category and if you like any of those games or any similar to that you will already like bannerlord before you realize it but to those who aren t familiar with m b a half decent summary would say it is a medieval sandbox where your goal is to be the strongest faction on the map by whatever means necessary to those who played m b warband many would consider this to be a continuation of this game and i d have to agree it is not a bad thing because i believe there is a lot more content being added and a lot of problems that have been solved since then combat mechanics are the same with some ai differences and new weapons armor new perk trees concepts for you and your companions bannerlord also added a questline that nudges you along towards total domination either by you or your ruler oh and also when you feel like skipping the battle and just sending your troops in they fixed the chance system for how likely characters are to die so rest assured you don t have to worry about one sea raider killing multiple of your hundreds of troops what i found to be the strongest points that make this game shine a free roam concept where you do as you please you can serve fight for whatever faction you wish including your own you can interact with characters court attack trade and so on you are able to participate in open battles with hundreds of units on the field commanding different types of troops to do different actions face a certain direction make a formation hold fire follow you and many others or if you re a part of an army filled with other nobles then you lead one type of troop infantry arrows cavalry horse archers under your commander regardless you are going to take a step back when you first see dozens of cavalry rolling over the hills in the distance or when your commander gives the order to charge and you have to join the front line where chaos is the only thing that is happening siege events with a lot of potential for strategy i say potential because if you decide not to set them on auto the troops are only as effective as you are at commanding them but as far as content there is a lot going on between manning a catapult to try and take out their siege tower and making sure that the troops are holding the line at the main gate where they ve broken through it takes a lot out of your hands as you try to make it all happen on the keyboard and it looks really intimidating seeing hundreds moving troops outside your walls very smooth trading system in markets and with npc s it s still in ea so frame rate drops load screens still happen but that is something that will be smoothed out music music music i love the music consistently m b proves that not all gaming companies are giving up on going above and beyond for their soundtracks the only negatives i have for this one is that there isn t enough of it and i wasn t there in person to hear it being performed sadly i found some things to be negative points about the game this is kind of difficult to tell since it is in ea so things may be added changed fixed after this post so i will focus on content that is there now rather than bugs and whatnot ai isn t the smartest if you re not the commander and you are only in charge of one troop then they go on to do whatever they want to and it may not match up with what is considered the best strategy at the beginning of each battle you spawn on opposite sides of the map one battle my commander thought it best to go backwards and to the left up a hill with a bunch of trees pushing the boundary of the map i had to figure out where i was going to put 200 archers so that they could see and fire at the enemy you only know as much as you research what i mean by this is that the only tutorial you get is the combat and how to use different weapons shields arguably this isn t a negative but i deem it more negative than not because there are a few menu keyboard tips that would help to know early on as silly as it sounds i spent more time than i should have looking in the vendors inventory for food because i didn t know that the category filters were at the top of the screen or how i wanted to look characters locations up to know what faction they were a part of or to find them but couldn t until i accidentally pressed n and opened the encyclopedia they have already added a mechanic that lets you click rmb to open the encyclopedia on a certain items but that doesn t solve the entire issue of the average player being clueless right now when you press esc in game there is a list of tips you can look through on the left which is a plus but i hope they add more because it doesn t solve as many questions as it could all in all the game is great and any of the negatives i ve found don t outweigh the positives if you were sold on the game after a few points then you re going to love it regardless of whatever you dislike about the game i bought it not only because it appeals to what i like in a game but also because i believe taleworlds is capable of reminding players what their standards should be for a great game anyways i hope this helps
