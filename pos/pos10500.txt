2019 if you enjoy naval history warfare then this is definitely the game for you for myself i tend to be wary of online multiplayer games mostly due to personal reasons and because sometimes the internet doesn t always bring out the best in people no commentary on the game or the community as a whole that s just life that s why i was pleasantly surprised how easy it was for me to play cooperatively without the rancor that sometimes comes with pvp gaming being able to play on a team versus the computer at decidedly lower stakes was a pleasant departure from other games i ve played online there s definitely a learning curve for sure but as a casual player i ve found the game to be a delight and as a student of naval history it s tons of fun to play with both historical warships as well as the what if fleet of ships that never left the drawing board or the slipway i would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a good time be you a student of naval history a warship aficionado or a fan of online war gaming
