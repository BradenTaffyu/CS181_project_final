2018 i ve got over a hundred hours on this and the only mod i ve ever used is diplomacy so know that anything i say is still only a fraction of the content this game could have if you want it the base ideas of the game are pretty simple you start from nothing recruiting local villagers with the pennies you have and fighting bandits helping local lords etc to get some cash to upgrade the villagers into a decent fighting force eventually as you win battles you ll gain renown that ll let you recruit more troops so you ll be able to take on bigger enemy parties maybe if you ve got on the good side of one of the ever warring factions you ll be offered a position as a mercenary in their pay or even a lord becoming a fully fledged vassal lets the leader of your faction assign you land at first it ll just be a poor village that you ll slowly build improvements for when you get your first it ll probably seem like a vast amount of money to spend and it won t get you much of a regular income but it ll be a regular income that ll really help you pay your troops wages then provided you stay in good graces with your faction and you keep impressing them they might give you a castle to call your own that you can provide garrisons for and actually defend without having to ride across the map for every time and if you re really lucky you ll get a whole town to your name which provides a huge increase in income and really give you some freedom of course you could go the other way and be a pillaging warmonger no allegiances and just building your armies enough to besiege a few towns until you start your own kingdom which is a whole dimension to the game i can t tell you about because i have yet to do it along the way you ll be levelling up upgrading your stats and buying yourself new better equipment and it always feels good to think back to when you were stretching the bank to get a good leather jerkin and compare it to riding a war horse into the fray in full plate metal looking exactly the great warrior you set out to be all those moons ago doing battle with armies you never believed your little band would ever stand a chance against
