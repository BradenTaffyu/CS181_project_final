2013 early access review this certainly was the best 20 euros ever spent on a game i love this game its learning curve and its modability here a few pointers to help you decide 1 if you love astronomy and space exploration this game is for you you can do everything you have read and fantasized about build any rocket no matter how stupid the concept may look at first and then try it out in the cold hard reality of space 2 the game has a very steep learning curve and will constantly challenge you you will learn a lot about orbital mechanics why staging is absolutely necessary and how to conserve fuel if you don t you probably won t make it into orbit much less to the mun or even other planets even after more than 600 hours of playing kerbal space program i m learning stuff the hard way by losing vehicles and kerbals 3 the game developers actively encourage modding and the modding community is breathtakingly awesome the modability of this game is the hidden strength of this game without it i wouldn t have played it half the time i actually did and wouldn t have enjoyed it as much at the same time the first time you play through the career mode meaning you unlock all the technologies you should play it without any mods just to learn the basics look how the game behaves etc but after that you should really check out the kerbal space program forums mod section kerbalstuff and or the curse mod page there s mods for so many aspects of the game want to play in more realistic solar system where it s harder to even get into orbit check want to have more realistic punishing aerodynamics check want to have rocket parts for even larger rockets check want to have some autopilot capabilities to assist you with repetitive tasks check want to mine for fuel and ores on distant celestial bodies check want to have a warp drive also check there s so many more which you should probably explore for yourself the replayability of this game is great thanks to all those mods the community forums are also really great and helpful if you play this game please make sure you don t forget to mod it at some point really you should not play this game if you don t like space sims to be too realistic again you will have to learn at least basic orbital mechanics which means the strongest force around is not your ship s drive but gravity and a heartless she is indeed if you don t enjoy learning stuff the hard way by explosions disintegrations and death there is no perfect rocket at some point stuff will blow up and you will have to start a whole mission again if you don t like games that are still in development there will be new versions released every now and then so things change from time to time for example when the game was upgraded from 0 22 to 0 23 the whole science system got a rework and a lot of my rockets that were built specifically for science grinding became useless the update was great though since it got rid of grinding altogether i hope you enjoy this game as much as i still do
