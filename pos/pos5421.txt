2016 early access review i will start this review by stating that i am not a die hard roguelike player i haven t played any of the classics except for tales of maj eyal and wouldnt consider myself particularly knoweldgeable about the genre history and so on with that said i consider caves of qud to be one of the if not the best game i have purchased and played in 2016 the first time i heard about this game was on a forum where it was described as retrofuturistic and inspired by post post apocalyptic fiction i was intrigued by talk of sentient plants and also a procedurally generated game with more of a focus on a narrative my expectations were not only met but were blown away when i finally decided to play the game caves of qud is hard to describe its often comically stupid full of crazy situations and at the same time solumn and steeped with a history that is intruging and suprisingly deep its a world where not much is explained because to explain it would be convoluted why does a machingun turret worship a god or why are there mutant hyena people living in something called the rust wells it is a testament to the vision and world the developers have created that something as absurd as a techno cyborg bear can not only exist but actually feels coherant within the setting the asthetic choices made in the game also really resonated with me and the ascii pixel art is superb and full of character helped by an excellent choice of colour pallet there are also stylistic flourishes that one wouldn t expect in a game with such simple graphics such as floating text highlighting things happening around you and clever ways of giving items in your inventory more character despite the text based nature one that comes to mind is discovering a jewel encrusted item with all the characters in its name coloured differently to represent gems i would say the sound is quite bare bones at the moment but the music and sound effects that are present are good the music in particular is very evocative and used to excellent effect at special locations specifically the 6th day stilt as a game to play is full of variety it has a really robust character building system essentially you pick between a mutant or a pure blooded true kin the mutants get to pick between 20 or so powers which could be something like shooting flames from your hands or a physical abberation like having two heads the true kin can subdue robots and have slightly better base attributes mutants pick a background such as marauder or nomad and then true kin pick which arcology they hail from these serve to augment your stats and give different equipment to begin both then pick from many skill trees thoughout the game as they level up each game you start in the same village joppa and begin the quest anew you will die and die often each time you reincarnate to do it again the world is static but aside from some plot critical locations each area is randomly generated each time each game is familiar but always different every character i have created has been memorable in his own way the game can feel punishingly hard and unforgiving deaths can feel cheap and unfair sometimes they are but it is still in early access there are some character builds that work incredibly well some feel like you are just hindering yourself some stats feel useless willpower and others too strong agility i personally like the unbalanced aspects but i can imagine somepeople being upset over the death of a long lived character i have never made it to the end of the game in fact i have no idea if there is an end as yet i can t get enough of it regardless the developers are very communicative and updates happen frequently i wouldn t have been dissapointed if i had bought this product as a fully released title its that good i have no doubt this game will go from stregnth to stregnth as its development continues i cannot reccommend it enough
