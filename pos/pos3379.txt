2017 this game is one of the best if not the best of it its kind with a great story a good sound track and amazing visuals my original thought s going into this game was that it would be the same as every other with progression gradually getting easier until i reach the point that i would have no problem killing everything but no matter how hard i tried i constantly had to redo some of the fights to really learn the tactics and how the game works the game exceeded my expectations by far and i would definetly recommed this game to any fan of dungeons and dragons especially with the new game master feature comming out soon this could very well revolutionise d d as we know it
