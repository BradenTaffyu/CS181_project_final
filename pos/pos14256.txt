2021 early access review this is an excellent factory sim in the same vein as factorio and satisfactory if you can get past the engrish which is sorta omnipresent the amount of polish is frankly incredible a couple tips set up your production lines like this in assembler assembler out so that it s easy to add on additional production later leave plenty of space in between each little production outpost so you can expand all of them in all directions while still having room to breathewhen it s time to start making tier 2 science the red ones you ll need to set up oil your first tier 2 science tech should be x ray cracking this is the advanced oil processing tech from factorio in dsp setup a very temporary oil hydrogen setup storing all the other outputs until you have this tech then it s time to set up your actual oil setup which will be oil pump 1x oil refinery set to basic refining 2x oil refinery set to xray cracking this will output graphite and hydrogen which are exactly what you need for red science in exactly the right ratios if you use a setup like the rockpapershotgun guide for xray cracking it s easy to tile it for expanding your hydrogen output something like this pump v hydrogen v v v v hydrogen v to v refiner xray crack xray crack red v ref oil v v science v v graphite v maker the point is xray cracking uses refined oil to basically turn 2 hydrogen into 3 hydrogen with this setup you can send the southern hydrogen belt to eventually loop back on the northern hydrogen belt using a splitter and then prioritize that output so that hydrogen only gets sent to the red science maker once the input is saturateddoes this sound like the kind of optimization stuff you adore did you love this kind of thing in factorio you ll enjoy it here tooone other tip you can set belts to any height at no additional cost so don t be afraid to ship a resource halfway across the planet by staircasing the belt up to a height of like 20 or 30 way above everything else then just extending that belt all the way around the planet before staircasing it back down to height 0 verticality in general doesn t get used the way it does in satisfactory you can stack storage boxes on top of each other up to ridiculous heights to basically just make one giant storage box but you re still going to feed into it from the ground floor most assembly happens in height 1 and height 2 lots of spaghetti belts weaving over and under so you can rest easy knowing that a belt at height 20 is never gonna obstruct later expansion maybe you ll even set up a giant main bus that literally encircles the planet way up at height 20 looping back on itself after a single orbit of the planet so that there s iron and copper and magnets in easy reach of every location c mon surely that whets your appetite this game is awesome if the engrish bothers you suck it up
