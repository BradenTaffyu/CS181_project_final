2019 writing this 108 hours into the game i feel like as someone who really enjoys doing everything that s offered i am not even half way through the game yet this game is absolutely insanely big i honestly can t find any negatives to the game yet as everything is basically perfect it s probably my second favorite game on steam ever and my favorite rpg of all time the amount of care put into this game is just ludicrous everything is impactfull every fight matters every character has their own unique personality the abilities are fun the mixing and trying out stuff is nearly endless it s honestly too much to tell you what s all possible and nice about this game so i ll cut it short this game is a pure 11 10 just freaking buy it not on sale either please these people deserve money it feels dirt cheap already for what it offers pro tip if you play it get pet talk as a starting talent to amplify the games fun by another ten fold
