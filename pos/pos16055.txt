it s just a digital tabletop that you can use for just about every game you can make your own games with custom assets or find ones for free on the steam workshop obviously it s mostly intended to be played in multiplayer but you can enjoy some solitaire or something in singleplayer heed my warning if you want to create a game to play with your friends when you re importing custom images when creating assets choose the cloud option choosing local will prevent your friends from seeing the images on the assets in multiplayer
