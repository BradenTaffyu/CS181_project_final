2021 early access review early access review 05 04 2021 after spending some time on my raft i can only recomend this game this is a very relaxing game to play and it feels like any age could play this there is some dificulty settings available and a free builder mode to try everything you want at the start you walk or peddle in a very cartoony world in wich you will have to survive if not in free mode when i played this game i noticed i spent a lt of time in it quickly i like colecting and organising so thats why i guess cause as for the story mode available at the time it was pretty short more will come developers sayd game still in development good thing to know there is a pretty active sea around you people with motion sickness might be afected by but there is a slo a setting to prevent this sea from being this active and you will have a smoother ride on your raft the tech specs requirements are very low game has no gamebreaking bugs and as far as i played i havent encountered any great job the renovation update awesome a lot of new not survival requirements stuff has been added chairs n sofa s rugs art flowers plants a whole lot your raft can now be your floating castle with everything you can think of don t hessitate to buy this game it s good for many hours of fun the team behind this development is doing a great job for an early access game there are finished products out there that can learn a thing or 2 from this team imo
