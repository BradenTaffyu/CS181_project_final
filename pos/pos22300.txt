2017 the pve in this game is very good if you re buying it for that which i assume most people are then it s definitely worthwhile similar in quality to the first half of dark souls 1 maybe even a bit better now that poise actually works world layout isn t as good though the pvp on the other hand dear lord it s the worst of the 3 dark souls games by a lot flawed in a lot of very frustrating ways and of course from has literally no idea how to balance weapons so some weapons and weapon classes are just plain worthless nothing new there
