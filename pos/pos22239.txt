2017 good art design cool lore polished combat more forgiving than previous ones but harder to catch up with it because it is faster there are many ways to make the game easier for you from usable items to different builds magic and weapons good item armor and weapon variety smart level design which encourages you to try different things gameplay wise it also uses visual story telling so most of the things don t look out of place unless it is designed to be good enemy variety pretty graphics and animations o the story is kinda obscure like older games which certainly gives it a charm o it is easy to miss some npc interactions but they add replayability o pvp and co op is a little too disconnected to the main game covenant rewards are pretty hard to get and not that cool some enemies and bosses are too easy with co op even though some of them react accordingly with more aoe attacks but they re still features and it s fun to play with people o the dodge is powerful so it helps with faster builds while making slower builds relatively worse o shields are not good dodge is too powerful for the pvp it is mostly a show it becomes too chaotic and invasions can take forever armor is mostly fashion heavy armor does not justify dmg absorption poise is not affected by armor anymore at least not enough it makes any difference especially when rolling is this strong shields are useless so some builds are not good as they used to be there was some gameplay value in the previous games which is not here anymore there are places where the game feels inconsistent a weak looking enemy not staggering when hit while a big guy can t stand against you a mob spamming his best move ai pathfinding freaking out to be fair the game is about observing the enemy before acting so it does not affect the gameplay horribly some bosses are either too weak and or don t feel special mouse support is not that good but they tried this game is not perfect but it is perfect with its flaws it is aware of itself and does not pretend to be something it is not the pvp and co op are not that good but you have to go out of your way to use them anyway the armors are bad but it is not like you can upgrade them like in ds1 they don t make you feel like armor is that important those bosses who don t feel special are not really special anyway they re dudes who happened to be in your way this game is a complete experience this game is difficult it does not hold your hand and it becomes way easier when you figure it out like every game should be it is never unfair it is either you or your character not suited for that part of the game use your items upgrade your items and abuse the systems of the game the game will not feel cheated if you abuse it as it tries to abuse you constantly play it at your pace don t hit your head against the wall try to go around it and if you feel like you don t want to find another way you can still do it your way but it might be way harder it is okay to be upset if things don t work out but if you don t like to get upset at times there won t be any relief when you beat the challenge so get ready for that dlc reviews ashes of ariandel short but fun it is worth it but does not cut it when it comes to surprising you it has 2 nice bosses but nothing really new mostly some generic enemies and a beautiful map the painting has its own story but it is not as interesting as the rest of the game because it feels disconnected the ringed city this dlc would be really good if it was not level hard high hp and dmg enemies all around one of the bosses the optional one is like something from wow or a jrpg it takes a while to bring him down as he can pretty much one shot kill you instantly other than that it is pretty cool because it keeps on giving it surprises you with traps that you have never seen in souls series before it shows you bits of unseen lore about the order of the dark souls universe the dark souls series end but these games are never about when you get there anyway it s always the climb
