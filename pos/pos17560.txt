2016 expensive yes a unique authentic and epic warhammer experience yes almost endless replay value made even more so with monthly updates for years to come yes a dev team who listens and communicates with the community yes if you have the cash this game is highly recommended there s no strategy game turn based and real time that can give you the epic experience of w th the dlc do add up but they are added to the campaign whether or not you purchase them you just can t play as them
