2019 like all total war games warhammer ii is a 4x turn based strategic management game with a lot of hardcore real time tactical combat other total war games are limited by the reality of whatever location and time period it is based on medieval shogun etc warhammer ii has no such limitations and makes full use of the extensive lore from its namesake you can control dinosaurs enslave populations and have sexy elven maidens shoot overpowered magic arrows over 750 yards into a bunch of ugly ratmen different races and factions have very different game play styles both at the strategic and tactical level making for tons of replayability compared to the already good warhammer i the developer has dramatically improved the campaign tighten gameplay and introduced new mechanics in this second iteration like all total war games its greatest weakness is its easily cheesable ai that performs particularly poorly on siege maps that and you will occasionally run across situations that feel very rng by nature where did that giant ai stack near my capital come from despite these flaws warhammer ii is hands down one of the best total war games every made personally i think warhammer ii is significantly better than the overrated total war three kingdoms
