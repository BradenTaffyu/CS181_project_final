2023 holy hell they were not kidding about this game let me be clear that this game worked for me right out of the box download but i played with an insane amount of mods installed regardless now this whole game was amazing i never got around to playing this game back in the day because alot of it had been spoiled for me sadly but not that long ago i was watching the no clip documentary on bethesda over the years and started to get the itch to play story was engaging with lots of ways to shape it how you want combat was fun well i played with mods and chaotic companions were very well written however it was a let down to see that they barely interacted with the world or with you unless spoken to directly like i figured they would have had more to say about current events as we were doing them but sadly they did not so even tho i had like 3 talking companions with me again mods it felt like i might as well had been traveling alone other then that it was a solid experience with great voice acting great side stories and fun adventures to be had boys and girls this game holds up even by 2023 standards and that is wild an amazing rpg that lives up to all the praise
