2015 it s great it s improved and evolved it s not exactly fallout 3 number 2 i ll write more when i actually beat and explore the game 90 something hours later i am still nowhere close to beating this game i m not very good at fallout games but i enjoy them immensely i ve created my second character now that i understand fully how the stats perk system work it s quite different from all the other fallout games much like the dialogue system which is great it s all voice acted but it gives you no choices you re always playing the parent of a victim of a kidnapping that being said fallout 4 is a blast to play already 90 hours in most on one character my second is only at level 20 fallout has a lot to offer
