2013 if you re coming to arma 3 as an arma series veteran you already know what to expect for the most part the game hasn t changed since the last installment but then it s always felt a little bit like bohemia interactive are still building on the groundwork laid back in 2001 by operation flashpoint in the world s longest ever game of development buckaroo thankfully the whole thing has yet to fall to pieces in any significant manner it s quite happy to continue wobbling uneasily for now arma has a reputation it s known to be frighteningly obtuse bewilderingly complex and often hilariously broken i can tell you right now that arma 3 is no different and absolutely still deserves that reputation thankfully i don t think it s unfair to say that this is the closest an arma game has come to being user friendly the controls have been tweaked and the interface refined a little to accommodate more modern tastes for these improvements alone i do recommend it to newcomers to the series over any previous entry coming from any other modern fps game it will still take a good few hours of what can feel an awful lot like hard work to get to grips with the controls but i honestly think arma 3 will see a far lower drop out rate of newbies who were frustrated to the point of giving up by the previous games at the time of writing the elephant in the room is the lack of content available when compared to arma 2 which is handsomely bolstered by an array of official expansion packs the amount of hardware available to play with is frustratingly slim in many cases opposing armies are equipped with identical vehicles which get a slightly different paint job at best for anyone used to the myriad of variants and oddments available in arma 2 arma 3 can feel awfully disappointing fortunately this is alleviated to some extent by the strong mod community it has long been the case that the best parts of the arma games are the parts not developed by bohemia interactive themselves and arma 3 is most definitely continuing this tradition nevertheless i can t help but feel that the game could ve done with a few months more time in the oven before full public release speaking of the mod community i think it s criminal that almost none of the best near indispensible mods from arma 2 have been officially integrated for a self professed war simulator arma 3 is hugely lacking in basic features like being able to rest your weapon on surfaces even with a visible bipod or tow damaged vehicles for all its flaws though arma 3 is still a blast to play if you can find a decent group of like minded gamers with access to a voice over net server you re in for some of the best gaming you ll ever experience sure you ll probably have to load up on mods to satisfy your need for variety and sure sometimes the game will crash spectacularly or the physics engine will flip out and kill you for standing too close to a wall but when you re standing on a hilltop looking out over an enemy outpost with your squadmates while a cas helicopter strafes an enemy apc and spots targets for a distant sniper team when everything clicks together in the way that only arma can manage you ll be glad to have been along for the ride
