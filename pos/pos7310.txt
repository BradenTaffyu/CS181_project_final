2020 so after 225 hours and i don t know how many years of the game i decided to write a review about the game after all ats is still the same simulator of cargo transportation from point a to point b like its twin brother ets2 it is very nice that the developers support the game and try to please with new dlc however it s already 2020 and the game is still marking time even screwed direct x11 does not save the situation in any way the picture in the game is still bad the mechanics of new ones do not appear in principle most of this simulator will get bored after 20 30 hours of play it has no specific purpose you will search for it yourself everyone will find something for themselves either open the whole map or open some achievements thanks to achievements at least they dilute the routine a little true drivers having a steering wheel and the like get an unforgettable driving experience yes unfortunately the game does not play like that without a steering wheel anyone who has ever played will understand you will no longer want to sit down at the keyboard or gamepad and if you still have a track ir controller thenimmersion in the game will be 100 then neither graphics nor flat mechanics will bother you i would like to wish the developers to take up their heads and finally move forward and not draw new states the game is missing a lot and it s not new locations in the first place despite all the disadvantages as a driver the game comes to me after all in fact in real life i perform the same tasks i recommend for purchase only to fans or lovers of heavy trucks there is nothing else to do here
