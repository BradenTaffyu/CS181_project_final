2022 this game ranks number 1 for the number of hours i spent in any single playthrough rating 8 5 10one of the most bang for buck games i only played the single player campaign and this is my first and only rts game i almost never play any 2d game but this game made me give it an exemption in this real time strategy game we start our journey by building the economy and growing our army sometimes we try diplomacy and find allies while we get new enemies we conquer the city by completing assigned objectives which mostly involve destroying enemy bases the story and voiceover are serviceable but not much worth a story the gameplay is what people love this game for although inefficient i find it super fun to just overpower my enemy by building a very huge army and sending all of them at once as a surprise return gift for all the small attacks they do in my base meanwhile i do villain laughs seeing their base being ripped apart by my army and they unable to produce enough soldiers to match mine xdit s a very fun game single player content alone is extremely huge and then multiplayer is another thing easy recommendation
