i d say it was the best rpg experience i ve ever had 10 10to remember it for the future i ll just list some memorable things from our journey friend didn t recommend undead so i thought it d be funny to be one and chose undead the only thing stopping me from unlocking every door in the game were puzzles eventually i became a debuff overlord crippling any enemy i see the first person we stole from was a crippled old lady struggling with several diseases black pits well everything else was a breeze is all i can say about the matter fire fire ahhhhh it s everywhere one friend got pet pal cause they like animals but all the animals hated them that same friend was an elf things happened and they became to be hated by their entire race too bard friend pulls out lute listen do your hear me listen do you feel it listen my red lizard companion who i also got to play as eventually became a one shot one kill boss killer made out with that same red lizard as an undead somehow but was later cuckolded by his wife loading times were long but i cannot forget the laughs we had while waiting it was a several month journey with my friends i cannot thank them enough for enriching my experience of the game i highly recommend this game to everyone who wants to go on a journey with friends thanks for inviting me to play it was a blast
