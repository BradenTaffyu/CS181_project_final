2017 i ve been using iracing since april 2011 i m not a fast driver but you don t have to be to enjoy this service the race splits usually provide plenty of competition at my level the physics and sound are awesome the developer continues to update the software every three months without fail each update brings a combination of new content cars tracks racing genres or software upgrades iracing tries hard not to release content before it s ready for public consumption so when new content is made available it is top notch this is a game it is also a simulation it is not cheap it is a good value for the money if you are serious about racing in a realistic manner it is not for playing bumper cars you control your pit stops control the car under caution control the car at the start of the race and at restarts this is about as real as you can get in terms of the immersion of things that you the driver crew chief manage catch a deal where iracing is offering new memberships for cheap to see if its for you
