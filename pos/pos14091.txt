2021 i have been playing this game a long time and have logged 322 hours on it i ve watched it evolve from earlier days and have enjoyed playing it first you need to know oxygen not included is not for the timid this has to be one of the most intricately complex resource balancing games i ve seen if you love a real challenge and non stop alerts that something else has gone wrong you ll love this game they now have two mode survival mode or no sweat mode don t be fooled though i ve now put in a couple hundred hours in the no sweat mode and it s no walk in the park you start the game with three duplicants aka peons or little dudes you can choose the defaults or keep pressing random until you get what you want i highly recommend making sure you have research building and farming covered without these three traits it s a bugger to build a starting base especially with no research also check what they will do when they get stressed if it says destructive it doesn t matter how good they are trust me on this one press that random button again the basics of the game your duplicants need oxygen to breath food to eat a place to sleep and stuff to keep them happy and stress free in the end the only thing you really need to watch is their happiness if they re missing anything else they re not happy this game has a unique set of conceptual engines that run all intertwined to challenge the player to the limit the most obvious is the fluid dynamics engine fluids gases and liquids all react realistically based on their density pressure and weight so be very careful about how you expand your base a couple examples a if you have plenty of oxygen and mine out the asteroid to make your space twice as big you still only have the same amount of oxygen but now it has to fill twice the space thus the air becomes thin and your duplicants become unhappy b if you have an area filled with oxygen and an area filled with carbon dioxide with a door between them when you open the door the gas with the higher pressure will surge through the door to try to equalize the pressure in the two rooms the second most obvious is the thermal engine everything in the game heats or cools also almost might be all but can t confirm everything in the game can be in solid liquid and gaseous states also everything you can construct in the game has thermal limits and will suffer damage and stop working if they are not within those limits you have to keep all of these things in mind to succeed some examples are needed to understand how complex and brilliant this system is a an obvious one if you re piping water through a cold area and the temperature drops below 0 the water will freeze and burst your pipes the duplicant waiting for that nice shower with water will become unhappy b a less obvious one if you drop crude oil onto a brick that s 1500 degrees it will quickly change from oil to petroleum at 400 degrees to sour gas at 500 degree if your duplicant in the room is unlucky and is not wearing a survival suit when this happens they also don t like 400 degrees and will become unhappy c one that might surprise you buildings like the hydro engine require very hot steam to turn into electricity but that same heat will destroy the building so you have to figure out how to keep the building cool while keeping the steam hot and trust me this is far from the only construction that will surprise you the third engine is the conversion system basically buildings plants or animals that turn one thing into another in order to succeed you ll need to use them all for example some plants and critters can do things that your duplicants and their buildings can t do including replicating seeds turning carbon dioxide into oxygen or oil turning polluted gas into slime etc the fourth engine is the priority system this is much like rimworld s system you cannot directly tell any duplicant to do a task except to move to a specific place it s all based on the priority you give a type of job and the priority you assign to a specific task such as building a wire or door you will always be tweaking the priorities of both to find a balance to keep your base running exploring and building and of course keeping your duplicants happy the fifth engine is a stress engine each duplicant is unique and get stressed by different things everything in the game will affect the duplicant s stress levels in a good or bad way if you want them to do any work you need to keep it on the good side the sixth engine is a scheduling engine the player can create any number of schedules and assign each little dude to one of them each duplicant has preferences some like to work early some like to work late some like me don t like to work too much again it s a balance of happiness and productivity the seventh engine is a full and complete automation system including any type of logical gate to completely automate when things should be on and off open or closed in any level of complexity you want to use last to survive you must explore and exploit the resources on the asteroid i don t want to ruin the game by telling you about them all but you ll find many things that will make it much much easier to keep your duplicants happy so is this game for you here are some things to help you decide if any of the description above has put you to sleep or you re no longer reading this because you got bored and stopped reading after the second paragraph then this is probably not the game for you this game is challenging and will keep you entertained for as long as you want even after 322 hours i have not been able to complete all of the challenges i have a fairly large base runs pretty smooth while i m watching it but there s much more to still explore the game can be tedious at times and you will likely find yourself yelling at your little dudes and calling them nasty little names there are a couple annoying behaviours that don t make sense like duplicants that complete a wall from the wrong side trapping them or you ll outline an area to dig out and a duplicant will go to the middle start digging on both sides of the tile they are standing on until they are stranded and all they can do is stand there and look sad if none of the above has scared you away then this is the game for you i personally have enjoyed this game very much even when yelling at my little dudes and hope you do as well
