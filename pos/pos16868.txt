2015 plague inc is a rather satisfying simulation in which the player s goal is to infect and kill off the entire world just exactly how the player chooses to tackle this is up to them gameplaythe player can choose to slowly infect the population remaining undetected and non lethal and then strike once much of the world s population is infected by evolving lethality to kill fast and unexpectedly making it difficult for the world to react and cure it in time or just try to kill the world as fast as possible which usually results in losing the game as many of the more isolated countries such as greenland will shut their ports and airports making it very difficult to infect them contentthe player is not presented with just one disease type but many these disease types range from a neurax worm which allows the player to manipulate infected hosts to their advantage to the necroa virus which allows the player to unleash a devastating zombie apocalypse on the world it doesn t stop here though as there is a rather extensive community workshop with countless unique diseases thanks to the scenario creator which is available to every player who owns the game more comingthe developers of this game are also working on a multiplayer mode which will see two players battle it out to see who s plague is superior the game is also regularly updated with new content and bug fixes conclusionwhile plague inc is not perfect it offers great replayability with different ways to beat different scenarios and higher difficulty modes which can really challenge the player the price is rather steep so i would suggest waiting until the game is on sale to get the best value for money 8 10 great game
