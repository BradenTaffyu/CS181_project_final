2015 so it s not often i m wrong but i have to admit how wrong i was after giving the game another 5 or so hours under the tutelage of a veteran player who showed me the ropes its quite honestly a marvel of a game thats not to say there arent some issues as there are like a dated graphics engine in game purchases for expanding tracks and drivable vehicles as well as having a limited pool of cars to drive but all in all an excellent simulation that doesn t pretend to be anything its not you just have to give it some time and love and it will give back 50 hours in had a number of issues purchasing iracing content through steam iracing support very helpful steam support completely lackluster been running the global challenge series in the cadillac looking at working back through the skip barber series and on up to the star mazda series also to get the most from this game you have to use a steering wheel and pedals controllers just dont cut it original review included for posterity pretty average game confusing web interface that keeps asking for steam approval waste of 39
