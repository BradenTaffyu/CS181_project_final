2018 where do i start with this game of all the games i have played over the last few years not many come close to divinity original sin 1 2 back on the 29th of october 2016 i finally gave in and purchased divinity original sin enhanced edition with a friend it was such an exciting journey and i enjoyed it a lot my only regret is not hearing about the kickstarter for the second game because i would ve been all over it but nonetheless i purchased divinty original sin 2 before release i knew it was going to be just as good if not better after playing roughly 18 hours in my first game and getting to the end of act 1 another friend bough the game and we started again but who could complain the game was amazing we enjoyed that playthrough all the way up to arx where one of our party lost interest in the game which brought our journy to an early end with such a huge time investment into a game i couldnt bring myself to start again so the game was shelved for a long while many single player attempts were made some mods were tried but could never get off the ground then finally this year after hearing the definitive edition was coming my friend and i decided we would do it finally play through from start to finish and it was as good as ever i could hardly bring myself to put the game down playing as loshe was one of the best experiences in this game and i m glad i picked her getting to the end of her story and finding a certain item i bagged it and thought nothing of it until i noticed it could be used i was taken aback it just came out of nowhere it really hit me and i realized this was the perfect song to end our game just over 200 hours played this game is one of the best i ve ever played i just wish there was more 10 10 highly recommend can t praise it enough
