2018 let me start by saying that i do recommend this game but not to someone looking for a similar feel to fallout 3 or new vegas let me tell you about the things i noticed in my short visit with fallout 4 1 load times are insanely slow i have it installed on my ssd why are my load times 3 4 minutes 2 paid mods wtf seriously do we not remember what happened with skyrim 3 motion blur enabled by default gross 4 no option to change fov had to get into the guides for that 5 purchase credits to buy cosmetic bethesda you know better don t get me wrong it s a fun game i continue to play it but for a person who has played all the previous fallout titles this one does not meet the bar i don t know how to explain it but it just doesn t feel like fallout i d still recommend it like i said still a fun game but don t be expecting the same or even similar experience that you got out of 3 or new vegas from this one this is a survival action rpg not a fallout game
