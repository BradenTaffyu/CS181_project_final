2017 hey to everyone who s reading my review right now if you would check my games here on steam you would notice that farming games like stardew valley aren t that type of games i normally play in my opinion in the most farming games you are bored after maybe an hour or two but in fact stardew valley isn t boring not at all but let s start at the beginning when i started to play this game for an hour or a lil bit more i got really bored to be honest the problem was that i didn t know how this game works i didn t know how to go fishing farming or better say i didnt know how i had to organize my farm that all would work and this is very annoying so i would add only one thing to that game a tutorial it would be really helpful so that you know what your first steps should be but of course i have to say there are some guides here on steam who can help you a little bit too but i think it s better if the game would explain and show you all and after i learned about the important things in stardew i had really fun to create my own farm the big difference between stardew valley and other farming games is that you can do lots of other things than only to be on your farm for example you can do mining you have in this game your own mine and its really cool in there because there are a lot of floors it feels a little bit like in the old pok kom dungeon games d and every floor is getting harder then of course in that mine are monster you have to fight fishing makes very fun too something that i really like too is that you can interact with lots of npc s you can fall in love with one of them or everybody and get married and have your own family too or maybe you are unfriendly as hell so that noone notice you and you will be forever alone it s your desicion p but yeah really it s so cool that you can get really good friends with them also every day you talk to them they say different things etc its really awesome i could say a lot of other good things about that game like that you have a libary where you can donate artifacts you find in that game and get cool stuff for your farm or that you have different festivals per year etc so what i really want to say is even you don t like farming games like me either you should really try this game you will probably love it after a few hours like me that s all enjoy your day
