2019 so i have about 300 hours on this game i like the slow pace the nice scenery and i ve gotten pretty good at it overall this game is fun but there are some things that you should know before you buy it 1 there s a shed load of dlc you can see that before you buy it don t buy it and then leave a negative review saying there is loads of dlc obviously this is a niche genre they want to make it good but that means they are going to rinse the people who buy it 2 it is a bit glitchy not game breakingly awful but it does do things that are weird stuck animals every single time you look at the map it takes your sight off your gun that s a new and very irritating bug sometimes animal footprints are in the trees its not perfect but you can put up with these bugs 3 the latest weapon pack kind of made the game a bit too easy those guns are just too good at killing shots that you know in the past would have lead to an injured animal kill them 4 this game works the opposite way to other games it starts off very hard and as your character gets better weapons and skills it gets much easier i don t know why they thought that was a good idea by the time your get as far as i am into the game you can kill a moose from 400 yards with a peashooter but mostly its a walk in the park simulator occasionally you stumble upon an animal whip your gun out blow its guts out and then continue with your nice little walk good clean family fun
