early access review compared to ase asa is aweful the graphics are beautiful many qol improvements crossplay console mods etc then there s the premium mods which i d support if it were only for mod creators that create new content and not just reskinned content the new pyromane dlc why it s a reskinned shadowmane that has no business being a 5 single dino dlc atrocious optimisation mandatory server host with god stupid prices and terrible customer service content being rushed i could go on but i won t the developers have it hard already no matter how terrible this game is i d still support it because i love ark i m not qualified by any means but i wish there were better decisions regarding ark and its future as it stands i fear this remaster and ark 2 aren t going to thrive as much as ase still recommend pray for your cpu
