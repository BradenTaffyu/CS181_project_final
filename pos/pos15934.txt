2022 my score 8 5 10prologueone fine day like any other the protagonist of our story a resident of a small town decides to make a new purchase one of those cleaning machines that use pressurized water to clean things but instead of just using it around the house decides to get to work cleaning things for others which luckily happened at the most opportune time possible as coincidentally the volcano near the town mysteriously got active again and other strange events filling the small town of ash and other dirt practically everywhere thus begins the long list of cleaning requests for our protagonist ranging from mundane things like houses cars bicycles to things far more exotic and unusual all of which have an unbelievable amount of dirt in literally every location visible signs that need to be removed bringing the beauty of the unique buildings back to light with each cleanup but at the same time unearthing rather dark secrets of some members of the small town that can have an impact on a large scale pros a game that even though each place we have to clean is practically a job it manages to be very relaxing mainly because it has no limits such as the time and order of cleaning with the exception of the challenge mode i really liked the creativity for the locations and vehicles as they are the classics at first but over time there are more and more different and creative places to clean practically everywhere including a small replay at the end after completing the first time all career mode stages can be re visited as many times as you like either to clear again in other ways or to hunt for achievements beautiful graphics and well done especially when comparing the dirty and clean versions of the locations cons i found the cleaning machine sounds a little too loud making when i wanted to listen to a song or a video while playing i had to turn down the game volume otherwise the sound of water under pressure would drown out the other sounds the online mode is a bit problematic as players in any part of the career mode can play together but they only have access to equipment unlock by the host of the match as well as all progress made in career mode is recorded only for the host some achievements can be a little boring especially the ones that ask us to clean a certain part of the place or vehicle lastly game mechanicsthere is not much secret about the steps for cleaning with a pressurized water machine just aim at the desired location and squeeze the trigger but some points must be taken into account as the game has the option of revealing to us where the dirt is but it is up to us to find out how to get the water to the place because even under pressure the water has limitations such as reach and obstacles making us have to climb stairs to clean places like roofs as well as literally lay on the floor for places like the underside of a table in this way making each location a real puzzle to discover how to get to all locations and also how to maintain the delicate balance between the area and the pressure as it is possible to decide between nozzles with different sizes in this way with the smaller ones having greater pressure and therefore managing to clean even the toughest dirt faster but in a smaller area in the same way the bigger ones clean a larger area but need more time to remove those annoying dirt like oil paint this way there is no right or wrong and giving the player the option to choose which method they prefer art and soundthe graphic part was very satisfied especially with the artistic creativity because as we hardly see any other form of life almost everything we have contact with are buildings and vehicles which can become a bit monotonous but the team managed creating very creative and beautiful buildings and vehicles i don t have anything to say about the soundtrack as the game even has some music but most of the time it s just the ambient sounds and those produced by the washer machine during cleaning conclusionpowerwash simulator had been a very fun experience for me i had already seen some videos before so i already had an idea of what i would find when i bought it in the early access period and i must say that even though i already had an idea of what i would find nothing could having prepared myself for the several hours i used climbing stairs or lying down in various places to fully clean each location and that without even having made one hundred percent of the conquests anyway if you are looking for a calmer and more relaxing game where you can do things and progress at your own pace without worrying about time and where you can pause and continue whenever you want this is a good recommendation
