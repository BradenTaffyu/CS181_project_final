2020 early access review basically mutant crawl classic as a roguelike mutate yourself some sweet regenerating limbs get infected by mushroom spores and fail to understand how the mysterious metal tubes could just in fact be a metal folding chair eventually you may find a sweet shotgun or an energy cell you can use to charge your flaming short sword but you ll probably get murdered by snapjaws a few times before you make it past the first quest its brutal but very rewarding
