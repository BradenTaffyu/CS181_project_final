2023 probably the best online yu gi oh you can find with a lot of ups and only a few downs depending on what kind of player you are these downs might make you quit the game just like i did the positives gems in game currency are easy to farm allowing you to open lots of boosters and get the cards you want the card catalog is massive almost any card you can think of is actually in the game active game devs provide regular patches to fix bugs release new content and sometimes limit cards that are too strong quick and balanced matchmaking a solo mode for casual players that showcases new decks to you for inspirationthe negatives the meta is extremely dominant at all times you will play against the same decks and archetypes very often which can get boring after a while many of the older cards pre synchro are locked behind legacy packs these can be farmed but unlike the other booster packs with 8 cards they only hold 2 cards on top of that the card pool you are pulling from is huge compared to the specific one of non legacy booster packs hunting for older cards is statistically impossible and you will have to opt for generating the ones you need with energy from dismantling other cards instead the casual mode is really just for the heck of it you get nothing out of playing it leaving you with little to no reason to pick it over ranked the players in casual mode sometimes play less try hard and rarely even original decks but you will often times find the same meta slaves as in ranked lastly and this might be very subjective but it is the strongest reason for me yu gi oh has changed drastically from what it used to be many years ago so much to the point that old decks can t compete and exist in the game with new ones it has become mandatory to have at least one big beatstick on the field that has a negate effect to stop your opponent in their tracks negates in general have an absolute stranglehold on yu gi oh ash blossom which is a card you can activate from your hand to negate a variety of effects is in 85 of all decks called by the grave is a quick play spell that negates a graveyard effect is in 52 of all decks infinite impermanence is a trap you can activate from your hand to negate a monster effect and it s in 55 of all decks yu gi oh is in a sad state where it s not about out performing the opponents play anymore it s about locking them out of play and stopping them dead in their tracks it s a very one sided and unfun experience if you are new to yu gi oh i can suggest this game to you but if you are an old returning player i highly caution you it might not be the way you remembered it
