product received for free early access review i absolutely love this game there s a great balance of elements of logistics and optimization along with the puzzle aspects for the more complex crystal shapes and harder difficulties the progression in difficulty across the scenarios is very well balanced normal difficulty was a great starting point hard ramped it up while being very achievable still and the insane difficulty scenario frequently required me to pull out paper to make sure i understood how all the shapes progressed which i loved i also really like the new hex mode it s great to have a new type of shape that often requires a different type of approach and a bunch of new blueprints i was a patreon supporter and was able to play the alphas of shapez 2 i played around 300 hours of the game before i later got a steam key hopefully my factory screenshots on the steam page entice you to buy the game hint hint the game is extremely polished for early access it s a full game with a ton of content and i really really recommend getting shapez 2
