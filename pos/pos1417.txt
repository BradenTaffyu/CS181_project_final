2020 early access review this game in short is such an absolute powerhouse and deserves all it receives in prestige pros open world a big world with plenty of unique areas and points of interest the different cities all have their own feel and not often does the buildings and environment get repetitive content and progression lots of things to do and major progressive elements not like other zom survivals where you build a base and set for life or keep hoarding items until you get bored zombies are always a problem and threat even late game fun and unique skill tress this game has perks and skills that affect your character these can be set by your profession and may require you to take a negative perk or 2 to balance out your perk sets and progress which i think is really cool and adds more character to your player realism this game boasts for its realism and i cannot argue otherwise it truly captivates a near realistic adaptation of what it might be like in a zed apoc modding plenty of mods out there that increase the depth of what this game can be cons updates this game is an absolute beast however major updates are very scarce and some of the promises have taken years to get put into beta add notes while i cannot say this is a con nor pro the layout of the game is almost like a classic rts game but with free movement and character perspective so you won t see a zombie until you have it in your character s fov which is realistic and i applaud however you may take some time to get used to this as it is all overwhelming with the screens and overlays as well there have been plenty of times where i pushed the wrong direction and got bitten so it will take time to adjust have got a plethora of stories to tell about this game and would happily boot this game up with friends however the new beta has no multiplayer yet some final tips for beginners beware of bathrooms make use of zooming in and out zoom in when inside and out when outside avoid combat and only fight when you must guns for emergencies use buildings and trees to make a good escape zombies have different speeds use this to split them out of a group be prepared for random meta events that will wake the dead out of their trance
